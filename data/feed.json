        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Catch up on the French Open with a guide that tells you everything you need to know about what happened at the clay-court Grand Slam tennis tournament, how to watch it, what the betting odds are, what the schedule is and more: Who is Playing on Monday? The match getting by far the most attention — Rafael Nadal vs. Alexander Zverev — will be third in Court Philippe Chatrier. That means it should start at around 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT; 9:30 a.m. EDT). That will be preceded by No. 8 Ons Jabeur against Sachia Vickery, which starts play in the main stadium at noon (1000 GMT; 6 a.m. EDT), and the second match there, with Iga Swiatek against Leolia Jeanjean. Another match that could generate interest will be Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who is coming off a hip injury, against Chris Eubanks, a big-serving American who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year. That starts the day in Court Suzanne Lenglen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT; 5 a.m. EDT). What Happened on Sunday? Two-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz pronounced his recently injured forearm “fully recovered,” even if it still is “feeling weird,” after overwhelming J.J. Wolf 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. “It's still in my mind, but I didn’t feel anything after the match ... which is really, really good for me.” Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka won a match at a major for the first time in more than two years by defeating Lucia Bronzetti 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to advance to what could be a second-round showdown against Swiatek. Other players moving into the second round included Caroline Garcia of France, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, No. 30 Dayana Yastremska and Donna Vekic in the women's draw, and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men's. No. 17 seed Ugo Humbert was eliminated by Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. There was a brief rain shower in the afternoon, which delayed action on several courts but allowed for the first use of the new retractable roof at Court Suzanne Lenglen. How to Watch the French Open on TV — In the U.S.: Tennis Channel, NBC, Peacock. — Other countries are listed here . Betting Guide Nadal is usually favored to win the championship at the French Open — he has 14, after all — but BetMGM Sportsbook has him as the underdog in the first round against No. 4 seed Zverev on Monday. Zverev is a -350 money-line favorite against Nadal, who is listed at +260 for that match. Nadal is just 7-4 this year and missed nearly all of last year while dealing with injuries; that is why he is unseeded and so could have been drawn to face anyone to begin the tournament. Zverev was a semifinalist in Paris each of the past three years and is coming off a clay-court title at the Italian Open this month. Swiatek is a big favorite to win the title (-155), so it makes sense that she is listed at -10000 against Jeanjean, who has +1600 money-line odds for their match.

        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.

North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau , who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits , to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. Biden said that last year the Department of Veterans Affairs delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever before. He credited the PACT Act, which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned,\" Biden said. \"Not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "An Egyptian soldier was killed during a clash with Israeli troops at a Gaza border crossing on Monday while an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 40 Palestinians at a camp for displaced people, further inflaming regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Egypt’s military confirmed that a border guard died at the Rafah border crossing on Monday, in bloodshed that threatened to escalate tensions with Israel. Separately, the airstrike at the camp northwest of the Gazan city of Rafah drew international condemnation. Israel acknowledged the death of dozens of people in the strike, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “a tragic mistake” in an address to the Knesset. Israeli leaders said they were still investigating both incidents. In the border clash, the Israel Defense Forces said “a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border,” and that discussions with Egypt were ongoing, without giving any more detail. Israel said the airstrike late Sunday at a Rafah tent community was based on “precise intelligence” and that it killed two “senior” officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union. But governments across the world were quick to condemn Israel for the strike. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged,” while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified.” The White House said in a statement that images of innocent civilians killed in the strike were “heartbreaking.” “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” the National Security Council said in a statement. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Israeli troops started operations around the outskirts of Rafah, which lies in southern Gaza, early this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will attack the city because it’s the last bastion of Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group, and several thousand of its fighters are lodged there. The U.S. and other countries fear mass casualties among the Palestinian civilians in Rafah and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail an assault to prevent harm to innocents. The White House said Monday it was “actively engaging” with the IDF and partners in the region to better assess what had occured. The U.S. and others have also voiced concerns about an Israeli attack on Rafah worsening ties with Egypt. The two Middle Eastern countries signed a peace deal in 1979, which is seen as crucial to Israel’s security. Egypt has been highly vocal of the war in Gaza and consistently called on Israel to agree to a cease-fire. The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. Israel’s counterattack has killed some 35,000 Gazans, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. (With assistance from Justin Sink.) ©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

Associated Press reporters Acacia Coronado in Austin, Texas, and Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Bhadrak : A day ahead of Amit Shah’s visit to Chandbali Constituency, BJP’s Ganjam district president Dr Subash Chandra Sahu and five of his supports were allegedly attacked by a group of BJD activists on Monday. As per reports, Subash Chandra Sahu, BJP’s in-charge for the Chandbali assembly segment, suffered a fracture on his left hand and one of his supporters, Devdatta Maharaj, also sustained injuries in the unprecedented attack. Both were admitted to the hospital. As Union Minister Amit Shah is scheduled to address an election rally in Chandbali constituency to canvas for Odisha state unit president Manmohan Samal on Tuesday, Sahu and his supporters were travelling in an SUV to take stock of the party’s preparations in Chandbali assembly. However, some BJD activists allegedly waylaid the vehicle, bearing the BJP’s flag, near Ghanteswar Totapada Chhak on the Bhadrak-Chandbali road and attacked the saffron party workers. They also vandalised the car. Tension prevailed at the scene for some time. Then, the police arrived and prevented the situation from escalating further. Reportedly, the injured BJP leader has lodged a written complaint at Ghanteswar police outpost.",

        "content": "The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) minister, Barrister Nyesom Wike, took a final lap of inspection of the facilities of the Abuja light rail project on Monday evening, preparatory to President Tinubu’s flag-off of commercial activities to mark his one year in office. It would be recalled that Wike, in an earlier inspection of the rail project, observed some minor things he said needed to be corrected. Speaking after the inspection, Wike said, “We are good to go; for the president, it’s a promise made and a promise kept. First of all, we are very happy that all our efforts have come to fruition. It’s no longer a story, but a reality.” However, he protested that he shouldn’t rate himself when asked about Tinubu’s performance in one year. He said one year is too short for any meaningful contribution, but he narrated the achievements so far. “So you are asking me to rate myself, however, if you say so. You can see that Mr President has done very well, not only in physical infrastructure but also in human capital development. “Nothing in this world is better than a career prospect. I am sure the civil servants in the FCT are very happy that their hopes have been rekindled. Their hopes have been restored. “Mr President has done very well. He is reassuring Nigerians that he is committed to delivering the dividends of democracy. “There are so many areas of attention; one year is really not enough for you to expect 100 per cent, but what you’ve seen on the ground shows there is hope for Nigerians.” With the dressed rehearsal on Monday, all is set and prepared for Mr President to take a ride on the Abuja light rail billed for Wednesday.

        "content": "The crazed firebug who allegedly torched a straphanger on a subway train over the weekend gave a vacant grimace in Manhattan court Monday as a judge set his bail at $250,000 — and prosecutors revealed he’s an ex-con with a lengthy rap sheet. Nile Taylor, 49 — who’s accused of tossing a flaming can of alcohol at Petrit Alijaj, 23, Saturday — has previously done prison time for gun and forgery busts, prosecutors said in Manhattan Criminal Court. Evidence in the case of his latest fiery attack is overwhelming, assistant District Attorney Aryan Ahmadian said. “This is a strong case,” Ahmadian told Judge Cori Weston. “The defendant was arrested shortly after the incident on Saturday afternoon, and he was in possession of multiple lighters, a bottle containing rubbing alcohol.” During the wild assault , Taylor allegedly set the floor of a No. 1 train ablaze when he tossed the flaming liquid at Alijaj — leaving him with severe burns on his face and chest, authorities said. Wearing a gray sweatshirt and sneakers, Taylor didn’t say a word as Weston set his bail. He stared straight ahead blankly and, at times, down at the floor during the brief hearing. “Considering the defendant’s activities and history of charges here, his criminal-conviction history... I’m going to set what the people asked, which is $250,000 cash,” Weston said. Taylor was previously convicted of criminal possession of a loaded firearm and forgery and was sentenced to two more than years in state prison, Ahmadian said. In a separate case, Taylor was allegedly captured on surveillance camera footage hurling two cans of flammable liquid at a group of people at the West 28th Street subway on Feb. 5. Taylor allegedly “identified himself” in the video footage and the police investigation is ongoing, Ahmadian said. Sign up for our Metro Daily newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Alijaj and his fiancee were riding a No. 1 train at the West Houston and Varick streets station at 2:45 p.m. Saturday when Taylor allegedly chucked the flaming liquid at him, setting his shirt on fire and burning up to 30% of his body. The victim later told The Post that he used his body to block his fiance from the flames. In total, Taylor was hit with two assault charges and a menacing charge in the subway fire attack case. “Without warning...[He] attacked two strangers inside of that subway train by throwing the burning liquid onto them,” Ahmadian said in court Monday. “Burning liquid lands on the floor of the subway station, causing the floor of the subway station to catch on fire.” He was also arraigned on a petit larceny charge for allegedly stealing an iPhone inside of the subway station. Taylor’s lawyer, Gretchen Resser, was silent in court aside from asking the judge about the date of the next hearing. She didn’t return The Post’s request for comment Monday. Taylor is due back in court on May 31.",

        "content": "The Texas Republican Party gathered in San Antonio for its annual convention this weekend, but GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents part of San Antonio and lives there, was ambivalent about attending. That's not entirely surprising — one of the featured speakers was Rep. Matt Gaetz, who endorsed Gonzales' opponent, Brandon Herrera, in Tuesday's GOP primary runoff in the 23rd District. The Texas Republican Party censured Gonzales last year over his vote for gun control legislation backed by the Biden White House, introduced in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers. Uvalde is also in the 23rd District. Gonzales had four Republican opponents in the March primary, which stretches 800 miles from San Antonio along the U.S.-Mexico border to El Paso. Gonzales failed to secure 50% of the vote, forcing him into a runoff with Herrera, the next highest vote getter. The runoff winner will face Democrat Santos Limon in November. Herrera only won 24% of the vote in the March primary, but the runoff has been a headache for Gonzales. With a runoff date so long after the primary and no big-ticket races on the ballot, turnout is likely to be low. \"If this was a high-turnout election, [Gonzales] would be a lock,\" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor. In a low-turnout election, \"anything can happen,\" he said, because the most fervent voters are the ones who go to the poll. Jones said a candidate needs to \"mobilize a handful of the most diehard supporters\" to win. That could be challenging for Gonzales, who's positioned himself as the pragmatic choice, compared to Herrera, a 28-year-old YouTube celebrity known as \"The AK Guy\" who has continually hit Gonzales over his gun legislation vote. Brandon Herrera, Tony Gonzales \"What we're seeing in Congressional District 23 is the story we see all over Texas politics,\" said Joshua... Caroline Linton",

        "content": "The bodies of a young missionary couple from the U.S. who were attacked and fatally shot by gang members in Haiti are expected to be transported to Missouri this week, a spokesperson for the families said Sunday. Thursday's killings of Davy and Natalie Lloyd, and Jude Montis, the local director of a mission group, Missions in Haiti Inc., happened in the community of Lizon in northern Port-au-Prince. They were leaving a youth group activity at a church, a family member told The Associated Press. Natalie Lloyd is the daughter of Missouri state Rep. Ben Baker. Speaking on behalf of the Lloyd and Baker families in a Facebook post on Baker's page, Cassidy Anderson said Sunday that transport had been secured for a Thursday arrival of the bodies in Missouri. But Anderson added that \"security is going to be very difficult.\" Haiti's capital has been crumbling under the relentless assault of violent gangs that control 80% of Port-au-Prince, while authorities await the arrival of a police force from Kenya as part of a U.N.-backed deployment aimed at quelling gang violence in the troubled Caribbean country. Here are some things to know about the missionary work, which focused on helping the children of Haiti, and the deadly gang attack. WORKING IN HAITI Missions in Haiti's website says its goal is \"to see the Gospel of Christ make a difference in the lives of Haiti's young people.\" Davy Lloyd's parents, David and Alicia Lloyd, of Oklahoma, started the organization in 2000 seeking to focus on the children of Haiti. David and Alicia Lloyd are full-time missionaries in the country. \"Although the entire nation is steeped in poverty, the children suffer the worst,\" they wrote on the website. \"Thousands are malnourished, uneducated, and headed for hopeless lives apart from Christ.\" Hannah Cornett, Davy's sister, told AP that they grew up in Haiti.

        "content": "Donald Trump's campaign has issued another extraordinary fundraising request to supporters by doubling down on a false claim that rival Joe Biden was prepared to hurt or kill him by authorizing the use of deadly force during an FBI search for classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago compound in August 2022. The claim has become a currency among some Trump supporters and is widely described by them as an \"attempted assassination\" – but rests on a misquoted section of FBI policy in a legal motion. Moreover, Trump was not even in Florida during the search. The revival of the claim came late Sunday came in the form of an email to supporters headlined:\"This is an Alert from Donald Trump.\" \"DEADLY FORCE? Biden authorized it. They brought guns to the raid on Mar-a-Lago!\" it read. \"I'm sick and tired of the Radical Left destroying this country and trying to destroy me,\" it continued, before detailing raids, indictments and arrests Trump claims he has been subjected to for political purposes. \"Here's the bottom line: I WILL NEVER SURRENDER. AND NEITHER WILL YOU!' It concluded with a request for donations of up to $500 and a demand to \"drop all charges\" against him.

Hopes of an exciting climax to the final day between Lancashire and Warwickshire at Emirates Old Trafford were dashed by rain, with only 75 minutes’ play possible.

Despite two of the first three days being washed out, Nottinghamshire were strongly placed at 234 for three and leading by 154 runs, but heavy overnight rain and a steady stream of morning showers dashed any chance of play, with the visitors taking 11 points and Worcestershire nine. In Division Two, promotion front-runners Middlesex and Sussex saw their match at Lord’s peter out into a draw. A stalemate looked inevitable once the home side had avoided the follow-on early on the final day and they went on to post 613 for nine declared in reply to Sussex’s total of 554 for nine.

Ricardo Vasconcelos hit an unbeaten 129 not out as he spearheaded Northamptonshire’s bid for an unlikely victory over Yorkshire, but the visitors’ bowling attack dug deep to ensure the Wantage Road clash ended in a draw. Northamptonshire had been set a challenging target of 326 in a little over two sessions and when Vasconcelos warmed up for the T20 Blast with 17 boundaries all around the ground, a home triumph looked a possibility. But a dramatic clatter of wickets as the Yorkshire attack – featuring Adam Lyth’s career-best figures of four for 56 – staged a late fightback to set nerves jangling in the home dressing room, meant Vasconcelos had to switch gears to ensure his side held out for the draw, eight wickets down.

        "content": "[Source: Reuters] An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said. Prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel’s assault. Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel’s military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties. “In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,” he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel’s military said Sunday’s strike, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza’s southern tip. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The U.S. urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said. NO SAFE ZONE More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Egypt also condemned Israel’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt’s military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters in Beirut on Monday that there were no plans for ceasefire talks and the group’s demands to achieve an accord, which include a permanent ceasefire, remain unchanged.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AFP): The United States said Monday Israel must make every possible effort to avoid civilian casualties, following a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Rafah, which Gaza’s health ministry said killed 45 people. Israel is facing a wave of international condemnation over the strike, both across the region and from the European Union, France and the United Nations. “As we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians,” a US National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened,” the spokesperson added. Gaza’s civil defense agency said the strike ignited a fire that tore through a displacement center in northwestern Rafah near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” the NSC spokesperson said. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on “precise intelligence information” about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It launched the attack on Rafah hours after Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets towards the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. The NSC spokesperson said that “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” before imploring more caution. The Gaza war broke out after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.",

        "content": "GENEVA (AFP): Planned talks between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog aimed at breaking the impasse over Tehran’s nuclear programme have been put on hold after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, an agency report said Monday. The temporary suspension of talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) comes as its chief Rafael Grossi reiterated his concern over public statements made in Iran regarding its nuclear weapons capability. In the report, Grossi said that “further public statements made in Iran... regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran’s nuclear doctrine only increase... concerns about the correctness and completeness of Iran’s safeguards declarations.” Iran has always denied any ambition to develop nuclear weapon capability, insisting its activities are entirely for peaceful purposes. Earlier this month, Grossi visited Iran in a bid to improve cooperation with Tehran, urging leaders to adopt “concrete” measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme. After returning from his trip, Grossi decried “completely unsatisfactory” cooperation with Tehran, saying he would like to see “results soon”. – Breaching deal limits – But in the meantime, the deaths of Iran’s president Raisi, his foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and six others in a helicopter crash on 19 May have further complicated the situation. One day after the helicopter crash, “Iran indicated that due to the ‘special circumstances’, it was no longer appropriate to hold substantive discussions” and a new date would be set, a confidential report seen by AFP on Monday said. With presidential elections scheduled for the end of June, Grossi “reiterated... his call for, and disposition to continue” the negotiations. At the same time, Iran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme and now has enough material to build several atomic bombs. In a separate confidential report seen by AFP ahead of an IAEA board of governors’ meeting next week, the agency said Iran’s estimated stockpile of enriched uranium had reached more than 30 times the limit set out in the 2015 accord between Tehran and world powers. According to the report, Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was estimated at 6,201.3 kilogrammes as of May 11, up by 675.8 kilogrammes from the last quarterly report in February. Tensions between Iran and the IAEA have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanction relief fell apart. EU-mediated efforts to revive the deal — bringing the US back on board and Iran back into compliance — have so far been fruitless. Nuclear weapons require uranium enriched to 90 percent, while 3.67 percent set out in the deal is enough for nuclear power stations. Iran has continued to breach further limits set out in the 2015 nuclear deal. According to the report, Iran has 751.3 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to up to 20 percent and 142.1 kilogrammes enriched to up to 60 percent. At the same time, Iran has gradually decreased its cooperation with the IAEA by deactivating surveillance devices needed to monitor the nuclear programme and barring inspectors among other measures. London, Paris and Berlin have been trying to push for a resolution condemning Iran at the IAEA Board of Governors. But the United States has been reluctant to join their efforts for fear of exacerbating the current geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, especially in the run-up to the presidential election in November. “Action by the IAEA board is long overdue,” Kelsey Davenport, an expert with the Arms Control Association, told AFP. “Waiting another six months until after the US election will only further exacerbate the challenges,” she said, by “sending the message that Tehran can flout its international obligations with impunity”. According to Davenport, the United States should put an offer on the table to “reduce the risk of conflict in the region and the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran”.",

        "content": "Cairo/Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that officials say killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip.

Israel’s military said Sunday’s strike, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza’s southern tip. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The US urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. Palestinians react next to the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip. Credit: AP The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Egypt also condemned Israel’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt’s military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area, but it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters in Beirut on Monday that there were no plans for ceasefire talks and the group’s demands to achieve an accord, which include a permanent ceasefire, remain unchanged.

        "content": "The Skokie Fire Department’s honor guard marched up an aisle between rows of spectators, their ceremonial axes glistening silver, to start Skokie’s Memorial Day ceremony Monday. Skokie Fire Chief Jeff Hoeflich welcomed speakers including Dan Ryan, a U.S. Navy veteran who had worked as the village’s finance director from 1980 to 1990 and later served on the police pension board. When Ryan’s father, who had served in World War II, was alive the two traveled to the National World War II museum in New Orleans, which in 2014 had a special exhibit on Higgins boats, Ryan said, describing the vessels as those in which the front half opens up to let troops storm out. The Skokie Fire Department honor guard stood during the singing of “God Bless America” at the village’s Memorial Day ceremony Monday. (Pam DeFiglio, Chicago Tribune/Pioneer Press) “They had a book where veterans could write their remembrances of Higgins boats,” Ryan said, adding he was surprised to see his father writing in it, since he had never previously mentioned anything about the subject. He later peeked at what his father’s entry. It described how one day in April 1945 in Okinawa, his father’s ship released its Higgins boats, watched the troops inside them successfully make it onshore and said the boatswains brought the Higgins boats back to the ship. The Skokie police honor guard performed a Memorial Day ceremony rifle salute Monday. (Pam DeFiglio, Chicago Tribune/Pioneer Press) “As we pulled away, we passed and gave honors to the ship that was taking our place (to deposit more Higgins boats and sailors). At that moment, the other vessel was hit catastrophically by a kamikaze pilot. We spent the next hours assisting the ship, caring for the wounded and recovering and respecting the dead,” Ryan’s father wrote, according to Ryan’s recollection. The moment of solemnity continued as a Niles North High School student sang the national anthem and the Skokie Police honor guard marched to a grassy area behind the speakers and performed a rifle salute. Rabbi Moshe Wolf gave a benediction, thanking honored heroes and their families and praying that first responders arrive home safely after their tours of duty.

        "content": "PYONGYANG (AFP): North Korea’s latest attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit ended in a mid-air explosion, Pyongyang said late Monday, hours after its announcement of a planned launch was criticised by Seoul and Tokyo. Putting a spy satellite into orbit has long been a top priority for Kim Jong Un’s regime, and it claimed to have succeeded in November, after two failed attempts last year. Seoul claims Kim received Russian technical assistance for that launch, in return for sending containers of weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine. But its attempt Monday to launch the “Malligyong-1-1” reconnaissance satellite ended in failure after it “exploded in the air during the first flight stage and failed to launch,” the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a statement. An “expert review concluded that the cause of the accident was the operational reliability of the newly developed liquid oxygen and oil engine,” the statement, carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, added. Japanese broadcaster NHK ran footage of what appeared to be a flaming projectile in the night sky, which then exploded into a fireball, saying it had filmed it from northeast China at the same time as the attempted launch. Pyongyang had notified Japan earlier Monday that it was planning to put another satellite into orbit, prompting criticism from both Seoul and Tokyo, which urged Kim to call it off. South Korea’s military said it had detected the launch but that the satellite “is presumed to have exploded in the air”. “The South Korean and US intelligence authorities are analysing it in detail in close cooperation,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Nuclear-armed North Korea is barred by multiple UN resolutions from tests using ballistic technology, and analysts say there is significant technological overlap between space launch capabilities and the development of ballistic missiles. The launch “is a provocative act that clearly violates the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the use of ballistic missile technology,” South Korea’s military said. Japan briefly issued an alert warning residents of southern Okinawa prefecture to take cover in shelters, but it was lifted minutes later. Hours after trilateral The attempted launch came just hours after Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo wrapped up their first trilateral summit since 2019. South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol said Monday that another satellite launch — North Korea’s fourth attempt — would “undermine regional and global peace and stability”. The South Korean military conducted attack formation flight and strike training on Monday to demonstrate “the strong capabilities and will of our military” after North Korea notified Japan of its plans to launch a satellite by June 4. Experts say that spy satellites could improve North Korea’s intelligence-gathering capabilities, particularly over South Korea, and provide crucial data in any military conflict. Kim met President Vladimir Putin in Russia last September, and Putin suggested afterwards that his nation could help Pyongyang build satellites. Seoul and Washington have both subsequently accused Pyongyang of shipping weapons to Moscow, with South Korea saying earlier this year that Pyongyang had sent thousands of containers of weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. A group of Russian engineers entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. North Korea claims the “Malligyong-1” satellite it put into orbit in November is successfully functioning, but Seoul’s intelligence agency has cast down on this claim. The North’s two failed attempts last year included one in May which failed due to the “abnormal” startup of its second-stage engine, Pyongyang state media said at the time, and one in August which was attributed to an error in the “emergency blasting system”. Seoul’s National Intelligence Service collected and analysed debris from one of Pyongyang’s failed launches earlier last year, finding it had no military utility.",

        "content": "BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) — An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were “civilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.” Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks “conducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel “will not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.” “The only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,” he said. Western countries, in particular the U.S. and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a cease-fire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. Associated Press staff writer Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report.",

        "content": "GAZA (AFP): Men cleared away the charred debris of shelters and children salvaged food in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah on Monday after an Israeli strike torched a camp for displaced Palestinians. “People were not just injured or killed, but charred,” 24-year-old Mohammed Hamad told AFP in the aftermath of the strike that killed at least 45 people. The death toll came from the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which also said that 249 people were wounded in the strike. “My cousin’s daughter, a child no more than 13, was among the martyrs. She had no features at all because shrapnel tore off her face,” Hamad said. Israel’s military said its aircraft “struck a Hamas compound in Rafah” on Sunday night, killing two senior officials for the Palestinian militant group in the occupied West Bank. The strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate’s Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes. Footage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. As Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated. “When these rockets fall on a tower block there are dozens of martyrs, so what about when they are tents?” lamented a man called Hamad. “When we heard the sound (of the explosion), the sky suddenly lit up,” displaced Palestinian Muhannad, an eyewitness, told AFP. “We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs as a result of the use of (...) missiles that caused a massive fire,” the director of Gaza’s civil defence agency, Mohammad al-Mughayyir, said. ‘Ground shook violently’ Mughayyir, who oversaw the response to the fire, said on Monday “rescue and retrieval operations concluded last night, while efforts to extinguish the fire continued for 45 minutes”. He said battling the inferno was made even more difficult because of fuel and water shortages. “We also saw cases of amputations, injured children, women, and elderly among the dead,” he added. Displaced Palestinians who had sought shelter in the area after being told by the Israelis to evacuate their homes were shocked when the camp was targeted. “They dropped leaflets asking us to go to the humanitarian zone in Tal al-Sultan, so we complied and came here,” Abu Muhammad, who was displaced from north Gaza five months ago, told AFP. “But yesterday when I was having dinner at sunset, suddenly it felt like there was an earthquake — the ground shook violently,” he said. Mohammed Abu Qamar, 27, said he was equally baffled by the strikes, after he too moved from north Gaza to the camp that had been labelled a “safe zone” by the Israeli authorities. “Yesterday evening, to our surprise, the camp was bombarded with rockets in this supposedly safe place,” he told AFP on Monday. “A fire broke out, and children, women, and old people were burned.” At the Tel Al-Sultan Clinic, body bags of white sheeting lay on the floor of a room before the dead were taken away for burial in pickup trucks. “She was seven months pregnant ... her room was bombed,” Ahmad Miqdad told AFP in tears at the clinic. His only sister, Yasmine, was killed in the strike and her body could not be recovered because it was blown to pieces in the explosion, he said. “She was preparing to welcome her new baby. What did this innocent child do to deserve this?”. Israel’s government said on Monday it was looking into the “grave and awful” impact on Palestinian civilians of the previous night’s strike. The military said it had launched an investigation. The Gaza war began after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.",

Here’s How to Get In.Legendary Investor Predicts: “Forget A.I. THIS Technology Is the Future”",
        "content": "Identifying the next set of growth stocks to buy can be a game-changer for Wall Street portfolios. Investors who buy a growth stock expect the company to grow its revenues and earnings significantly faster than an average industry peer or the overall market. For instance, the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEARCA: VUG ) fund has returned over 38% since January. By comparison, the S&P 500 index has advanced shy of 29%. We should note that investing in growth stocks isn’t without risks. These companies usually have valuations that can seem stretched by traditional metrics. They’re also more vulnerable to market volatility and economic downturns than their more established counterparts. Some of them are young companies with unproven products or services. However, growth shares can be a potent tool for investors willing to take on a bit more risk in pursuit of outsized returns. With that information, here are three growth stocks to watch in June. Nutanix (NTNX) First up on our list of growth stocks to buy is Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX ). The company sells data center software that merges virtualization, storage and networking into a single integrated solution. Nutanix’s innovative software solutions are well-positioned to capture significant market share as they help businesses simplify their data center operations. Second quarter fiscal 2024 metrics for Nutanix surpassed analyst estimates with strong revenue and billing growth and margin expansion. Revenues grew 16% year-over-year (YOY) to $565 million. The company posted an adjusted earnings per share ( EPS ) of $0.46, up from $0.12 in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, free cash flow skyrocketed 158% to $163 million. Investors have been following the news that Nutanix has signed AI-related deals with Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Hugging Face and others. Understandably, these deals could cause strong tailwinds in Nutanix’s pipeline. Annual contract value billings jumped 23% YOY to $330 million, driven by strong renewal performance that illustrates the stickiness of Nutanix’s offerings. Year-to-date, NTNX stock has gained 52%. As a result, Nutanix shares command a premium valuation at 67.6 times adjusted forward earnings and 8.6 times trailing sales. Therefore, interested readers may wait for a pullback below the $70 level. Sensata Technologies (ST) Industrial technology company Sensata Technologies (NYSE: ST ) is the next name among our growth stocks for today. Sensata specializes in sensors and sensor-rich solutions. These critical components are vital in the automotive, aerospace, energy, agriculture and construction industries. In the first quarter of 2024 , Sensata Technologies reported revenue of over $1.006 billion, marking a 1% increase YOY. Adjusted EPS was $0.89, down $0.03 from the first quarter of 2023 but $0.01 above guidance. Meanwhile, management highlighted the company’s strategic focus on electrification, which has shown impressive growth and positions the company well for future opportunities in the electric vehicle (EV) market. However, the mixed performance across different business segments and challenges posed by industrial destocking are important considerations for investors. Year-to-date (YTD), ST stock is up 11% with a dividend yield of 1.2%. Meanwhile, the shares potentially offer fundamental value at 11.3 times future earnings and 1.5 times sales . Despite the recent gains in ST stock, the 12-month median price forecast is $47. Such an advance in Sensata shares would suggest an upside potential of 12% from current price levels. ServiceNow (NOW) We conclude our discussion of growth stocks with cloud-based solutions provider ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW ). The company’s innovative workflow platform employs AI to streamline enterprise workflows and enhance enterprise productivity. ServiceNow exceeded guidance across all topline growth and profitability metrics in its first quarter earnings. The company reported revenue of $2.6 billion, marking a 24% YOY increase. Adjusted EPS surged 44% YOY to $3.41. Generative AI has helped ServiceNow enhance its existing product offerings and increase its addressable use cases. The company boasts an almost perfect renewal rate and an impressive track record of upselling and cross-selling its customers. In the first quarter, subscription revenue grew 25% YOY to $2.5 billion, with generative AI solutions playing a key role in securing deals with other companies. The global market for workflow automation is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.6% from 2022 to 2030. Management sees yearly subscription revenue growth of at least 20% through 2026, exceeding $15 billion by 2026. Additionally, analysts are forecasting incremental margin improvements in the coming quarters as operational leverage continues to reduce costs. Year-to-date, NOW stock has advanced 11%. Shares are valued at a premium with a forward P/E ratio of 55.6 and a trailing sales ratio of 16.4. Finally, Wall Street’s 12-month price target implies an upside potential of 10% .

        "content": "and Slovakia coach Francesco Calzona has opted to include five Serie A players in his 32-man provisional ahead of this summer. Calzona is in an interesting position as he is still technically head coach of Napoli, but he did not stop working in his role as Slovakia head coach in February. He is out of contract at the Stadio Maradona at the end of June, and it is reported that Antonio Conte is set to be his successor. Calzona is still expected to lead Slovakia into the Euros this summer. Five Serie A players have made his national team squad, including one he will know particularly well from his time with Napoli. That is because Stanislav Lobotka is included among the midfielders. He is effectively a guaranteed starter for Slovakia, so it is expected that he will still be included when the 32-man squad gets cut down to 26. There are also inclusions for and defenders Norbert Gyomber and Adam Obert. have two inclusions in the squad, namely midfielder Ondrej Duda and forward Tomas Suslov.",

Low’s body was found on a track in Pitilie, near Aberfeldy, Perth and Kinross, on February 17. It was not realised until a post-mortem examination six days later, however, that he had been shot. The BBC reported that Low's death certificate states that he had suffered a shotgun wound to the neck and chest. Low had retired from his job as a groundsman at the Edradynate Estate in 2023. Campbell, of Perth and Kinross, was charged with murder and with attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He made no plea in court and was committed for further examination. He remains in custody. He is due to appear in court again within the next eight days.",

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. Meanwhile, an animal park in northern Mexico confirmed it has received reports that at least a hundred parrots, bats and other animals have died, apparently of dehydration. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a heat stroke, noting a “synergy” of factors — including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat — appeared to be to blame, while saying a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. But with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. In the northern state of San Luis Potosi, Ena Buenfil, the director of the Selva Teenek eco-park, told The Associated Press on Monday that her facility has been overwhelmed as parrots, bats, toucans have died due to the heat. Buenfil said when the heat wave began in mid-May their clinic to help animals quickly filled up with sick birds and they received a wave of reports by locals finding dead or suffering birds. Because of scarce resources by authorities, Buenfil said the number is likely only a small percentage of the animals affected, but added that their organization has worked with Civil Protection to aid some birds. Buenfil said birds mainly die of dehydration in the heat, and are often disproportionately affected because they don't have anywhere to store water. Meanwhile, bats would become dehydrated sleeping in the beating afternoon heat. She recommended that locals put out bowls of water for animals. “We’ve never seen a situation like what’s happening right now,” she said, adding if they see more heat peaks like this one “there is not going to be much we can do for the animals.” “There are going to be a lot of casualties to the ecosystem if we continue this trend of heat waves in the region,” said Buenfil. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "description": "A feasibility study found a network is 'technically and economically viable', council officials have reported.",
        "content": "Plans for a heat network using the Glasgow Recycling and Renewable Energy Centre on Polmadie Road could make “substantial inroads” into reducing carbon emissions in the area. A feasibility study found a network is “technically and economically viable”, council officials have reported. They added the proposal is “commercially attractive enough to engage the private sector’s interest”. It could cost around £24m to build out the network. The report added carbon emissions analysis suggests a 81% reduction is achievable through development of the network, relative to “the continued operation of existing heating systems”. “These savings are estimated with gas boiler back-up over a 40-year assessment period.” A council spokesman said: “How we heat our homes and other buildings is one of the big challenges we face as the city tackles the causes of climate change. “But this study shows conclusively that heat produced by the GRREC can be used to warm buildings across a wide area on Glasgow’s southside. “The heat that comes from household waste processed at the GRREC is fully renewable and would make substantial inroads on the carbon emissions from the buildings in this heat zone area.” The study on a Polmadie district heat network was carried out by consulting engineering firm Buro Happold. It was hoped it would build “confidence that district heat networks are technically and economically viable in locations across the city”. A council report added: “A potential benefit to the GRREC is that heat generation from the waste resource is significantly more efficient than electrical generation, therefore heat supply to a network could significantly improve the overall energy efficiency of the facility.” An image included in the report shows a pipe network linked to Hampden Park, the New Victoria Hospital, Langside Library, Holyrood Secondary School and Cathcart Police Station. It also displays Toryglen Regional Football Centre, Glasgow Clyde College, Mount Florida Primary School and two blocks of flats. The feasibility report proposed that “heat exchange equipment for the EfW supply be sited on the GRREC site, with an energy centre building, housing back-up boilers and thermal storage, on adjacent GCC land”. Council officials added there is “good alignment between the specific heat source at GRREC considered and the demand identified within the core cluster”. A council spokesman said: “The possibility of a district heating network sourced from the GRREC can also help to attract inward investment and create the infrastructure that can support the push for net zero. “The GRREC produces reliable heat and this study shows investors should be confident of a return on any investment. “We are at an early stage with this initiative but we have grounds for optimism that using energy from waste to heat homes and other buildings is realistic and achievable.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "description": "According to the Department of Military Affairs, the tradition stretches back to the Roman Empire.",
        "content": "SHREVEPORT, La. ( KTAL/KMSS ) – Why do people leave coins on top of military gravestones? Similar practices exist in many cultures and have a history stretching back centuries. In modern times, this tradition is a way for service members to honor those who are no longer with us. It also shows the families that someone came to pay their respects and remember their loved ones. According to the Department of Military Affairs , the tradition stretches back to the Roman Empire, where soldiers would insert coins into the mouths of fallen soldiers. The coins enabled them to pay the mythical boatman Charon to take them across the River Styx into the afterlife. The U.S. military adopted the tradition of placing coins on service members’ graves during the Vietnam War. According to the DMA, anti-war sentiment created a charged political climate that could make it difficult to speak with the family members of their fallen comrades. Using the coins provided them a way to pay their respects peacefully. But there’s a deeper meaning behind each coin, depending on which was left at the gravesite. These coins are usually collected from gravesites periodically and used to maintain cemeteries. They can also go toward burial costs for homeless veterans. Another coin often left on the graves of military members is a “challenge coin.” These are small coins or medallions with the insignia of an organization or unit. They’re presented to service members by their commanders to recognize them for their achievements. Although there are traditions and rules on how to use the coins in a challenge, they are also given as mementos. A service member might leave one on the grave of a person who served in their unit. A similar tradition is also practiced in Judaism . Although the origins of the ancient practice are unknown, placing small stones and pebbles on a Jewish gravesite signifies a desire to remember and honor loved ones.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Prince Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) has urged both chambers of the National Assembly to halt the move to expeditiously pass a bill for an Act on National Anthem with the major aim of replacing the current one with the old. The AGF offered words of caution on Monday in his submission to the public hearing on the bill organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights, and Legal Matters. While he acknowledged that the move to initiate a new National Assembly was laudable, Fagbemi maintained that it should not be treated with legislative fiat. He said replacing the current with the old must enjoy the “buy-in of most Nigerians. He said, “In some cases, the national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to a plebiscite or referendum before its eventual adoption or declaration. “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions. “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat or presidential proclamation alone. “Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National anthem, whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians”. Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, who was represented by the Director-General of the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, who also agreed with the AGF on wider consultations, also suggested discussion around national identity rather than limiting it to the change of the national anthem. Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu identified certain lines in the old national anthem, which he noted do not have a complete meaning. “The issue of the national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not value national identity, of which the national anthem is one. It is not about singing in schools; it is about learning it and imbibing it.” A legal practitioner, who also expressed strong reservations about the expeditious passage of the bill, called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever national anthem is proposed and buy into it. According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an act for general acceptability. He, however, supported the move to replace the current “Arise, O Compatriots” national anthem with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee” the country started with in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current national anthem adopted in 1978 does not have the required gravitas and is not inspirational enough to ignite the passion and zeal for nationhood among Nigerians. Other stakeholders in their submissions preferred the old national anthem to the current one. ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "content": "A former manager target for Celtic is set for a mega-money move to Chelsea. Enzo Maresca is set to join the Premier League giants from Leicester City. The Athletic reports that the Championship title winners have given formal permission to the Stamford Bridge side to talk to their head coach. An approach was made by Chelsea on Monday afternoon, with the Italian - Pep Guardiola's former assistant at Manchester City - identified as the top candidate to replace Mauricio Pochettino. And it's said the 44-year-old is expected to agree a bumper five-year contract with the Blues. Maresca only joined the Foxes last summer after deciding to go it alone in the dugout after breaking ties with City. He had been heavily linked with the vacant post in the east end of Glasgow after Ange Postecoglou's departure for Tottenham Hotspur last June. A formal approach was expected to be made by the Hoops for the coach. However, Dermot Desmond instead opted to go after former manager Brendan Rodgers and well, the rest is history. Maresca guided Leicester to an impressive season in the Championship, earning promotion back to the Premier League at the first time of asking. Kieran McKenna - who won promotion with Ipswich Town - was also under consideration by Chelsea chiefs, but Marseca appears to have won that race.

        "description": "According to the Department of Military Affairs, the tradition stretches back to the Roman Empire.",
        "content": "SHREVEPORT, La. ( ) – Why do people leave coins on top of military gravestones? Similar practices exist in many cultures and have a history stretching back centuries. In modern times, this tradition is a way for service members to honor those who are no longer with us. It also shows the families that someone came to pay their respects and remember their loved ones. According to the , the tradition stretches back to the Roman Empire, where soldiers would insert coins into the mouths of fallen soldiers. The coins enabled them to pay the mythical boatman to take them across the River Styx into the afterlife. The U.S. military adopted the tradition of placing coins on service members’ graves during the Vietnam War. According to the DMA, anti-war sentiment created a charged political climate that could make it difficult to speak with the family members of their fallen comrades. Using the coins provided them a way to pay their respects peacefully. But there’s a deeper meaning behind each coin, depending on which was left at the gravesite. These coins are usually collected from gravesites periodically and used to maintain cemeteries. They can also go toward burial costs for homeless veterans. Another coin often left on the graves of military members is a “challenge coin.” These are small coins or medallions with the insignia of an organization or unit. They’re by their commanders to recognize them for their achievements. Although there are on how to use the coins in a challenge, they are also given as mementos. A service member might leave one on the grave of a person who served in their unit. A similar tradition is also . Although the origins of the ancient practice are unknown, placing small stones and pebbles on a Jewish gravesite signifies a desire to remember and honor loved ones.",

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

        "content": "With regard to the apparent ecological harm caused by homelessness (“Spring reveals a mess on Anchorage’s trails, and a vexing conversation about homelessness,” ADN, May 19): Contrary to repulsive depictions, homeless people historically leave the smallest ecological footprint. First and foremost, the majority of homeless don’t drive vehicles but walk or take public transportation. The “homeless shuffle” merely consists of cutting a path through the grass leading up to a soup kitchen. Wherein the homeless sit down, eat, get up and walk out empty-handed and with empty pockets. Where’s all the consumerism and trash coming from? There’s a deliberate illustrative demonization of the homeless afoot; organized sabotage of people living outdoors. Actual sabotage coupled with ad hominem attacks against the homeless resulting from too much burning of incense to Herbert Spencer and Ayn Rand is the problem; hence there is no political will to bring about sufficient affordable housing and other services. — Christopher Deile Anchorage Have something on your mind?

        "description": "Netanyahu pushed back at accusations that he has not empowered the negotiating team and that he has preferred to wage an un-winnable war rather than make a deal to return the hostages",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the IDF strike that killed 45 Palestinian civilians in Gaza a “tragic mistake” as he vowed never to wave the white flag of defeat as he rejected domestic and international calls to end the war. “Those who say they are exhausted that they are not ready or can not withstand the pressure,” Netanyahu told the Knesset plenum on Monday, “should hold up the white flag of defeat. I will not wave that kind of flag. I will continue to fight until we wave the flag of victory,” he stated. In a brief but rousing speech delivered as the international community increasingly believes that Hamas can not be defeated militarily, Netanyahu vowed to battle on. Opposition leader MK Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) called on Netanyahu to resign, due to his failed policies, primarily the Hamas-led invasion of Israel on October 7, in which over 1,200 people were killed and another 252 were seized as hostages. “Mr. Prime Minister, why are you still here [in office]?” Lapid said during the 40-signature debate which he initiated. “In what world does the prime minister who is responsible for [October 7] the greatest disaster that has happened to the Jewish people since the Holocaust remain prime minister? In what world do you not come before the plenum, ask for forgiveness from the people of Israel... – and go home?” But when the plenum was asked to vote, 50 of the 120 Knesset members voted to support Netanyahu’s policies, while only 39 backed Lapid’s call for him to quit. Netanyahu defended his efforts to secure the release of the hostages. Although he was able to free 105 of the captives during a deal in November, a second deal has eluded him. A negotiation process, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, has dragged on, without any visible sign of a possible deal, even as high-level talks were held, including in Paris over the weekend between Mossad Chief David Barnea, CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammad Al-Thani. Netanyahu pushed back at accusations that he has not empowered the negotiating team and that he has preferred to wage an unwinnable war rather than make a deal to return the hostages. \"I completely reject the abominable lie, that I do not give the negotiating team the mandate when asked, and do not respond to its requests,” he said. “From the end of December and until now, I received five requests from the negotiating team to expand the mandate, to allow flexible terms, and I authorized all of them,” Netanyahu explained. He blamed the absence of a deal on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, stressing that he was the “obstacle” to a deal. Night after night television studies repeat false claims and spin about the talks that only harm the families and give Sinwar an excuse not to make a deal, Netanyahu explained. The pressure that should be directed to Sinwar “in whose basements the hostages are kept” is instead being leveled at “the Israeli government.” “Israel is repeatedly asked to make more concessions and more concessions So why should Sinwar get stressed? He is sitting in his bunker, rubbing his hands with pleasure, and is happy that others are doing the work for him,” Netanyahu said. “The pressure directed from home and abroad towards the Israeli government, which is fighting with all its might to return the hostages, only hardens the positions of Sinwar, who demands from Israel surrender conditions that endanger its existence, and therefore we cannot agree to them,” Netanyahu said. The prime minister also spoke of the importance of continuing the Rafah operation, a military campaign that has drawn global condemnation, with the International Court of Justice ordering Israel to halt any military campaign that would destroy the Palestinian group, in whole or in part. The IDF has focused on targeted strikes, killing two high-level Hamas operatives on Sunday night, Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. The strike, however, set off an explosion into a nearby safe zone for civilians, in which 45 civilians were killed and scores of others were wounded. Netanyahu in describing the incident said, “Despite our best effort not to harm those not involved, unfortunately, a tragic mistake happened last night. We are investigating the incident, we will draw conclusions because this is our policy.” He stressed that separately the IDF had managed to safely evacuate over a million civilians from Gaza.He urged the Israeli public not to listen to the pundits, former politicians, and generals, who painted a false picture of defeat “I hear in the studio the voices of despondency... that say it’s impossible to win.” These voices note the pressure against Israel from the “international community [and] America,” Netanyahu said, as he stressed that he did not plan to be constrained by the global community. “Citizens of Israel, if you want weakness, despondency, surrender – listen to the studios. But if you want power, spirit, and victory – listen to the warriors.,” Netanyahu stated. “The goals of the war, have not changed,” Netanyahu said. “To be victorious over Hamas, return all the hostages, ensure that Gaza won’t pose a threat to Israel, and return the residents of the North safely to their homes.” “These remain our objectives,” he added. “If we surrender, we won’t get all our hostages back. If we surrender, we will give a great victory to terrorism, a great victory to Iran, to its axis of evil, and to all those seeking our destruction,” Netanyahu said. “I am not ready to surrender and fold. I am not ready to end the war before all its objectives are completed. Our heroes did not die in vain.”",

        "description": "The Portland Trail Blazers legend and Hall of Famer died of cancer at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday.",
        "content": "PORTLAND, Ore. — People across the basketball world are sharing their memories of Portland Trail Blazers and NBA legend Bill Walton, who died of cancer at the age of 71. Walton, considered one of the best players in Trail Blazers history, led Portland to its lone NBA championship in 1977 and was named Finals MVP. He won a second championship in 1986 with the Boston Celtics, his final full season in the league. Walton was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. He was also beloved for his work as a sportscaster after his playing career and his life-long work as an advocate for social and political issues (and the Pac-12). Here are some of the reactions from the NBA world: Adam Silver , NBA commissioner: \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know him and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many colleagues and friends.\" Julius Erving , NBA legend and Hall of Famer: \"I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc\" I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too.

His NCAA Championship performance as a UCLA Bruin against Memphis is by far the most dominate NCAA Championship performance ever - he shot 21 for 22 and had us all mesmerized! That’s when I first fell in love with his basketball game. They talk about Jokic being the most skilled center but Bill Walton was first! From shooting jump shots to making incredible passes, he was one of the smartest basketball players to ever live. Bill was a great ambassador for college basketball and the NBA, and he will be sorely missed. Cookie and I send our condolences and prayers to his wife Lori, kids Luke, Nathan, Chris, and Adam, and all of his loved ones.\" Ron Wyden , Oregon senator: \"Bill Walton brought Rip City our greatest on-the-court thrills by leading the Trail Blazers on a magical run to the title in 1977. And for decades after his playing days, he brought an entire nation his good nature on life and basketball. I will miss my friend Bill dearly.\" Daryl Morey , Philadelphia 76ers executive: \"RIP Bill Walton - my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992.\" RIP Bill Walton - my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992 pic.twitter.com/eZVtBZMOBX Los Angeles Clippers : \"We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd. The Clippers organization extends our deepest condolences to the Walton family, as well as our utmost gratitude. Bill was a singular force, and we were privileged to know him.\" Pac-12 Conference : \"The Pac-12 is and will forever be the Conference of Champions not because of trophies or medals, but because of the amazing individuals, champions in life, who compete in this league and cement legacies of excellence. There is no better example of this 'Conference of Champions' spirit than Bill Walton. We are heartbroken and devastated to learn of Bill's untimely passing. We offer our sincere condolences and thoughts of love to Bill's family and the entire Pac-12, UCLA Bruins and basketball communities. Bill's list of accomplishments on the court, as massive as they are, are only outweighed by the quality of his character and beauty of his one-of-a-kind loving spirit.\" Sam Amick , longtime NBA reporter: \"Thoughts and prayers to the Walton family and legions of friends that the legendary Bill Walton made in his 71 years. He was larger than life in every sense, and sharing his positive energy and humor until the end.\" Marc Stein , longtime NBA reporter: \"Such incredibly sad news. Bill Walton was one of the most magnetic, engaging, basketball-loving personalities I ever encountered covering this game. He will be so, so, SO missed. Most heartfelt wishes to his son Luke, their whole family and everyone who knew and loved Bill.\" Kevin O'Connor , longtime NBA reporter: \"RIP Bill Walton.

Bill was just a joy to be around, one of the most passionate, engaging, fascinating people I've had the honor of knowing. Always generous with his time and insights. Condolences to his family.\" John Hollinger , former NBA team executive, current NBA reporter: \"Bill Walton was 1 of 1. Always passionate about the game, always had a warm greeting for everyone he saw in the arena - even people like me that he barely knew. What a sad day for basketball.\" Chris Vernon , NBA podcast host: \"RIP Bill Walton. One of my absolute favs. He wrote this letter to my son. Will treasure it forever.\" RIP Bill Walton. One of my absolute favs. He wrote this letter to my son. Will treasure it forever. pic.twitter.com/m8LY3psZnx Mike Barrett , former Trail Blazers broadcaster: \"Had an intense love for life. Happy and peaceful, seemingly always. Always made you feel important and honored. What a gift he was, and what a legacy he leaves.\" Casey Holdahl , longtime Trail Blazers team reporter: \"I wrote a dumb story (my specialty) about players wearing shorter shorts, so I figured I'd reach out to Bill not expecting I'd hear back. Bill ended up talking for an hour (his specialty) with complete sincerity about the virtues of short shorts. And that really encapsulates Bill. Never too big or serious to make you feel silly or small. Always made you feel important because of the time he was willing to give you. Willing to be vulnerable in ways most people avoid at all costs.\" Danny Marang , Portland radio host, host of Jacked Ramsays podcast: \"I remember in my earliest years not liking Walton on game calls. Then, I grew to love his love and appreciation for the people and the game. 'Throw it down, big man!' become one of my favorite calls. Man, this sucks. RIP to a true 1 of 1. No one will ever do it like he did.\" Orlando Sanchez , KGW sports anchor and reporter: \"Heartbreaking to hear the passing of the legendary Bill Walton. One of a kind. Got the opportunity to chat with him a few times over the years. My favorite line of his was, \"I'm the luckiest guy in the world.\" Condolences to his family and loved ones. RIP to a legend.\" Jay Allen , former on-air TV and radio host/reporter for the Trail Blazers: \"Devastated to hear the news of Bill Walton's passing. Through my work with KXL and the Blazers, I had the honor of dining in and broadcasting from his San Diego home. One of my cherished memories of Bill was picking him up at PDX before a Fred Meyer remote. We had some extra time so he asked me to take him to Multnomah Falls. As we walked the trail up to the bridge, people stopped us every few moments to thank him, ask for a picture or autograph, or just say hello. He was patient and gracious with each fan. I will never forget the kindness and generosity he showed me over the years. My condolences to his wife, Lori, and his family. #RIPbigredhead\" Ian Karmel , famous comedian and Blazers fan: \"I'm not sure who is the greatest Blazer of all time, but Bill Walton is the most Blazer of all time. ... This is of course very sad, and especially sad for the people who knew him and aren't just fans from afar like me... but imagine being on your death bed looking back at THAT life. He really went out and did it.\" Dave McMenamin , ESPN NBA reporter: \"We get caught up in 'greatness' conversations about NBA players ad nauseam - Who’s the GOAT? Is this guy better than that guy? Would that guy's game translate to this era? Take some time to read the tributes pouring in about Bill Walton today. That's true greatness.\" Chris Vannini , The Athletic senior writer: The best of Bill Walton on commentary: pic.twitter.com/MqwNQZj2dg This story will be updated with more reactions as they continue to come in.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Walton, a legend in college basketball at UCLA and in the NBA, carved out a post-NBA career as a college basketball announcer at ESPN. His offbeat and often humorous commentary during games arguably made him more famous than he was as a player. Here’s some of the social media reaction to his death. Rachel Nichols, then host of ESPN’s “The Jump” show, recalls when Walton came on took a framed photo of Bill Russell, and “ .” Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey wrote of Walton’s “ “Absolutely crushed to hear of the passing of the legendary Bill Walton, whose intellect, sense of humor, and zest for life were even bigger than he was,” ESPN host Mike Greenberg wrote on X. “He was also, , with a game that was decades ahead of his time - he’d have been perfect in today’s NBA.” Former NFL star Julian Edelman called Walton “ .”",

        "content": "Google has announced a $1 million grant to support the development of the \"Auschwitz in Front of Your Eyes\" project through its philanthropic arm, Google.org. The initiative aims to deepen awareness and knowledge about , reaching additional audiences worldwide through a live-streamed virtual tour. The project enables people unable to physically visit the camp, including those in remote locations, to engage with the history of Auschwitz. The virtual tour, conducted by a guide, includes , multimedia materials, and interactive opportunities for participants to ask questions. \"The funding will help develop the technological platform and its accessibility, including real-time subtitles, AI-based translation into multiple languages, and the digitization of survivor testimonies,\" said Rowan Barnett, for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. \"This support will also provide comprehensive training for guides and enhance the capacity to bring such visits to large communities worldwide, including partnerships with schools to educate more students about the Holocaust.\" The online guided tour program, \"Auschwitz in Front of Your Eyes,\" was recently launched by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum. This innovative initiative provides a virtual visit to the former German Nazi concentration and extermination camp. The two-hour tour is divided into two parts: Auschwitz I and Birkenau. Educators conduct the tours live, utilizing multimedia materials, archival photographs, artistic works, documents, and testimonies of survivors. Group tours are available in seven languages: English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Polish, and Spanish. Individual tours are offered in English, German, and Polish. Bookings can be made through visit.auschwitz.org. \"This form of visit differs from on-site tours primarily because, in the online version, we do not present the museum exhibitions,\" said Tomasz Michaldo, project coordinator at the Museum. \"Technology allows us to somewhat transfer the content of the exhibition to the historical site, as many things can be additionally shown on the screen. During the online tour, it will be possible, thanks to video recordings, to enter several spaces that are either not accessible to visitors, such as Block 10 in the former Auschwitz I camp, or are located too far from the regular tour route, such as the Sauna building in the former Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp.\" Dr. Piotr M. A. Cywiński, the director of the Auschwitz Museum, emphasized the importance of making the Memorial and its resources accessible globally to confront issues related to antisemitism, racial hatred, and societal threats. \"Our mission is to commemorate the victims and preserve this universal memory, on which we have built and continue to build our post-war identity. Although thousands of people visit the authentic site every day, this unique technology will enable us to reach people in the most remote corners of the world,\" he said. \"We hope that this will strengthen the memory that actually gives us the power to act responsibly for the repair of the world, making it a better place for our children and grandchildren.\" The online platform is a collaborative effort between the Museum, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, and companies such as AppsFlyer and DISKIN. Wojciech Soczewica, director general of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, noted the project's responsibility to preserve the authenticity of the historical site while making educational content accessible worldwide.

        "content": "Adrienne McGuinness provided a false alibi for infamous killer ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney Adrienne McGuinness turned up a stereo to drown out murder victim Mark Dwyer’s screams Election candidate Malachy Steenson Adrienne McGuinness at an anti-immigration protest Adrienne McGuinness at and anti-immigration protest ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney A woman who initially gave a false alibi for a notorious gangland killer in a murder investigation is part of the campaign team for an anti-immigrant candidate in the upcoming elections. Adrienne McGuinness, a prominent anti-immigrant protester from East Wall in Dublin, initially lied for ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney to give him an alibi for the brutal torture and murder of Mark Dwyer over missing drugs in 1996. McGuinness, who was present in the Co Kildare home where Dwyer was being tortured and turned up the stereo to drown out his screams, was arrested by gardaí in connection with the killing and gave Delaney an alibi saying she had been having an affair with him and slept with him that night. However, she later agreed to testify against Delaney in court and said she had given him the false alibi as she had been frightened of him. Election candidate Malachy Steenson She said she booked into a hotel with Delaney in the aftermath of the killing after she received death threats from a man purporting to be from the INLA over alleged drug pushing and had been given seven days to leave the country. McGuinness is now campaigning for Independent European and local election candidate Malachy Steenson, who in the 1990s was a fringe republican and anti-drug activist who had been targeted by Garda Special Branch and has a conviction from the Special Criminal Court. The pair have found common ground in recent times due to their shared anti-immigration views and have been part of a campaign against the housing of asylum seekers in East Wall in Dublin. Last year, the Sunday World revealed that McGuinness — who previously described refugees as “scammers bleeding us dry” — had a compensation claim thrown out of court because she had failed to disclose previous accidents. Adrienne McGuinness at an anti-immigration protest McGuinness had been awarded €175,000 in compensation over a number of years as a result of various accidents. However, last October she was unsuccessful in a €60,000 claim in Dublin Circuit Civil Court in relation to a minimal-impact car crash which she said left her with a sore neck. Judge Sinéad Ní Chúlacháin told McGuinness she had no option but to throw out her latest claim because she had given evidence of two accidents that she had failed to disclose earlier. Steenson has been linked to various political groups over the years, including the Workers Party and Republican Sinn Féin. Adrienne McGuinness at and anti-immigration protest In 1994, Garda Special Branch raided Steenson’s home in an operation targeting fringe figures linked to Republican Sinn Féin – an anti-peace process republican splinter group. Four years later, in 1998, he lost a court bid to get a licence to drive a hackney after an appeal to Dublin District Court. The carriage office had previously rejected his application for a public service vehicle licence as he had three convictions, including one at the Special Criminal Court for unauthorised taking of a vehicle. Steenson was also a friend of Alan Ryan, who was shot dead after a feud with gangland criminals in 2012. He spoke out after Ryan’s death and later said he did so because Ryan was dealing with drug dealers in society and “the state wasn’t willing to do that”. ‘Cotton Eye’ Joe Delaney While Steenson was part of anti-drug movements in Dublin in the 1990s, he also defended a drug dealer whose home was marched on by local residents. Steenson publicly defended Brendan ‘Fats’ Reilly, saying he was an addict but not a dealer. Reilly was later jailed after being caught with £30,000 of heroin at his home. Meanwhile, McGuinness is not the only anti-immigrant campaigner who was present during Mark Dwyer’s torture. Delaney’s son Scott Delaney , who helped abduct Dwyer before he was tortured and killed by his father, is also part of anti-immigrant protests.",

        "description": "White House response less critical than others issued after similar incidents throughout the war, says 'Israel has right to go after Hamas, but must take every precaution'The post US laments ‘devastating’ Rafah strike, urges Israel to better protect civilians appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "The US on Monday lamented the “devastating” and “heartbreaking” images from an IDF missile strike carried out the previous night, which targeted two senior Hamas officials, but also reportedly killed dozens of displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering in tents in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians, but, as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians,” said a statement from a National Security Council spokesperson. While the White House indicated a degree of disappointment with Israel over the high civilian toll, its statement was notably less critical than previous dressing-downs that the Biden administration has not shied away from giving in recent months. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened,” the spokesperson added, indicating that the White House may have more to say on the matter after more information is gathered. In April, after an IDF strike killed seven humanitarian workers, US President Joe Biden said he was “outraged” by the attack and threatened to fundamentally shift his policy in the Gaza war if Israel did not take significant steps to improve the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza. Earlier this month, Biden warned that he would halt certain offensive weapons shipments to Israel if it launched an offensive in the population centers of Rafah. Two US officials told the Axios news site on Monday that the White House was still assessing whether Sunday’s strike violated that red line set by Biden. Just last week, the White House indicated its satisfaction with Israel’s shifting from its initial Rafah plans to a more limited operation. Sunday’s strike drew fiercer condemnations from the European Union, the United Nations, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, France, and others, who called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Israel acted relatively quickly to acknowledge wrongdoing, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying, “Despite our efforts not to harm [civilians], there was a tragic mishap. We are investigating the incident.” The airstrike in the Tel Sultan area of western Rafah targeted and killed the commander of Hamas’s so-called West Bank headquarters — charged with advancing attacks against Israel in and from the West Bank — as well as another top member of the unit. Hamas health authorities said some 45 people were killed in the strike, which also engulfed several tents and shelters where thousands of people were taking shelter in the area — many of whom after having been repeatedly displaced due to the war. The IDF said that an independent military body responsible for investigating unusual incidents during the war will probe the Sunday night strike. The army said it carried out the attack after receiving intelligence that senior Hamas commanders Yassin Rabia and Khaled Najjar were in the area. It claimed that it took “many steps” to reduce civilian harm and believed that non-combatants would be protected. A military source said that two missiles with a “reduced in size” warhead, which were adapted for such targets, were used in the strike. The IDF added that the strike did not take place in the designated “humanitarian zone” in the al-Mawasi region on the coast, where the military has called Palestinians to evacuate to in recent weeks. Palestinians say that the zone is completely overcrowded, forcing them to find adjacent areas to shelter. The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas’s October 7 massacre, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 252 hostages amid acts of brutality and sexual assault. Roughly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed and 80,420 have been injured in the Israeli military offensive against Hamas since October 7, according to the Gaza health ministry run by the terror group. These figures have not been verified and only some 25,000 fatalities have been identified at hospitals. The tolls include some 15,000 terror operatives Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Emanuel Fabian contributed to this report.",

        "content": "ANTHONY MARTIAL has left Manchester United after nine years with the club. The Frenchman, 28, confirmed his departure with an emotional Instagram video and caption. He signed for the club from Monaco in 2015 in an initial £36million deal. With add-ons, that fee eventually rose to £44m. His initial contract with the club was extended in January 2019, under the watch of then manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. That saw him earn a contract of £200k-a-week until this summer, and contained in it the option to extend by another year. United have opted to not take up that option or renegotiate on reduced terms. It's understood that Sir Jim Ratcliffe is willing to allow several high earners to leave Old Trafford as he looks to make space for the club within PSR constraints.

        "description": "Teachers and other child educators can benefit from regular professional development, but in-person training can be expensive. New research found that virtual training can be a budget-friendly alternative—and especially effective for certain groups of educators.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Katie Bohn, Pennsylvania State University Teachers and other child educators can benefit from regular professional development, but in-person training can be expensive. New research found that virtual training can be a budget-friendly alternative—and especially effective for certain groups of educators. The study—a collaboration between researchers at Penn State and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and published in the International Journal of Professional Development, Learners and Learning —found that educators who took a virtual training reported feeling more confident in their abilities to implement practices shown to support positive youth development. In particular, after-school providers who did not have a four-year degree and were relatively new to teaching experienced the most growth in their feelings of self-efficacy. Co-author Benjamin Bayly, assistant professor in family studies , child, and youth development in the College of Agricultural Sciences, said the work suggests that virtual professional development has the potential to be an effective way to reach a vast audience of educators who otherwise may not have the opportunity to participate in these trainings. \"Early care and education programs are often limited in financial resources and their workforce is often stretched thin, making it difficult to participate in professional development,\" Bayly said. \"Virtual professional development represents an alternative that is low cost and can be completed on teachers' own time.\" Education quality has a direct impact on children's development, the researchers said, and has been shown to predict future academic success and social and emotional well-being for children of all ages. For teachers and other educators to provide high-quality educational experiences, the researchers said it's important they are trained in and feel confident implementing the most up-to-date pedagogical theories and best practices in their classrooms. This can be achieved through professional development, traditionally completed in person. For example, an early care and education program may bring in an outside expert to conduct a workshop with the aim of improved instructional and emotional support in the classroom. \"However, given the high rate of turnover in early care and education programs , these teachers may leave and be replaced by new teachers who have not completed the workshop,\" Bayly said. \"It may not be feasible for the program to continuously bring in an outside expert to train teachers every time new teachers come on board.\" As an alternative, training can be done in an online setting. Penn State Extension, for example, offers virtual evidence-informed professional development to early care and education and youth-development professionals to improve the quality of their care and educational practices through its program, Better Kid Care. \"All of Better Kid Care's courses are on-demand, meaning professionals can take the course whenever they want,\" Bayly said. \"The vast majority of the courses offered by Better Kid Care are designed to take two hours and are approved for professional development credits in 49 states.\" But while virtual training can reach a larger audience and be more cost effective than in-person professional development, research on its effectiveness has remained mixed. Bayly said he and the rest of the research team wanted to better evaluate the impact of virtual training and whether certain groups may benefit more than others. For the study, the researchers collected data from 3,535 educators accessing positive youth development courses through Better Kid Care. Educators varied in their specific roles, the ages of children they worked with, the level of their own education and how many years of experience they had. After completing the virtual course, educators completed a post-test that asked them questions about what they had just learned, as well as how they would have responded to those same questions before taking the training. This was designed to assess changes in the participants' learning. Participants also were asked to rank how confident they felt in their ability to apply learnings from the course, for example, \"When working with children and youth, I can recognize their individual differences and make changes to activities to meet these differences.\" Taken together, the researchers said the study's findings suggest that on-demand professional development is a promising way to increase educators' self-efficacy, but the courses may have different impacts depending on factors such as education level, role and experience. Bayly said after-school providers without a four-year degree appear to have benefited the most from the virtual training because they were relatively new to the field and likely had not received a comparable amount of training compared to the other educators who completed the course. \"Also, because the courses were dedicated to supporting positive youth development , it is likely that the content resonated with them, which has been shown to impact participants' engagement and the effectiveness of the professional development opportunity,\" Bayly said. The researchers said because there is great variability in the quality of virtual professional development—and as a result, great variability in the effectiveness of the trainings—additional studies should continue to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual professional development, both on its own and in comparison to in-person professional development and hybrid models.

        "description": "Vancouver artist Sang Chul Nam displays his latest work at Fort Langley Community Hall June 1 to 9",
        "content": "A contemporary Vancouver artist with a high-tech show is taking over a new art exhibition space in the historic Fort Langley Community Hall next month. “Hacking the Third Wave II” runs 10 days, colliding past and future in the former-library-space-turned-art-gallery, which is located on the ground floor of the hall. Earlier this year, the long-time Fort Langley Library was temporarily relocated to the former centennial museum space on King Street, consequently vacating the 900-plus-square-foot space, while the library waits to move into its permanent home in the salishan Place by the River cultural centre currently under construction nearby. In the meantime, the vacant area of the hall has been transformed and since dubbed the “Olde Library Space.” It will now be used for art opportunities, said Brigitte Seib, executive director of the community hall. Fort Langley Artist Group (FLAG) was the first to use the space for a four-day pop-up show during the May Day long weekend, and that exhibition will be followed this coming week by a Fort Gallery show, running from June 1 to 9. “Hacking the Third Wave II” was created by multi-media artist Sang Chul Nam and features cosmic paintings, sculptures, and projections—immersing viewers in what he calls a world of possible futures. Nam is a visual and new media/interactive artist exploring the boundaries between visual art and technology in Seoul and Vancouver. For the past 17 years, Nam’s work explored the emotional, interactive, and formative space made through the movement of light – and the combination of painting, objects, video installation, and physical computing. He has displayed his work in numerous exhibitions in Hong Kong, South Korea, plus some 20 other cities around the globe – including Langley. Recently, his interest has shifted towards conveying the message of climate change and the unsettling impact of global warming on the environment. He tries to channel this concern through media and interactive art forms that orchestrate the movement of lights and artificial objects with human interactions. Nam’s latest show explores people’s multifaceted relationship to nature in an increasingly manufactured and technological age. He’s creating a space where he hopes viewers will grapple with the many forms of change facing climate and local ecologies. What he calls a “hopeful and critical” body of work, this exhibit was developed in response to his experience of working as an artist in Seoul. He said he was “saturated with technology to such a degree that he felt his own consciousness and behavioural patterns changing like a machine... trapped in patterns of ‘replication,’ ‘repetition,’ and ‘computation’.” When he relocated to Vancouver, he had a contrasting experience, surrounded by abundant natural spaces. This prompted Nam to explore the question: “what will the world of the future look like if our consciousness is controlled by technological properties, patterns, or behaviours and doesn’t feel the beautiful, emotional waves that come from nature?” Entering the historic community hall space, viewers will encounter abstract paintings and kinetic geometric sculptures, overlaid with projected patterns and interactive lights. Multiple screens will be suspended and layered throughout the space, immersing viewers in “a powerful interplay of organic and artificial elements.” Viewers are invited into a dual investigation of their relationship to nature and technology, as Nam illuminates both the “benefits humans derive from nature and the concerns surrounding the contradictory impacts of technological progress on the environment.” The exhibit is open June 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9, from noon to 4 p.m., and also available for viewing by appointment June 3 through 6. Appointments can be booked via email at . There will also be an artist talk and opening reception held Saturday, June 1, starting with the talk at 2 p.m. and the reception to follow. All events are free and open to the public. Fort Gallery is in its second season of its pop-up programming. Fort Gallery was founded in 2006 as an artist co-op to provide a space for experimental, non-commercial art practice in the Langley area. In 2019 the co-op was dissolved and Fort Gallery became the first and only artist-run-centre in the Fraser Valley. In 2022, after 17 years exhibiting contemporary art in its heritage Fort Langley storefront at the corner of Glover Road and Francis Street, Fort Gallery moved out of this beloved space to begin a new venture as a mobile artist-run-centre. Responding to growing online engagement and the challenge of maintaining a physical gallery in a post-COVID world, the board determined that going mobile was a way to embrace experimentation and reimagine Fort Gallery. Fort Gallery continues hopes to continue bringing engaging, challenging, and thought-provoking contemporary art to the Fraser Valley in alternative and public spaces throughout the region, said board president Alysha Creighton.",

        "description": "Mr Fagbemi said the call for the transfer of the conduct of local government elections to INEC is fueled by the perception that state electoral commissions are appendages of incumbent governors. The post Why there’s growing agitation for scrapping of SIECs — AGF appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, has said there is a strong call for the scrapping of the state electoral commissions because of their abuse by governors. Mr Fagbemi said the call for the transfer of the conduct of local government elections to INEC is fueled by the perception that SEIC are appendages of incumbent governors. The AGF spoke on Monday at the national dialogue organised by the House of Representatives at the Sheraton Hotel in Abuja. The dialogue was titled; Nigeria’s Security Challenges and Good Governance at the Local Government Level. Under the 1999 constitution, SIECs have the mandate to conduct elections in the 768 local governments in the 36 states of Nigeria, while INEC is responsible for the six area councils in Abuja and other elections. Over the years, the inability of the SIECs to conduct free, fair and credible elections has led to calls for reforms. In many states, ruling parties in the states win all elections, while many states are operating caretaker committees. In his speech, Mr Fagbemi said the perceived lack of independence by the electoral commissions is fueling the call for the shift.

Their functions and powers should be transferred to the independent national electoral commission because the state independent electoral commissions remain an appendage to every incumbent governor. “This is perceived as the root cause of the problem of local government administration in Nigeria,” he said. However, the minister did not state if the executive was going to adopt the option, nor did he provide the stance of the government on the proposal by the experts. To make the change, the constitution has to be amended. The process is currently going on in the two chambers of the National Assembly. Mr Fagbemi said the constitution did not provide adequate political autonomy for the states, hence the abuse by state governments. He explained that the failure of the constitution is to blame for the subjugation of the local governments by states. “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria did not provide adequately for the political autonomy of the local governments. The resultant effects of these inadequacies are that the state governments have the discretion to determine the nature, content and direction of local government elections and political activities. “The failure of the constitution to articulate a clear line of authorities to both the state and local authorities and the continuing debate over the involvement of state governments in distributing local government allocation from the Federation Account has affected the capacity of LGAs to provide essential services at the grassroots,” he said. Speaking further, the AGF said that most local governments operate “as an appendage of the state governments” due to the constitution. He added that “the constitutional provisions on State Joint Local Government Account (section 162 (5-8)) have placed the local government councils in a political bondage.” Mr Fagbemi said many state governors do not conduct elections rather they select preferred candidates. “Politically, due to the flaws in the electoral process in the country, what is obtained is a virtual selection and not the election of local government functionaries. Local government chairmen are always imposed on the people by the state governors,” he said. Mr Fagbemi proposed some recommendations to address the problems facing local governments in Nigeria, stating that there is a need to amend the 1999 constitution to address the anomalies. “LGAs are created by the constitution. Accordingly, in a tiered system like ours, a constitutional amendment is imperative before a new system of local government administration can be instituted. “Good governance at any level of governance is not possible without the transfer of authority, responsibilities, capacity and resources. This is even more so for the LGAs. He stated that the reforms should, among other things, aim to increase the fiscal and administrative autonomy of the local government system to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency; Mr Fagbemi also said, “Fiscal autonomy should be balanced with fiscal restraint by strengthening the internal controls system, processes and infrastructure for public financial management.” In addition, the minister said the legislative arms of local governments should be allowed to decide what they should do with revenue accruing to them. He said there is a need to invest more in local government administration with institutionalised internal and external oversight. PREMIUM TIMES reported that the AGF, on behalf of the federal government, filed a suit at the Supreme Court against the 36 state governments, seeking the enforcement of full autonomy of the local governments in Nigeria. Governors have a history of opposing any form of reform of the local government system. Most constitutional alteration bills on reforms are blocked by them. In December 2022, former President Muhammadu Buhari accused the state governors of pilfering local government funds. PREMIUM TIMES reported how state governors rose against a move by the NFIU to abolish the states’ local governments’ joint accounts through which governors allegedly exercised absolute control over local governments’ funds in the country. The NFIU placed a limit on cash withdrawals from local government accounts to a maximum of N500,000 per day. It warned banks to ensure strict compliance. Last December, the Nigerian Senate asked the federal government to stop the allocation of funds to local governments run by caretaker committees.

        "content": "ABUJA – The National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party, Chief Dan Nwanyanwu has commended the National Assembly for passing the bill to repeal the current national anthem and revert to the original National Anthem which commenced with the Nigeria’s Independence on October 1st,1960. Chief Dan Nwanyanwu stated this today Monday 27th 2024, during a Press conference at the party National Secretariat in Abuja . Nwanyanwu who also congratulated the lawmakers, said he felt vindicated by the noble act of 10th National Assembly which he said was in complete consonance with his Presidential Manifesto for the 2023 Presidential Election where he vigorously canvassed for the return to Nigeria’s old national anthem. According to him, “What the National Assembly has done, has not only proved that it is sensitive to the yearning’s of the people but it’s also abundantly clear that there was no justifiable reason to have tampered with the 1960 National Anthem of Nigeria to the extent of replacing it with a meaningless anthem that makes mockery of Nigeria’s diversity and yearning for unity. “The National Anthem of a country is so symbolic that it becomes strange that when Military adventurists without any form of consultation or logic, repealed Nigeria’s charished National Anthem by military fiat. Many countries of the world have retained their National Anthem for several centuries as long as they existed as a Nation. Nigeria unfortunately has become a guinea pig that everything is experimented on without a convincing reason. “The 1960 National Anthem of Nigeria touches the very core of our diversity, and religious complexities. Nwanyanwu further stated that the National Anthem evoked emotions and the call for a united Nigeria where equity justice will reign supreme with no citizen oppressed and a section being preponderant over others with clear equity of citizens. “These are the reasons I gave when I canvassed for the reverting to the original National Anthem. I joined all well meaning Nigerians in commending the National Assembly and its leadership for their courage and patriotism in this regard. “I urged Mr President to waste no time assenting to this bill without delay and history will record the enactment of this landmark Act to his credit,” Chief Dan Nwanyanwu added. The Zenith Labour Party also seized the opportunity to commend President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the achievements recorded since he became Nigeria’s democratically elected President.",

        "content": "PUNTERS have mourned the loss of a \"brilliant venue\" as a bingo hall closes its doors for good today. Buzz Bingo 's traditional bingo hall in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire , will pull down the shutters for the final time. The 26,000sq ft establishment on Shenley Road was popular with players in the area. The move comes as Buzz Bingo is set to test much smaller boutique bingo premises for use on high streets, reports the Times. And it's not all bad news for bingo lovers in Borehamwood with a new bingo hall is opening in the same area on May 28 to replace the old establishment. But the \"new and improved\" 3,000sq ft site has a capacity of only 150 players. However, the new hall is described as a \"major glow up \" with plenty in store for players to enjoy and see for themselves at the re-opening. Members can expect a fresh modern atmosphere with stylish decor and comfy new seating in a more contemporary, state-of-the-art \"bingo lounge\" layout. The Slots Room will feature the latest fun games and slot machines. Punters can also enjoy a new menu including a delicious range of paninis and halloumi fries. Dinesh Pandithurai, General Manager at Buzz Bingo Borehamwood, said: “We’re so excited to bring our amazing community the bingo they know and love with added sparkle.\" One Facebook user praised the new development, saying: \"Looks brilliant. Well done all. Look forward to seeing it soon.\" Another added: \"Good luck to all staff and management I'm sure you will smash it.\" Although many were excited at the potential \"glow-up\", others were apprehensive about the change. Social media was abuzz with people weighing in with their opinions on the new site. One wrote: \"Doesn’t look like many places to sit and play.\" Another said: \"I feel sorry for anyone that turns up on a busy night and gets turned away.\" While a third said that the original \"brilliant venue\" would be missed by many. Buzz Bingo — then Gala Bingo — was acquired by Caledonia Innvestments in 2015 for £241 million. It is now owned by ICG, which bought a majority stake in the business from Caledonia in 2021. In 2015 it had 130 clubs, but it has been whittled down to 83 as leases have expired, sites have been redeveloped and poorly performing venues have been closed. Dominic Mansour, 47, chief executive at Buzz Bingo, said new smaller bingo premises had been “at the core of their communities for more than 25 years [with] a focus on a low-stake bingo offer with frequent winners”. Mansour told The Times: “There was a renaissance last year where we saw an interesting adoption of bingo among a younger demographic. \"Historically this business has always been known for a middle-aged female demographic. Then last year we saw increases in younger customers looking for a different night out. \"It’s low risk. It’s a very good experience. It’s the softest form of gambling and is very good value.” He said that bingo still represented “a very, very safe place for women of a certain demographic to go out and have some fun\". Buzz is buying a business that welcomed 410,000 visitors last year and has recorded a 5 per cent increase in admissions in the year to date. On average they pay out winnings of more than £1 million a month. The pandemic was a tough blow as many stores had to close during lockdown . Since then energy costs have risen and more shoppers than ever are choosing to order online rather than head into stores. This has left some remaining retailers grappling with budgets and having no choice but to close stores to cut costs. The Body Shop is currently going through administration and announced plans to close half of its 198 stores with seven already closed. Boots revealed it would be closing 300 stores over the next year as part of plans to evolve its brand . WHSmith told The Sun it has no plans to open anymore more high street stores as it wants to focus on the travel side of its business. Major banks have also announced multiple branch closures. Halifax is closing several branches this month and more are due to close later on in the year. Even charity shops are struggling Oxfam confirmed it would close eight of its UK stores last year.",

        "content": "BRAINTREE, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts man will be arraigned Tuesday on multiple charges including assault with the intent to murder after six people, including four girls at a movie theater, were stabbed in separate attacks, officials said. Jared Ravizza, 26, of Chilmark, a town on Martha’s Vineyard, was arrested Saturday night after a police pursuit. Police said a person entered the AMC Braintree 10 south of Boston about 6 p.m. Saturday and went into one of the theaters without paying. The girls, ages 9 to 17, were inside the theater when the individual suddenly attacked them “without saying anything and without any warning” before running out, the Braintree Police Department said in a news release. The four suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to hospitals. Video footage showed the suspect’s vehicle and a license plate, and that information was broadcast to law enforcement, police said. A vehicle matching that description was later seen in Plymouth, about 27 miles (43 kilometers) south of Braintree. Police said it had left a McDonald’s restaurant, where a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were found stabbed. Both were taken to hospitals with injuries. Surveillance video appears to show Ravizza allegedly reaching through the drive-through window and stab the man with a large knife, according to the district attorney’s office. State police found the vehicle another 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) south, in Sandwich, and unsuccessfully attempted to pull it over. The vehicle later crashed. Ravizza, the driver, was taken into custody shortly afterward and was being treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Ravizza is being charged in the restaurant attack and is being investigated in the theater stabbings, officials said. Ravizza was arrested in April on Martha’s Vineyard and charged with assault and battery on a family or household member, as well as vandalism, after he allegedly attacked his father, according to court records, The Boston Globe reported. Ravizza’s father told officers that Ravizza “had just had a mental break and attacked him” inside his home, according to the police report. The newspaper reported that Ravizza was sent to Martha’s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but “did not meet their standards to be held,′′ the report said. The Edgartown case was sent to pretrial diversion. It was not immediately known if Ravizza has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. No phone listing could be found in Ravizza’s name.",

        "content": "SAN JOSE — San Jose police are investigating the city’s 15th homicide of this year, a man who was found dead from a gunshot wound in an apartment complex near a busy shopping mall. The killing occurred at about 2:45 p.m. on Sunday at an apartment in the 1000 block of Blossom River Way, a street that’s adjacent to the bustling Westfield Oakridge shopping center in South San Jose. “When officers arrived, they located an adult male victim who was neither conscious nor breathing and was suffering from at least one gunshot wound,” the San Jose Police Department stated in a prepared release. Police officers immediately began to administer life-saving measures to the victim and at the same time called emergency medical responders to the apartment. But the man died in the apartment, police said. The victim, described as an adult male, wasn’t immediately identified. “The suspect is unknown and fled the scene prior to police arrival,” the police department said. “The motive and circumstances surrounding the event are under investigation.” The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office will release the man’s name once he is identified and his next of kin are notified. Anyone with information is asked to email Detective Sgt. Julien Taylor at 4257@sanjoseca.gov or Detective Mike Harrington 4365@sanjoseca.gov, or call 408-277-5283.",

        "content": "INQUIRER PHOTO / GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE MANILA, Philippines — Analysts expect inflation in the Philippines to settle at an average of 3.7 percent this year, a slight improvement from the 3.8 percent consensus back in April. According to the Monetary Policy Report of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) released on Monday, forecasters surveyed said they expect “within-target inflation over the policy horizon, although settling at the upper end of the target range as uncertainty lingers.” “Upside risks continue to dominate due mainly to supply disruptions,” the BSP said. This is why the BSP is being “very careful” not to cut rates too early to avoid stoking inflation. READ: BSP unlikely to cut interest rates too soon this year, says think tank While average price growth is expected to return to the target band in 2024 after settling above that range in the last two years, BSP Senior Assistant Governor Iluminada Sicat said the central bank was treading lightly when it comes to the timing of easing. “Indeed, we are anticipating that higher inflation rate will be observed from May to July but thereafter, we are projecting that inflation will revert to the target range,” Sicat said at an economic forum on Monday. “We foresee inflation to be within the target, but on the upper end of the target range. That is precisely the reason why the BSP has been very careful not to bring down interest rates too early, or else we may not be able to address some of the upside risks that we are seeing in the future,” she added. The peso became more volatile last week after Governor Eli Remolona Jr. struck a less hawkish tone and floated the possibility of two 25-basis point rate cuts this year, with the first one possibly in August and ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s own easing. READ: BSP chief unfazed by U.S. Fed’s hawkish signals The central bank chief said he was not worried about such a move’s impact on the peso, which may come under pressure if local yields become less attractive to capital inflows while interest rates are still high elsewhere. This month, the BSP’s policy rate was kept at a 17-year high of 6.5 percent for the fifth straight meeting. READ: BSP keeps key rate at 17-year high as inflation risk remains Remolona assured the market that the BSP has “ample reserves” to defend the peso against speculative attacks. A weak currency—which breached the 58-per-dollar level last week—can fan inflation by making imports more expensive. For his part, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, who also joined the same economic briefing, said a rate cut in the third quarter was “very much possible.” “It all depends on the inflation outlook and I suppose what the Fed does. Those spreads should not be too different between the US and the Philippines or else you might have a flight to safety,” said Recto, who represents President Marcos’ Cabinet in the Monetary Board.

Surely, I don’t expect interest rates to go any higher. If not, there’s time they’ll start going down. Maybe 150 basis points in the next two years,” he added. INQ",

        "description": "Ninja Theory return with a sequel to 2017's Hellblade and this one contains deep adult themes around mental health combined with next-level visuals that truly elevate the Xbox Series X console",
        "content": "Hellblade 2 is one of the very best Xbox video games I’ve ever seen visually. But it falls a little short when it comes to gameplay. The epic blockbuster experience is just that - an experience, an interactive movie, rather than a full-on video game. It gave me that same feeling I had when I first laid eyes on The Order: 1886 on PS4 in 2015, a flawed but in many ways similarly visually outstanding game at its time. A sequel to 2017’s Senua’s Sacrifice, this picks up where the last left off with a mourning Senua struggling to deal with her inner demons while fighting some very real monsters in the actual world. She’s on her way to take the war to Northmen who have been raiding her homestead, slaying her folk. And our sword-bearing heroine is happy to lay death at their door for a change after suffering a heavy familial loss in the first game. Ninja Theory have turned everything up to 11 with this title and the visuals and audio are something extra special. It looks simply ‘real’ and there’s a very definite blur between what is a cut scene and what is actual gameplay. That in itself is something remarkable. You’re watching the story push on one second and then moments later you’re in the heart of a sword fight without really realising when the game swapped between rendered acting set-piece and full-on Unreal Engine gameplay. Spectacular. The audio is also incredibly realistic and atmosphere driven. It expects you to be playing this with earphones to really get the most out of the sonic spectrum that dials up both the intensity of Senua’s mental anguish and real-life warrior fury. It’s a difficult game, dealing with psychosis, various voices in your head battling for control, and aurally that works incredibly well with the use of headphones. Those whispers are seemingly everywhere. The game itself isn’t massively long and the gameplay somewhat one-trick-pony, a side-of-shoulder sword fight game with the odd puzzle thrown in. It’s the story that carries this, one of trauma and revenge, even a little healing. There’s little replayability in the title but what a ride it is when you are invested. If you are seeking an interactive, heavy themed, intense movie this is your game. If you’re after a hands-on player, maybe wait until it drops in price. Unless of course you have already got the Game Pass subscription, in which case it’s yours to try now.",

The post Tony Elumelu proposes special courts, name-shaming for energy thieves in Nigeria appeared first on Nairametrics.",
        "content": "Tony Elumelu, Chairman of the Board of Directors at Transcorp Group, has called on the Federal Government to establish special courts dedicated to prosecuting energy thieves in Nigeria. Elumelu made this appeal during the 18th Annual General Meeting of Transcorp Group held in Abuja on Monday, stressing the critical need for stringent measures to combat energy theft which has been severely detrimental to the country’s power sector. Emphasizing the fundamental importance of reliable power for national progress, he also recommended a public naming and shaming process for convicted energy thieves, regardless of their societal status, to serve as a deterrent. Related Stories ICAN labels Electricity Tariff increase burden on Nigerian citizens, calls for its suspension Power Sector achieved 5,000MW in May for the first time in 3 years – Adelabu He noted: “While I note that the provisions of the Electricity Act 2023 regarding criminal punishment for energy theft, I recommend the establishment of special courts with powers for summary proceedings to exclusively deal with cases of energy theft. There should also be a process of naming and shaming convicted energy thieves irrespective of their status in the society.” Addressing the financial challenges plaguing the sector, Elumelu highlighted the substantial debts owed to power generation companies (GENCOs) by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET). He said: “The power sector is designed to function in a cycle that ensures liquidity flow and payment assurance, which in turn sustains the reliable flow of electricity from power generation companies (“GENCOs”) to end users. The distortion in the liquidity flow in the sector is huge and typified by the debt owed to GENCOS by Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (“NBET”), currently in excess of N2 trillion. We are owed N250 Billion as at March 2024. “Technically, the GENCOS are subsidizing the sector by continuing to generate power despite the huge debts owed them. This, obviously, has impacted negatively on the ability of the GENCOS to pay their gas suppliers, thereby impacting the quantity and reliability of gas supply to the GENCOS, as well as investment in generation.” He urged the Federal Government to expedite actions to address these debts, emphasizing the need for liquidity to sustain reliable electricity generation. Additionally, Elumelu called for the full privatization of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and DISCOs. “Only a partial privatization of the power sector has been achieved since the privatization exercise commenced in 2012. As of today, TCN is owned 100% and DISCOs are owned 40% by the Federal Government, which also holds ownership interests in some GENCOs. “To enable the sector to be efficiently run by the private sector, I recommend that the Federal Government should come out with a clear timeline for full privatisation of the power sector, starting with the DISCOs and Transmission Company of Nigeria,” he suggested. Reflecting on the financial performance of Transcorp Group, Elumelu reported impressive growth. He noted that Transcorp’s gross earnings grew by 47% from N134 billion reported in 2022 to N197 billion in 2023, while profit before tax increased by 94% from N30 billion in 2022 to N59 billion in 2023 . Looking ahead, Elumelu noted that the plan for Transcorp Power Plc, a subsidiary of Transcorp Group, is to increase and maintain its combined available generation capacity from 710MW in 2023 to 908MW in 2024. He also mentioned the potential benefits from the bilateral power sale opportunities facilitated by the 2023 Electricity Act and plans to consolidate Transcorp’s presence in the regional electricity market through its membership in the West African Power Pool.",

        "content": "By Sarah NEGEDU Officials of the Federal Capital Territory Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, have cautioned FCT contingents against extravagance and other reckless lifestyle that can make them vulnerable during the Hajj exercise. The admonition is coming following the increasing reports of loss of properties by some pilgrims, especially the first timer. The officials who embarked on special enlightenment sessions aimed at exposing first timers to the best way to live in both Mecca and Medina, warned against activities capable of attracting severe penalty from the authorities of kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They regretted that despite repeated warning on the implications of extravagance, some of the pilgrims have recklessly spent their Basic Traveling Allowance, BTA. According to them, the pilgrims should exercise caution in all their financial transactions in view of the remaining days ahead. They also emphasized the importance of cleanliness and proper utilization of facilities provided at their various accommodations. Some of the pilgrims expressed appreciation for the guidance and pledged to use the knowledge acquired to better their living conditions in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. While pledging to be law abiding citizens in their host country, the pilgrims also promised to be good ambassador of their Nigeria throughout the period of their stay in the Holy land.",

        "content": "TL;DR: For people who don't like the look of a clunky desk with a PC and peripherals piled on top, this video is a must-watch. In fact, it's a must watch for anyone interested in clever craftsmanship and technology. The 27-minute video documents the process of building an invisible PC, along with the custom-made parts needed for the project. Picture a Venn diagram showing the relationship between people who care about home decor and people who own a gaming PC. The people in the middle circle, however large or small it may be, would be the group delighted with the latest video from YouTube channel DIY Perks . It shows how to build the Endgame Invisible PC – a desk with a hidden hatch that opens to reveal a widescreen OLED monitor with all the peripherals underneath and a PC cooled by a custom liquid cooling radiator. In short, it houses a high-performance PC that doesn't disrupt the room's design and aesthetic. It doesn't hurt that Matthew Perks, who runs the YouTube channel, is a skilled craftsman with IT credentials. He has made videos of other DIY projects, such as building a \"stealthy\" PlayStation 5 . The 27-minute video documents how to build the invisible PC and the materials necessary for the project, ranging from stripped-down components to custom-made parts that work together seamlessly. For instance, the monitor mounting process, which is very complex, involves several custom components to integrate the 45-inch OLED display within the desk. The desktop is made from aluminum sheets that are 3mm thick and are supported by an extruded aluminum frame. The 3mm sheets are flexible and only become rigid after the panels are attached. Custom hinges, pneumatic struts and tension springs combine to create a hinge mechanism for the monitor hatch. Throughout the video, Perks relies on a mix of special hinges, custom L-brackets, pneumatic struts, tension springs, and sliding rails to integrate the various joints and panels. Perks used a 45-inch Corsair Xeneon Flex ultrawide bendable OLED monitor, which he stripped down to its PCB and panel to minimize its size. The peripherals include a full-size keyboard, a mouse, a headset, and an external audio interface with the OLED monitor. The PC components include an Intel Core i9-13900K processor, Asrock Z790 PG-ITX/TB4 motherboard, and Zotac GeForce RTX 4090, all cooled with water blocks. Because ATX and SFX power supplies were too large to conceal, Perks used two HDPlex 500W GaN power supplies, dedicating one to the GPU. For storage, he installed twelve 4TB Crucial P3 M.2 drives in a Flashtor 12 Pro NAS, connected to the motherboard via an M.2 port and a 10Gbit M.2 network card.",

        "content": "As Nigerians celebrate the Children’s Day across the country, Nollywood actress, Toyin Abraham has opened up about her feelings as she revealed why the celebration brings her unhappiness. Taking to her Instagram page, Toyin Abraham wrote a lengthy note wishing all parents, who were once children, a Happy Children’s Day. She emphasized the need for better parenting in society, stating that recent observations and encounters compelled her to share this heartfelt message, as the quality of upbringing for today’s children requires serious attention. Toyin Abraham wrote, “I am not happy on this children’s day. “Happy Children’s Day to all children and to parents who were once children. As we celebrate this day, it is essential to acknowledge the need for better parenting. “Recent online encounters and observations compel me to share this heartfelt message with every parent and guardian. “The quality of children we are raising today needs serious attention. We now have kids who see respect and courtesy as burdens. “How do we feel reading some of the things the youth say to adults online under the guise of being “woke” or adopting a “no tolerance” attitude? “Many of us were not raised the way we are raising our kids today. We are raising them with kid gloves because we believe times have changed. However, different times are not an excuse to raise disrespectful children. “Despite our age and blessings, there are still things we would not tell our parents, not out of fear, but out of respect. This Children’s Day should remind us to do better as parents and raise children who are respectful and kind. “The recent tragic event at Ajayi Crowther University, where students killed a fellow student in the name of jungle justice, highlights the severe consequences of a lack of home training and moral values. Even if theft occurred, it does not justify taking another person’s life. “Respect, courtesy, responsibility, kindness, and hard work are values we were raised with. Although we may not have liked the discipline at the time, we are grateful to our parents today for instilling these values in us. We have a nation-building responsibility to raise the next generation of quality individuals. “Happy Children’s Day once again. May God keep our children for us, protect us from all forms of evil, and grant us a great celebration filled with wonderful experiences for the kids. “My name is Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi. I was once a little child, and I am now entrusted with the responsibility of raising quality children for a better society and nation.”",

But DUP interim leader Gavin Robinson said that discussions began on such a strategy last year “long before any election was called”, and hit out at “selfish party interests”. He said he had been “inundated” with calls for a non-party aligned candidate and is aware of people who are willing to take up the role. The UUP has already selected local councillor Diana Armstrong as its candidate in the constituency. There was phone contact between unionist leaders on Friday scoping the potential for running a non-party candidate to take on Sinn Fein. While the DUP and TUV support the strategy, Mr Beattie has made clear his opposition. “There were no conversations around a unity candidate and that remained the case until Friday 24th May when a proposed unity candidate was put forward by phone call,” he said. “This was without any detail on how they would breach the differences between the parties. “Would this proposed unity candidate support the DUP and UUP position of entering the Executive? If they did, the TUV wouldn’t support. “Would they promote the ‘Safeguarding the Union’ document as a good deal? If they did, the UUP wouldn’t support. “Would they refer to the DUP as (Northern Ireland) Protocol implementors? If they did, the DUP wouldn’t support. “The reality being any ‘unity’ candidate would be undermined with just a basic level of scrutiny. They would not be able to deliver a unified message. “In 2019 the Ulster Unionist Party came within 57 votes of taking the seat and returning a pro-union MP. “Announcing our candidate early, ensuring she is known and is making headway in delivering a pro-Union message gives many unionists the opportunity to affect change in FST. “We have not asked any party to stand aside in FST, they have the right to stand if they wish. “However, Diana Armstrong is the only realistic opportunity for a unionist to win in that constituency.” Mr Robinson said in a statement: “The DUP has not contested this Westminster seat since 2005 despite being the largest party in the constituency. “Last week, when I became aware of people offering to run as a non-party candidate, I reached out to the UUP and TUV leaders to encourage them to follow our example and withdraw in favour of an agreed candidate. “Contrary to the UUP statement, the DUP engaged in discussions about an agreed unionist candidate in Fermanagh & South Tyrone last year, long before any election was called. “Indeed, we even challenged the UUP leadership about publicly announcing a candidate before those talks had concluded. “The people of Fermanagh & South Tyrone should know who was interested in returning a pro-Union voice to Westminster and those advancing selfish party interests, especially if there is a hung Parliament and Fermanagh & South Tyrone are once again left voiceless.”",

With all my affection, Anthony Martial.\" Anthony Martial scored a memorable goal vs Liverpool on his Man United debut ( Image: Getty Images) Who do you think Man United should sign this summer? Share your suggestions below Martial, a 30-time French international, joined the Red Devils in 2015 as a teenager from Monaco. The deal was worth an initial £36m, potentially rising as high as £57.6m. The forward enjoyed a bright start to life at Old Trafford. He scored on his debut with a brilliant solo goal against Liverpool - one of 17 in all competitions that season. He remained a key player for the next few campaigns with his 23 goals in the 2019/20 campaign a career-best. However, inconsistency and injuries blighted his final few years with the club. He joined Spanish side Sevilla on-loan for the second-half of the 2021/22 campaign. Martial made just 19 appearances this season under Erik ten Hag , scoring twice. He has been linked with a move to Inter Milan . Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "content": "Dalawa ang nasawi, at hindi bababa sa 10 katao ang sugatan sa karambola ng isang boom truck, isang bongo truck, at isang motorsiklo sa Carmen, Davao del Norte. Sa ulat ni Kent Abrigana sa GMA Regional TV One Mindanao nitong Lunes, sinabing nangyari ang trahediya sa national highway sa nasabing bayan noong May 25. Sa video, makikita ang tindi ng pinsalang tinamo ng bongo truck na parang niyuping lata. Ayon sa pulisya, patungong Tagum City ang boom truck na may sakay na 12 pasahero nang masabugan umano ito ng gulong at napunta sa linya ng kasalubong na bongo truck. Nakasunod naman sa likod ng bongo truck ang motorsiklo na sinasakyan magka-live in na sugatan din sa insidente. “Nasiraan kasi ng gulong. Allegedly, pumutok yung gulong ng boom truck, yung elf boom truck tapos nag-swerve siya sa kabilang lane. Pag-swerve niya sa kabilang lane, nagkataon naman na padating yung bongo (truck) kaya nagkabanggaan sila,” ayon kay Carmen Municipal Police Station Traffic Investigator, Senior Master Sergeant Joconor Coronel. Nasawi ang parehong driver ng boom at bongo trucks. Dinala naman sa pagumutan ang nasa 15 sugatan. “Patay pareho ang driver ng boom truck at driver ng bongo. Dalawa ang patay and ang sugatan is 15 kasi may dalawa pa na nadamay sa pangyayari yung dalawang nag-motorsiklo na mag-live-in partner,” ayon pa kay Coronel. Hindi pa umano nagkakausap ang mga kaanak ng nasawi sa aksidente, at ang mga nasugatan. -- FRJ, GMA Integrated News",

        "description": "In W̱SÁNEĆ communities and beyond, it’s the women who hold everything together, says Matriarch Tracy Underwood.",
        "content": "In W̱SÁNEĆ communities and beyond, it’s the women who hold everything together, says Matriarch Tracy Underwood. “The SENĆOŦEN word for women is SȽÁNI,” she said. “And if you look it up in our SENĆOŦEN dictionary, you’ll see the second definition of the word is ‘a knitting stitch.’ And that brings a whole new perspective to women’s place in the fabric of society.” Underwood is the president of the non-profit XAXE TEṈEW̱ Sacred Land Society (XTSLS), which recently launched the Rematriate Stewardship project. The project is meant to bring housing and land to Saltwater Salish women and their families on “Vancouver Island” so they can better steward their unceded homelands. The Rematriate Stewardship project kicked off its first fundraising campaign at ȽÁU, WELṈEW̱ Tribal School in W̱JOȽEȽP (“Tsartlip”) on Red Dress Day earlier this month with the goal of raising $400,000 by August 5. The group ultimately wants to provide a 20 per cent downpayment on an acreage on southern “Vancouver Island” as a tangible way to restore the sacred relationship between Matriarchs and their lands and their waters. The site itself has not been decided yet but they are currently working with a realtor to secure something once the down payment is in place. The W̱SÁNEĆ Nation itself has re-established ownership of unceded sites — ȾIKEL and SISȻENEM — in recent years after creating its own land trust. XTSLS is the latest organization working to fund the return of Saltwater Salish lands, which were never given up by their original owners. The timing of the fundraiser launch on the same day as Red Dress Day was intentional, said Rematriate Stewardship project lead Tiffany Joseph. “It was because of the murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls epidemic that I wanted to start doing some work with our people to get land back,” she said. “Land is critical for us to begin to heal, practice our culture, and access foods and medicines. It’s time everyone understood the impact of missing and murdered Indigenous relatives and worked together to provide safe space for us.” According to the Assembly of First Nations, 56 per cent of all Indigenous women have suffered from physical assault, while 46 per cent have been sexually assaulted. The 2019 National Inquiry into MMIWG reported that Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ people “experience disproportionately high rates of poverty and insurmountable barriers to obtaining secure housing, food, education, employment, transportation, and other basic needs,” which decreases their safety and increases the levels of violence they face. “I constantly say we are in an ongoing genocide that has never stopped,” said Georgina Underwood, who sits on the Board of XTSLS and is a great-grandmother of 14. “The Rematriate Stewardship project ensures women have voices — that women will rise up to speak on their own behalf, and find their identity.” The national inquiry concluded that the gendered violence “amounts to a race-based genocide of Indigenous Peoples, including First Nations, Inuit and Métis, which especially targets women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.” In response, the inquiry laid out a series of actions for all governments to take, emphasizing the need for “safe, permanent, and meaningful access for Indigenous women, girls and Two Spirit/LGBTQ+ people to their cultures and languages in order to restore, reclaim and revitalize cultures and identity.” The inquiry also emphasized the need for Indigenous women to have safe housing, clean drinking water, and adequate food. Tracy Underwood said the genocide Indigenous women experience stems from the values of settler society in “Canada,” which have been entrenched through policies such as the Indian Act. “It’s the way Canada devalues dark-skinned women that is the root of the issue. And that goes back to how the Indian Act disadvantaged us,” she said. “So to me, empowering our young women to use their voices and know their value is important because it’s preparing them not to be a part of the murdered and missing. And to get there, we need to provide safe places for them.” “The band council system, the reserve system, they’re all still imposed through the Indian Act,” she added. “And immediately, there are inherent harms and difficulties layered in it.” The Indian Act, created by the federal government in 1876, has also been a central tool used to deny women the right to inherit their ancestral lands. Under the reserve system, only widows could “possess” land, and even then a widow “could not inherit her husband’s personal property upon his death — everything, including the family house, legally went to his children,” according to Indigenous Foundations. In 1884, government agents modified the Act slightly to allow men to will their estate to their wives, but Indian agents could still deny Indigenous women this inheritance if they determined them to lack “good moral character.” This rule was in place until 1951. The national inquiry recognized the violence the Indian Act perpetuates against Indigenous women and called on all governments to “eliminate discriminatory provisions from the Indian Act.” Georgina Underwood said the Indian Act and other colonial structures “really interfere with families and communities,” and the Rematriate Stewardship project is an important step in helping Saltwater Salish women to push back against those forces, connect with their ancestral inheritance, and uphold their responsibilities to land. “One of our words in SENĆOŦEN is ĆELÁṈEN, which refers to ancestral inheritance in relation to our territories,” she said. “ĆELÁṈEN is something that is given to each of the families, passed down by their ancestors, an ancestral heritage that connects them to the land, to the sea, and to their family. And I think that’s what we are a big part of restoring.” “In my heart, right now as I’m speaking, I see our ancestors in the clouds,” Georgina added. “They’re watching us, waiting for this movement to happen.”",
