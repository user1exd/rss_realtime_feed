Memorial Day tends to mark the unofficial start of summer for many Americans, though the season really begins with the Summer Solstice in mid-June. The annual holiday - which is celebrated on the last Monday of May - is a federal holiday in the United States for mourning the U.S. military personnel who have died while serving in the United States armed forces. Since the Revolutionary War ended, 646,596 American troops have died in battle and more than 539,000 died from other, non-combat related causes. It was formerly observed on May 30 from 1868 to 1970. Flag etiquette on Memorial Day is unique, according to the Farmers Almanac . At sunrise, flags are to be raised to full staff briskly, then lowered to half staff position, where they will remain until noon. See guidelines for flying the American Flag. Traditionally, on Memorial Day (U.S.), volunteers often place small American flags on each grave site at national cemeteries. A national moment of remembrance takes place at 3:00 p.m. local time. Consider visiting a local cemetery to place flags; many organizations would be grateful for volunteers. Contact your local American Legion post, Daughters of the American Revolution, or Boy or Girl Scouts troops. The custom of honoring ancestors by cleaning cemeteries and decorating graves is an ancient and worldwide tradition. In early rural America, it was usually performed in summer and was an occasion for family reunions and picnics. The ritual of visiting family graves and memorials was never a morbid tradition. Rather, it was an annual act of remembrance, as well as a chance to clean and decorate family memorials. Often, families would picnic as well; cemeteries were often the only open green spaces in crowded cities. Memorial Day was originally known as Decoration Day, starting with the American Civil War. It's believed that the tradition of honoring the dead was inspired by the way Southern states decorated the graves of both Confederate and Union soldiers with flowers, wreaths, and flags.

On May 5, 1866, Waterloo, New York, hosted its own community-wide event that, in 1966, led to President Lyndon Johnson declaring the town as the birthplace of Decoration Day. Meanwhile, on May 5, 1868, inspired by the suggestion of veteran, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (a fraternal organization of Union Civil War veterans), issued General Order No. 11, designating the 30th of May as an annual day of remembrance. The idea caught on. U.S. President Joe Biden honored fallen soldiers during the 156th observance of Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery outside the nation's capital on Monday. Biden placed a wreath of flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in a solemn ceremony, where he was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'We gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives for this nation,' Biden said afterward at the cemetery's amphitheater. Earlier in the day, Biden hosted a White House breakfast in honor of Memorial Day that included administration officials, military leadership, veterans and so-called Gold Star family members, referring to those who have lost an immediate relative in military action. US President Joe Biden speaks at the 156th National Memorial Day observance at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, May 27, 2024 'We gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives for this nation,' Biden said afterward at the cemetery's amphitheater Earlier in the day, Biden hosted a White House breakfast in honor of Memorial Day that included administration officials, military leadership, veterans and so-called Gold Star family members, referring to those who have lost an immediate relative in military action The Memorial Day ceremony is the latest in a string of events where Biden has focused on active and retired military personnel, including delivering the commencement speech on Saturday at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York . Next week, the president will travel to Normandy, France, to participate in ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion . He is expected to give a major speech about the heroism of Allied forces in World War Two and the continuing threats to democracy today. Thursday will mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Biden's son Beau, who served in Iraq as part of Delaware's National Guard. Beau died from glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer that his father believes was possibly a consequence of exposure to military burn pits in Iraq. 'This week marks nine years since I lost my son, Beau,' Biden said. 'Our losses are not the same. He didn't perish on the battlefield. He was a cancer victim. 'The pain of his loss is with me every day ... so is the pride in his service,' the president said. On Memorial Day, each grave site at Arlington will have a small American flag carefully positioned exactly one boot ́s length away from the headstone. The flags were placed by 1,500 soldiers from the Army ́s 3rd Infantry Regiment, better known as The Old Guard. The regiment has carried out the tradition, known as 'Flags In,' just before Memorial Day every year since 1948, when it was designated as the Army ́s official ceremonial unit.

The 45-year-old novelist told an audience at the Hay Literature Festival: 'There are some politicians who, I won't name names, won't come on the podcast because it has the word \"fail\" in the title and they don't want to be seized upon. 'So if I really thought about it I might not have branded it that way. 'But I'm not fetishising the pursuit of failure. I'm simply saying that failure is something that happens to us all and it connects us which is really liberating.' Politicians who have braved the podcast have discussed their failures in Whitehall, their mental health problems and personal relationships. Elizabeth Day (pictured, in May at The Podcast Show in London) has revealed politicians won't be guests on her award-winning podcast How to Fail because they don't want to be associated with the word 'fail' Ed Milliband appeared on Ms Day's podcast in 2021 and discussed his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failure to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive In 2019, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told Ms Day about her failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends Ed Milliband appeared on Ms Day's podcast in 2021 and discussed his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failure to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive. Read More Clive Myrie reveals how he wouldn't report on the Notting Hill Carnival as he refused to be pigeonholed by the BBC In 2019, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told Ms Day about her failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends. She talked about the failure in contraception that resulted in her eldest son, her failure to get on the Home Office Fast Track scheme and, in an extremely moving admission, her self-perceived failure to fix her brother's drug addiction. The same year, the former Conservative politician Chris Patten went on the show to discuss losing his seat in the 1992 election and his time as Chairman of the BBC where he presided over the Jimmy Saville scandal. The Magpid author shared that her dream guests for the podcast were Sienna Miller, Michelle Obama, Beyonce and Taylor Swift - though the Midnights singer no longer does interviews. Speaking about her latest non-fiction project, Friendaholic, which shot to Number One on the Sunday Times Bestseller list, she encouraged people to have a wedding ceremony with their friends before getting married to their partner. She said: 'An audience member in Bath said that before she got married to her husband, she got married to her best friend because she thought that relationship was as important to her. 'I completely and utterly agree. - they'd gone into the woods and done a wedding ceremony and I thought that was genius. 'I think people should think about having platonic wedding ceremonies that I put it as an extra chapter in the paperback version of my book.' The Magpid author shared that one of her dream guests for the podcast was Beyonce The former Sunday Telegraph journalist also revealed she was set up on a date with fellow journalist and author of Empireland, Sathnam Sanghera Ms Day got divorced from her first husband the BBC News Editorial director, Kamal Ahmed, who she divorced at 36 after four years of marriage in 2014 and is now married to CEO Justin Basini. The former Sunday Telegraph journalist also revealed she was set up on a date with fellow journalist and author of Empireland, Sathnam Sanghera. She said: 'We quickly realised we worked way better as friends and he's been a very close friend of mine ever since.'

OceanGate's Titan submersible disappeared on June 18, 2023 , after it plunged into the sea to explore the wreck of the Titanic - killing all five people on board, including the company's CEO, Stockton Rush. The cost of the expedition was $250,000. The company was slammed for flouting warnings of the risks and offering cut-price tickets to some of those on the trip. But despite the catastrophic implosion, rich thrill-seekers are still spending thousands on similar expeditions. One of the companies still operating deep sea dives, including an expedition back to the Titanic wreck, is Triton. Its operators insist their submersible is safer than Titan, which was criticized for having no official safety certification. America's super-wealthy are still risking their lives on deep sea adventures even after the catastrophic implosion of OceanGate 's Titan last year, that killed all on board (Pictured: next-generation Triton submersible, the Triton 660/9 AVA, called the Scenic Neptune II) They refused to share the per-person cost for a seat on their sub, or tell DailyMail.com when they plan to plunge to the depths of the Atlantic to reach the Titanic wreck. Triton's subs have been used in the past for the 'world's deepest dive' to Australia's Great Barrier Reef in July 2023 with British biologist Sir David Attenborough . This year, Triton subs were used for expeditions to the Mariana Trench, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Arctic Ocean. Influential individuals have recognized how the tragic implosion could impact the investment in deep ocean research, said Sophie Bentham-Wood, Executive Director of Global Marketing and Sales Strategies for the leading submarine company Triton. 'Some have already approached us to discuss the build of deep-diving submersibles purely to counteract any negative impact those events could have had and maintain momentum in the ocean space,' Bentham-Wood told Dailymail.com. Ohio real-estate investor and businessman, Larry Connor, is one of them. He is planning to be on the first sub to dive back to the titanic wreckage since the Titan imploded last June. Ohio real-estate investor and businessman, Larry Connor (left) says he is signed up for an expedition to the Titanic later this year OceanGate 's Titan submersible (pictured) disappeared on June 18, 2023, after it plunged into the ocean to explore the wreck of the Titanic. The cost of the trip was $250,000 The sub diver is determined to prove submersing down 12,500 feet to the 112-year-old titanic wreckage is perfectly safe - and he has the money to do so. Connor is set on taking a two-person submersible down to titanic wreck depths to show people worldwide that 'while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way,' he told the Wall Street Journal. He is planning the dive with Patrick Lahey, President and co-founder of Triton Submarines, one of the leading submersible companies in the world. The two have worked together previously diving to some of the ocean's deepest depths. Triton clients have already made various dives this year, from exploring the Mariana Trench, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Arctic Ocean. Despite OceanGate's catastrophic implosion last June, the pair aims to prove to the world that such an expedition can be carried out safely. Connor, who has previously explored the Mariana Trench, the deepest oceanic trench on Earth, said they plan to undertake the journey in a two-person vessel called the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer, named '4000' for the depth in meters it can reach. It's unclear when the trip will take place or how much it will cost.

'If there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,' she told Dailymail.com (Pictured: Project Hercules, a collab between Triton Submarines and Espen Øino International, a luxury sub) Historically, submersibles have successfully dived deeper than the Titanic for decades (Pictured: The world's first and only submersible certified 'Depth: Unlimited') The TRITON 660 AVA series employs our revolutionary Advanced Versatile Acrylics to create the world's first submersibles with a free-form acrylic pressure hull (Pictured: TRITON 660 AVA) The world’s deepest dive to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was achieved by Sir David Attenborough in a Triton submersible Lahey was among many industry figures who criticized OceanGate before and after the disaster, accusing it of questionable safety standards. After the implosion, he described Rush's recruitment tactics use to convincing people to get on board as 'quite predatory' and emphasized that certified submersibles are generally safe. Lahey emphasized that this tragedy wasn't reflecting of the industry as a whole. 'In that sense, OceanGate didn't make the industry look bad,' McCallum told the WSJ. 'It made us look good.' Lahey said that after the implosion, Connor called him saying, 'You know, what we need to do is build a sub that can dive to [Titanic-level depths] repeatedly and safely and demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that, and that Titan was a contraption.' With respect to the lives lost last June, Bentham-Wood said the 'continued exploration of the deep ocean in manned submersibles is essential to understanding the ocean environment, which is a key component of our future on this planet.' 'If there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,' she told Dailymail.com 'Plus everyone realizes the deep ocean is no place for compromise – therefore, the need for programs to solely employ submersibles with full classification certification in their operations is not an option, but a prerequisite.' Before Titan, the only major sub disaster included the USS Thresher's 1963 implosion, killing 129 crew members Dakar - World's Record Deep Sea Dive (1954) Historically, submersibles have successfully dived deeper than the Titanic for decades. When the wreck of the Titanic was first first discovered in 1985, submersibles had already been diving to greater depths for several decades. The first to do so was the FNRS-3 bathyscaphe in 1954, setting a record by reaching 4,050 meters. In 1960, the Trieste descended 10,916 meters in the Mariana Trench. Since then, at least 16 submersibles have repeatedly taken people deeper than the Titanic over the past 69 years. The US submersible Alvin made the first dives to investigate the Titanic in July 1986, followed by the French submersible Nautile in 1987, which returned in 1993 and dived to the wreck 47 times in total. Today, ten submersibles in service can reach Titanic depths and beyond. According to the Marine Technology Society's submarine group, OceanGate was the only company operating a submersible capable of reaching Titanic-wreck depths that was not certified, raising industry concerns. 'There are only 10 submarines in the world that can go 4,000m or deeper and all of them are certified except the OceanGate,' Will Kohnen, chair of the Marine Technology Society's submarine group told CBC News in June 2023. OceanGate was conducting deep-ocean expeditions since 2009, with over 200 successful dives using its three submersibles in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. The Titan was designed to reach deeper depths of over 13,000 feet, according to the company. Before Titan, the only major sub disaster included the USS Thresher's 1963 implosion, killing 129 crew members. British explorer Hamish Harding was among those killed in the 'catastrophic implosion' French Navy veteran PH Nargeolet (left) was in the sub along with Stockton Rush (right), CEO of the OceanGate Expedition But after the implosion, many in the industry called for extra caution around any future trips to the titanic wreckage. Other have called for greater oversight of the submersible industry as a whole. Last year, titanic expert Tim Maltin said trips to the wreckage should be paused until more is discovered about what occurred to the Titan sub. 'We need to make sure that any vessels that go down there carrying fee-paying passengers...[are] certified to greater depths than they will be put through,' said Maltin. Caroline Heaven, a member of the British Titanic Society, said the dangers outweigh any benefits. 'I see no point in even considering the perilous journey to the wreck,' she told the BBC . 'The dangers involved are too great, the conditions are too cramped, and visibility is limited when the wreck is reached. Debris from the Titan submersible recovered from the ocean floor near the wreck of the Titanic, is unloaded from a ship 'Out of the entire population of submersibles, 90 to 95 per cent are certified. There's a five to 10 per cent fringe, so in that aspect they are an outlier, but sure, in the deep submersibles they really stand out.'

On June 18, the OceanGate's Titan was launched around 8am in the Atlantic Ocean above the site of the Titanic shipwreck. The five passengers, tourists Hamish Harding , 58, Shahzada Dawood , 48, and his son Sulaiman Dawood, 19, French Navy pilot Paul-Henry (PH) Nargeolet and OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, started to descend as Rush piloted the vessel. At 9:45am, the ship lost contact with its mothership, the Polar Prince, during a descent to the wreck of the Titanic 12,500 feet beneath the surface. Days later, its debris was recovered. It was said to have suffered a 'catastrophic implosion'. All on board died on the submersible. The US Coast Guard confirmed the victims' deaths four days later and an investigation into the implosion is ongoing . Because OceanGate's titan completely imploded, researchers will likely never determine the exact location of the flaw that caused the tragic event.

'You are an enabler, President Biden,' she told a crowd at the Peoples' Conference for Palestine . 'Each year, our country, and I say our country because it is our country, sends billions of dollars to maintain an apartheid government and support the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,' said Tlaib. 'It is disgraceful that the Biden administration and my colleagues in Congress continue to smear them for protesting to save lives, no matter faith or ethnicity,' she said, referring to the pro-Gaza protesters that have popped up at universities and elsewhere throughout the country.' Tlaib was behind a group of Arab activists who convinced Michigan Democrats to vote 'uncommitted' in the state's primary to protest the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Palestine war. 'You are an enabler, President Biden,' she told a crowd at the Peoples' Conference for Palestine Tlaib also tore into Biden for saying Israel is not committing 'genocide' as its defense forces push further into the southern city of Rafah. It comes as Hamas fired rockets from Rafah toward Tel Aviv for the first time in four months, signaling the militant group is still capable of threatening Israel. All of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. 'The International Court of Justice just ruled that the Israeli government must stop its invasion of Rafah, but President Biden says what's happening [in Gaza] is not a genocide,' the 'Squad' member said. 'Where's your red line, President Biden?' 'Attacking the authority of the International Criminal Court and interfering in the legal process is nothing more, nothing more than an attempt to prevent the genocidal maniac Netanyahu and his senior Israeli officials from being held accountable for those crimes against humanity.' 'You are an enabler,' Tlaib said to Biden. 'But we're not going to forget in November, are we?' Read More BREAKING NEWS Israeli troops exchange fire with Egyptian soldiers near Rafah, killing one: IDF says incident 'under investigation' Tlaib and a handful of her progressive colleagues refused to clap during Biden's March State of the Union address, instead holding up signs that said 'stop sending bombs.' At least 45 people were killed, including women and children, in an Israeli airstrike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah over the weekend, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Israel, meanwhile, said it killed two 'senior Hamas terrorists' there and is investigating the circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area.' Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said the rockets fired from Rafah proved 'the IDF must operate in every place Hamas still operates from, and, as such, the IDF will continue to operate wherever necessary.' Close to 36,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict since October 7, when Hamas killed some 1,160 Israelis and kidnapped over 200 . Biden has in recent months grown more vocal about Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Gaza conflict but staunchly defended the U.S. ally after ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week announced he is seeking arrest warrants for the prime minister and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, in addition to Hamas' Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, political chief Ismail Haniyah, and as Mohammed Deif, who is behind its armed wing. 'We don't recognize their jurisdiction — the ICC — the way it's being exercised,' Biden told reporters last week during a press conference with Kenyan President William Ruto. 'It's that simple. We don't think there's an equivalence between what Israel did and what Hamas did.' Biden has in recent months grown more vocal about Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Gaza conflict but staunchly defended the U.S. ally after ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week announced he is seeking arrest warrants for the prime minister and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Pro-Palestine demonstrators march holding a banner expressing their opinion in the neighborhood of Astoria, Queens, N.Y., in mid-May 'Contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what's happening is not genocide,' Biden had said earlier. 'We reject that. And we'll always stand with Israel and its — in the threats against its security.' In an olive branch to progressives and Arab-American voters, Biden publicly touted a pause on the shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel on May 8 in protest of the IDF pushing into Rafah, where some 1.4 million Palestinians took shelter as many of their homes in the northern part of Gaza had been razed. But shortly after that the Biden administration announced a $1 billion arms deal with Israel - and the U.S. will continue to supply Israel with weapons even as they push into Rafah. That package includes $700m in tank ammunition, $500m in tactical vehicles and $60m in mortar rounds.

        "content": "Crisco inferno? A Connecticut woman is lucky to be alive after a half-baked attempt to extinguish a grease fire literally blew up in her face, as seen in this video setting the internet ablaze. “This is exactly what you SHOULD NOT DO,” warned LaTeasha Brost in the caption to the clip, which boasts over 6.2 million views on TikTok. In the viral footage, the TikToker is seen cooking in her kitchen, when all of a sudden, a fire erupts in the pan. “What do I do?” cries the petrified Brost, who decides to try and douse the blaze with water. Unfortunately, this backfires horribly, creating a giant fireball. Terrified, Brost flees to the living room and chucks the flaming pot, which nearly hits her dog, before she trips and falls in the living room. Thankfully, the fire appeared to go out on its own. Why did the water paradoxically act as an accelerant? As Brost pointed out, the inferno was an oil-based blaze, Yahoo News reported. When water is combined with grease, it sinks beneath the less-dense oil, pushing the grease to the surface. This water then rapidly heats and vaporizes, propelling the flaming top layer of oil into the air and creating a flaming greaseball. Thankfully, Brost said there was no “apartment damage” and that she only sustained second-degree burns in the freak accident. She said she hopes that sharing the video will help prevent others from making the “same mistake.” “It’s okay if you laugh,” she added. “This is your sign to get a fire extinguisher or fire blanket in your kitchen ... We didn’t know what to do and although we are very embarrassed, we hope people can learn from this so they don’t make the same mistake as we did.” It’s okay if you laugh...there was no apartment damage and luckily only recieved 2nd degree burns. This is exactly what you SHOULD NOT DO! Sharing this because we didn’t know what to do and although we are very embarrassed, we hope people can learn from this so they don’t make the same mistake as we did. Social media had a field day with the flaming fiasco. “The accidental stop drop and roll is insane,” exclaimed one bemused viewer, while another wrote, “not you almost throwing the fire ON your dog.” Brost clarified in the comments that she chucked the pan because it was burning her skin. “The important thing is that you didn’t panic,” snarked one TikTok wit. “Friendly reminder not to add water to a grease fire,” advised one social media Samaritan. In the event of a grease fire, people are advised to turn off the stove and cover the pot with a non-glass lid or other pot to starve the flames of oxygen, ABC 27 reported. Failing that, one should try and put it out with an extinguisher or call 911 if the fire’s raging out of control.",

        "description": "Aston Villa are playing Champions League football in the new season having finished fourth - they're looking to aim in one direction under Unai Emery",
        "content": "Aston Villa are a short price to repeat their top four achievement of the recently ended season, when they tackle the Premier League again next term. Villa overcame the odds, which were against them, in securing Champions League football for the forthcoming campaign ahead of the likes of Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and last season's top four occupants Newcastle United. Next year, they'll have to try and repeat the feat while juggling their Champions League campaign , which will entail a minimum of eight matches throughout the autumn and winter in the new 36-team league table format. After Southampton's victory over Leeds United in the Championship play-off final on Sunday, thanks to Adam Armstrong's first-half winner, Villa now know the confirmed line up of opponents who they'll face over the course of the Premier League campaign next season. After this previous term's achievements, Villa are understandably nearer the top of the list with the various bookmakers' odds than towards the bottom. READ: Emery has already paid Barkley a compliment ahead of Villa transfer READ: Villa squad value skyrockets before Barkley transfer and Champions League Premier League title odds: Manchester City 10/11, Arsenal 9/4, Liverpool 8/1, Chelsea 20/1, Manchester United 25/1, Newcastle United 25/1, Tottenham Hotspur 33/1, Aston Villa 50/1, BAR 150/1 Villa are a good bit shorter a price to match this past season's achievements; a top four finish, when you consider the strength and likely improvements of those within the 'Big Six' who comparably underachieved this term, would be another fine effort - particularly, as mentioned, with Villa set to fight amongst the elite both domestically and in Europe this coming year. Top four finish odds: Manchester City 1/10, Arsenal 1/4, Liverpool 8/15, Chelsea 11/8, Newcastle United 7/4, Manchester United 2/1, Tottenham Hotspur 2/1, Aston Villa 3/1, BAR 12/1 (Odds: Bet 365) Where will Villa finish next season?

Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. Speaking after the match, Nadal said: 'For me it is difficult to say what is going on in the future. It is a big percentage that I will not be back playing here, but I cannot say 100 per cent. 'The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it's special to feel the love in the place I love the most. 'I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. But it's something I don't feel yet.' Rafael Nadal refuses to rule out a French Open return after first round defeat on Monday Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. Many believe that this was Nadal's last appearance at the tournament he has won 14 times Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.

        "content": "The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Monday, dismissed the petition filed by Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), challenging the election victory of Gov. Usman Ododo in the Nov. 11, 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel, chaired by Justice Ado Birnin–Kudu, dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioners; PRP and its governorship candidate, Abdullahi Bayawo, failed to prove the allegations of non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022 during the poll. The tribunal, in a unanimous judgment, held that the petitioners’ evidence that Forms EC8B and EC8D (the ward result sheets and the state result sheets) tendered were not prepared for the Nov. 11, 2023 poll, were bereft of substance. The panel said that the testimonies of the petitioners’ witnesses were hearsay and that failure to call polling agents from the alleged affected polling units to give their evidence was fatal to the case of the petitioners. Besides, it held that some of the evidence of the witnesses had no probative value. “The petition lacks merit and it is accordingly dismissed,” Justice Birnin–Kudu-led tribunal declared. It held that the election that produced Ododo of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as governor of Kogi complied substantially with the provisions of the Electoral Act . Earlier, the tribunal dismissed the petition filed by Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its governorship candidate, Murtala Ajaka, against Gov. Ododo. The tribunal held that the petitioners also failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission. It would be recalled that the tribunal had, on Feb. 20, struck out the petition filed by the Action Peoples Party (APP) against the election victory of Ododo in the Nov. 11 governorship poll in the state. The panel struck out the petition following its withdrawal by counsel for APP, Daniel Edeachi. The application, seeking the withdrawal of the petition was not opposed by lawyer to Gov. Ododo, Ibrahim Muhammed, SAN; counsel to APC, DC Denwigwe, SAN, and that of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Kanu Agabi, SAN. The APP had, in the petition number: EPR/KG/GOV/02/2023 filed on Dec. 1, 2023, before the tribunal, challenged the declaration of Ododo as the validly elected governor of Kogi in the Nov. 11, 2023 governorship poll conducted by INEC. The party had sued Ododo, APC and INEC as 1st to 3rd respondents respectively. However, in its motion on notice dated and filed on Feb. 15, the party sought two orders, including an order granting leave to the petitioner/applicant to withdraw the Petition No: EPT/KG/GOV/01/2023 and an order striking out or dismissing the petition, having been withdrawn by the petitioner. Giving eight-ground of argument, APP said though it filed the petition to challenge Ododo’s victory, the party said upon the re-evaluation of the grounds and facts of the petition, it “is not reasonably convinced about the sustainability of the grounds of the petition as presently constituted before this honourable tribunal. According to the party, the withdrawal of the petition is based on the perceived unsustainability of the grounds of the petition and to avoid overburdening this honourable tribunal with numerous petitions.(NAN)",

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as \"vital\" in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has \"its own large reserves of uranium.\" Putin, in turn, vowed to \"do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan's (nuclear energy) market.\" If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia's influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China, where he expressed appreciation for China's proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin's ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",

        "content": "Shri Apurva Chandra, Union Health Secretary addressed the Committee A of the World Health Assembly (WHA), in Geneva today. WHA comprises of sessions in three main committees, which are Plenary, Committee A and Committee B. Committee A will be chaired by India and facilitate discussion on various programmatic topics covering Universal Health Coverage, Public Health Emergency preparedness and response, antimicrobial resistance, climate change, sustainable financing for WHO etc. The Union Health Secretary started his address by highlighting the alignment of the World Health Assembly’s theme this year – “All for Health, Health for All”, with the core values and the ethos of India, that is “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” which means “the world is one family”. He said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, India not only managed the crises within the country but also supplied medicines and health related products across the world embodying the spirit of “One World, One family”. “This philosophy guides our efforts to promote well-being for all, facilitate Universal Healthcare Coverage and achieve health-related Sustainable Development Goals”, he stated. Shri Apurva Chandra stated that the traditional public health approach of focusing on community interventions such as information and awareness as well as preventive measures hold the key to better health outcomes. He informed that India has established Health & Wellness Centres to not only address health issues at the community level but to also focus on educating communities towards better health seeking behaviour. “At this critical juncture, when all countries are working towards our collective Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring health services for all so that no one gets left behind, India has been taking the lead in advocating for digital health innovations as key to the critical transformative process required to help us achieve our goals”, he further stated.",

        "content": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday it is \"obscene\" that small island states, which are on the front line of climate change, should pay for the fossil fuel industry's greed and competition between major economies. \"Your unique geography puts you at the mercy of climate chaos, rising sea levels and land degradation,\" Guterres said at the opening of the fourth Small Island Developing States (SIDS) summit in the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda. \"Climate change is an existential crisis for the entire human family, but SIDS are on the front lines,\" he told the conference of 39 states, whose populations number roughly 65 million people. SIDS are extremely vulnerable to climate change but not rich enough to stop it on their own. One key hope from the summit is increased climate financing -- though many criticize the slow pace of fulfilling previous UN aid pledges. \"We cannot accept the disappearance of any country or culture under the rising waves,\" Guterres said. \"The idea that an entire island state could become collateral damage for profiteering by the fossil fuel industry, or competition between major economies, is simply obscene,\" he added. Guterres said the United Nations supported SIDS' aspirations to \"halt and mitigate the terrible impacts of the climate crisis,\" as well as to protect the ocean and biodiversity, and to build resilient economies. He urged SIDS governments to invest and engage in these goals but said they \"cannot do this alone.\" \"The international community has a duty to support you –- led by the countries that have greatest responsibility and capacity to deal with the challenges you face,\" Guterres said. \"SIDS are a test case for climate justice and financial justice,\" he added. Last week, the UN maritime court ruled in favor of nine small island states that brought a case to seek increased protection of the world's oceans from catastrophic climate change. The countries that brought the case called the court decision \"historic,\" and experts said it could be influential in shaping the scope of future climate litigation involving greenhouse gas emissions.",

The first time had been in French, but because the question that had been asked was not translated, it was later repeated in English. Some managers would have snapped. She had just lost a European final for the first time as manager and was probably not in the mood to discuss where she will be next season. But she does not seem the type to do so. She knows as well as the rest of us that it is the worst kept secret in women’s football that she will soon be announced as Emma Hayes’ successor at Chelsea . Bompastor has been manager of Lyon since 2021, winning seven trophies - including three back-to-back league titles and the 2021-2022 Champions League. Sonia Bompastor (pictured) laughed during a press conference after the Women's Champions League final Her Lyon side cut dejected figures after they suffered a 2-0 defeat by Barcelona during Saturday's final The match may have been Bompastor's (centre) final game as Lyon boss, as speculation mounts that she will now move to succeed Emma Hayes at Chelsea Podcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola?

EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify Her team were beaten 2-0 by Barcelona on Saturday but, on another day, could have come out on top. The absence of star striker Ada Hegerberg, who was only fit enough for a place on the bench, proved crucial. Barca dominated possession but both teams had the same number of shots and clear chances. The difference was Barca took two of theirs, even if they needed a bit of luck with a heavy deflection for the first goal. Bompastor will leave Lyon with a fine record but, in truth, it is hard to measure her success. Read More Barcelona 2-0 Lyon: Jonatan Giraldez's side clinch back-to-back Women's Champions League titles... as Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas' strikes seal victory She was appointed at a difficult time, replacing Jean-Luc Vasseur in April 2021 after French rivals Paris Saint-Germain had knocked them out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage. Bompastor, who also played for Lyon, had been coach of the club’s academy for eight years. She could not stop PSG from going on to win the French league, which subsequently ended Lyon’s 14-year reign as champions, but she has since re-established their position at the top. Lyon have won the last three titles and beat Barca in the 2022 Champions League final - which made her the first person to win the competition as both a player and a manager. But she also inherited a talented squad. She will do the same at Chelsea, but the Women’s Super League is far more competitive, with more teams challenging for trophies than in France. Hayes (pictured) had become the unofficial spokesperson of women's football in England during her glittering reign as Chelsea manager The former Chelsea manager guided the Blues to their fifth consecutive Women's Super League title last week Read More Lionesses icon Steph Houghton isn't short of options for what's next after retirement... while top priority is husband Stephen Darby, she will keep fighting for the women's game What may work in Bompastor’s favour is that there will be less of a spotlight on her than her predecessor. As I discussed in this column last week, Hayes had become the unofficial spokesperson for women’s football in England. The same will not be expected of Bompastor. Hayes worked with Bompastor, who played as a left back, during her time as a football consultant for Washington Freedom in America. Hayes described her as a ‘brilliant player’ with an ‘unbelievable wand of a left foot.’ She also said she was ‘very quiet’ but ‘cheeky’ and ‘funny’ - traits she argued the media may not always see. The description Hayes gave of Bompastor mirrors what some of her former players have said. A manager who is passionate, fiercely determined and demands high standards. She is also said to be deceptively loud. Dare I say she sounds an awful lot like England manager Sarina Wiegman, who has many of the same traits. Hayes worked with Bompastor (pictured), who played as a left back, during her time as a football consultant for Washington Freedom Bompastor brings proven experience of winning the Women's Champions League, the one trophy that has seemingly evaded the Blues in recent years Much like at Lyon, Bompastor will enter a dressing room at Chelsea that is used to winning. The Blues have lifted five successive WSL titles but the one competition that has evaded them is the Champions League. Bompastor’s experience in that competition will be key and it is one of the big reasons Chelsea wanted to bring her in. Read More Emma Hayes helped transform women's football in this country... but after her exit from Chelsea, it has to move on without her, writes KATHRYN BATTE But Bompastor will be responsible for more than just tactics and formations. Hayes spoke regularly about having to manage people and personalities. Chelsea’s squad depth meant players who could walk into other starting XI’s did not always make her matchday squad. Bompastor knows all about this from her time at Lyon and it will not faze her. The switch from Hayes to Bompastor will be fascinating to watch next season. While we are unlikely to get references to Star Wars, geese or poetry in press conferences next season, perhaps in time we will get to see the cheeky and funny side to Bompastor that Hayes promised us is in there. The switch from Hayes (right) to Bompastor (left) will certainly be a fascinating one Bompastor will sign off her time at Lyon having guided her side to the Division 1 Feminine title Brilliant Bronze is Britain's best export Lucy Bronze said her Barcelona team will go down in history after winning their first ever quadruple. But it is not just the team, but Bronze herself who will be remembered in the history books. The defender became the first English player to win five Champions League trophies on Saturday and is now the country’s most decorated player. Bronze has not always started for Barca this season, but she put in a fine display against her former club Lyon. There have been a number of discussions recently about who is the best English player to play abroad. Usually, the answers range from Kevin Keegan, who won the Ballon d’Or while playing for Hamburg, to Steve McManaman, who won two European Cups with Real Madrid. But no English player has been more successful abroad than Bronze - who has won 16 trophies across her spells at Lyon and Barcelona. There is no doubt that, for me, she is the greatest English export we have ever seen. Lucy Bronze (pictured) became the first English player to win five Champions League titles on Saturday Bronze (pictured lifting the trophy) stated that her Barcelona team will go down in history The defender will also go down in history, too, as one of British football's greatest ever exports Scotland will play Israel behind closed doors It is a shame that Scotland’s Euro 2025 qualifier with Israel will have to take place behind closed doors due to security concerns. The Scottish FA said its stadium operations team were alerted to the potential for planned disruptions to the game at Hampden Park and therefore made the decision to stop supporters from attending. Safety is of course paramount but were other options, such as Police Scotland deploying extra force on the ground, explored? The women’s game in Scotland is still far behind England and having games behind closed doors will certainly not help. Scotland's Euro 2025 qualifier against Israel at Hampden Park will take place behind closed doors Referee Rebecca Welch (pictured) delivered an impressive performance during Saturday's Women's Champions League final Welch delivers impressive refereeing performance Barcelona far outnumbered Lyon fans at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, with over 40,000 of them making the short trip across Spain.

        "content": "( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

        "description": "The Celtics and the Mavericks have rolled through their respective conferences this postseason, thanks in large part to the clutch contributions of Jrue Holiday, PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford.",
        "content": "The Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks saw room to improve, and they struck. Exactly one week before their first preseason game, the Celtics traded a haul for Jrue Holiday , sacrificing depth to bring in the savvy veteran point guard with plenty left in the tank. Dallas’ transformative trades came just before the Feb. 8 deadline, with PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford arriving in under-the-radar moves that gave the Mavericks a much-needed physicality boost. Those deals are paying serious dividends now. Boston and Dallas have rolled through their respective conferences this postseason, thanks in large part to the clutch contributions of Holiday, Washington and Gafford. Here’s how they got here. Fresh off of their second consecutive trip to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics already appeared poised to be among the NBA’s best teams without Holiday. They had traded in June for Kristaps Porzingis, adding another All-Star to a roster headlined by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. The Porzingis trade didn’t come cheaply, however, as it cost Boston their defensive-minded point guard, Marcus Smart, who for years had served as the team’s gritty emotional leader. Boston seemed set to begin the season with Derrick White and Malcolm Brogdon as its top point guards, until Holiday suddenly became available. Holiday — a three-time first-team selection for All-Defensive honors and a 2021 champion with Milwaukee — had just been traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in the blockbuster deal that sent Damian Lillard to the Bucks. Holiday, 33, didn’t fit into the rebuilding Blazers’ timeline, so on Oct. 1, they flipped him to Boston for Brogdon, center Robert Williams and two first-round picks. The do-it-all Holiday proved to be a seamless fit, averaging 12.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.8 assist per game for the 64-win Celtics while again making the All-Defensive second team. Holiday remained a consistent force throughout the playoffs but became even more impactful during the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, who boast the NBA’s highest-scoring offense. Holiday scored a season-high 28 points in Boston’s Game 1 win and made a critical defensive play in overtime. With the Celtics up by a point with 1:02 remaining in OT, Holiday’s smothering defense caused Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton, a two-time All-Star, to lose control of the ball out of bounds. “He’s the best defender in the NBA,” Haliburton said afterward. “He has been for a long time.” Holiday finished with seven rebounds, eight assists and three steals and made 10 of his 16 field-goal attempts in Game 1. He followed that up with 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting and 10 assists in Game 2. And in Game 3, Holiday again made a game-sealing defensive stop. With Boston up by a point and under 10 seconds remaining in regulation, Holiday met a surging Andrew Nembhard in the backcourt, remained glued to him as he cleared the 3-point line and stripped the ball away to put Boston up, 3-0, in the conference finals. The steal helped the Celtics overcome an 18-point deficit, as did Holiday’s 14 points and nine rebounds. “I just made a play,” Holiday said. “I kind of jumped his right hand and got the steal.” The Mavericks, meanwhile, tried to retool in the offseason after a disappointing 2022-23 season in which they failed to make the play-in tournament. They traded for center Richaun Holmes and signed forward Grant Williams and guard Seth Curry, hoping to improve the supporting cast around Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving . Those additions each fizzled, however, prompting the Mavs to remake their roster on deadline day. They sent Williams, Curry and a first-round pick to Charlotte for the forward Washington, a hard-nosed defender who shot at least 36.5% on 3-point attempts in three of his five NBA seasons. They shipped Holmes and draft compensation to the Wizards for Gafford, a rim-protecting center who is highly efficient around the basket. Washington shot just 42.1% from the field and 31.4% from deep in 29 regular season games with Dallas but came alive in the playoffs, particularly in the second round against top-seeded Oklahoma City. Washington scored at least 21 points in three consecutive games against the Thunder, making at least five 3-pointers in each. His two made free throws with 2.1 seconds remaining in the series-clinching Game 6 were the final points in Dallas’ 117-116 win. He remained clutch in the Western Conference Finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves, making a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:56 remaining in Game 1 and another with 3:38 left in Game 3 — both of which proved to be game-winners. “Anything can happen out there on any given night,” Washington said after Sunday’s Game 3 victory put Dallas up, 3-0, in the series. “I’m just blessed to be able to be here in this position. ... We don’t take it for granted.” Despite being five inches shorter, the 6-7 Washington has also played tough defense against the 7-foot Karl-Anthony Towns, who repeatedly settled for 3-point attempts through the first three games and went only 3-of-22 from deep. Towns, a four-time All-Star who averaged 21.8 points per game in the regular season, is yet to eclipse 16 in the Western Conference Finals. Gafford, meanwhile, continues to serve as an effective lob option for Doncic. His alley-oop dunk with 34.8 seconds left in Game 3 served as the dagger in the Mavericks’ 116-107 win. The 6-10 Gafford is averaging 10.3 points per game on 65.2% against the towering Timberwolves, holding his own against 7-1 Rudy Gobert, who just won his fourth Defensive Player of the Year honor. Dallas’ addition of Gafford allows promising rookie center Dereck Lively to come off the bench. The athletic Lively, a top-10 pick who entered the league with raw potential, has thrived this postseason as a reserve, though he left Game 3 with a sprained neck. “Tests returned OK on Dereck Lively II’s neck but his availability for Game 4 remains unclear,” ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday. Gafford and Lively solidified a center position that the Mavericks have historically struggled to fill, outside of a pair of one-season stints with Tyson Chandler in 2010-11 and 2014-15, and a two-year stretch with Porzingis that never quite fit. Dallas is getting a combined 50.7 points per game this postseason from Doncic and Irving. Coincidentally, that’s exactly what Boston’s dynamic duo of Tatum and Brown were averaging entering Monday. Thanks to some shrewd trades, Dallas and Boston have much more in common than their standout superstars.",

        "content": "Japan tells residents to 'take cover' as North Korea launches rocket 'carrying spy satellite' off coast Japanese Prime Minister’s Office issued a missile alert for Okinawa North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November By Claudia Aoraha For Dailymail.Com Published: 16:32, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:41, 27 May 2024 e-mail 19 shares 49 View comments Japan issued an alert telling its residents to take cover after North Korea launched a rocket allegedly carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night. The rocket launch came just hours after the country's announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center at 10:44pm on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful.

Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. Kim Jong-Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs.

North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia.

Posting on one of his ghost X handles, donzamusoro007, Charamba said: “WHAT CAN’T: Chamisa cannot be available as a NATIONAL LEADER; he can only be available as a PARTISAN, PARTY-LESS LEADER!!!!! “The reason is simple: He turned down the offer of LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT, itself an elevated NATIONAL STATUS. Zvimwe zvese rangova drama zvaro!!!!!!” Asked the following question by Joseph Samanyanga who said: “Did he qualify to be the leader of the opposition in Parliament, yet he was not a member of Parliament? You must be an MP to qualify for the post! “Otherwise, he didn’t turn it down, the party appointed Tabitha Khumalo because Chamisa was not a member of Parliament.” Charamba responded: “I can share with you what the plan then was. Chamisa was going to get one of his MPs to cede a constituency to him in return for some ambassadorial posting. “Chamisa would have got into Parliament on that basis, itself founded on mutual understanding between parties. “The same idea had been agreed to with Tsvangirai although it got overtaken by GNU arrangements. “There is always a way out, as you saw with Mwonzora who became that even though he had been outside Parliament!!!!

        "content": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ( WNCN ) — Two people were rescued just before a $1 million luxury 80-foot sport yacht sank off the coast of Florida Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The incident was reported just after 11:35 a.m. about 3 miles off St. Augustine Beach, a news release from the Coast Guard said. The operator of the Atlantis, an 80-foot sport yacht, said the vessel hit an object in the water and was sinking. The Coast Guard sent out a boat crew to assist and coordinated with St. John’s County Fire and Rescue, which soon arrived and plucked both people from the yacht. The Atlantis yacht appears to be a 1999 or early 2000s model of the Sunseeker Predator 80. A larger Sunseeker Predator was featured in the 2006 James Bond film “Casino Royale.” A 2001 Predator that is 5 feet shorter than Atlantis, which sank Saturday, is listed for sale for $975,000. Sunseeker Predator 80 yacht, built in the United Kingdom, can accommodate up to six guests in four staterooms, with two crew members aboard. Atlantis has two Caterpillar diesel engines and can reach a top speed of 44 kn, or 50 mph, according to data from Boat International. A data sheet about Atlantis says the vessel is in the top 5% by speed in the world. After Saturday’s rescue, a hazard to navigation was broadcast to alert mariners about the yacht, which could cause damage to other vessels, according to the Coast Guard. The owner of the Atlantis will arrange for a salvage of the vessel, the Coast Guard said. The cause of the incident is under investigation.",

The unrest erupted over a French voting reform plan that Indigenous Kanaks say will dilute their voice. As he exited the plane at Tontouta International Airport, the French leader told reporters he wanted to ensure that \"as quickly as possible there will be a return to peace, calm, security\". \"That is the absolute priority,\" Macron added, ahead of a day of intensive meetings with local leaders. He is expected to spend about 12 hours on the ground. France has ruled New Caledonia since the 1800s, but many Indigenous Kanaks still resent Paris's power over their islands and want fuller autonomy or independence. \"I don't know why our fate is being discussed by people who don't even live here,\" said Mike, a 52-year-old Kanak at a separatist roadblock north of the capital, on the eve of Macron's visit.

Extraordinary drone footage seen by The Sun shows how four armed terrorists were tracked along an alleyway inside the West Bank town of Nur al-Shams Tulkarm before being killed in a targeted strike. 11 Israeli troops use drones to target terrorists in Gaza and the West Bank 11 Panicked Hamas terrorists throw objects and fire shots at an Israeli drone 11 Another drone armed with an explosive device moves in on the terrorists 11 A bomb is dropped from several hundred feet above, apparently killing the terrorists Israeli operators can be heard discussing the operation in the background while controlling a reconnaissance drone with a handset not much larger than a mobile, to track down the gunmen. The terrorists appear surprised by the drone as it flies close to them at around head height. The panicked insurgents begin throwing objects at the drone, with one firing shots from his weapon, as the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) operator withdraws from the alleyway. Meanwhile, another drone armed with an explosive device moves in on the terrorists and drops a bomb from several hundred feet above, apparently killing all four. The footage appears to end with the drone camera zooming in on the lifeless bodies of the four gunmen. Eran Salmon, a bomb disposal officer with the Israeli police, described the footage as \"Rare documentation of IDF forces fighting terrorism in an integrated manner using small drones.\" The former IDF special forces commander wrote on social media: \"In a recent operation, four armed terrorists concealed in the complex alleys of the Nur al-Shams Tulkarm were surprised when an IDF small drone appeared and located them from a short distance. \"They fired at the drone and threw objects at it, but it managed to evade them. \"Meanwhile, another drone dropped an explosive warhead at their exact location and...

The pair of despots look increasingly cosy on the surface - but Lord Admiral West warned that Xi could be set on seizing Russia's resource-rich territory. 6 Admiral Lord West believes Xi's long term goal could be to tear up his alliance with Putin and invade Siberia Credit: The Sun 6 He told The Sun's defence show that Putin was playing a dangerous game with Xi Credit: The Sun 6 The pair of tyrants looking cosy on their state visit last week that solidified their burgeoning alliance Speaking on The Sun's World at War show, Lord West branded Putin a submissive \"supplicant\" to a far more powerful Xi. He argued their flourishing, but not strictly defined, alliance could fall apart if the Chinese leader got too greedy. The former First Sea Lord believes Xi's long-term strategy could be to invade parts of Russia and capture its bountiful oil fields and other raw materials. He said: \"If it really gets very bad and they desperately need resources I think there's a very real risk they cold decide to take the bits of Siberia they want. \"It is all about resources. Resources are going to become more and more of a problem for China. \"They have already issued maps of Siberia that have Chinese names.\" \"That is why Putin is playing with fire. The Chinese don't like him.\" Referencing Putin's cuddly state visit to Beijing last week, he said: \"He looks like the little teddy bear about to be eaten, doesn't he? \"[That is] the danger of supping with the devil.\" Since Russia's full-scale of Ukraine over two years ago, Putin has relied on Xi as a lifeline, increasing his economic dependence on China as Western sanctions cut off access to much of the international trading system.

She repeated a warning that Moscow first issued earlier this month after British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine had a right to use weapons provided by London to hit targets inside Russia. The ex-PM also announced new British military aid for Ukraine - saying it would be up to Kyiv how it used the UK-supplied weapons. Moscow reacted with outrage as a result, citing Lord Cameron's comments as one of the reasons why it has opted to hold exercises this month to simulate the launch of tactical nuclear missiles. Raging Vlad even slammed the former PM and branded his comments as \"dangerous and worrying\". Lord Cameron said: \"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view, it is their decision about how to use these weapons. \"They're defending their country, they were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps.\" It prompted a fierce response from the Kremlin, with Putin's puppet spokesman Dmitry Peskov vowing his comments could \" imperil the entire system of European security architecture\". Peskov added: \"The Kremlin views Cameron's statements about Kyiv's right to use British weapons to strike the Russian Federation as a direct... Tom Malley",

A spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs office said in a statement that China will take action to \"resolutely crush\" any separatist plot if Taiwan pro-independence forces insist on going their own way or taking risks. China hopes Taiwan will work with the mainland to oppose independence separatism and interference from external forces, said spokesperson Chen Binhua. Early this morning, China encircled Taiwan and other Taipei-controlled islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin as part of the \"Joint Sword 2024A\" exercises. Taiwan has condemned the military drills - which are tagged as \"A\" in an apparent warning of potential follow-ups - as \"irrational provocations\". It quickly mobilised its naval, air and ground forces to \"defend the island's sovereignty,\" the defence ministry said. The defiant island has scrambled jets and even placed missile units on high alert. Four fighter jets took off at around 1pm (5am GMT) from a military airbase in Hsinchu, an hour southwest of Taipei, while the city's coast guard warned off Chinese vessels.

Russia is said to be trying to redraw their territorial waters to steal areas in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland and near the cities of Baltiysk and Zelenodradsk in the Kaliningrad region. But, experts are most concerned over Putin's plans to take over Gotland - an island that sits just off the coast of Sweden . It is thought to be the next area on Putin's hitlist if he gets his way and is regarded as one of the most important areas in the Baltic Sea. Whoever runs Gotland dominates the Baltics General Richard Shirreff General Richard Shirreff spoke to The Sun on the importance of Nato keeping control of Gotland and keeping it far away from the hands of a tyrant.

Shlomi, dad to Agam Berger who can be seen with blood dripping from her mouth in the footage, claims the video should serve as a \"wake up call to the world\" to end the hostages' nightmare. It's crazy as a father that my girl is in that situation and I can't help her. I can't do anything to help her Shlomi Berger He told the New York Post: \"This is a wakeup call to the world. Look what we're dealing with. \"You saw how many terrorists were in that video. \"You only see three minutes, but we know that they sat in the same place for two or three hours, and in front of their eyes they saw their friends that were murdered, on the floor. \"It's crazy as a father...

Fuming drivers were forced to call the cops after traffic on the busy road between Menorca's capital Mahon and its third-largest town Alaoir was blocked. Authorities soon arrived at the scene in the Balearic Islands and found in a man in a \"state of drunkness\". He was taken to a nearby hospital but left after reportedly refusing to receive medical attention. He was formally identified so he could be reported to traffic chiefs and fined for putting other road users in danger. However, just a few hours later, the man was seen taking a stroll in the middle of a busy road again - causing the traffic to stop abruptly. He was then checked by ambulance staff and let go after authorities failed to find him a bed in a local accommodation centre, local media report.

After being questioned by Israel's secret service, Shin Bet, the men spoke on the torment they unleashed with very little remorse. Radi, a father-of-seven, is a member of the Hamas Security Service, who patrolled the Nir Oz kibbutz causing chilling crimes to countless Israeli families. The thug admitted: \"In each house where we found someone, we either killed them or kidnapped them. \"In the first house I found a woman and her husband, and we hit them with fire and killed them - they were in their late 40s.\" After confessing to the murder of two innocent people, Radi spoke about how he heartlessly treated a woman he found in another home.

A report on the ambush stated: \"It is noted that there were several boats, on which landed more than 15 occupants.\" It added: \"The Birds of Madyar [drone unit] disrupted the operation of the Russians and eliminated at least seven Russians. \"Note that Nestryha island is the last before the mouth of the river and actually the last island on the right bank.\" As such it is strategically important \"as the positions on the island allow shelling the right-bank Kherson region with mortars and artillery\".

Nine people are seriously injured and seven people are in critical condition after what cops say was likely caused by an overload of people on the first floor. Abdoulaye Diop, 44, a Senegalese migrant living in Majorca, was the first of those who died last night to have been named. He had been working as a nightclub doorman in the area who made headlines on the island in 2017 by saving a man who was drowning. He is thought to have stopped off at Medusa Beach Club, on the beachfront promenade, after leaving the gym. The fourth victim is a 23-year-old female Spanish worker. It has now emerged nine survivors being treated in hospital are Dutch, the nationalities of the others are unknown.

        "content": "The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico’s southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up, and water supplies are running out. Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score.

        "content": "Jason Kelce had some choice words for a troll who called his wife, Kylie Kelce, a “homemaker.” After voicing his disagreement with Harisson Butker’s controversial commencement speech , the former NFL player became the target of a troll on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Monday. “Your wife is a homemaker,” the critic wrote. “But you can’t support butker.And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. Sorry but it is dirty and messy on television.” The netizen then accused Jason of being a “bit hypocritical,” warning he would “be left with nothing but swifties,” referencing his brother Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift. “You just ruined your gig. It’s a shame,” they concluded. The former Philadelphia Eagles player — who has three daughters , Wyatt, 4, Ellie, 3, and Bennett, 14 months, with Kylie — explained that he doesn’t view his wife as “a homemaker.” “I think of her as my wife,” the 36-year-old wrote . “I think of her as a mother. She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily. The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first.” Jason went on to add that the couple both raise their kids and tidy up the house. “It is both our faults it is messy, but such is life with 3 young children, busy schedules, and neither of us being neat freaks. She also makes a mean sandwich,” he joked. Start your day with Page Six Daily. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Want celebrity news as it breaks? Hooked on Housewives? “If being a homemaker, works for some, and that’s what they want, then hell yea, that’s awesome, more power to you,” the retired athlete concluded. “I want to be clear, I’m not downplaying that at all, but that is not our family dynamic.” Jason and Kylie, 31, were among some who criticized Butker for his speech at Benedictine College’s graduation ceremony in which he told the female graduates that they had been fed “diabolical lies” about how they should live their lives. “Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world,” he said. “I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabelle, would be the first to say her life truly started when she started living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.” The Kansas City Chiefs kicker also took time out in his speech to rail against Pride Month, abortion and IVF. Butker later defended his speech claiming at a fundraiser, that the backlash revealed how “timeless Catholic values are hated by many.”",

        "content": "MADRID (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday secured from Spain a pledge of additional air defense missiles to help fight the about 3,000 bombs that he says Russia launches every month at Ukraine in the third year of the war. However, Ukraine still urgently needs another seven U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction, Zelenskyy said. “If we had these modern Patriot systems, (Russian) airplanes wouldn’t be able to fly close enough to drop the (glide) bombs on the civilian population and the military,” Zelenskyy told a news conference in the Spanish capital. Glide bombs are heavy Soviet-era bombs fitted with precision guidance systems and launched from aircraft flying out of range of air defenses. The bombs weigh more than a ton and blast targets to smithereens, leaving a huge crater. Two Patriot systems are needed to protect the northeastern Kharkiv region, where the Kremlin’s forces launched a cross-border offensive on May 10 that left Ukrainian troops reeling, Zelenskyy said. The death toll from a glide bomb attack on a Kharkiv shopping mall Saturday rose to 18, regional Gov Oleh Syniehubov said Monday, with five people still missing. The Kharkiv push has further strained Ukraine’s already depleted army, which in recent months has been fighting Russia’s intense drive deeper into the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the Kremlin’s army is mustering at another point in Russia, farther north but close to the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, aiming to stretch Ukraine’s depleted army thinner and crack its resistance in the area. Zelenskyy and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez signed a bilateral security agreement that allocates 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. More Leopard tanks and artillery ammunition also feature in the package. “After more than two years (of war), Russia’s aggression continues, and that’s why it is more necessary than ever to redouble our support,” Sánchez told the joint news conference. The Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system that was first deployed in the 1980s and can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles. It is expensive but is effective and sought after by armies around the world. European countries have hesitated to send Patriot systems to Ukraine, fearing they may need them. Spain’s King Felipe VI earlier welcomed Zelenskyy at the capital’s Barajas airport. Zelenskyy was due in neighboring Portugal on Tuesday. He had been due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia’s response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. A Ukrainian long-range drone set a new distance record by attacking overnight an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Ukrainian officials claimed. The operation was conducted by Ukraine’s military intelligence, GUR, an intelligence official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to comment publicly. Ukraine’s previous long-range attack record was at 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) when a drone struck an oil refinery in Russia’s Bashkortostan on May 9. It was not immediately possible to verify either claim. Meanwhile, a Western intelligence assessment suggested that Russia’s Kharkiv offensive has subsided. “The northern Kharkiv front has likely stabilized with Russian territorial control fragmented and not joined up,” the U.K. Defense Ministry said Sunday. “Russia’s gains in this axis will be limited in the coming week, as Russia’s initial momentum has been contained by Ukrainian resistance.” That is in line with Zelenskyy’s claim last Friday that Ukrainian forces have secured “combat control” of areas where Russian troops entered the Kharkiv region. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "content": "@XandertheWise It depends on when the first day of school is of that year. My high school typically started very early in August, then seniors wouldn't be around anymore in May. I graduated in 2008 and during that year they pushed our first day into late August. So while my graduation was the first day of June, on Sunday, our last day of classes was the 2nd week of May. Sorry for the late reply @Bundersvessel ! I pulled a back muscle and I was in so much pain over the weekend. The joys of getting old Yeah it was an extraction. It seems to be doing rather well now.. So surreal that it's gone though. Ooooh boy I don't envy you. Mine are already all grown up thankfully (Though that comes with it's own problems). I don't think I could manage with a baby/toddler at my age now... I deal with kids enough as a teacher ha ha Is this where @kyleforrester87 is at? @JohnnyShoulder nah but I have seen that in recent years. We are total bad asses! Went to a local Tekken 8 tournament last night and it was pretty cool. I didn't do great @Voltan Cool. How many took part in that? @oliverp It was actually quite big (and a Dojo event for Tekken World Tour) - 48 players in the bracket @Jimmer-jammer How are you man? I'm still downloading RotR, despite having completed the tutorial, as I have a very slow internet connection/set up my Ps5 with performance settings that somehow cause slow downloads, anyway, it is a big game as well so that probably contributes to that. Anyway, how's work and life treating you? Is your job anything like the TV Show 'The King of Queens'? 🤣 @Black_Swordsman Doing well, thanks! Yeah, RotR is a really big game, so that’s surely a factor. As for my job, it’s less King of Queens and more Highway Thru Hell. In fact, parts of the show were filmed in my neck of the woods. I haul petroleum crude, so there’s the added stress of dealing with a dangerous goods product but the nice thing is that I work a 9 on and 5 off schedule, which works well for managing my life, especially when my real passions are decidedly less blue collar. I did, for a time, deliver and service portable toilets across Calgary and Vancouver, including at the 2010 winter olympics, which probably could have been its own tv show 😂 How are you doing? Have you carried on with your studies? Still operating the helplines? @Jimmer-jammer Yeah, good thanks, I am applying for courses at the moment so hopefully I'll get on to a good one, and yes, still operating the helplines. It's quite rewarding and enjoyable. That's interesting about your former employment. Definitely a TV Show I would have paid to watch! @Black_Swordsman Glad to hear you’re doing well! Being an ear for people in need is a real gift and takes a tremendous amount of personal fortitude. Here’s hoping your courses pan out the way you’d like! Plan a game purchase for tomorrow (its the day when the salary comes here where I live so) feel like I deserve to buy a game then (have planed the purchase for quite some time). @oliverp Which one? I cna't wait to buy Paper Mario 2, but unfortunately I had an awful pay day this month. That on top of me having spent all my savings over the last year, makes it really hard to justify new game prices. Especially since I still have quite some games left unfinished. Finances will probably return to normal by next month, so it's nothing to be worried about. Just sad that the one game I was looking forward to happened to release this month. @kidfred Oh its a big one which I might announce in the purchase thread. I of course hope that you soon will be able to pick up some new games. @oliverp I might have an idea about which game 😉 I have decided to give up on the idea of being a professional musician and focus purely on psychology for a future career path. It was an accumulation of things that led to this decision, I suppose, but mostly the fact that I realised I had been holding on to my teenage dreams, mostly inspired by reading interviews with musicians, mostly from the band 'Iced Earth' and other rock and heavy metal bands about how you go \"all in\" when you're young if you're gonna make it, and then stick to it, kinda thing. I realised that at this age a career in psychology, another of my interests, is more realistic, and on a personal level, more fulfilling to me. I also felt like I had \"made my mark\" on the music industry, with a handful of gigs from my teens under my belt, in addition to SoundCloud recordings, which people liked, flatteringly, recorded more recently. I will now just play guitar for fun, along with games, and read and watch cricket as my primary hobbies and interests, whilst focusing on psychology for the career and personal fulfillment. I have \"met up\" with my college self in the best possible way now, still focusing on a couple of the same hobbies and interests I had at that age, but without applying the passion and drive necessary to become a professional musician to that unlikely end now, and instead applying it to becoming a professional psychotherapist. @Black_Swordsman I find your decision and self-awareness quite inspiring. I'm closer to retirement than I am to my early working years, and I still don't know what I would choose to do or have a passion for. I do have some experience in psychology having spent many years talking to professionals with my personal history of depression, anxiety and other related mental illnesses, and I can certainly see the appeal and fulfillment of such a career choice. The very best of luck to you! @Malaise Thank you for your feedback and for disclosing that, I sincerely wish you all the best with your mental health and everything else in your life. I hope you discover what you want to do, in terms of a particular ambition, what you and I both referred to as a passion, and if not, I hope you enjoy the things that you do do in life that you may not necessarily be passionate about in the sense of a specific ambition, goal, or drive.",

District Judge Gail Horne Ray's decisions have raised questions over a potential conflict of interest in Brooks' case. Brooks, 19, died when she was hit by a car in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana , on January 15 2023 after she was allegedly raped by four men , Kaivon Washington, Casen Carver, Everett Lee, and Desmond Carter. Ray is presiding over their trials, but her impartiality has been called into question after she dismissed Donald Ray Link's 1972 rape conviction this month and released rape suspect De’Aundre Cox on reduced bail last year. East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III has clashed with Ray over the decisions telling WBRZ : 'I've never seen this done ever or heard of it ever done before.' Madison Brooks, 19, died when she was hit by a car in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana , on January 15 after she was allegedly raped by four men District Judge Gail Horne Ray's decisions, along with her son Nelson Dan Taylor Jr's multiple rape convictions, have raised questions over a potential conflict of interest in Brooks' case Ray's son, Nelson Dan Taylor Jr, was convicted of raping multiple classmates - aged between 12 and 17 - between 1995 and 1996, breaking into their homes in a mask and attacking them at knifepoint. He pleaded guilty to all of the rapes and was sentenced to 50 years in prison with a requirement to serve at least 25. Ray took office as a 19th Judicial District Court judge January 12, 2023. Three months later, she released De’Aundre Cox, who was accused of raping his preteen neighbor, on reduced bail without alerting the victim or notifying the district attorney's office. Cox is facing two counts of aggravated rape against a now-teenage girl who lives near his family’s home in the Park Forest neighborhood. She was 12 when the alleged sexual abuse began. She told officers that Cox threatened her with a gun before raping her on two occasions. The abuse was discovered when the victim's older brother, who was friends with Cox, found a video of the attacks on his phone. District Attorney Hillar Moore slammed Ray's decision to release him last April and said his office was only notified a week after he was released. He told The Advocate at the time: 'We really are confused as to how this bond was reduced without notice to the state and an opportunity for us to be heard on behalf of the victim. And we are concerned as to what happened and how it happened.' The victim's mother told the outlet that the family 'live in fear' and said: 'Why didn’t they let me know? We could’ve changed up, because these people have already threatened me.' This month, Ray clashed with the DA again over her decision to throw out convicted rapist Donald Ray Link's 1972 conviction for aggravated rape. Link was serving a life sentence for threatening a woman with a butcher's knife before raping her. He appeared before Ray asking her to reduce his sentence so he could ask for parole. Instead of reducing his sentence, she overturned his conviction entirely, bypassing the parole process. Moore told WBRZ her decision was 'unheard of', adding: 'She has no authority whatsoever to do what she did and her reasoning was erroneous.' Ray's decisions and her family history have raised further questions over Ray's impartiality in the ongoing Brooks case. Her decisions were slammed online with one Twitter user saying 'she needs to be removed' and another saying 'this judge should be removed! Absolutely disgusting.' Moore and Ray did not return Fox News Digital's requests for comment. LSU student Brooks was allegedly raped by Carter and Washington in the back of their car while the other two suspects watched after a night of drinking at a bar in Tigerland. After the alleged attack in their car, the suspects allegedly left Brooks stumbling and drunk on the side of a busy four-lane highway. She was hit by a car around 3am and died from her injuries. Brooks' alleged attackers claim they did not rape her and say only consensual sex happened in the back of the car. Brooks was allegedly raped by Carter and Washington in the back of their car while the other two suspects watched after a night of drinking at a bar in Tigerland Casen Carver, 18, (left) Kaivon Washington, 18, (second left) and Everett Lee, 28, (second right) and Desmond Carter, 17, (right) were all arrested on rape-related charges Brooks was last seen drunkenly stumbling out of Reggie's bar, which has since had its license revoked, with the group. Other footage released by authorities shows the student running after the group of men on the night she died. Fellow Varsity football player Washington has been charged with third-degree rape in Brooks' case – though prosecutors say they are hoping to upgrade the charges. He has been accused of raping another young woman who claims he attacked her in October last year after targeting her at Reggie’s, the same bar the group met Brooks. The victim in the October case says she was too drunk to go home so asked if she could stay at one of Washington's friend's apartments. According to his arrest affidavit, they all went back to the home together, where she and the friend started having sex in front of Washington. The friend allegedly became more 'aggressive', pinning her down and ignoring her as she pleaded with him to 'stop'. Other footage released by authorities shows the student running after the group of men on the night she died The 29-second clip shows Madi appearing to tell the teenager Desmond Carter, 17, to 'get out' of the car so she can 'Uber on her own' Washington was watching but then approached and felt the victim's breast and vagina, the affidavit claims. The alleged incident is the third accusation of rape to have been made against Washington. In addition to Brooks, he is accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in 2020 after following her home from a pool party when he was 15. The Walker High School Varsity Football player has been charged with first-degree rape in that case, with prosecutors vowing to upgrade the charges in relation to Brooks. Lawyers for Washington previously submitted video footage to the court in an attempt to prove that the drunk sorority girl was able to consent to the acts – but a judge felt it showed 'criminality'. A legal expert told DailyMail.com that the judge's 'inappropriate' comments could 'taint the public opinion' of the defendants. Washington can reportedly be heard in the footage laughing at Brooks as she slurs her words after the alleged anal rape. Her sorority Alpha Phi confirmed that she donated her kidneys and heart Madi died after being hit by a ride-share car at 3am on January 15, when she was dropped off by the four men who had picked her up at a college bar Louisiana's first-degree rape statute carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. Brooks died after being hit by a ride-share car at 3am on January 15, when she was dropped off by the four men. Two Good Samaritans reportedly stopped to perform CPR on the sophomore LSU student after the collision. East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office says they were guided by first responders on the phone in the pouring rain after Madi was hit by the ride-share car. They confirmed that Madi Brooks died from 'multiple traumatic injuries' when she was hit by a car after allegedly being raped. Police confirmed that the driver of the vehicle will not be charged as he was not impaired and contacted emergency services immediately. A memorial was created for the 'amazing young woman' who had 'limitless potential' by her friends on the highway where she died. Carter has been formally charged with the first-degree rape and third-degree rape of Madi, but a grand jury chose not to indict him on one count of kidnapping Madison Brooks (left) seen behind the bar at Reggie's with two sorority sisters. She had been drinking at the bar before she was raped and fatally struck by a car on January 14 Pictures show Washington partying with friends and posing for the camera, while another shows him topless and clutching an inflatable alien The bar where Madi worked, according to several social media posts, has also had its responsibility for the incident called into question. Surveillance footage surrounding Reggie's bar, where the group met, shows Madi drunk and stumbling around, according to police documents. The Louisiana ATC has confirmed that they have suspended the license of Reggie's following the 'seriousness of the allegations and potential threat to public safety'. An attorney for the bar, Kris Perrett, confirmed in a statement that they are 'fully cooperating with authorities'. A lawyer for Brooks' family issued a statement last year saying: 'She was raped. Rape is rape. It's just a horrific, terrible situation. 'And to the extent that those involved with the alleged rapist want to blame the victim and show up at press conferences and say things ... we're standing up for Madi. That's not right.'

        "content": "by: iSeeCars Posted: May 27, 2024 / 10:00 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 10:00 AM PDT ( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

        "content": "Some of the polls before the general election may be overstating Labour’s huge lead over the Conservatives , a Tory election expert has said. According to Robert Hayward, a peer and former MP who first identified the phenomenon of “shy Tories” before the 1992 election, his analysis of local election results suggests that the Conservatives are getting more support from voters who say they are undecided than is showing up in the polls. “About 33 years on, I am yet again convinced that a statistical bias exists in the polls,” he said. Polling in the run-up to the election has shown commanding leads for Labour of more than 20 points in some surveys, such as YouGov, while others, such as Opinium, show a gap of about 14. Some constituency-level polling by YouGov suggests the Conservatives are heading for near wipeout. Its April projection points to more than 400 seats out of 650 going to Labour . Most experts, MPs and political strategists across the parties agree that Labour is almost certainly heading for victory, but the size of its lead will determine its majority in parliament. Hayward said it was “not shy Tories” all over again, and that Labour still undoubtedly had a large lead over the Conservatives, but he was concerned the polls were “getting it wrong”. “I think the biggest problem for me is how you allocate the Conservative 2019 voters who are now ‘don’t knows’. I do believe the ‘don’t knows’ will vote in fairly large numbers, and the indications from local council results is that they are beginning to break towards the Conservatives. “Because of the lack of commitment displayed so far, I’m not sure where things are going to end up, because events during this election could have more of an effect than in many elections because there are so many undecided.” One polling industry expert also agreed there was a risk the polls could contain methodological or structural errors. They said: “I think there are lots of reasons to be concerned about a polling error this time around. There are serious data quality issues across the industry, where it’s getting tougher to ensure the people taking part in surveys are real, taking the surveys seriously, and representative of the wider population. Pollsters are working harder to combat it, but that task is getting tougher, and there is a risk that it affects the accuracy of the polls this election. “The other issue is undecided voters. There’s three times more people who voted Conservative and are undecided than voted Labour and are undecided, and where these voters end up going will make a big difference. The pollsters make different assumptions about this group ... The range of this is probably like Labour 1997 to Canada 1993 – it’s a Conservative party historic defeat with one methodology, to complete wipeout with another methodology.” Sign up to Election Edition Make sense of the election campaign with Archie Bland's daily 5pm briefing, direct to your inbox. Jokes where available after newsletter promotion They added: “The last thing is that polls do tend to be less accurate in elections with lots of change. Polls were fairly inaccurate in 1997 but it didn’t matter, because the result was so decisive. When there are more voters moving between parties, polls become more chaotic, their accuracy tends to decrease.” Anthony Wells, head of European political and social research at YouGov, said it was likely that the differences between each company’s surveys would narrow as polling day approached. “There are still a substantial number of people who voted Tory in 2019 saying ‘Don’t know’ when asked how they will vote,” he said. “A large amount of the difference in leads between different polling companies is because of different choices in how to handle that. Some companies choose to model or predict how those people will vote come election day, while others report only what people currently say. “It is as much a philosophical decision as anything else. Are we measuring how people say they will vote, or predicting how we think they will vote? Either way, it is reasonable expectation that the differences between pollsters will narrow in the lead-up to July 4 as the number of people saying ‘Don’t know’ falls.

        "description": "If you want to combine a motorcycle road trip with a camping adventure, then you will need a quality tent. Here are five of the best to consider.",
        "content": "We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. With camping gaining popularity, it might have you wanting to take your motorcycle out into the wilderness to see what all the fuss is about. Motorcycle camping isn't exactly the same as going into a campground with your truck pulling a camper, or even car camping. You have to be far more picky about what you bring along with you, and that means you'll usually be going without a camping gadgets and portable grills that you could take car camping. There are many different tents out there, and some of the cooler ones have a garage-like space for your motorcycle to be tucked away out of the elements. If you don't want to spend for the extra quality of life upgrades like that, you can stick with a smaller tent that will keep you safe and dry overnight. No matter the case, there are plenty of options available, and each one on this list is backed up by high user scores. A more in-depth explanation of how these five tents were picked can be found at the end of the list. If you're looking for something that can keep your motorcycle dry overnight, the Wolf Walker tent is a perfect option for you. For $215.99 from Amazon, you get a tent that'll let you camp out overnight while also providing a cover for your motorcycle. You might think having a spot for a motorcycle would take up a lot of the room, but you still have room for two or three people with the motorcycle. However, it would get cramped fast if you're all trying to fit air mattresses in there. It comes bundled with a storage bag that lets it get all packed up and tucked away on your bike when you're all done. This tent has a 4.4 out of five user score on Amazon based on more than 140 ratings. While it's advertised as being waterproof with a rainfly for cover, some reviewers have noted water soaks through the liner and gets the floor wet. Other reviewers mention it being a good tent during storms, so your mileage will vary. A cheap, no-frills tent that will keep you inside overnight is exactly what the Coleman Sundome tent offers. It's available from Amazon for $68.78, and its easy 10-minute setup makes it a breeze to make your campsite. There's no fancy way to keep your motorcycle housed inside as this is meant for two people, but you can opt for bigger sizes if you have more people with you. Coleman recommends the tent for backpacking and hiking, With more than 20,000 ratings on Amazon, this Coleman tent has a 4.7 out of five rating. There's nothing particularly fancy about the tent, but it's affordable and easy to carry around, which makes it a solid option for somebody camping out with their motorcycle. If all you're looking for is a way to stay dry overnight while having a roof over your head, it's hard to beat this tent for the price. It comes with a carrying bag so when you're all done with the tent you can get it packed away and back on the road within minutes. The poles fold up nicely, so you won't have issues storing it away nicely on a motorcycle. While not exactly a traditional tent, the Outsunny folding camping cot get you elevated off the ground and give you housing that'll keep you dry from any potential rain. This is an option for solo bikers who don't want or need to set up a whole tent. The cot comes with an air mattress and a dome covering for $124.99 from Amazon, where it has a 4.2 out of five user score. It seems like quite a bit to pack away, and everything weighs 27.1 pounds, making it heavier than some of the other options on the list. Some reviewers note it's too wide to stow away on a bike, but others mention how it was fine for road tripping on a motorcycle, so perhaps you'll need to measure the dimensions of your motorcycle beforehand. With this being more of a raised bed, you do have the downsides of not having a ton of storage space. If you're looking for a simple way to sleep overnight and get going again in the morning, then this is a good choice for you. If you want to have additional room outside of just a bed, you'd want to go with a regular tent instead. For a lightweight option at just about 2 pounds, the Hubba Hubba 2-person tent is a perfect choice if you're not trying to lug around something heavy. Cutting back on the pounds comes at a premium of $549.95 at retail, but you can often find the tent on sale well below that. On Amazon, you can grab it for $299, and it's much easier to justify at that price. It's a small tent that's mean for just a couple of people, but you have some nice storage options where you can put your phone and keys. Don't expect to be able to stand up in this tent, but there are 40 inches of headspace that lets you still move around without being too uncomfortable. The user scores are nice at 4.5 out of five on Amazon. There are some negative reviews where the tent broke or ripped on them after the first use, so that's a potential issue you could run into. With this being a high-priced tent, that'd be a shame, especially since there's no type of warranty offered with the purchase. If you didn't know Harley-Davidson made outdoor gear , you likely had no idea the company made tents. The Harley Road Ready Tent boasts the brand's iconic black, orange, and gray colors and comes in at a lightweight 5 pounds. The size makes it perfect for taking on a road trip, and you can fit it into the trunk of your Harley or luggage rack with ease. It comes in at $179 from Harley-Davidson, so while it's not the cheapest tent from the list, it's also not the most expensive. It can house up to three people and comes with a duffle bag that makes it easy to transport. The tent has a 4.56 out of five rating on Harley-Davidson's website, where customers speak highly of its quality. In a one-star review of the Harley tent, a buyer argued the rain fly isn't large enough, and that's the only complaint from the user scores. This is a good one for Harley fans who want to show off their brand loyalty. The tent is backed by a 90-day limited warranty. All five of the tents on this list have high user scores from where they're sold, whether that's Amazon, or in the case of one tent from Harley-Davidson. Motorcycle camping differs from regular camping as you don't have the room a car can provide, so you need to save space where you can. Each of these tents fits into a little bag that makes it easy to carry with a motorcycle. On top of that, nothing's too heavy where you'll feel like you're being weighed down while riding in a noticeable way. With many motorcyclists traveling on their own, each tent is made for a person or two, so you won't have a lot of extra space. That's not a huge deal if you're just looking for somewhere to spend overnight, but don't expect to pack a full family comfortably into any of these five options.",

        "description": "\"That is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss, Bruno Famin.\"",
        "content": "According to Sky F1 correspondent Craig Slater, dropping Esteban Ocon for the Canadian Grand Prix is “under serious consideration” for Alpine boss Bruno Famin after the events of Monaco. Ocon had launched an overtake attempt on Alpine team-mate Pierre Gasly into Portier on the opening lap of the race, but the duo would collide, lifting the rear of Ocon’s Alpine off the ground as he suffered race-ending damage. This did not go down well at all with team principal Famin, who in the immediate aftermath, threatened “consequences” for Ocon via French broadcaster Canal+, which sparked speculation that Ocon could be benched for the upcoming Canadian Grand Prix, where he is due to serve a five-place grid drop. Slater has moved to confirm that this is a genuine threat facing Ocon, rather than just a rumour that emerged in the heat of the moment. “Bruno Famin, he was actually on the pit wall with Canal+ who called him up immediately in the aftermath of that first-lap crash and Famin spoke angrily and he talked about taking a tough decision, which everyone has interpreted as benching Esteban Ocon for the next race in Canada,” Slater began. “What I can say to you is that that is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss, Bruno Famin. He will do what is best for the team. But if he decides that leaving Esteban Ocon out for a week as a demonstration of how team discipline needs to be, he is prepared to do that, but that decision has yet to be taken. “There were face-to-face meetings between Ocon and Famin in the aftermath of the Grand Prix yesterday. Ocon apologised, both privately face to face and publicly afterwards via social media. So let’s see what happens.” 👉 Revealed: The staggering cost of Sergio Perez’s Monaco Grand Prix crash 👉 Monaco GP data: Mercedes ‘survival’ strategy conditioned by Alonso’s traffic denies fight for the win Gasly did go on to secure a point in P10, moving Alpine’s total up to two in what has been a disappointing season for the team so far, these struggles having seen both Gasly and Ocon linked with moves away from the team for F1 2025. Williams has been speculated as a potential destination for Gasly, while Ocon has been linked with the likes of Haas and Sauber, to become Audi in 2026. And Slater reckons that this Monaco incident – and any repercussions that it may carry for Ocon – fuels such exit talk. “I think what it does do is call into question whether Ocon will continue with the team beyond next year,” Slater continued. “We all cast up the fact that he was a childhood rival of the other Alpine driver Pierre Gasly and could the two happily coexist in the same team? Well, this is another example of them not coexisting happily. “And the other thing is, as far as most observers were concerned, it was a needlessly optimistic attempt that Ocon made to pass. “It could have cost the team any points in the Grand Prix, it could have taken both the drivers out the race and with the situation as it is at the moment, with anyone outside the top five teams really struggling to get points, it could have left them again at the back of the Constructors’ standings. “In the end, Gasly was able to get a point, that keeps them on two points for the season, but that’s an illustration of just how costly that crash could be. “So we wait and see. I think it would be a big, big decision to drop someone like Esteban Ocon. It really rarely happens. You don’t see it happen. “And remember, not that he’s unavailable to race, he has a five-place grid penalty for Canada, that would carry on to whoever got in that seat, of course. “But it is, as I understand it today, still a potential outcome here. Bruno Famin is weighing up whether or not to drop Ocon for the next Grand Prix. It’s in a couple of weeks time. Let’s see if he does take that very, very big call.” Ocon and Gasly have contributed a point each for Alpine so far in F1 2024.

        "content": "Devon’s planned devolution deal with Torbay has been thrown into limbo because of the surprise announcement of the general election. Devon and Torbay’s councils had both agreed to create a combined county authority (CCA), a so-called devolution deal that proponents believe would provide a better chance of securing government cash for projects linked to adult education, housing, transport, and green initiatives. But prime minister Rishi Sunak’s plans for a poll on Thursday 4 July mean parliament will be dissolved next week, putting many planned pieces of legislation on ice. Before the election was announced, it was hoped the parliamentary process would take place in or around October, but with uncertainty about who will be running the country then, it’s now unclear what will happen. “We are seeking clarity from government officials on how the legislative process for setting up the Devon and Torbay Combined County Authority will be affected following the announcement of the general election,” Cllr James McInnes (Conservative, Hatherleigh & Chagford), the new leader of Devon County Council said. “We met....with Torbay Council and both organisations remain committed to bringing forward our agreed devolution arrangement as soon as possible, and we collectively await clarity from government officials.” Cllr McInnes added that he had already contacted the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing, which oversees the devolution process, to secure the previously announced £16 million agreed as part of the deal. He and Torbay’s leader, Cllr David Thomas (Conservative, Preston), have selected 16 “excellent projects” to receive the money, a decision that now needs to be confirmed by a formal vote. “These schemes span housing, skills, business support and green infrastructure and can have an immediate impact on our local economy,” Cllr McInnes added. “There would be schemes in each district area with the potential to bring forward affordable homes, decarbonise existing properties, support more than 1,000 learners in green and net zero skills, and the creation of jobs and apprenticeships.” Cllr McInnes added that as soon as he had any more information about the devolution process, he would update the council.",

Discover why BlockDAG is the top choice for crypto investment in 2024The post BlockDAG Announces New Dashboard Features: A Comparison with DogWiFhat Price and Theta Network Prediction appeared first on Metaverse Post.",
        "content": "To improve your local-language experience, sometimes we employ an auto-translation plugin. Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. The gamification of cryptocurrency is changing how investors interact with digital assets. ‘s latest dashboard feature is a prime example of this trend, offering a gamified experience that engages users. This article will compare BlockDAG with Dogwifhat Price and Theta Network Prediction, highlighting their similarities, differences, and unique selling points. It also aims to provide useful and interesting content to generate excitement about BlockDAG’s mineable network and encourage readers to consider investing in the presale. Theta Fuel (TFUEL), the Theta Network’s operational token, is essential to on-chain processes like deploying smart contracts and compensating relayers for sharing video streams. Analysts and investors often discuss the potential for TFUEL to hit $1. Although it is currently undervalued, a number of factors could affect its price in the future. Technological developments, general market trends in the cryptocurrency industry, and the Theta Network’s overall growth and adoption are all significant factors. The market for TFUEL is anticipated to grow as Theta Network broadens its alliances and applications. Innovations in blockchain technology and the growing popularity of decentralised streaming services also contribute to the increase in its potential value. Reaching the $1 threshold is a difficult but attainable goal, though it takes significant market momentum and positive sentiment to do so. DogWiFhat, although not very well-known, has seen its price rise sharply due to significant investments by large players known as ‘whales’. These big investors have been buying substantial amounts, causing a noticeable increase in the cryptocurrency’s value. This activity has sparked curiosity in the crypto community, with many speculating about the reasons behind these large transactions. Whale activity has given DogWiFhat’s price a brief boost, but overall, the price has been extremely volatile. This has caught the eye of retail investors, who see it as a possible investment opportunity. However, opinions among analysts are mixed. Some believe the whale activity signals confidence in DogWiFhat’s potential, while others warn that the price surge may be short-lived and driven by speculative trading rather than real value. BlockDAG’s latest dashboard feature offers users comprehensive insights and tools to manage their investments. Upon entering the dashboard, users see the latest announcements, ensuring they’re always informed. The dashboard also displays the user’s current rank, wallet balance, and recent transactions, making it easy to track investment progress. The leaderboard showcases the top 30 users with the highest purchases, categorised into Crab, Tortoise, Fish, Shark, and Whale ranks. This gamified ranking system adds competition and motivation for users to increase their investments. The referral screen allows users to see the bonuses earned through their referral links, enhancing the community aspect of BlockDAG. BlockDAG’s platform is built on advanced low-code/no-code technology, simplifying the creation of utility tokens, meme tokens, and NFTs. Users can choose from pre-designed templates and customise them to meet their needs. This intuitive interface democratises access to blockchain technology, allowing individuals and businesses to explore and create on the blockchain. By accelerating development timelines and reducing time to market, BlockDAG fosters a vibrant ecosystem of diverse projects. The platform’s robust and scalable infrastructure supports the growth of decentralised applications, enriching the blockchain landscape with innovation and diversity. Each platform showcases distinct strengths and promising prospects when considering BlockDAG, DogWiFhat, and Theta Network. DogWiFhat has garnered attention due to its substantial whale activity, while Theta Network’s expansion relies on its broadening range of applications and technological advancements. Nevertheless, BlockDAG shines through its innovative dashboard feature and user-friendly interface, making it an appealing option for potential investors. BlockDAG sets itself apart with its user-friendly dashboard, gamified ranking system, and easy-to-use token creation tools, positioning itself as a frontrunner in the crypto industry.

        "description": "Biologist warns of potential environmental impacts of this practice on local sensitive habitat",
        "content": "Tanja Hespe Kerr moved to Royston about 25 years ago. Over the years, she has observed from her front porch, which overlooks Comox Harbour, a trend she says has been worsening. “People drive down the beach, park wherever they want and set up their lawn chairs,” she said. “Sometimes they have fires going and some let their dogs run free. They can stay there for several hours.” “It has been getting worse, especially in the summertime, (and it seems like) the place is getting more popular.” Accessing the intertidal zone via the community’s boat launch on Marine Drive, steps from Royston Road, Hespe Kerr explained that vehicles typically enter the beach at low tide and leave when the tide rises. Though she mentioned that the majority of people are using the boat launch for its intended purpose, the Royston resident is concerned about those using it improperly. On more than one occasion, she observed up to six vehicles driving and parking all over the beach, littering the ground, and becoming mired in the mud as they tried to leave. “One time, a woman got... stuck so badly that the tide came in (and engulfed her car,)” said Hespe Kerr. “It was kind of laughable because her dog was swimming in circles around the vehicle while she was standing beside the car with her coffee cup trying to scoop water out of the inside of her vehicle.” Despite efforts from locals, law enforcement, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to prevent vehicle access to the beach, this illegal practice, in violation of the federal Fisheries Act, persists to this day. “Around five years ago, DFO put up a sign saying ‘Launch and retrieve ramp only. Do not park on the beach,’” said Hespe Kerr. “That sign was taken down in less than 10 days. As soon as it was put up, people were still driving on the beach.” At her wit’s end, the nature enthusiast and avid kayaker took to social media to share her discontent with the current situation. Shortly after, Area A Director Daniel Arbour commented on Hespe Kerr’s post. In a May 23 interview with the Record , Arbour shared that he would address this matter in an upcoming regional district meeting. “I think there’s a lot of value to (this boat launch), but I think that what was not anticipated is people using it to go for random drives around the beach,” said Arbour. “That is definitely not the kind of thing that we want to encourage.” “It’s also not in my intent (to close off the boat launch.) We want to make sure that people continue to have amenities but have respect for the marine environment.” The local politician also added that he is currently in discussions with regional district staff to find ways to prevent motorists from accessing Royston’s intertidal zone. “We’re going to start by laying out our options and strategies,” said Abour. “(We also want to) engage the community and see what’s (needed) to improve the management of that boat launch.” The environmental impacts Although this practice seems to be localized to Royston, as Arbour noticed, registered biologist Dusty Silvester said the damage done by motor vehicles to this small area cannot be neglected. “(Any) additional impacts beyond the baseline are just going to push things a little bit further towards an unbalancing (of the ecosystem),” said Silvester. “If there’s an introduction of a deleterious substance by way of access to the intertidal zone, that’s gonna have an impact not only on that specific location where it occurred but on the broader landscape.” Any pollutant or contaminant, whether introduced willingly or accidentally – such as gasoline, motor oil, or invasive species –could cause harm to this ecosystem, which happens to be a sensitive habitat. “Royston, and other parts of the Comox harbour, are identified (as) red-listed communities which is a provincial regulatory item (which recognizes) that specific areas need to have special management practices put in place to protect (them) and (mitigate negative) impacts. “These sensitive ecosystems are (called) ‘sensitive’ because they’ve already been subject to the impact of human development and urbanization. Adding these extra impacts to a location (that was) somewhat stable, (might cause its loss.)” Potentially affecting everything from aquatic plants to mollusks, fish, birds, and mammals, the biologist highlighted that driving one’s vehicle in this sensitive habitat could have a ripple effect on the region’s broader food web. The impacts could be significant, including ground compaction that could asphyxiate shellfish, the crushing of crustaceans that are food for local birds, and the disruption of herring spawning grounds and smelt feeding areas, which support other aquatic species. Extending beyond the Comox Harbour, Silvester also expressed concerns about the effects of deleterious substances carried by south-flowing currents to the Baynes Sound, another highly ecologically and biologically sensitive area. “That area in particular is well known for being an intertidal agriculture area for the shellfish leases,” Silvester noted. “Would you wanna eat oysters that were exposed to motor oil or gas? Probably not. “I’m sure that (the shellfish industry) have practices in place to protect their harvest... but ultimately (I’m) sure they would want to keep these deleterious substances out of that area.” DFO’s stance In a May 23 statement to the Record , DFO stated that they are taking proactive steps to address the current situation. “Fisheries and Oceans Canada is aware of the issue of off-road vehicle activity in several intertidal foreshores around the Comox Valley and of potential impacts to in-channel and riparian fish habitats associated with this activity,” reads the statement. Additionally, the governmental institution mentioned collaborating with the province to find a long-term solution for managing vehicle access and protecting fish habitats in the Comox Valley area. Under the federal Fisheries Act , it is considered a violation to operate a motor vehicle on intertidal flats (section 34.4) and harmfully impact fish habitats (section 35). If the operator of a vehicle is found guilty of an offence under either of the two sections, they are liable for a fine ranging from $15,000 to $100,000. Members of the public are asked to report observations of illegal off-road activity to the DFO Observe Record Report line at DFO.ORR-ONS.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca or toll-free at 1-800-465-4336.

        "description": "Joe Sperry, a 2022 Lourdes grad, was set to play Division I baseball at Winthrop University after playing two years of junior college ball. But he decommitted after a coaching change at Winthrop.",
        "content": "ROCHESTER — Due to a coaching change at Winthrop University, Joe Sperry has had a change of heart. Sperry, a 2022 Lourdes grad, has spent the last two seasons as a standout for the University of South Carolina Lancaster junior college baseball team. He had planned to play at Division I Winthrop starting this fall, but decided to decommit when the head coach was fired following the 2024 season. “I don’t know who the (new) coach is going to be,” Sperry said. “The staff that recruited me to go there, or at least the coach, isn’t there anymore. So I think I should just find a new relationship with a coach at a different school. I had the option to do that so I chose to do that.” Sperry had to get a release from Winthrop after signing a letter of intent before he could begin the recruitment process again. “They gave me an opportunity to be successful, and I’m grateful for that,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT The right-handed hitting and throwing Sperry was a two-way player at Lancaster. He had a monster hitting season this year as a sophomore. He batted .398 with a lofty 1.264 OPS. He smashed 20 home runs, had 16 doubles, scored 56 runs and had a whopping 84 RBIs in just 54 games. On the mound, the 6-foot-2, 210-pounder went 3-4 with a 6.67 ERA with 56 strikeouts in 54 innings. His fastball topped out at 93 miles per hour and was regularly in the 88-92 range. He has already had some preliminary talks with coaches at other Division I schools, but is still early in the process. He would like to make his decision as soon as possible, but doesn’t want to rush it. “There could be a lot coming up here soon,” he said. “When you reopen your recruitment, it’s just crazy for the first couple of days. You don’t know who’s going to be talking to you or who’s interested.” Sperry is done with the school year and has returned home. He is training at The Yard Sports Training facility in Rochester. He is taking a little break from baseball but will play with the Rochester Honkers of the Northwoods League beginning July 3. “That’s still the same plan for the summer,” he said. “But who knows, I might have to take some time off with the Honkers in order to visit a school or something. But I’m sure they’ll understand that. But hopefully, I’ll find a new home by then.” — — Four area seniors have been selected to play in the Minnesota High School All-Star Baseball Series. The event will be held June 20-22 at Chaska Athletic Park. ADVERTISEMENT The event will feature six teams and each team will play a pair of games. Local seniors who will participate for the South squad include Isaiah Brennan of Byron, Preston Ohm of Zumbrota-Mazeppa, Reid Hartmann of Red Wing and Isaac Nelsen of Lyle/Austin Pacelli. — — Rochester Community and Technical College had six baseball players named MCAC South All-Division for the 2024 spring season. The Yellowjackets finished the season 29-17 and were one of the final four teams in the North Plains District Tournament. Yellowjackets coach Clark Jones was named the South Division Coach of the Year for guiding RCTC to a division title and a 14-2 record. Named to the first team were infielder Griffin Olson of Viroqua, Wis., catcher Augusto Mungarrieta of Valencia-Carabobo, Venezuela, and outfielder Luis Rodriguez of Coamo, Puerto Rico. Rees Campanale of Orlanda, Fla., was named to the second team as a pitcher and the third team as a designated hitter. Others named to the third team were pitcher Jerry Santiago Jr. of Coamo, Puerto Rico, and outfielder Ramon Teran of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. Guy N. Limbeck is a sports writer for the Post Bulletin.

        "description": "Minnesota has a new point person working with the state's Fortune 500 companies, educating them about NIL, all in search of the next 'game changer.'",
        "content": "Imagine a day when Gophers athletes are receiving millions of dollars in name, image and likeness (NIL) payments from Minnesota's big businesses, putting them on par with peers across major college sports. The Gophers are hoping for their own version of what the University of Memphis landed in April with a $25 million NIL contribution from FedEx. Why not dream big on getting an NIL supercharge from among the state's 15 Fortune 500 companies? \"FedEx is a game-changer,\" Gophers athletics director Mark Coyle said. \"There's no doubt.\" Brett Schreiner is the new point person trying to help Coyle and the Gophers attract a big-business NIL investment like the one Tigers athletics scored from the Memphis-based shipping giant. Schreiner was fundraising on the university's academic side before taking on his new role as Senior Manager, Business Development-NIL. He works for Learfield, the official rights holder for the Gophers and hundreds of other collegiate programs. The Gophers were the 13th program within Learfield's national footprint to hire someone for an NIL-specific job. \"We're trying to kind of be on the cutting edge with this role,\" Schreiner said. \"We're trying to work with a lot of companies to make NIL more important to them.\" Schreiner, who played Division III football at Wisconsin-Eau Claire and worked in athletics at his alma mater and Wisconsin-Stout, is trying to change the way big companies think of NIL in Minnesota. The most familiar NIL path involves donations to a collective, such as Dinkytown Athletes , which helps athletes get paid through endorsements. A challenge facing collectives is trying to explain to larger businesses how they can benefit from this process. Why should Minnesota's Fortune 500 companies, such as 3M, Target, Best Buy, Land O'Lakes and General Mills, invest in NIL deals with Gophers athletes? Many of these corporations already donate to the U in other areas. In 2017, 3M announced a 14-year, $11.2 million Gophers athletics naming rights sponsorship with the Mariucci hockey arena. NIL is completely different, but the Gophers have talked to 3M about giving. \"3M and the University of Minnesota have had a strong relationship for nearly 100 years and our involvement in Gopher Athletics is one piece of a larger partnership,\" 3M spokesman Mike Laninga said. \"The Gopher athletic department was very helpful in explaining how the NIL process works and how to properly engage if we chose to do so.\" Schreiner works closely with Jeremiah Carter, Gophers senior associate AD for NIL/Policy and Risk Management . Schreiner explained that a crucial step to convincing corporations to invest in NIL is getting them to see the value of influencer marketing. Using social media and video messaging, athletes can use their personal brand and social media following to bring exposure to companies big and small. \"I don't think this path has gotten as much press,\" Schreiner said. \"This basically gives student-athletes a chance to be influencer marketers for companies. That can mean a lot of different things. This can also teach athletes about developing their entrepreneurship and what they want their brand to be.\" Sure, Timberwolves' Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns or the Vikings' Justin Jefferson are popping up on billboards and ads all over town. Could Gophers athletes be in the running for similar opportunities? A recent example was Gophers women's basketball leading scorer Mara Braun's image being used on a billboard in town to promote Affinity Plus, a Minneapolis credit union. Braun has nearly 28,000 followers on Instagram. \"How can we pair a company with student-athletes and the Gophers' brand to touch the hearts of fans across the state and the nation?\" Schreiner said. \"We can humanize the companies with athletes from the University of Minnesota and not just from the local pro sports teams.\" U.S. companies went from investing an estimated $1.7 billion in influencer marketing in 2016 to $16.4 billion in 2022, according to data from influencermarketinghub.com . Other data from the site projects that investments in influencer marketing by businesses nationally could increase to $24 billion this year. In late February, state legislation stripped the NCAA's ability to regulate NIL in recruiting, opening doors for collectives to negotiate directly with prospects before they signed. That changed NIL in a big way. An agreement Thursday between the NCAA and Power Five conferences opened the door for direct payments to athletes -- another massive-change moment for college sports. This points toward Minnesota and other schools taking control of the NIL process, which would make Schreiner's goal of connecting large companies to NIL funding even more critical for the Gophers. \"It's part of the growth and evolution we will need as an athletics department to best position us for the future,\" Carter said. \"A position like Brett's is going to be relevant and needed no matter where NIL goes.\"",

Strengthening optimism that the European Central Bank, which meets on June 6, could make positive moves towards a rate cut have also buoyed stocks and oil prices. The governor of the Bank of Finland, Olli Rehn, who is also the European Central Bank (ECG) governor, helped matters on Monday by suggesting that rate cuts could begin in June because inflation was closing in on its 2% target across the euro zone and that the drop in inflation was “sustained”. “Thanks to this disinflationary process, inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, and the time is thus ripe in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates,” Rehn said . “This obviously assumes that the disinflationary trend will continue and there will be no further setbacks in the geopolitical situation and energy prices,” he added. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} For April, Euro zone inflation was 2.4%, the seventh consecutive month in which it remained below 3%, with May figures due out on Friday this week expected to be highly anticipated by markets.

        "description": "The final resting place for a U.S. Navy submarine that sank the most Japanese warships in World War II has been found more than 80 years after it was sunk.",
        "content": "( WAVY ) — The final resting place for a U.S. Navy submarine that sank the most Japanese warships in World War II has been found more than 80 years after it was sunk. The USS Harder was found in the South China Sea, more than 3,000 feet below the surface off the coast of the Philippines’ northern island of Luzon, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. The sub, with its 79-man crew, was sunk during a 1944, battle. It was data collected and provided by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea and the Lost 52 Project, that helped find the sunken submarine. Previous submarines found by the Lost 52 Project include the USS Grayback, the USS Stickleback, USS R-12, USS S-26, USS S-28 and the USS Grunion. The first USS Harder was commissioned Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It now rests upright and is relatively intact. The NHHC said the excellent state of preservation of the site and the data it collected allowed it to confirm the wreck as the USS Harder. The first USS Harder (SS 257) was commissioned on Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It was lost at sea with 79 souls aboard on Aug. 24, 1944. “Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,” said NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, U.S. Navy rear admiral (retired). “We are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the ‘Hit ‘em Harder’ submarine that sank the most Japanese warships — in particularly audacious attacks — under her legendary skipper, Cmdr. Sam Dealey.” The Harder made six patrols before it was sunk, with its fifth being the most successful, according to the NHHC, sinking three Japanese destroyers and heavily damaging or destroying two more in four days. Its last known location was in the South China Sea off Luzon during its sixth and last war patrol. Japanese records later revealed Harder fired three torpedoes at its CD-22 vessel, the NHHC said. “The Japanese ship evaded the torpedoes and began a series of depth charge attacks, [with] the fifth depth charge attack sinking Harder and her crew,” the NHHC said. The USS Harder received the Presidential Unit Citation for her first five patrols, six battle stars for World War II service. Dealey was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor “for his outstanding contribution to the war effort on Harder’s fifth patrol.”",

        "content": "The ‘‘Cyber Surakshit Bharat’ initiative of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) was conceptualised with the mission to spread awareness about cyber-crime and build capacities of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and frontline IT officials, across all government departments, for ensuring adequate safety measures to combat the growing menace of cyber crime and enable organizations to defend their digital infrastructures and become future-ready in tackling cyber-attacks. National e-Governance Division (NeGD), under its Capacity Building scheme, organised the 44 th CISO Deep-Dive training programme from May 27–31, 2024 with participants from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and New Delhi at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi. The inaugural session of the programme was attended by senior officials from MeitY, NeGD & IIPA. The deep-dive training specifically aims at educating and enabling CISOs to understand cyber-attacks comprehensively and thoroughly, get necessary exposure in latest technologies of safeguard, and translate the benefits of a resilient e-infrastructure to individual organizations and citizens at large. The training is also focused on providing a holistic view of legal provisions, enabling CISOs to formulate policies in the domain of cyber security and build concrete cyber crisis management plans. The purpose of the programme is to spread awareness, build capacities as well as enable Government departments to take steps to create a cyber resilient eco system. The endeavour of the programme is to sensitise and orient participants on cyber safety and security, thus facilitating the Digital India programme for integrated delivery of various Government services to citizens. It also imparts holistic information and knowledge about cyber security to enable government departments to look after their cyber hygiene, safety and security. Launched in 2018, the CISO training is the first-of-its-kind partnership between the Government and industry consortium under Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. Since June 2018 until May 2024, NeGD has efficaciously conducted 44 batches of CISO deep-dive training programmes for over 1,637 CISOs and frontline IT officials.",

        "content": "In a massive stride for India’s electoral polity, Jammu and Kashmir witnessed its highest poll participation in the last 35 years. The Combined Voter Turnout (VTR) at the polling stations for the entire Union Territory (5 Lok Sabha seats) was 58.46 % in the General Elections 2024 . This significant participation is a testament to the robust democratic spirit and civic engagement of the people in the region. Commission led by CEC Rajiv Kumar along with ECs Sh. Gyanesh Kumar and Sh. Sukhbir Singh Sandhu thanked the polling personnel and security officials over the peaceful conduct of elections in the UT. CEC Sh. Rajiv Kumar while conveying ECIs compliments to the voters of J&K said “This achievement sits on a credible weave of 25% increase in number of contesting candidates since 2019, C-vigil complaints showing enhanced citizen involvement and Suvidha Portal showing 2455 requests for rallies etc., reflecting the steady retaking of the election & campaign space away from hesitation and to fuller participation. Compared this outcome of the layered depth of electoral mobilization and participation, as reminiscent of the fame and deft of the legendary Kashmiri artisanal weave. This active participation is a huge positive for Assembly elections to be held soon so that the democratic process continues to thrive in the Union Territory”. UT of Jammu and Kashmir comprises 5 PCs namely Srinagar, Baramulla, Anantnag Rajouri, Udhampur and Jammu. The combined VTR for the 5 PCs in past few elections is given below: * PC of Ladakh has been removed which was part of erstwhile state of J&K for comparison. ** Graph depicts Gross VTR for 1996-2019; For 2024, VTR is at polling stations The voter turnout of 50.86% from the three Parliamentary Constituencies in the Kashmir Valley echoes the faith of the people in the democratic process. The poll participation percentage witnessed 30 points jump from the last GE in 2019 where it was 19.16% . The three PCs in the valley namely Srinagar, Baramulla and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded VTR of 38.49%, 59.1% and 54.84% respectively, which has been highest in last 3 decades. The other two PCs in the UT namely Udhampur and Jammu recorded 68.27% and 72.22% voter turnout respectively. Note: Due to delimitation exercise, the voter turnout data from previous elections for the PCs, may not be directly comparable *Graph depicts Gross VTR for 1996-2019; For 2024, VTR is at polling stations The historic participation in the UT was realised by earnest efforts of the election and security officials who had worked tirelessly to empower the people of Jammu and Kashmir, especially the youth to participate in the elections. More young people have asserted their faith and embraced democracy in a big way. Another interesting perspective is the electors in the age group of 18-59 years which forms the major part of electors in the UT. The high poll percentage in GE 2024 is reflective of their faith in democracy, which is a positive and heartening development. Age wise distribution of registered electors (percentage of total electors in a PC) in UT of J&K Age Groups Baramulla Srinagar Anantnag-Rajouri Udhampur Jammu 18 – 39 Years 56.02 48.57 54.41 53.57 47.66 40 – 59 Year 30.85 34.87 31.59 32.65 35.28 18 – 59 Years 86.87 83.44 86.00 86.22 82.94 60 & Above 13.13 16.56 14.00 13.78 17.06 The Commission has also enabled Kashmiri migrant voters residing at various relief camps in Delhi, Jammu, and Udhampur to also have the option of voting in person at designated special polling stations or using postal ballot. 21 Special Polling Stations were established at Jammu, 1 at Udhampur and 4 at Delhi. Ladakh, which was constituted as a separate Union Territory in 2019, also saw an enthusiastic response to the call of democracy as reflected in the VTR of 71.82%. Gross Voter Turnout in past few elections in each PC PC/Year 2019 2014 2009 2004 1999 1998 1996 1989 Srinagar 14.43% 25.86% 25.55% 18.57% 11.93% 30.06% 40.94% Uncontested Baramulla 34.6% 39.14% 41.84% 35.65% 27.79% 41.94% 46.65% 5.48% Anantnag 8.98% 28.84% 27.10% 15.04% 14.32% 28.15% 50.20% 5.07% Udhampur 70.15% 70.95% 44.88% 45.09% 39.65% 51.45% 53.29% 39.45% Jammu 72.5% 67.99% 49.06% 44.49% 46.77% 54.72% 48.18% 56.89% As part of awareness and outreach, wide range of activities were organized as part of SVEEP on the field in Jammu and Kashmir for the General Elections 2024. Office of the Chief Electoral Officer, J&K organised adventure sports events, symposiums, awareness rallies, nukkad natak and numerous other events to propagate the message of voting.

        "description": "The unclaimed coins were most likely buried in the medieval-era, between 1100 and 1125, during a period of political turmoil",
        "content": "A woman was out taking a casual stroll when she stumbled into a treasure trove in the Czech Republic. She found a ceramic pot containing thousands of coins in a field in the country’s Kutnohorsk Region, perhaps buried for a rainy day by its owner during a tumultuous period nearly 900 years ago. While the pot was found broken, likely due to agricultural work done in the area, but archeologists were able to use metal detectors to unearth more than 2,150 silver coins, known as denarii, scattered about. The hoard of rare coins is one of the most significant finds of the decade, the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic said in a news release . The unclaimed denarii were most likely buried in the medieval era, between 1100 and 1125, during a period of political turmoil, according to Filip Velímský, an archeologist with the institute. “It was probably placed in its place during the first quarter of the 12th century, at a time of internal political instability,” he was quoted in Popular Mechanics as saying. “At that time, there were disputes in the country between the members of the Přemysl dynasty about the princely throne of Prague.” How much the coins were worth at the time isn’t known due to lack of available data, but it was likely a significant sum. Velímský compared the find to winning the lottery. “It was a huge amount, unimaginable for an ordinary person and at the same time unaffordable. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.” During the middle ages, the Kutnohorsku rival princes had frequent battles for the throne of nearby Prague. The coins were minted in Prague between 1085 and 1107 and date back to the reign of Přemysl rulers King Vratislav II, and princes Břetislav II and Bořivoje II. The buried treasure could be war loot or cash meant to pay wages, experts say. The denarii were made of a silver alloy, which included copper, lead and other trace metals. X-ray imaging and spectral analysis will help determine the precise composition, which will help date the coins. Experts expect to restore and document the artifacts in the coming year. The coins are expected to be displayed at a museum in Kutnohorsk by 2025. Our website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

        "content": "(Stacker) – Jam-packed parking lots, gridlocked roads, bustling crosswalks—these aren’t scenes from New York City or Los Angeles but from some of the country’s most popular national parks. According to reports from the National Park Service, destinations like Arches and Rocky Mountain National Parks have seen record visitation numbers in recent years, resulting in unprecedented overcrowding. Fortunately, the National Park Service is already taking steps to save our national parks from being visited to death. Most notably, several of the nation’s most-visited parks have implemented permit systems, which require visitors to make advance reservations to enter. This helps park officials manage traffic flow and prevents parks from becoming overwhelmed by numbers they can’t accommodate. These permit systems aren’t without their critics, as some have said this measure can make it much more difficult for visitors to experience the national parks. But it’s important to note that most of these permit systems only apply during peak visitation season (namely, the summer months), so you can still enjoy a spontaneous national park trip during much of the rest of the year—at least for now. Using information from Outside and the National Park Service , Stacker compiled a list of six national parks that will require entry permits in 2024, excluding parks that only require permits for specific landmarks. Don’t forget that permit reservation fees won’t cover national park entrance fees, typically charged when you enter the park. Read on to learn where you’ll need a permit—and how to get one—this year. Yosemite first instituted its timed entry system in 2020 to limit visitor numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, but even when cases began to subside, Yosemite kept the permit system around to alleviate longstanding overcrowding issues. After removing the system for one year in 2023, the park has brought back the entry permit requirement for 2024. Permits have been required to enter the park on weekends and holidays since April 13 and will be required every day from July 1 through Aug. 16. From Aug. 17 through Oct. 27, permits will only be required on weekends and holidays again. Most permits were released on Jan. 5 this year, but for last-minute trip planners, further permits can be reserved seven days before your expected arrival date. Inside Yosemite, you can marvel at the views of El Capitan and Half Dome or hike one of the park’s many scenic trails, all while enjoying the benefits of fewer crowds. Mount Rainier National Park has seen a 40% uptick in visitor numbers over the past 10 years. To preserve the park’s delicate environment and offer an improved visitor experience, Mount Rainier will require permits to enter both the Paradise and Sunrise Corridors during peak visitation days in 2024. Reservations are needed for Paradise Corridor from May 24 to Sept. 2, while Sunrise Corridor requires entry permits from July 4 to Sept. 2. Both the Sunrise and Paradise areas offer their own unique attractions—Sunrise features stunning views of Mount Rainier and the Cascade Range, while Paradise hosts the park’s main visitor center and abundant wildflower meadows. You’ll need to reserve two separate permits if you want to visit both spots this summer, but if the timed entry system works according to plan, you hopefully won’t have to share the park with too many other tourists. Anyone who’s visited Arches National Park in recent years won’t be surprised to find it on this list. After experiencing significant overcrowding for more than a decade, Arches implemented a timed entry program in 2022. Now in its third year, the system continues to evolve to accommodate visitors and provide the best experience possible. Entry permits are released in monthly blocks three months before each month (for example, permits for September visits are released on June 1). A small number of additional permits are released one day ahead of time, which allows for a certain degree of spontaneity in planning your trip, though these permits may get snapped up quickly. Explore the park’s namesake sandstone foundations and learn more about the unique combination of elements that led to their creation, keeping an eye out for wildlife like bighorn sheep that have made a home in this desert landscape. From May 24 through Oct. 20, every vehicle that enters Rocky Mountain National Park will need a timed entry permit . There are two different types of permits: Timed Entry+, which includes popular destinations along Bear Lake Road, and the regular Timed Entry option, which excludes Bear Lake access. You’ll have to pay close attention as you reserve your permit. It might seem onerous to plan your trip activities so far in advance. But considering you’re helping preserve the park’s gorgeous, one-of-a-kind alpine landscapes using the timed entry system, a little extra legwork doesn’t seem so bad. When hiking to Lake Haiyaha or soaking up the sights at Moraine Park, your permit will be all the more worth it. As most of its attractions are deep underground, Carlsbad Caverns is slightly different from the other parks on this list. Carlsbad requires timed entry permits 362 days a year , from January through December. The only exceptions are Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s, when the park is closed to the public. But park officials have long restricted entry to Carlsbad Caverns, reducing strain on the sprawling cave system and karst formations. You can view the caves on ranger-guided tours, which depart from the visitor center several times a day, or you can hike down alone. In the summer of 2024, Glacier National Park will require visitors to have a vehicle reservation to access Going-to-the-Sun Road, the North Fork area, and Many Glacier valley. Entry to these areas will be restricted between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. from May 24 through Sept. 8, exact start dates vary with each location. If you have your trip dates set ahead of time, try to snag one of the reservations available 120 days (four months) before your trip. If you’re unsure, log in to recreation.gov early the day before your arrival to book a permit. Those reservations will grant you access to some of the most spectacular natural landscapes in the western U.S. Going-to-the-Sun Road winds past snowy Rocky Mountain peaks, while Many Glacier valley features dramatic alpine scenery that draws hikers from all over the world.

        "description": "Go private allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability back to Canada's biggest bookstore",
        "content": "TORONTO — shareholders have voted to approve a deal that will see the retailer become a private company. Shareholders voted Monday in favour of a $2.50 per share offer from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P., which have a 56 per cent stake in Indigo and are owned by , the spouse of Indigo chief executive . The Trilogy companies originally offered $2.25 per share but raised their bid in April. “We are pleased with the result of today’s vote and look forward to continuing our work on Indigo’s transformation strategy,” Reisman said in a statement following the vote. “We remain deeply committed to our customers and to all our stakeholders as we work together to inspire reading and enrich the lives of booklovers across the country.” Indigo spokesperson Madison Downey said in an email to The Canadian Press that Trilogy would not be commenting on the vote. For Trilogy’s offer to be accepted, it required approval by a two-thirds majority vote of Indigo shareholders and a simple majority vote by shareholders not linked to Trilogy and its affiliates. Some 95.09 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at the meeting Monday were in favour of accepting the deal. Just shy of 83 per cent of the votes from shareholders not linked to Trilogy and affiliates were in support of the offer. The privatization allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability and growth back to Canada’s biggest bookstore. “The rationale is not to be saddled with public reporting responsibilities because Indigo has been through a lot,” said Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto, in February, when the Trilogy firms made their offer. Trilogy now faces a hefty amount of work. Indigo is still recovering from a cyber attack that downed its website for a lengthy period last year, a series of quarterly losses leading up to a January layoff, and a succession of changes that saw four of 10 board members depart last year with one claiming mistreatment and “a loss of confidence in board leadership.” Reisman, who retired amid the turmoil, returned within months to helm Indigo. The issues have played out as inflation and high interest rates make many Canadians think twice about opening their wallets, especially for the discretionary items Indigo is known for. The trend cropped up particularly in the holiday season, when Indigo executives admitted they had overbought merchandise and stocked an assortment of merchandise they found customers weren’t looking for in the final weeks before Christmas. “Despite all their best efforts, they are not doing well,” Kai Li, the Canada Research Chair in corporate governance who teaches at the University of British Columbia, said of Indigo in February. “They are bleeding cash.” To turn things around, Indigo has been carrying out a transformation plan since at least November. It’s offered few specifics, but Reisman, who founded the chain in 1996, has said it is meant to “return Indigo to both growth and profitability.” In the months since she mentioned the plan, some stores have seen wellness products and the popular American Girl dolls culled from their shelves and Columbus Cafe & Co. has moved into some Indigo spaces previously held by Starbucks. Reisman has also pledged in newsletters to bring back its digital inventory search kiosks, program more events and add seating to more stores. Trilogy hasn’t said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted, likely because the money offered reflected a 69 per cent premium on the share price of $1.48 that Indigo had when Trilogy first made its bid. Indigo’s share price sat at $2.48 ahead of the Monday vote. Last month, the offer garnered the support from a special committee of independent directors Indigo formed to assess the deal. Earlier this month, Indigo also said that leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders approve the deal. Indigo has said it expects the transaction to close in June and its shares to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange sometime after.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal ‘not sure’ of French Open return after loss to Alexander Zverev",
        "content": "Listen to Story Tennis legend Rafael Nadal said that he’s unsure of Roland Garros 2024 being his last appearance in the French Open after being knocked out by Alexander Zverev on Monday, May 27. Notably, Zverev emerged victorious against the 14-time French Open champion with a scoreline of 3-6, 6-7, 3-6. Despite being dominated by his opponent for most of the three-hour-long game , Nadal continued to fight his way back into the match through some of his vintage shots. Following his loss, the Spaniard thanked the crowd for their tremendous support throughout the game and said that he was not sure whether it would be his last appearance in the tournament ever. “The amount of energy.. it’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know if it’s gonna be the last time here in front of all of you. I’m not sure. But if it’s the last time I enjoyed it. The crowd was amazing during the whole week of preparation. Today the feelings I have are difficult to describe in words. For me it so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most,” Nadal said after the game. We love you too Rafa, and we hope to see you again next year ðçá #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/7hX4Gw46WE — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 “I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than 2 months ago. Maybe in 2 months I say it’s enough. But it’s something I don’t feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. That’s going to be another chance,” he added. Notably, Rolland Garros 2024 was Nadal’s first Grand Slam appearance of the year after he missed out on the Australian open. The 22-time Grand Slam winner got a rousing reception upon his arrival at the court where he has lived some of the highest points of his career. The southpaw was handed just the fourth loss of his illustrious career at the Rolland Garros as Zverev became just the third man to beat him at the grand event. Earlier, Robin Soderling (2009) and Novak Djokovic (2015 and 2021) have also emerged victorious against Nadal in the competition.",

It also released the Monthly Rainfall and Temperature Forecast for June 2024 in a virtual media interaction today in New Delhi. Dr. Mritunjya Mohapatra, Director General of Meteorology, presented the forecast. Highlights of the Long Range forecast Quantitatively, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106% of the long period average (LPA) with a model error of ± 4%. Thus, Above Normal rainfall is most likely over the country as a whole during the monsoon season (June to September), 2024. The southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September, 2024) rainfall is most likely to be above normal over Central India and South Peninsular India (>106% of LPA), normal over Northwest India (92-108% of LPA) and below normal over Northeast India (106% of LPA). Above Normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country except many areas of northern part of Northwest India, Northeast India and eastern part of the Central India and adjoining areas of east India, where below normal to normal rainfall is most likely. Normal rainfall (92-108% of LPA) is most likely over the country as a whole during June, 2024. The above normal monthly rainfall is most likely over most areas of the south peninsula, and adjoining areas of central India and over isolated areas of Northwest and Northeast India. Below normal rainfall is most likely over many areas of northern and eastern parts of Northwest India and eastern part of Central India, and over some areas over Northeast India and southeastern part of South Peninsula. In June, above-normal monthly maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country, except many parts of the southern peninsular India, where normal to below-normal temperatures are most likely. Above-normal monthly minimum temperatures are likely across most parts of the country, except extreme northern parts of northwest India and a few pockets of east and northeast India, where normal to below-normal minimum temperatures are most likely. During June, above-normal heatwave days are likely over most areas of Northwest India and adjoining areas of Central India. The strong El Niño conditions observed over equatorial Pacific in the beginning of this year have weakened rapidly into weak El Niño conditions and currently transitioning towards ENSO neutral conditions. The latest Climate model forecasts indicate ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to get established during the beginning of the monsoon season and La Niña conditions are likely to develop during the later part of the monsoon season. At present, neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. The latest forecasts from many global climate models indicate positive IOD conditions are likely to develop during the monsoon season.",

        "content": "This Morning's Sian Welby found herself in a bit of a pickle when she had to wee on the side of the road during a traffic jam. Caught in a gruelling three-and-a-half-hour Bank Holiday traffic jam, the pregnant TV presenter opened up about how she couldn't hold it in any longer. At 37 weeks pregnant, Sian had no choice but to dash out of her car and seek refuge behind a bush for a quick relief. However, her roadside emergency took a painful turn as the chosen bush was riddled with nettles. The hilarious ordeal was caught on camera, showing Sian making a frantic sprint for a less thorny spot. Discussing the incident on Monday's This Morning show (May 27), Sian recounted: \"I had to do a wee in the middle of the road. I had to run into the bush and I didn't dare go in there as it was full of brambles and nettles.\" \"So then I was stuck and I ran to the side of the car. I'm 37 weeks pregnant\", reports the Daily Star . The pregnant star needed a wee during a traffic jam and rushed to the side of the road ( Image: ITV) The studio erupted in laughter as hosts Dermot O'Leary and Josie Gibson watched the clip. Even Giles Brandreth was shocked that the footage aired, exclaiming to Sian: \"Is this you coming back from your wee? \" As Sian laughed, Giles added: \"Now I've seen it all. Morning television isn't what it used to be, is it? \". Dermot chimed in with a cheeky comment: \"The mystique is definitely gone. But who doesn't love a pee-pee rustique from time to time.\" Sian responded: \"Do you know what, it was exhilarating.\" Siân announced that she was pregnant whilst live on Capital Breakfast alongside her co-hosts Roman Kemp and Chris Stark in February. She said: \"I've got a bit of an announcement for you! I'm pregnant! I don't know how I've managed to keep it from you for so long. [...] The lies, the deceit, the mocktails!\" She added: \"I couldn't wait to tell you. [...] This is a whole new journey for me and I want to take you all on it with me, and don't worry I'm not going anywhere!

        "content": "Harry Warden is set to return from the dead, as Bloody Disgusting reports that Blumhouse is actively working on a new movie in the My Bloody Valentine series. The last entry was the 3D remake in 2009. The remake, and the original 1981 movie, both follow a killer in a miner outfit that may or may not be the ghost of Harry Warden, a deranged murderer from years before. His weapon of choice is usually a pickaxe. The 2009 remake was directed by Patrick Lussier and starred Jensen Ackles and Jamie King. It ended up earning $100.7 million at the box office on a $14 million budget. In spite of the success and the tease of a sequel, it never happened.",

The Monegasque outfit are willing to let him leave this summer but want at least €25m. He has also attracted attention from over the last few months. In the meantime, Milan have given up on Ouedraogo, despite their appreciation of the Schalke talent, due to poor relations with his entourage.",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory .",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal only lost his fourth match in 116 matches since winning on debut in 2005, going down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to world number four Alexander Zverev. New Delhi: Rafael Nadal couldn’t definitively say whether it would be his final appearance at the French Open after getting beatean in the first round in Paris on Monday. The record 14-time champion only lost his fourth match in 116 matches since winning on debut in 2005, going down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to world number four Alexander Zverev. It was the Spaniard’s first defeat in the opening round of the tournament that came after he has battled multiple injuries throughout the year, having missed the Australian Open. He turns 38 on June 3 and in all likelyhood was his final appreance in his record-breaking French Open career. Though Nadal wasn;t immediately willing to confirm it. “It is difficult for me to talk, I don’t know if it’s the last time I’ll be here in front of all of you,” he said. “Honestly, I am not sure. If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most. “It’s hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago,” Nadal said. “Maybe in two months I say it’s enough. That is something I don’t feel yet.” Nadal confirmed his plans of competing at the 2024 Paris Olympics in Paris in two months “I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared,” he said as the crowd cheered. We love you too Rafa, and we hope to see you again next year 🧡 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/7hX4Gw46WE — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 ‘Thank you’ “I don’t know what to say. Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour,” Zverev said. “I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment.” Nadal has been crippled by injuries in recent months, allowing him to play only four tounaments since January of last year. It has seen him plummet to 275 in the ATP rankings and enter the French Open unseeded. He had earlier said that 2024 would be his last year on the ATP tour though prior to his opening round match he has said to “100% keep the door open”. But despite chants of “Rafa, Rafa” egging him on Court Philippe Chatrier, the 22 Grand Slam champion was under pressure against Zverev. There are no words. Merci, Rafa 🫶 #RolandGarros @RafaelNadal pic.twitter.com/znj0j42Qbf — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 But as the in-form Zverev dominated the proceedings and Nadal looked weary the support for him was stunned into silence. They were left to appreciate the achivements of the Spaniard as he lost the contest that stretched over three hours. Zverev’s celebration after the match was muted as he handed over the microphone for Nadal to deliver a courtside interview and clapped him off from the court. Zverev’s heartfull words to Nadal 🧡 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/liz9YdMDGY — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 Nadal, as always, was grateful for the gesture, thanking Zverev, wishing him good luck for the rest of the tournament and thanked the crowd who had been behind him throughout the years. “The amount of feelings I had on this court throughout my career, I didn’t think I would be here almost 38 with all of the success. It has been a very beautiful process,” said Nadal, as he left the court to a standing ovation.",

        "content": "The West Lothian club announced on Monday that he will remain in charge in the wake of relegation from the Premiership. The Lions won only five of their 38 league fixtures as they finished a grim campaign ten points adrift at the foot of the table, leading to the manager’s future becoming a talking point. However, Martindale’s near-decade of “dedication” to the club, including his largely positive stint as manager since November 2020, have been taken into consideration by directors John McIlvogue, John Ward and Dave Black. The club also acknowledged that the team had been hindered by the fact Martindale’s playing budget was significantly cut for the campaign just finished. “There is no getting away from the fact that this season has been disappointing,” it read. “Every single member of staff inside the building is hurting with how the year transpired and we know full well that the same disappointment and upset is shared amongst our supporters. “However, we now have an opportunity to regroup, both on the park and in the stands, but we can only do with everyone pulling in the same direction. “David has been involved with the coaching set-up here for almost ten years now. “His involvement in the dugout has seen us lift a League One title, win the Premiership play-offs, two top-six finishes, two seasons just missing out on the top six on the final game before the split, a national cup final appearance and a club record six consecutive seasons in the top flight. “For a club of our size and stature, that is an incredible return – and a list of achievements that David deserves huge credit for. “As your board, we believe that David has earned the right to remain as first-team manager and have the opportunity to try to steer us back to the Premiership. “His commitment and dedication to the club over the years is unrivalled and whilst that alone can’t be the sole driver behind remaining in charge, his qualities as a manager, as a coach and as a leader give us full confidence that David is the man we want in charge of this football club going forward.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "content": "Displaying a firm resolve towards finding green and sustainable transport solutions, the Indian Army has collaborated with Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) for demonstration trials of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus technology. The Indian Army is known for its commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Indian Army and the IOCL in presence of General Manoj Pande, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) and Mr Shrikant Madhav Vaidya, Chairman of Indian Oil. During the event, one Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus was received by the Indian Army. This marks the commencement of mutually beneficial partnership between Indian Army and IOCL. The MoU emphasised the commitment to fostering innovation and advancing sustainable transport solutions for the future. Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology offers a clean and efficient alternative by converting Hydrogen gas into electricity through an electro-chemical process. The process leaves water vapour as the only by product, thus ensuring zero emission. The Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus has a seating capacity of 37 passengers. It promises an impressive mileage of 250-300 km on a full 30 kg onboard tank of Hydrogen fuel. Notably, on 21 st March 2023, the Indian Army became the first government entity to ink an MoU with National Thermal Power Corporation Renewable Energy Limited for installation of Green Hydrogen based Microgrid Power Plants along the Northern Borders. A pilot project is being setup at Chushul, where a 200 Kilo Watt Green Hydrogen based Microgram will provide 24×7 clean electricity to troops deployed in inhospitable terrain and extreme climatic conditions. With a focus on innovation and environmental responsibility, the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus endeavour between Indian Army and IOCL represents a significant stride and pave the way for a cleaner and greener transport solutions.",

        "description": "A doctoral thesis at the University of Oslo's Faculty of Dentistry points to the possibility of reconsidering standard treatment routines, aiming to improve the quality of life for people who survive head and neck cancer.",
        "content": "A doctoral thesis at the University of Oslo's Faculty of Dentistry points to the possibility of reconsidering standard treatment routines, aiming to improve the quality of life for people who survive head and neck cancer. Globally, head and neck cancer accounts for 5% of all cancer types , with a mortality rate of 50%. However, in the Nordic countries, head and neck cancer accounts for only 2.6% of all cancers, with a mortality rate of just 30%. But more survivors mean that many must live with extensive damage and side effects after cancer and cancer treatment. \"It is the exposed and vulnerable location that makes head and neck cancer one of the most mutilating types of cancer,\" explains Lisa Printzell. She works as a specialist in oral prosthetics at the ear, nose, and throat department at Rikshospitalet. Recently, she completed a doctorate at the University of Oslo, where she investigated an alternative rehabilitation pathway for head and neck cancer patients. \"Damage from surgery and radiation therapy can make it difficult for patients to chew, swallow, and speak afterward,\" says Printzell. In some, their appearance changes significantly, which they may find incompatible with a normal or dignified life. Printzell also explains that before patients can receive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, a number of teeth often need to be removed to prevent infections. \"For most patients, this news comes as a great shock. Some find the news of having to pull teeth almost as brutal as the diagnosis of serious cancer,\" says the researcher. \"Anatomical changes after cancer surgery can create significant functional and aesthetic challenges. However, the side effects of radiation therapy are perhaps what make oral rehabilitation most demanding,\" Printzell explains. Patients often have thin, dry, and very fragile oral mucosa after radiation therapy, making it difficult to use ordinary dental prostheses that rest on toothless jaws. \"To achieve satisfactory oral rehabilitation in these patients, dental implants are often used to support and attach prostheses or other dental replacements,\" Printzell explains. Dental implants are titanium screws that are surgically inserted and integrated into the patient's jawbone. These so-called osseointegrated implants then serve as an attachment for various types of dental replacements. A major challenge in this context is that irradiated tissue has a reduced ability to heal, leading to reduced and uncertain integration (osseointegration) of dental implants. \"The survival of dental implants placed in irradiated jawbones is significantly lower than those placed in non-irradiated patients,\" says Printzell. She notes that any surgical procedure in previously irradiated jawbone carries an increased risk of infection. Besides the lack of healing ability, it can, in the worst case, result in osteoradionecrosis, where the jawbone dies as a result of the radiation treatment. Due to the risks involved, rehabilitation with dental implants for these patients is not considered until at least one year after the completion of radiation therapy. Patients experience this as a long waiting period with significantly reduced quality of life. \"Therefore, we need research on alternative methods. At the very least, methods that can provide a faster oral rehabilitation for the group of these patients who need it the most,\" explains Printzell. One possibility for this is to install the implants before radiation therapy starts, in connection with cancer surgery or tooth extraction. Printzell explains that so-called primary installation of implants is not unknown. Studies have shown an increased use of this approach in the past decade, always justified by the increased quality of life for patients. However, despite the undeniable benefits of faster oral rehabilitation, clinicians remain somewhat hesitant and skeptical of this approach. One reason for this is the concern about the \"backscatter effect,\" which occurs when radiation hits the implants. \"When ionizing radiation is directed at a cancerous tumor and there is a titanium implant in the radiation field, not all the radiation will penetrate the metal. Instead, it will reflect back to the surrounding tissue,\" Printzell explains. Healthy cells on the implant's surface will then receive a higher radiation dose and may suffer more damage than they would if there were no implant present. \"There is a concern that this will negatively affect the ongoing osseointegration (healing) of the implant, and thereby also the survival of the implant,\" says Printzell. Printzell notes that very little is known about how harmful this backscatter effect really is. Therefore, she and her colleagues wanted to investigate this further. They assessed the effect of backscatter radiation from titanium on two of the most important cell types for bone healing and osseointegration of dental implants . These cell types are called human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts. Human mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to develop into many different cell types, including osteoblasts, which are the precursors to mature bone cells. Printzell adds, \"In our experiments, these cells were seeded on two different titanium surfaces, as well as a plastic surface. The cells were then exposed to various doses of ionizing gamma radiation, relevant to what is used in cancer treatment. The titanium surfaces generated backscatter radiation to the cells, while the plastic surface represented 'jawbone without an implant present.'\" In cancer treatment, radiation doses are measured in gray (Gy). Gray is the international unit for measuring absorbed radiation dose. Patients typically receive radiation therapy in small doses (often 2 Gy) 5 days a week until the total dose (50–70 Gy) is achieved after 5–7 weeks. The purpose of administering many small doses over time is to give healthy cells in the radiation field time to repair minor DNA damage between doses. \"We found that backscatter radiation from titanium generated as much as a 40% increased radiation dose to the cells closest to the titanium surface. However, the lowest doses (2 and 6 Gy) caused minimal effect on the cells,\" says Printzell. Higher radiation dose (10 Gy) significantly reduced the number of osteoblasts (bone-producing cells) on titanium surfaces compared to plastic surfaces but increased the surviving cells' ability to develop into mature bone cells. \"We also found that the highest dose of 10 Gy inhibited both cell types' ability to move from one place to another on titanium, while lower doses (2 and 6 Gy) neither caused significant DNA damage nor affected the cells' ability to move. \"The results indicate that backscatter radiation from titanium at doses of 2 Gy does not cause greater cell damage than the same dose does without an implant present,\" says Printzell. She says more research is, of course, needed to establish this treatment as the first choice for this patient group. \"Nevertheless, we can conclude that our findings are important for the question of whether backscatter radiation from titanium implants should be a reason to avoid the so-called primary installation of implants in patients who are to undergo radiation therapy.\" Printzell explains that when they started this study, they knew there is an increased risk of placing implants in previously irradiated jawbone. What they did not know was whether it involves greater, lower, or the same risk to insert implants in these patients just before they undergo radiation therapy. \"What we did know, and still know today, is that implant-supported dental replacements significantly increase the quality of life for head and neck cancer patients, and the earlier the patient can be rehabilitated in this way, the shorter the road back to a somewhat normal life,\" says Printzell.

        "description": "Losing Acuna is a brutal blow for a Braves team with grand aspirations.",
        "content": "The Braves entered 2024 with the second-best World Series odds, and it now appears that the wheels are falling off in Atlanta. Ronald Acuna Jr. suffered an ACL tear Sunday in non-contact injury that will sideline him for the rest of the season and seismically shifts the National League landscape. Prior to the injury, the Braves were +425 to win the World Series, according to BetMGM , but have fallen off massively, dropping to +800 odds to win the illustrious last game of the season. Their chances of winning the NL East also dropped dramatically, from near pick ’em status down to +160, as the Phillies continue their torrid stretch where they have opened up a six-game lead in the division. Philadelphia (38-16) has the league’s best winning percentage, grabbing a six-game lead on the Braves (30-20) entering Memorial Day. But the loss of Acuna seriously downgrades Atlanta’s hope for a few big wins come October — and at least raises questions about whether Atlanta can even reach the postseason. The Braves opened the season at -3000 to make the playoffs and are sitting at an impressive -10000 on FanDuel even after the injury, with the best odds to fade them to make the playoffs being 22/1 at DraftKings . But it’s tough to fade the Braves to make the playoffs even without Acuna, as baseball has expanded the playoffs to the point that the Mets are still just four games back of the third and final wild-card spot despite being eight games under .500. Losing Acuna is a brutal blow for a Braves team with grand aspirations, with Acuna Jr. winning his first MVP last year to help Atlanta grab the NL’s No. 1 seed. He had been off to a slow start this year, though, hitting just four homers with a .250/.351/.365 slash line, a far cry from last year’s .337/.416/.596 numbers. The fact that the Braves are 10 games over despite Acuna’s slow start, losing Spencer Strider for the season after two starts and catcher Sean Murphy being sidelined for all but one game entering Monday is nothing short of impressive and shows just how deep they are organizationally. But now it’s a different animal for the Braves to pull this off without their best player. The Phillies could’ve been had at -135 on Bet365 after the injury to win the NL East, but that has ballooned massively to -190. That’s not the worst bet considering all the Braves have to deal with now as their team completely changes. PICK: Phillies win NL East (-190, FanDuel )",

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21): Look and act sharp as the week begins and make sure your rivals get the impression that you are not the sort of person who can be taken advantage of. Image is important at the best of times but now it could be crucial to your long-term success. GEMINI (May 22 - June 21): Your head may be full of amazing ideas but there is no way you are going to be able to make use of them all, so pick the best three ideas and junk the rest. What you don’t do today is almost as important as what you do do. CANCER (June 22 - July 23): Don’t waste time and energy on activities that are unlikely to turn a profit for quite some time. Focus on what you do best and aim to see some kind of return on your efforts in a matter of days rather than weeks or months. LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23): There are precious few limitations or restrictions being imposed on you now, so feel free to come and go as you please and don’t think you have to tone down your ambitions just to please other people. Think only of pleasing yourself. VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23): Give yourself permission to dream an impossible dream and ignore those who say you don’t stand a chance of success. It’s that kind of thinking that has held you back in the past and you have no intention of letting it hold you back now. LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23): By all means free your imagination today but don’t get carried away to such an extent that you start believing in unicorns and other mythical beasts. Unless you are writing fiction, of course, in which case it might just be a best-seller! SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22): Partners and colleagues will be rather demanding today and like it or not you are going to have to cut back on your own plans so you have more time to assist them. Do so with good grace because they will do the same for you later on. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21): You may not be the touchy-feely sort but it will pay you to be more open about your emotions today. If you let loved ones know what is bugging you they will go out of their way to ease your fears and put a smile back on your face. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20): You may think you have got a considerable amount of leeway on the work front but don’t push your luck too far today or your boss could get annoyed with you. You’re on the same side and should be pulling in the same direction. AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19): Others may say you are being selfish for putting your own needs first but with so much cosmic activity working in your favor now you would be a fool not to. Don’t look back from later in the year and wish you had been more ambitious. PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20): The most important thing now is that you set yourself a schedule and stick to it religiously. Others will try to get you to change it as the week goes on but you must be stubborn and refuse to do more than you know will be good for you. BIRTHDAY MONDAY: Forget about taking the easy route through life and aim to be more daring and adventurous over the coming 12 months. The more some people say you are aiming too high the more you must strive to prove them wrong. Act as if there are no limits. Discover more about yourself at sallybrompton.com See a typo/mistake?

        "description": "The Palm Beach Health Network has become the latest health provider accused of illegally sharing identities and private health information of its patients with the social media company Meta, owner of Facebook.",
        "content": "The Palm Beach Health Network has become the latest health provider accused of illegally sharing identities and private health information of its patients with the social media company Meta, owner of Facebook. A lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach says the health network's websites share code with Meta that enables patients to be targeted with advertising on Facebook based on \"highly sensitive personal information\" they share. It names as defendants the Palm Beach Health Network Physicians Group, doing business as Palm Beach Health Network, and Palm Beach Gardens Community Hospital, doing business as Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. Palm Beach Health Network is the largest health care network in Palm Beach County, the suit states. It includes a large multi-specialty physician group, ambulatory surgery centers, outpatient diagnostic facilities, and six hospital and care centers, including Delray Medical Center, Good Samaritan Medical Center, Palm Beach Children's Hospital, St. Mary's Medical Center, West Boca Medical Center and Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. The network, according to the lawsuit, has \"disregarded the privacy rights of their patients who used their web properties by intentionally, willfully, recklessly and/or negligently failing to implement adequate and reasonable measures to ensure that the users' personally identifiable information and protected health information was safeguarded.\" Andrew Lofholm, spokesman for the network, said on Thursday, \"We are not commenting on that,\" referring to the lawsuit. The suit claims that the network installed Facebook's Meta Pixel and other invisible third-party tracking technology on its websites to intercept patients' information \"with the express purpose\" of disclosing the information to Meta and other third parties. Meta encourages businesses to install its tracking code and does not offer any tools that allow users \"to opt out of such extensive tracking,\" the suit states, adding, \"even the most sophisticated users who enable cookie blockers cannot avoid having their information tracked through the various Meta tracking tools.\" The practice violates the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as state and federal law, the suit claims. The technology collects patient data regardless of whether they have a Facebook account, the suit states. \"Facebook maintains 'shadow profiles' on users without Facebook accounts and links information collected via the Pixel to the user's real-world identity using their shadow profile,\" it says. The lawsuit alleges that its lead plaintiff, Ron Prosky, used Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center's website and patient portal to search for doctors, make appointments, review medical treatments and review his medical records, including imaging results, for a specific health issue that the publicly available version of the lawsuit redacted. Prosky then began receiving advertisements on his Facebook account \"relating to his particular medical conditions and treatments,\" the suit claims. After receiving information about patients and their conditions, \"Meta then shares the information with additional unauthorized third parties whose businesses and advertisements are related to those conditions,\" the suit claims. Prosky relied on the health network's privacy policies and reasonably expected it would safeguard his private information, the suit alleges. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of claims since 2022 accusing health networks across the United States of illegally sharing patient information with third parties such as Facebook and Google. In January, North Carolina-based Norvant Health agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle claims against it. In 2022, the company admitted that 1.3 million patients' information was leaked to Facebook, saying Pixel was \"configured incorrectly.\" In 2023, Advocate Aurora Health agreed to pay $12.25 million to settle multiple lawsuits alleging pixel tracking tools, including Meta, Google and others. In a separate case, Milwaukee-based Froedtert Health reached a $2 million settlement over charges it installed the Meta Pixel tool without patients' knowledge, according to Becker's Hospital Review. Last July, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights and the Federal Trade Commission sent letters to 66 hospitals and health systems warning that they might be violating federal health privacy laws by installing pixel tracking technologies on their websites. Palm Beach Health Network was not among the systems notified, according to a post by Becker's Hospital Review. Meta itself is the subject of a class-action suit in California filed in June 2022 by plaintiffs who claim at least 664 medical entities use its technology, according to published reports. Meta blamed the providers, stating they control the code placed on their websites and they choose what information it sends to Meta. Meta also argued that the plaintiffs did not violate patients' health privacy, saying the only information the company received were the URLs of websites browsed by the plaintiffs. Two motions by Meta to have the lawsuit dismissed failed. One claimed patients hadn't sufficiently established the company's intent to collect their information. That was defeated by the judge in August. In January, the judge disagreed with Meta's contention that an amended complaint lacked specific examples that patients' information was transmitted. He ruled that the information provided was sufficient to allow the lawsuit to advance to the discovery phase. The lawsuit against the Palm Beach County providers seeks damages, other equitable relief, treble and/or punitive damages, interest and attorneys' fees. It was filed by Clarkson Law Firm of Malibu, California, and Almeida Law Group of Chicago.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese three under-the-radar growth stocks picked by the new GPT-4o AI bot could deliver massive gains if the AI model is right.The post 3 Growth Stocks the New ‘GPT-4o’ AI Bot Says Will Make You Rich appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "OpenAI has recently released its GPT-4o AI bot, touted as a more advanced version of its previous language models. This new bot is more focused on voice inputs and usefulness in day-to-day living than pure logic or reasoning. However, its improvements over previous GPT-4 models have not been groundbreaking, to say the least. That said, it is still worth exploring how this AI bot approaches the stock market. Playing with prompts and asking for different stock picks can provide some interesting ideas to research. I did precisely that on some stocks that the GPT-4o bot has picked. I asked it for more “under-the-radar” growth stocks , as it regurgitated the usual FAANG/Magnificent 7 tech giants when prompted for growth picks. Here are the three I got. MongoDB (MDB) I agree with GPT-4o that MongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB ) is a company well-positioned for growth. MongoDB provides a platform that allows developers to build and update applications with greater ease and efficiency. In the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, MongoDB again showed solid execution. Revenue increased 27% to $458 million . Additionally, both revenue and earnings exceeded expectations. Atlas, their cloud database offering, remains the key driver of growth, growing 34% and now accounting for 68% of the company’s total revenue. The company added over 7,000 new customers last year across both small startups and large Fortune 500 companies. MongoDB’s earnings per share metric is very bullish, considering the 86 cents figure beat analyst estimates by 39 cents. Paying 148-times forward earnings here is definitely quite the premium. However, the company should be able to sustain annual revenue growth well above 25% for years to come, along with juicy earnings growth averaging roughly 40%. Even if this stock’s premium remains 50% intact, MDB stock should deliver significant gains over the next decade. DexCom (DXCM) DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM ) is in the continuous glucose monitoring business. The company’s G7 system, which came out last year, has already made a big impact with how accurate and easy to use it is, plus how well it connects to popular devices. In Q1, DexCom saw their sales grow an impressive 25% to $921 million , beating estimates. Earnings per share also beat by 18.6%. It’s a major positive that more doctors are recommending the G7, and insurance is covering this device for more patients. What gives me hope is how fast DexCom innovates on new products. Since releasing the G7, the company has sent out monthly updates to improve how it functions, connects to other things, and is used. Getting approved to connect directly to the Apple Watch makes this device the first CGM that can do that. With more people (sadly) getting diabetes worldwide, DexCom’s top-notch glucose monitoring system sets up DexCom well for strong growth. If the company can keep making progress like this, I definitely think DXCM stock can outperform. The stock is still down some 19% from its 2021 high. Nutrien (NTR) Nutrien (NYSE: NTR ) is another solid pick by GPT-4o. A fertilizer company, Nutrien is also a different type of bet than the other two. That’s because Nutrien’s growth is relatively muted, so a recovery is what I’m hoping for. And I think that recovery is underway, since NTR stock has appreciated 24% since mid-February. Nutrien reported adjusted EBITDA of CAD$1.1 billion , aided by improved margins on crop nutrients, higher fertilizer production meeting strong demand, increased sales volume, and lower operational expenses. The company’s agricultural retail division also saw significant year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA. According to Nutrien’s estimates, global supply and demand for potash appear fairly balanced. The company is maintaining its full-year forecast for worldwide potash shipments at 68-71 million metric tonnes. I believe Nutrien is well-positioned to benefit from these favorable market dynamics and continue recovering. Indeed, NTR stock seems to have bottomed out at current levels.

        "description": "\"Inflation is here. It’s real,\" Bass Pro Shops CEO Johnny Morris said.",
        "content": "The founder and CEO of Bass Pro Shops, Johnny Morris, says that despite inflation, the hunting, fishing and outdoor sporting brand will remain focused on affordability heading into boating and fishing seasons. Inflation remains high at 3.4% , above the Fed’s 2% goal, though it dropped from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. “Inflation is here. It’s real,” Morris told FOX Business during a video interview. In April, energy prices rose for the third month in a row, and the cost of gas increased by 2.8%, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI). Bass Pro Shops ended an inflation buster savings program in late 2023, but the brand maintains its promise to work with consumers on belt-tightening opportunities to combat elevated inflation burning holes through American’s pockets. “We worked hard, and we still focus on affordability,” Morris said of starting Bass Pro decades ago. Bass Pro Shops offers consumers payment plans as low as $5 and $10 per day to make the dream of owning a boat a reality for just about anyone. “My dad was big on delivering value to customers,” Morris said. “One of his sayings to me every day was, ‘Johnny, it’s not worth any more on your shelf than it is your competitors.’” Morris, a Missouri native, proudly referred to a framed advertisement of the original Bass Pro Shops boat, a Bass Tracker, hanging behind him that retailed for $2,995. “We broke through by delivering remarkable value to fishermen and to anglers,” he said. “That’s something that we’re focused on. We build boats right here in the Ozarks — most of them — sell them direct, and we have a few great select dealers.’” The company was founded by Morris in 1972, when he was just 21 years old and gas cost 36 cents a gallon, or $2.53 today when adjusted for inflation. “I approached my dad about stocking fishing tackle in a liquor store he had on the way to the lake,” Morris said. “We called it Bass Pro. Every nickel we could get, we put it into this fishing gear.” Morris, a dedicated leader in conservation, credits his father, John A. Morris, founder of Walmart, Sam Walton, former President Theodore Roosevelt and naturalist John James Audubon for not only his approach to consumer-driven business strategies but his ability to preserve a healthy, commonsense harvest of “God-given natural resources.” Subscribe to our daily Business Report newsletter!

On Saturday, Morris unveiled Thunder Ridge Nature Arena, an outdoor amphitheater on 1,200 acres near Table Rock Lake, just outside of Branson, Missouri. The grand opening was packed with thousands of attendees and starred country music A-lister Morgan Wallen. The venue is planned to host Chris Stapleton and Luke Bryan, among other celebrities, later this summer. In July, the Rolling Stones will end their summer tour at Thunder Ridge. Thunder Ridge, dedicated to celebrating the natural beauty of the Ozarks, teamed up with Live Nation and ASM Global to execute the day-to-day operations of the space for 18,000-20,000 people. “I think one thing that people can expect is getting their money’s worth here in the Ozarks,” Morris said. “And they can expect genuine, friendly service in this region.” Morris is a vocal advocate for conservation, and designed the amphitheater oasis to highlight the rich history and unmatched views of the Ozarks. “The economy is what it is, but I think people can expect good value here,” Morris said.",

She says the strategy will help make government more efficient and improve services for Canadians. The effort will include setting up a specific division to retrain existing public servants. Anand made the announcement at a meeting with experts who are convening in Gatineau, Que., to discuss developing the strategy. The federal government has already begun incorporating AI into its operations, using the technology in hundreds of different ways. These talks come as eight more private organizations sign on to a voluntary federal code of conduct for artificial intelligence including Mastercard, Lenovo and the Quebec real estate broker's association.",

New Delhi : In a shocking incident of road rage that has come to light from Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow, a man wielded a pistol and threatened a person in full public view. The video of the incident has gone viral. It all started following a spat over a car collision near Basmandi on Faizabad Road in Lucknow. In the video, the man, identified as Vinod Mishra, can be seen holding a pistol and pointing it at the other person, Ranjit. Vinod grabs Ranjit’s T-shirt and hits the barrel of the gun in the man’s abdomen. Later, he shoves him towards a vehicle and hits his shoulder with the butt of the pistol. All this while, Ranjit pleads with Vinod and tries to protect himself. Road-Rage Kalesh in Lucknow UP pic.twitter.com/4ZXHuQvzfN — Ghar Ke Kalesh (@gharkekalesh) May 27, 2024 Talking about the incident, Additional Superintendent of Police Amit Kumawat was quoted as saying by NDTV, “Ranjit was going towards Bhootnath Market in his white WagonR when his vehicle hit Vinod’s black Tata Safari, which sparked a spat between them and then, the man whipped out a pistol.” Vinod attacked the man and hit him with the pistol three times, as seen in the video. The victim continued to seek apology, but the accused didn’t stop threatening him. Accused arrested, pistol seized An onlooker captured the incident from a vehicle and it went viral on social media platforms. After the victim Ranjit filed a complaint, the police took note of the incident and arrested Vinod. The police have also seized Vinod’s licensed pistol and launched a probe into the matter. Further legal action would be taken against the accused, the police pointed out. In April, a parking dispute took a violent turn when a man attacked another driver with sticks and belts in Saadatganj area in Lucknow. A video of the incident showed a person scaling the roof of a car during a traffic jam and hitting it with a stick after it rammed into his vehicle.",

A Met Office spokesperson said: \"During the outlook period, the weather will turn more settled as high pressure builds in from the west. \"It will feel warm with light winds, but it will feel cooler near the coast where onshore sea breezes develop. This fair weather is likely to continue for a few days into the following week, but thereafter the outlook becomes more uncertain. \"The south of the UK will probably be drier, although not ruling out scattered showers completely. Cooler and cloudier further northwest, where rain is more likely. \"Temperatures will probably be around normal or a little above average.\" This week, however, looks rather gloomy, with rain forecast every day except Sunday (June 2).

        "content": "Image credit: (Photo by Eddie Kelly/ProLook Photos) The next three weeks is without a doubt the best stretch on the college baseball calendar. Virtually every day from May 31 through the middle of June will be chalk-full of NCAA Tournament games . Between the incredible atmospheres and high-level play, it feels like each year we get a handful of games that fall into the “instant classic” bucket. Like any other year, this year’s tournament field is loaded with draft prospects. Instead of highlighting solely 2024 draftees, I also included a handful of underclassmen. This ranking is mostly a reflection of our most recent draft board, though I did shuffle a few players around. Enjoy watching all 25 players ranked below, but especially those who will be drafted in a little over a month. It will be their last time ever putting on their respective school’s jersey and the end of what was fantastic college career. RELATED Condon enjoyed an historical season in which he completed two legs of the triple crown. His 35 home runs not only led the country, but are also the most in a single-season since the turn of the century. The 6-foot-6 third baseman and outfielder posted a gaudy .443/.558/1.043 slash line and is a near-impossible at-bat for opposing pitchers to navigate. Not only does Condon have double-plus raw power, but he has also displayed an advanced feel to hit. His operation is uniquely compact and explosive for someone of his stature. Should Georgia make its first College World Series appearance since 2008, Condon will be a huge reason why. Like Condon, Bazzana has a chance to be the first overall selection in this July’s draft. He enjoyed a record-breaking season in which he slashed .418/.581/.939 with 14 doubles, 26 home runs and 62 RBIs. Bazzana also boasts a video game-like 71-to-32 walk-to-strikeout ratio. He is a high-level athlete with top-of-the-scale bat speed and an elite feel for the barrel. Bazzana has plus power to the pull side, but he has shown the ability to drive the baseball with authority to all fields. A natural leader, the Sydney, Australia native will look to lead the Beavers back to Omaha. No pitcher in college baseball was more dominant this season than Smith, who will likely win pitcher of the year. He pitched his way to a 9-1 record with a nation-leading 1.48 ERA and 154 strikeouts to 30 walks across 79 innings. Smith features a deadly one-two combination in a thunderous, upper-90s fastball with life through the strike zone and a hellacious slider that flashed long, sweeping action with a bit of depth. He has collected double-digit strikeouts in 11 of his 15 starts, and will be the perfect tone-setter for the Razorbacks this June as they eye their second College World Series appearance in the last three seasons. Wetherholt missed almost half of the season dealing with a hamstring injury, but the third-year shortstop has made the most of his 104 at-bats, hitting .356/.500/.664 with eight doubles, eight home runs and 30 RBIs in 31 games. When healthy, Wetherholt is as impactful as any player in the sport. He has highly advanced barrel skills, and there is an argument that he is the best pure hitter in college baseball. Wetherholt has big-time bat speed as well, and it looked like this season he had tapped into a bit more raw power. A plus runner, Wetherholt can impact the game in a myriad of ways and his fingerprints are sure to be all over the box score on a game-to-game basis. Montgomery thrived in his first year in College Station to the tune of a .317/.451/.742 slash line with 14 doubles, a career-high 26 home runs and a career-high 80 RBIs. The switch-hitter has an athletic operation with plus bat speed and plus power from both sides of the plate, though he posted a markedly better slash line from the left side. Montgomery moves well in right field and his strong 70-grade throwing arm is the best in this year’s draft class. He has been the focal point within a deep Texas A&M lineup and has his Aggies well-positioned for a deep tournament run. Burns has the most electrifying mound presence in all of college baseball, and this season at Wake Forest was the best of his career. The 6-foot-3 righthander worked a 10-1 record with a career-best 2.46 ERA, and his 184 strikeouts are tops in the country. Like Hagen Smith, Burns features a thunderous one-two punch in an upper-90s fastball and a demonic slider that flashes plenty of two-plane break. Burns rounds out his arsenal with a mid-80s power curveball that features ample depth and sharp, downward teeth and a high-80s changeup that is a more than serviceable fourth pitch. He will likely get the ball in the Demon Deacons’ first regional game and will look to lead them back to Omaha for the second-straight season. The best two-way player in college baseball, Caglianone has turned in another productive season on both sides of the baseball. In the box, he hit a career-best .415/.525/.844 with 29 home runs, 58 RBIs and 41 walks to 21 strikeouts. He is an excellent athlete with thunderous bat speed and double-plus raw power. Caglianone generates high-end impact no matter where a pitch is thrown, and he is one of the most dangerous hitters in college baseball. On the mound, Caglianone moves well and flashes a mid-to-upper-90s fastball, an effective cutter and a plus changeup. His command eludes him at times, but he can carve through lineups when he’s around the zone. While Caglianone will likely be a hitter professionally, he will continue to do both as he concludes his collegiate career. After a slow start to the season, Kurtz—thanks to an unconscious two-week stretch in April—has since boosted his slash line to .313/.538/.789 with 11 doubles, 22 home runs and 55 RBIs. He also has a top-notch approach and pro-level pitch recognition skills that has translated to a ridiculous walk-to-strikeout ratio of 76-to-39. Kurtz has a tantalizing combination of plus hit and power with a fairly tight and compact operation in the box. He rotates really well in his swing and has a lengthy track record of hammering the baseball to all fields. The centerpiece of Wake Forest’s lineup, Kurtz—along with Burns—will look to lead his squad back to Omaha. Yesavage has enjoyed a career year in which he has pitched his way to a career-best 11-1 record with a 2.09 ERA with 139 strikeouts to just 28 walks across 86 innings. His ERA and strikeout totals rank fifth and fourth nationally, respectively, and every aforementioned stat is a new career-best. Yesavage has a durable frame at 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds and is an imposing presence on the mound. He features an effective four-pitch mix with three pitches grading out as at least above-average. Yesavage’s fastball sits in the mid 90s with big-time carry through the zone. He supplements the heater with a sharp gyro slider and a plus split-changeup. There is very little doubt he will start at the next level. Yesavage has the Pirates poised for a deep tournament run, although it’s worth noting he missed his conference tournament due to a partially collapsed lung. After a dominant 2023 campaign at Division-II Wingate that was punctuated by a strong summer on the Cape and with Team USA, King this spring has been one of Wake Forest’s most productive hitters. He has posted a .316/.386/.594 slash line with 33 extra-base hits, and his 64 RBIs rank second on the team. King is as dynamic and athletic a player as you will find in college baseball. He has an explosive operation in the batter’s box with thunderous bat speed. He is also a plus runner who can really go and get it in the outfield. King is new to the position, but his combination of speed and athleticism have translated well. He figures to hear his name called at some point in the first round this July. The newly minted ACC Player of the Year has been one of the best hitters in the country. To this point he has posted a .379/.494/.825 slash line with 17 doubles, 25 home runs and 84 RBIs. As a cherry on top to an already-impressive stat line, Tibbs has 45 walks to just 24 strikeouts. He has plenty of strength throughout his 6-foot, 200-pound frame and has a simple operation with plus hand speed. On top of having plus power to all fields, Tibbs’ hit tool also grades out as plus. He has advanced contact skills, is consistently on the barrel and uses the entire field while frequently generating high-quality contact. Tibbs has a borderline plus arm in right field and could be a top-10 overall pick this July. Honeycutt is perhaps the toolsiest player in all of college baseball. He heads into the tournament with a career-high .319 average to go along with 12 doubles, 22 home runs, a career-high 58 RBIs and 28 stolen bases. Honeycutt has a twitchy and athletic operation in the box with plus hand speed and above-average power. He is a plus runner and an elite defender in center field with a knack for making a big play in a big spot. Honeycutt will need to clean up his approach and pitch recognition skills as he transitions into pro ball, but his ceiling is as high as any player in the draft. 13. Cam Smith , 3B, Florida State — Class of 2024 Smith and Tibbs are college baseball’s equivalent of the “Bash Bros.” Like Tibbs, Smith has also had a career season in which he is hitting .396/.487/.661 with 20 doubles, 13 home runs and 48 RBIs. He has a big league frame at 6-foot-3 and 224 pounds and has a quiet, simple setup in the box with a minimal load and plus bat speed. Smith’s approach and contact skills have improved year-over-year, which is an encouraging sign. He has plus power to all fields and with an ever-improving hit tool, there is a lot to like offensively. Smith at third base has a plus arm and solid range in either direction. He is a slam dunk to stick at the position and has top-20 overall upside in this year’s draft. Benge has enjoyed an outstanding season for Oklahoma State. He is hitting .342/.451/.680 with 42 extra-base hits—including 17 home runs—and 62 RBIs. He is a wiry athlete who has a bit of a noisy operation in the box with a big barrel tip, but he has lightning-quick hands and consistently gets in a good position to hit. Benge has a plus arm in right field where he is a strong defender. He plays the game hard and at one speed, and it is abundantly clear that he loves to play. Should the Cowboys make just their second College World Series since 1999, Benge will be a key reason why. A 6-foot-6 Adonis, LaViolette has in the midst of a more productive season than his freshman year in which he had 33 extra-base hits and 63 RBIs. The star sophomore is currently hitting .321/.450/.796 with 15 doubles, 28 home runs and 73 RBIs. LaViolette has minimal movement in his operation, and does a nice job of creating natural loft in his swing. He has plus raw power to all fields, including double-plus to the pull side. The impact he generates is incredibly impressive. There is an argument to be made that he is the favorite to be selected first overall in 2025. Along with Braden Montgomery, the Aggies boast two of the most formidable sluggers in the country in their lineup. The ACC Freshman of the Year — and likely National Freshman of the Year — exploded onto the scene in 2024, posting a .379/.506/.801 slash line with 14 doubles, 23 home runs and 65 RBIs. His 23 long balls are a new Georgia Tech freshman single-season record, and he leads all freshmen in a whopping six different statistical categories. Burress has an unbelievably explosive operation in the box with high-end bat speed, and his plate coverage with power is remarkable. He also has an advanced approach and high-level pitch recognition skills that have translated to an overall chase rate under 20% and a walk-to-strikeout ratio of 52-to-34. Defensively, Burress has shown well in center field where he has a plus arm. He has a host of tools packed into his 5-foot-9 frame and has 1:1 upside in 2026. The reigning ACC Freshman of the Year carried over his success from 2023 into 2024. Cannarella is currently hitting .342/.422/.560 with 16 doubles, a career-high nine home runs and 51 RBIs — also a career-high. He has an ultra-twitchy, athletic operation in the box with quick hands and above-average bat speed. Cannarella has plus bat-to-ball skills and is consistently on the barrel while using the entire field. He is also an impact defender in centerfield, where he boasts a quick first step with advanced baseball sense. Cannarella’s competitiveness is infectious, and he will look to avenge last year’s early Clemson exit. Moore has been the catalyst within a loaded Tennessee lineup to the tune of a .386/.452/.801 slash line with 16 doubles, 63 RBIs and a new Tennessee single-season record 28 home runs. He has an ultra-physical build at 6-foot-1 and 210 pounds, and this year has flashed plus power and added impact. Moore defends well at second base where he has an above-average arm. Moore, Burke and Billy Amick make for one of the most formidable middle of the orders in the sport. That trio has what it takes to carry the Vols’ back to Omaha. Christian Moore hit a 441-foot homer yesterday 😳 On Friday, we picked the @Vol_Baseball star as a potential postseason breakout and MLB Draft riser... https://t.co/uzQt0eMESd pic.twitter.com/B9jSILvosi The reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year has already upstaged his 2023 campaign and enters the tournament with a .352/.447/.644 slash line with 11 doubles, a career-high 18 home runs and 49 RBIs. Taylor has a strong base in the box with no shortage of bat speed and an above-average feel to hit. He has plus power, and most importantly he is able to get to it consistently in games. Taylor routinely generates big-time impact and is one of the best bats in the 2025 draft class. Bremner this spring cemented himself as one of the premier starting pitchers in college baseball. He posted a perfect 11-0 record with a 2.63 ERA and 96 strikeouts to just 19 walks in 82 innings. He has a lean, athletic build at 6-foot-2 and 180-pounds. Bremner has an easy, under control operation with present arm speed. His fastball sits in the 93-96 range while topping out at 98. It has big-time run and ride through the zone and is at its best when located in the top-half of the zone. Between its velocity and shape, it is currently a plus pitch. He boasts two quality secondary offerings in a mid-80s changeup and low-80s slider. Bremner’s changeup is the more polished of the two, but his slider has tons of potential and took a major step forward this spring. He’s arguably the best pitcher right now in the 2025 draft class. Following a modest freshman campaign, Arnold this season emerged as one of the best starting pitchers in the country regardless of class. The 6-foot-1 southpaw has pitched his way to a 10-3 record with a 2.45 ERA and 134 strikeouts to only 20 walks in 88.1 innings. His ERA ranks eighth nationally, while his strikeouts rank fifth. Arnold attacks from a low-three quarter slot and primarily throws a fastball and a slider. His heater has been up to 97 and explodes out of his low arm slot, and is at its best when elevated to the arm side. It features plenty of natural running life and has worked an impressive 33% miss rate. Arnold’s plus slider is long in shape with plenty of sweeping life. With a strong finish to this season and continued success next year, Arnold could end up as the first college arm drafted in 2025. Following a fantastic 2023 season at Clemson, Amick entered the transfer portal and eventually committed to Tennessee. He has had a mighty productive season in Knoxville, and is hitting .318/.388/.657 with 12 doubles, a career-high 18 home runs and 50 RBIs. Amick has a quiet, yet explosive operation in the box with no wasted movement in his swing. He is barrel-chested and would not look out of place on an NFL field. Amick boasts plus bat speed with plus power, and he has routinely shown the ability to back spin the baseball with ease to all fields. He does a great job of extending through the baseball and really finishing his swing. Amick has held his own over at third where he has a slightly above-average arm. Along with Jac Caglianone, White is arguably the most famous name in college baseball. White hasn’t quite matched his level of production from last year, though he still has had a strong 2024 season in which is hitting .337/.411/.675 with 11 doubles, 24 home runs for the second-straight year and 69 RBIs. His 75 career home runs are a new 21st century record. White moves well in the batter’s box, where he is an underrated athlete. He has lightning-quick hands and drives the baseball with authority to the opposite field perhaps unlike any other hitter in the country. In addition to his plus power, White has an advanced feel for the barrel and consistently generates high-quality contact. He has a knack for coming up with a big hit when the lights are at their brightest, and will look to again lead the Tigers to a deep tournament run. DeBarge this season picked up right where he left off in 2023, and has posted a .361/.429/.723 slash line with 17 doubles, 21 home runs and 67 RBIs. He has set new career-highs in almost every statistical category, and has seen his draft stock steadily ascend throughout the season. DeBarge plays bigger than his 5-foot-9, 175-pound frame suggests and is an outstanding athlete both in the field and in the batter’s box. He has a strong swing with plus bat speed, plus barrel skills and above-average power to the pull side. DeBarge is also a plus runner, and his skill set enables him to impact the game in a number of different ways. After a stellar start to the season, Santucci did not enjoy the same success in ACC play. Even so, he heads into the postseason with a career-best 3.54 ERA with a career-high 86 strikeouts across 56 innings. Santucci’s fastball has been up to 97 with riding life through the zone. It’s most effective—and generates the most swing-and-miss—when located in the top-half of the strike zone. He has below-average command of the offering, though. Refining it will be key once he gets into pro ball. Santucci supplements his heater with a plus mid-80s slider of which he has an advanced feel. He varies its shape well. Against righthanded hitters it will take on more of a gyro look. Against lefthanded hitters it is longer and sweepier. Santucci throws it sparingly, but he also will flash a borderline plus changeup that has late tumbling life. Waldschmidt this year exploded onto the scene and has been Kentucky’s best hitter. The third-year outfielder has set new career-highs in virtually every statistical category. He heads into the tournament with a .357/.487/.654 slash line 16 doubles, 13 home runs, 42 RBIs and 23 stolen bases. He has an ultra-explosive, athletic operation with comfortably plus bat speed, and an engaged lower-half. Waldschmidt has a tantalizing, yet underrated hit-power combination. He has plus pitch recognition skills and an advanced approach. He seldom expands the strike zone and his overall chase rate is under 20%. With plus power to go along with a plus hit tool, there is plenty to like about Waldschmidt’s profile. He could be selected this July as high as the first round.",

        "description": "As consumers are more commonly using buy now, pay later programs to purchase big-ticket items, companies have new consumer protections they must follow.",
        "content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday in a new rule that buy now, pay later companies must provide consumers with the same legal rights and protections as credit card lenders. That includes the right to demand a refund and to dispute transactions. The agency began an inquiry into the short-term lending industry two years ago, and it issued the rule in response to ongoing consumer complaints, it said. Here's what you need to know. What's behind the new regulation? Buy now, pay later loans are typically marketed as zero-interest, or low interest, and allow consumers to spread out payments for purchases over several weeks or months. They’re marketed as a way to buy expensive products and services over time, and the service is typically offered at checkout for online shopping. It’s often used for big-ticket items, like furniture, clothes and airline tickets. In a report , the CFPB found that more than 13% of buy now, pay later transactions involved a return or dispute, and, in 2021, people disputed or returned $1.8 billion in transactions at the five companies surveyed. “Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. How is the industry responding to the rule? Two major buy now, pay later players — Affirm and Klarna — say they welcomed the regulation. “We are encouraged that the CFPB is promoting consistent industry standards, many of which already reflect how Affirm operates, to provide greater choice and transparency for consumers,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. Affirm currently offers “dispute and error resolution assistance,” the spokesman added. Company News Americans cutting back spending on nonessential items at major retailers Justin Boggs 8:34 AM, May 23, 2024 A spokesperson for Klarna said the company also already investigates consumer disputes and covers related refunds. The agency's announcement is a “significant step forward” in regulating the buy now, pay later industry, Klarna said in a statement. It said it has been calling for regulatory oversight “over many years.” While some in the industry have voluntarily chosen to operate at the standard now mandated by the CFPB's new rule, there remain significant differences between credit card lending and buy now, pay later loans. For instance, buy now, pay later lenders do not all report their loans to the three major credit bureaus. Some analysts have said this can lead consumers to overextend themselves or take on more debt than they can manage or afford. What rights do consumers have? The CFPB said that buy now, pay later lenders need to extend many of the same rights and protections as classic credit card providers. “Importantly, these cover dispute and refund rights,” the agency said. The agency clarified that, with its new rule, buy now, pay later lenders must: - Investigate disputes. Lenders must also pause payment requirements during the investigation and sometimes must issue credits. - Refund returned products or canceled services. Buy now, pay later lenders must credit the refunds to consumers’ accounts. - Provide billing statements. Consumers must receive periodic statements of money owed similar to the ones received for classic credit card accounts. “The failure to provide dispute protections can create chaos for consumers when they return their merchandise or encounter other billing difficulties,” the CFPB said.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

        "description": "@xeofate Idk how it is for you but, also, RotR strongly reminds me of TW3 so far for some reason. I think it's related to the quest & leveling-up system.",
        "content": "After a few weekends of not playing anything, I got the itch to just play something, so I went back to the FF7 remake. I won't say it \"clicked\" for me this time necessarily, I still think the combat is wildly overrated and the pacing of this game has been so far pretty horrible, but after a couple of really boring early chapters, Chapter 4 and 5 were significantly more interesting to me than basically anything that came before it outside of the opener. And I quite literally have nothing else to play right now, so I may as well see this to the end. Also I don't care if it is all a trick, Jessie you are welcome to ruin my life. Hopped back on Tekken 8 because I have a local tournament coming up this week. Starting again after a break was rough but after a couple days I think I can hold my own again. Also, finally started Hi-Fi Rush and it's been delightful. Dave The Diver and Animal Well are queued up next. Still playing FF7 Rebirth (102 hours, now in Chapter 12) and a little bit of Fallout 76 here and there. I’m having a lot of fun with Stellar Blade! For a game that actually has a lot of little issues that do add up, it’s getting enough right to keep me fully engaged, though I am surprised just how much it really does take from NieR. I was looking for something breezy and this is fitting the bill wonderfully. @Jimmer-jammer Did you play Fallen Order? If so, how does it compare to Stellar Blade? @Black_Swordsman Structurally, I’d say Fallen Order is actually a pretty fair comparison, though Stellar Blade is a fair bit more clumsy in it’s execution and its writing and characters just aren’t on the same level. Beyond that, little things like unpausable/unskippable cutscenes and a protagonist who tends to control like a dump truck at the most inopportune times chip away from what could be a smoother experience. Overall, it fits well within PlayStation’s portfolio of graphically sexy, straightforward and polished comfort food. @Jimmer-jammer I'm glad to hear it's not all bad, then. I loved Fallen Order but from what you say overall I think I will still give Stellar Blade a pass. Eyeing up RotR for when I end my gaming break, so I'll tag you when I have gotten round to the part of the game where you're past the early hours and the real experience begins! Got a specific build in mind, but not Berserk-related this time. 😉 I love the fact that there are preset character creation codes in the game. I'll give you a clue as to my build. \"Got the coin for it?\" 😃 @Black_Swordsman You actually get to make two characters, so you can probably role play that even farther than you might think 😊 I'm making my way through Sand Land and finding it pretty enjoyable. Definitely my type of game. Also still playing and loving Sea of Thieves. I'm playing Rise of the Ronin currently. So far it seems like Ghost of Tsushima with better combat which is a good thing because I loved that game. I'll probably make a start on WRC 10 tomorrow also. WRC 9 was great so I'm expecting more of the same. @xeofate I just started this as well (RotR) I went for a Geralt of Rivia build as I was saying to Jimmer-jammer above. Only played a bit so far, loving the combat which is excellent as you say. I remapped the controls to make them match the control scheme for the Souls games. 😃 Did you go for a specific type of character for your primary Blade Twin? @Black_Swordsman That's not a bad idea remapping the controls actually, might do that myself. I went with the Dex build of Breaker like I always do in souls games. For the main protagonist I kind of made him like an old greying Jin from Ghost of Tsushima. As for the other Blade Twin I made her like my pawn in Dragon's Dogma 2 which was named after my old German Shepherd dog Rusty I've been in a bit of a gaming slump since beating Dragon's Dogma 2 but I think this game is going to change that, liking it so far. xeofate wrote: I'm playing Rise of the Ronin currently. . Black_Swordsman wrote: @xeofate I just started this as well (RotR) I am many hours into RotR and have enjoyed my journey so far i think its a better game than GoT but that's just my opinion. Decided to give XDefiant a try. I've been looking for a game that I can play when I have a spare 15 minutes and this looks like it'll be perfect for that. I've put in a few hours on Deliver Us Mars. The story seems compelling enough, the graphics and score are fantastic and the exploration puzzle gameplay is pretty much what I'd expected from playing the first game. The only thing that's getting to me is the jankiness of the character animations, it's like half way between cartoon and realism and keeps throwing me out of full immersion. The spacey sci-fi geek in me is enjoying it so far though. Just started RotR properly. Looks promising so far. Loving the combat. Edit: Just beat the Prologue and first boss. Proper action rpg game so far. Edit 2: Haha, didn't realise the second boss that you're meant to defeat was actually the final boss battle of the prologue, completed and got the appropriate trophy this morning🤣 . @Jimmer-jammer Now let loose in the world! @xeofate Idk how it is for you but, also, RotR strongly reminds me of TW3 so far for some reason. I think it's related to the quest & leveling-up system.",

        "description": "The ‘King of Clay’ was beaten in straight sets by fourth seed Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "The 14-time champion, known as the ‘King of Clay’, was roared on by family, friends and rivals at the scene of his greatest triumphs. Unseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four in the opening round. But Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd. The Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not “close the door” on a return to the Paris showpiece. It seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players’ boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz – Nadal’s heir apparent – long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women’s number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Also in attendance were Nadal’s wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni – his former coach – and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Manchester City midfielder Rodri, no stranger to titles himself, was another famous face in the crowd. They were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third. But a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight. So Nadal’s astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here. Vintage Rafa 👀 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/PewWj1Dp9W — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 It was a significant win for the German, who still has the cloud of a trial over domestic abuse allegations – which he denies – hanging over him and which begins this weekend. The last time he faced Nadal was on the same court two years ago in the semi-finals, when he slipped and seriously injured his ankle, costing him the best part of a year of his career. His celebrations were low key as Nadal sent a forehand wide on match point, before Chatrier rose, possibly for one last time, to salute their hero. Nadal was persuaded afterwards by tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to say a few words to the crowd.

        "description": "The ‘King of Clay’ was beaten in straight sets by fourth seed Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal said he did not want a French Open leaving party, but he got one anyway as he bowed out to Alexander Zverev in the first round at Roland Garros. The 14-time champion, known as the ‘King of Clay’, was roared on by family, friends and rivals at the scene of his greatest triumphs. Unseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four in the opening round. But Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd. The Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not “close the door” on a return to the Paris showpiece. It seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players’ boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz – Nadal’s heir apparent – long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women’s number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Also in attendance were Nadal’s wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni – his former coach – and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Manchester City midfielder Rodri, no stranger to titles himself, was another famous face in the crowd. They were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third. But a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight. So Nadal’s astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here.

        "description": "Rishi Sunak, Sir Keir Starmer and Sir Ed Davey continued to set out their stalls for the country.",
        "content": "Here are the key moments: Trouble at the top The Prime Minister had a awkward end to Bank Holiday Monday after suspending one of his own MPs for backing a Reform candidate rather than a Tory. He had earlier faced anger and confusion from other Tory MPs over his contentious national service plan. Lucy Allan is standing down in Telford and publicly gave her support to Reform’s Alan Adams rather than Conservative Hannah Campbell. “A vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer,” a Tory spokesman said. Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker publicly criticised the way the national service policy had been “sprung” on Tory candidates. And Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan did not rule out the possibility of parents facing prosecution if their children refused to take part in the scheme. But Tory deputy chairman James Daly said Ms Trevelyan “certainly doesn’t have responsibility for this area” and asked: “Why would you think that a parent of an 18-year-old would go to jail because of the actions of an 18-year-old?” Trust me I’m a leader Sir Keir Starmer ventured onto enemy territory for his first major speech of the campaign in Tory-held Lancing in West Sussex, as he promised to stand up for working people. The Labour leader referenced his childhood in Surrey and his family’s debt fears as he insisted he could be trusted to deliver economic stability and protect national security. Sir Keir acknowledged that despite Labour’s commanding opinion poll lead, many voters were not fully persuaded about his party. “I know there are countless people who haven’t decided how they’ll vote in this election. They’re fed-up with the failure, chaos and division of the Tories, but they still have questions about us: has Labour changed enough? Do I trust them with my money, our borders, our security? “My answer is yes, you can, because I have changed this party, permanently.” Picture of the day Rishi Sunak tried his hand at dribbling and took part in drills at Chesham United football ground alongside young players on a Monday afternoon campaign visit. Mr Sunak attempted dribbling practice alongside four different age groups: under-eights, under-nines, under-11s and under-16s. “Did we win?” he asked the group of players he had joined after the whistle blew. “No,” one of them replied. Number of the day No country for old men? Rishi Sunak distanced himself from Tory attacks on Sir Keir Starmer over his age. The 44-year-old Prime Minister said “the substance is what matters” following the comments about his 61-year-old rival. Some Tories had dubbed the Labour leader “sleepy” and claimed he does not have the “stamina” to campaign. The jibe mirrors Donald Trump’s favourite insult for President Biden, who he regularly mocks as “sleepy Joe”. Sir Keir dismissed the claims as “desperate”. Quote of the day Top dogs now underdogs In Scotland, new SNP leader John Swinney had to concede his party has a lot of ground to make up on Labour. Polls have shown the party, which for years has been the dominant force in Scottish politics, is now trailing behind Labour in the run-up to the July 4 voting day. As he campaigned in Dumfries, Mr Swinney was asked if his party was now fighting this election as the “underdog”. The Scottish First Minister said: “That’s an interesting way to put it. Actually, it is quite a good way to fight an election campaign.” They also face a challenge from the Lib Dems, whose leader Sir Ed Davey was bullish as he launched his party’s campaign in Scotland. Speaking in Fife, Sir Ed said: “I believe we can make gains here in Scotland just as we’re going to make gains against the Conservatives in England.” Tik Tok for top parties? During the 2019 election, social media app TikTok was in its infancy, but in 2024 the top two parties have realised it is the place to be. The Chinese app was banned from Government phones in March 2023 because of data security concerns but both parties have launched profiles in recent days. Despite the Prime Minister announcing the General Election last Wednesday, Labour launched on TikTok three days before the Conservatives. Although it is early days – the Conservatives had shared just four TikToks by Monday afternoon to Labour’s 25 – the approach by Sir Keir Starmer’s party has been more successful. Labour has more than 43,000 TikTok followers to the Conservatives’ 13,000, and they have received over 10 times more likes on the platform – with more than 930,000 to 87,000 for the Tories. Stepping down The latest MPs to announce they are stepping down at the next election were Labour’s Barbara Keeley and John Spellar. Ms Keeley, 72, who has represented Worsley and Eccles South since 2005, has had health issues and said the demands of the campaign made her realise that it was time to step aside. And Mr Spellar, an MP since 1992 who represents Warley in the West Midlands, said he looked forward “to continuing to play an active role in the Labour movement”. What’s happening tomorrow? Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves will make her first major election speech promising to be both pro-business and pro-worker. She will join Sir Keir Starmer in the Midlands. The Tory battlebus will be out and about – no details yet. Nigel Farage, who has declined to stand as an MP for his Reform party, will be campaigning on the south coast where the subject of small boat migrant crossings are sure to feature heavily.",

However, in an exclusive conversation with PEOPLE magazine for this week’s issue, she revealed the secret to maintaining a young and glowing appearance. “The best facelift is a smile,” Seymour told the outlet adding, “If you want to look young, just smile from ear to ear.” But, “to set the record straight — because people were getting it wrong — they attempted to do something to my under-eyes when I was 40 because photographers kept saying that I had bulgy eyes,” the now 73-year-old Harry Wild star revealed. She continued, “The doctor told me it's actually a muscle, so there's nothing I can do about it.” Additionally, the British actress also quipped that she’s had “quite a good career considering the bulgy eye” however she mentioned that she does not want to “do anything permanent.” “I've been playing a lot of amazing roles, recently two women with Alzheimer's with very emotional scenes, and if you're going to be that emotional, you need every muscle in your face,” Jane Seymour added, explaining why she avoids synthetic procedures.",

The final between KKR and SRH didn’t include a single Indian player who is going to the T20 World Cup which will be played in the United States and West Indies from June 1. Only Rinku Singh was a part of KKR but he is going to the World Cup as a travelling reserve. Talking to Sportskeeda Cricket , Akram joked: \"At least this time, Indian players will not make an excuse of being tired during the mega event.\" \"Well, now at least none of them will have to say that they are tired. They were thinking ahead, what is the point of reaching the final, India is more important, we will play with the country. But it could be a blessing in disguise for India,\" he said. \"We discussed in the previous show that I was worried that they might be tired, and they will be tired, no doubt. Even America is not their road. I think Pakistan's first match is Dallas if I remember. Now they will go and play there, one or two practice matches. It will be okay, I suppose. It is T20, the boys will recover, nowadays fitness levels are very high.” The first batch of Indian players, who did not play in IPL playoffs, left for the USA on Saturday evening including their captain Rohit Sharma and others. Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Dube, Mohammed Siraj, Axar Patel and Shubman Gill left India on Saturday night for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

        "content": "Tennis star Rafael Nadal has been knocked out of the French Open 2024 in Round 1 by Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(5) and 6-3 on Monday. Nadal, who won 22 Grand Slams, tried to give his best similar to that of the old days to triumph on Court Philippe Chatrier, but the 37-year-old failed. In a post-match talk, the 14-time Roland Garros champion said Monday: \"It is incredible, I want to say thank you. It is difficult for me to talk. I am not 100% sure if this is going to be the last time I am in front of you. The feelings I have today are hard to describe.\" \"To feel the love in the place I love the most. I have to congratulate Sascha for this great match. I know 2022 has been a super tough moment for you and so I wish you the best.\" Rafael Nadal was able to secure 90 points over his opponent’s 109. He was served at 0-30 in his potentially last game, according to The Telegraph . The Spanish athlete underwent a hip surgery rendering him to only play four tournaments since January last year. Nadal won his maiden French Open title in 2005. Till then, he had 14 titles on his name. He said: \"I have been going through a tough moment, so many injuries but I went through it to get back here. I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. There is a big chance I won’t be back but I can’t say 100%. My body is feeling better than two months ago.\" The Spaniard’s impeccable record at Clay makes him as widely the greatest player of Clay's season as in 116 matches he played at Roland Garros, he only lost four times, which includes Monday’s defeat. Nadal added: \"I have amazing feelings on this court, I never dreamed as a kid I would be here at 28. Sorry, 38. I would love to be 28! All the memories have been different, so special. Support has been unforgettable. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here, to be honest. I'm not 100 sure.\"",

The post, originally shared by the comedian Mathias Nastos was actually about missing Candy and his presence. “Sometimes outta nowhere...I’ll think of this guy and miss the living hell out of him,” a comment across a photo of Candy read in capital letters. Reynolds shared the post on one of his Instagram Stories, set to the instrumentals of the song, Power to Believe by The Dream Academy, the soundtrack of the late actor’s film, Plane Trains and Automobiles. “Retro Rewind 80s: The Candy Man Can,” the caption of the Instagram post added. “Although guys like Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd tend to get most of the recognition for their 80s comedies, John Candy was easily one of the funniest men in the movies,” the caption of the reposted upload read. It continued, “The man had perfect comedic timing on screen, charisma that was second to none, and the ability to make every film better with even the smallest of cameos.”",

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani on Monday signed two new ordinances, the Election Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024. After the promulgation of Election Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, the election tribunals will have the retired judges as its members besides the serving jurists. Meanwhile, the NAB Ordinance extended the period of remanding accused in National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cases from 14 days to 40 days. Moreover, the sentence duration for the officer convicted for framing cases based on ill will has been reduced to two years from five years. The promulgation comes after the federal cabinet’s approval of the amendments in the two ordinances. The acting president signed the Election (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as President Asif Zardari is currently in Dubai. The development comes ahead of the Supreme Court hearing of the NAB amendments case, which is slated to take place on May 30. A three-member bench of the SC, in September 2023, had approved Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan’s petition challenging amendments made to the country’s accountability laws during the tenure of the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led government. Headed by then-chief justice Umar Ata Bandial, and comprising Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ijazul Ahsan, the court held more than 50 hearings and in its majority 2-1 verdict restored graft cases against public office holders that were closed down following the amendments. The apex court ordered restoring all graft cases, worth less than Rs500 million against the political leaders belonging to different political parties and public office holders, which were closed and declared the amendments void. The verdict provisioned far-reaching consequences as the striking down of the amendments would mean that references against some of the country’s political bigwigs will once again land in the accountability courts. Following the verdict, the federal government filed an appeal under Section 5 of the Supreme Court law against the apex court’s order.",

        "content": "LAHORE: Announcing the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) intra-party elections, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Public and Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has said that party supremo Nawaz Sharif will be seen proactively \"playing his role in national politics soon\". Sanaullah, addressing a press conference in Lahore on Monday, announced that the ruling party commenced the process of the intra-party elections by the PML-N’s constitution and an election commission was also established by a central working committee. The former federal minister said that nomination papers were issued from 9am to 5pm today which would also be continued before 12pm by tomorrow (Tuesday). \"Scrutiny of the nomination papers will be performed at 1pm, whereas, candidates could withdraw their nominations by 2:30pm, tomorrow.\" He added: “Overall, 11 nominations have been issued so far. At 3pm tomorrow, final lists of the candidates will be issued and a general council’s session will be held afterwards.” He added that the party would organise the polls for electing its president at 4pm tomorrow. Sanaullah went on to say that Bashir Memon, Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, Ishaq Dar, Raja Muhammad Farooq, Hafiz Hafeez-ur-Rehman and Shah Ghulam Qadir have received their nomination papers today. He said that Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — a disgruntled PML-N leader who had applied to register a new political party last month — could also submit his nominations, however, the scrutiny committee will decide on his “eligibility” to contest the party’s intra-party polls. Regarding Nawaz, the PML-N senior leader said that the entire party agreed on the former premier’s name for the party’s presidency. \"However, the party would welcome if someone else wants to submit nominations for taking part in the upcoming polls.\" Sanaullah further said that Nawaz transformed the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz into a popular public party after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah that ruled the country four times. “In case no candidates, the party’s president would be elected unopposed, otherwise, polling will be held via a show of hands,” he added. The politico said that Nawaz was not angry with someone and was fully active in national politics. He added that all decisions of the federal and the Punjab governments would be taken after Nawaz's approval. He further said that lesser statements from the PML-N supremo would be ended, soon. The premier’s aide added that the ruling PML-N was considering recommendations to reshuffle the party positions. He said that Shehbaz Sharif would be the next leader after Nawaz on which the entire party was agreed upon for the presidency. He praised Shehbaz, the incumbent prime minister, for making maximum efforts to pull the country out of the economic crisis. To a question regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Sanaullah replied that he would continue to warn the nation against the former ruling party’s founder Imran Khan. He added that he was continuously warning the nation that the ousted premier would push the country into a big turmoil. The former security czar said that he was unaware of sources pushing the incarcerated PTI founder for making political blunders, however, “stupidity” could be committed by any individual. “I would pray for the PTI founder not to face the same consequences as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” he added.",

        "content": "KARACHI: The provincial authorities once again deferred the matriculation exams in Karachi slated for Tuesday as the country will observe national holiday tomorrow on account of Youm-e-Takbeer. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced a public holiday on Youm-e-Takbeer to mark the historic day when Pakistan conducted successful nuclear tests in the hills of Chaghai in 1998. Later, Sindh Universities and Boards Minister Mohammad Ali Malkani announced that the papers of IX and X classes will not take place in the metropolis tomorrow (Tuesday) due to the holiday. He said that a new date for tomorrow’s papers will be announced later. It may be noted that the Board of Secondary Education Karachi (BSEK) had announced a new schedule for the matric exams, which had been deferred for almost a week due to extremely hot weather. The BSEK had postponed the remaining papers of the IX and X classes, which were supposed to be held between May 21-27, in the wake of an expected heatwave in Sindh. Meanwhile, University of Karachi also announced holiday tomorrow in line with the official announcement. The exams due to be held tomorrow in the varsity have been deferred. In a statement released earlier in the day, PM Shehbaz said the Youm-e-Takbeer reminded the Pakistani nation of unity to make the defence of the country invincible. On this day, the premier said, the entire nation had resolved for the integrity of this country that no compromise would be made on the country’s defence by accepting any kind of external pressure. “The Youm-e-Takbeer reminds political and defence forces to unite under one flag, the green crescent flag, to strengthen the defence of this country,” he added.",

        "content": "Kenyan content creator Brenda Jons has made a comeback citing spiritual renewal as the reason why she took a social media detox. In a recent post on social media, the born-again content creator revealed that she had taken a three-month hiatus to focus on deepening her connection with her faith. \"Fasting social media, I took 3 months away to just soak and hear God more clearly. It's been the best vacation ever!!!!\" Brenda Jons said. Jons confessed that for a significant period, she had allowed social media to define her identity, but felt it was time to rediscover herself through the lens of her faith quoting a verse from the book of Jeremiah. \"Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; before you were born, I sanctified you; and I ordained you a prophet to the nations,\" she said. \"I needed to know who that person is. How does He define me and what a faithful God.\" During her hiatus, Brenda Jons shared that she dedicated herself to reading the Bible more fervently, allowing its teachings to guide her. She highlighted the importance of meditation and cited the verse from the Gospel according to John; \"The sheep recognize the voice of the shepherd, the one who feeds them, guides them, and protects them.\" \"Now I can hear Him more. How beautiful,\" she expressed. \"I missed you friends, catch me up, what has the Lord been teaching you?\" she asked. In September 2022, the comedian revealed that she had “As humans we grow every day, things change every day, we develop every day and discover ourselves every day. And with time, I am realizing that wasn’t my identity. It wasn’t who I am but more of a phase,” she stated. The 25-year-old content creator explained that her previous lifestyle was a phase she needed to experience. She has since moved past it and is now focusing on a fulfilling relationship with God. “I accept change, I accept when my life is taking a different turn and I am never scared to start from scratch. I let life flow and I think at this point I am letting God take control of my life,” she stated. “I know people will point fingers saying that I had initially said am gay but I have seen the value of a man in a woman’s life and am telling you a different story and those that will find me to be confused good for you.”",

        "content": "MONACO — The sprinter who set the Under-20 world record at 100 meters has been banned for four years and had his record stripped after anti-doping officials ruled against his claim that his positive test for a performance-enhancer came from eating “recovery gummies.” The Athletics Integrity Unit, which runs track and field's anti-doping operation, announced the penalties Monday for Issam Asinga, who ran an Under-20 record of 9.89 seconds in the 100 at the South American championships last summer. Asinga said in a statement released Monday he will appeal the decision. “Since I began competing, I have always been committed to the integrity of my sport,” Asinga said. “I have been hyper-vigilant and have NEVER used and would NEVER knowingly use any banned substance, risking a promising career and my entire future.” Asinga, who lives in Florida, burst onto the track scene by beating world champion Noah Lyles in April 2023 in a wind-aided time of 9.83. Asinga has been suspended since August, when he tested positive for a banned substance called GW1516, which was developed to build endurance and burn fat but failed medical trials when it was found to cause cancer during tests on rodents. Asinga claimed he took gummies that were supposed to aid in his recovery. He said two containers of the gummies revealed the presence of the banned substance but the AIU panel that heard the case said he did not satisfy the burden of proof that the gummies were the source of the drug found in his sample. His statement said the lot number of the Gatorade Recovery Gummies that Asinga consumed weren’t the same as the ones tested in his case. His statement said that requests to “obtain a sealed container from the exact lot number for testing were denied by PepsiCo.” “Sadly, in 2023 while I was still a high school senior, PepsiCo gave me a Gatorade gift package which contained Gatorade Recovery Gummies, displaying the industry-approved NSF Certified for Sport logo,” Asinga said. “The containers given to me were later tested at a WADA-accredited laboratory which identified that the product given to me was contaminated with GW1516, the same substance I tested positive for in trace amounts. Further, it turned out that the lot number on the containers given to me was NOT from an NSF-Certified for Sport lot.” Asinga added: “While I respect the AIU’s responsibility to protect the sport, I am devastated that they issued the harshest ruling without regard for these facts and the evidence presented, which showed that the product I was given and took the week before my positive test was contaminated. I am even more disheartened by misleading product labeling from a major corporation and their refusal to provide product samples needed to help an athlete they honored as their Gatorade Athlete of the Year.” The penalties, which can be appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, scrub all his results since July 18, including the world-record time and the 100 and 200-meter crowns from last year's South American championships. “My goal has always been to use my gift to follow my dream of a track and field career, continuing my parents’ amazing legacy,” Asinga said. “I am a young man of integrity.”",

        "content": "The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has said the state under his watch has the lowest records of out-of-school children in Nigeria. He attributed the feat to the huge investment of his government in the education sector. Soludo disclosed this during the 2024 Children’s Day celebration held at the Alex Ekwueme Square on Monday, which witnessed March past by school children and uniformed organisations, cutting of cake, cultural dance and fashion parade, among other activities He said, “We’re here to celebrate our future, our future, and others who were not able to join us here. This is the third time I’ve witnessed Children’s Day since I assumed office, but this is the largest. “I can see the glorious future of Anambra and Nigeria as we behold their faces. We’re deliberately investing in our children, who are our bridge. “In two years, we’ve employed over 8,000 teachers because they’re our greatest asset. Currently, Anambra has the lowest number of out-of-school children in the country. We are targeting making it zero. “We’re having sleepless nights because of you. Roads will wash away, skyscrapers will collapse, but investment in children will stand the test of time.” While commending the teachers for their commitments to training the children, the governor assured that his government would not lower the bar in the recruitment of standard teachers, stressing that Anambra children deserved the best. “We call on everyone to invest in education because it is everyone’s responsibility. If you can save money on your favourite brand of drink, you can buy a pencil for the child. That’s a way of investing in education,” he added. The Commissioner for Women’s Affairs and Social Welfare, Hon. Ify Obinabo, urged parents to offer their children the needed parent-child relationship and make their homes more conducive for them to thrive amidst challenges. “Governor Soludo’s manifesto shows that enhancing the well-being of the Nigerian child through quality education and skill development is possible and achievable to build a livable and prosperous homeland. “Enhancing the well-being of the Nigerian child is not the sole responsibility of the government. It requires multi-stakeholder synergy, such as parents and guardians, whose major role focuses on creating the needed healthy environment for our children to blossom,” she said. The State Commissioner of Police, CP Nnaghe Obono Itam, who also witnessed the celebration, urges parents and guardians to be better role models for their children and wards by creating a deliberate relationship with them, as it will help to assess and direct them properly. In her brief congratulatory message, the Convener of WIGA (Umunwanyi Soludo), Hon. Mrs Amaka Obi, urged the children to always believe in themselves while pursuing their dreams in life. The Nigerian Tribune reports that the winners of this celebration include Girls Secondary School Awka (secondary category), Udoka Primary School Awka (practitioner school category), and Nadora Nursery School Awka (nursery school category).

        "content": "Andela, a leading private marketplace for technical talent, said it grew Nigeria’s technical talent by 791 per cent in the last four years, starting in January 2020. The growth milestone was announced as Andela celebrates its 10th anniversary with a series of international events recently held across the United States, the United Kingdom, and multiple African countries. Andela said in a statement on Thursday that it had played a significant role in transforming Africa’s tech landscape, training over 110,000 technologists since January 2020. “110,000 technologists have been trained through Andela’s programs, exceeding the original 10-year goal of 100,000. 15 per cent of Africa’s estimated 716,000 engineers were skilled through Andela,” the company stated. According to the co-founder and CEO of Andela, Jeremy Johnson, building a great company was fundamentally an exercise in hiring great people. The CEO remarked, “At Andela, I have been unbelievably blessed to work with extraordinary humans on this now decade-long journey. Bringing people together and fostering a sense of community in our marketplace has been part of our secret sauce. “As we look to the future, Andela will continue to show why we are the most trusted tech talent marketplace for enterprises. Our customers will continue to experience the world as a hiring pool, and technology will continue to enable us to extend that reach,” Johnson expounded. Abdela is backed by prominent investors such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Softbank, Google Ventures, Serena Ventures, and Generation Investment Management, making it the first talent marketplace to become a unicorn company and one of the seven unicorn companies founded in Africa. Through its rigorously qualified global marketplace of skilled technologists, Andela’s adaptive hiring model has emerged as a future-proof solution, empowering businesses such as MasterCard, GitHub, and Tawi Fesh to rapidly scale world-class teams on demand to meet their evolving needs, the company stated. By tapping into 60 per cent of Andela’s qualified tech talent pool from largely untapped markets like Africa and LATAM, these businesses gain access to cost-efficient tech expertise and diversity of thought while also benefiting from hiring speeds up to 70 per cent faster than traditional recruiting methods. The Community Programs Manager of Andela, Ofejiro Ikogho, said, “We, at Andela, celebrate a decade of impact and reflect on the transformative journey that began in Lagos. Over these years, our technologists have been instrumental in catalyzing the growth of tech communities across Africa, showcasing their profound talent and potential.",

Explore the astrological forecasts for each of the twelve zodiac signs, from Aries to Pisces. The day offers opportunities for self-discipline by balancing work and personal life. Learn more about today’s zodiac forecasts. Aries Horoscope Today Aries, the ram butts forward with confidence today! Work ignites your fiery spirit, and your creative juices are bubbling over. You’ll tackle office problems with innovative solutions, leaving your colleagues in awe. Remember, Aries, a true leader listens as well as commands. Lend an ear to your team’s ideas – you might be surprised by the gems you uncover. The evening brings a social whirl, and you’ll connect with an influential figure who can boost your professional network. So, Aries, charge ahead with confidence, unleash your creativity, and watch your success take root! Taurus Horoscope Today Feeling the weight of relationship woes, Taurus? Your love life is in a rough patch, leaving you emotionally drained and yearning for security. The future seems bleak, and the spark seems to be fading. But don’t despair! Healing is possible. Consider a change of scenery – a quick getaway could be the perfect reset button. Distance can help you both gain perspective and rekindle the flame. Remember, communication is key. Before you pack your bags, have an honest conversation with your partner. Open communication and a willingness to heal can work wonders. Gemini Horoscope Today Feeling curious, Gemini? The stars are urging you to break out of your shell and explore the world! New experiences and environments beckon, promising to expand your already impressive knowledge. Mingle with fresh faces – they’ll challenge your perspectives and introduce you to new ways of thinking. Don’t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone, Gemini. Embrace new ideas, and who knows, you might even shed some outdated beliefs along the way. This openness can also lead to deeper connections. Take a chance on a meaningful conversation – it could blossom into a beautiful friendship or even more. Cancer Horoscope Today Cancer, the Moon is your ruler, and today it’s guiding you on a journey of self-discovery. A sudden disconnect from the outside world might be unsettling at first, but it’s a gift in disguise. This detachment is helping you see your own worth and prompting you to connect with your inner self and spirituality. This introspective mood might make you crave a quiet space for meditation or reflection. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself drawn to others who share your spiritual interests. Embrace the openness, Cancer, for it will lead you to wisdom and a deeper understanding of yourself. Leo Horoscope Today Leo, the spotlight is on you today! You’re radiating charisma, and everyone wants a piece of your sunshine. But remember, Leo, with great attention comes great responsibility. Handle everyone’s demands with grace and a healthy dose of humility – it’ll make you shine even brighter in the professional arena. The home front might require some juggling, though. Finding time for chores between social engagements could prove tricky. Don’t mask any guilt with aggression, Leo. Acknowledge your commitments and delegate or reschedule when needed. A little honesty goes a long way, and your loved ones will appreciate your efforts. Virgo Horoscope Today Attention to detail Virgo, today’s forecast brims with opportunity! A new project or the exciting kick-off of one you’ve been waiting for is on the horizon. This could involve collaborating with a fresh team, bringing together a diverse range of perspectives. Remember, Virgo, in this situation, listening is your superpower. Absorb the ideas of others, learn from their expertise, and let that knowledge guide your own contributions. While enthusiasm is wonderful, avoid overstepping professional boundaries. Stay focused on your role and use this as a learning experience. Libra Horoscope Today Libra, your diplomatic skills are usually top-notch, but today it’s best to tread carefully. Avoid the urge to dispense advice in areas where you’re clueless. This might not only lead to bad advice, but also make you miss out on valuable learning opportunities. Instead, be the gracious listener, Libra. Let others share their expertise – you might be surprised by the financial knowledge gems you uncover! By stepping back and letting others shine, you open yourself up to new money-making possibilities. Remember, sometimes the best way to gain is by learning, and there’s always something new to discover. Scorpio Horoscope Today Scorpio, it seems a recent social experience has prompted some introspection. You’re feeling a surge of self-awareness and a desire to transform yourself – your look, your interactions, your overall presentation to the world. This isn’t about external validation, though. It’s about embracing the most graceful, beautiful version of you for your own satisfaction. The good news? Your partner might be your biggest cheerleader on this journey of self-discovery. They’ll support you as you shed the layers that no longer serve you and step into your most confident, authentic self. Remember, Scorpio, true beauty radiates from within. Focus on self-love, self-care, and becoming the best version of you. Sagittarius Horoscope Today Uh oh, Sagittarius, looks like your arrow might miss the mark today. Setting your sights on a special someone within your friend zone can be tricky, but here’s the thing: being overly obvious and putting on a fake persona is a recipe for disaster. You might scare them off with an inauthentic approach. Instead, Archer, be yourself! Let your genuine personality shine through. Don’t force the romance – let it unfold naturally. Building a deeper connection through shared experiences and honest conversations is a far better strategy than grand gestures or pretending to be someone you’re not. Authenticity is key, Sagittarius. Show your true colours, and if it’s meant to be, a spark will ignite. Capricorn Horoscope Today Congratulations, Capricorn! The cosmic weather is bringing a sprinkle of good fortune your way today. At work, expect a wave of support and appreciation from colleagues. Your dedication and hard work haven’t gone unnoticed, and you might even see a raise or discover a new income stream. Here’s a tip: maintain a light and easy demeanour in the office. A calm and collected Capricorn can have a soothing effect on everyone around them. You’re brimming with creative ideas, but for now, keep them under wraps. Jot them down somewhere before they vanish into the ether! Remember, strategic timing is key. So, bask in the recognition, Capricorn, and file away those brilliant ideas for the perfect moment to unleash them. Aquarius Horoscope Today Aquarius, the winds of change are blowing strong today! New and exciting opportunities are swirling around you, beckoning you to explore. But with so many paths to choose from, how do you pick the right one? Focus on your goals, Aquarius. A clear vision will help you identify the people and projects that truly align with your aspirations. Remember, collaboration is key. Surround yourself with a team that shares your vision and brings diverse skills to the table. Don’t be afraid to lay down some ground rules – a bit of practicality will ensure everyone’s on the same page. And finally, Aquarius, embrace openness! Be receptive to new ideas and approaches – they could lead to unexpected breakthroughs and lucrative collaborations. Pisces Horoscope Today Pisces, listen to your inner voice today. Your emotional well-being needs to take centre stage. Finding harmony in your relationship might be challenging right now. Your partner’s career focus has them feeling overwhelmed and a little short-tempered. Their frustration might manifest as aggression, leaving you feeling unheard and hurt. Seek solace in a friend who can offer a healthy mix of fun and intellectual stimulation. Talking things out with this confidante can provide much-needed emotional support and a fresh perspective. Remember, Pisces, communication is key in any relationship. Once you’ve had a chance to process your own feelings, consider having a heart-to-heart with your partner.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal cut an emotional figure after falling to a first round French Open defeat to Alexander Zverev. The tennis legend has won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles in Paris and is dubbed as the 'King of Clay' amid such immense success. Nadal missed last year's French Open due to injury and hinted that 2024 could be his final year of action ahead of retirement. And his hopes of winning the tournament one more time potentially came to an end on Monday in a 3-6 6-7 3-6 first round defeat to Zverev. Nadal appeared downbeat afterwards, with the crowd applauding him having set such a long-lasting legacy on the court. Zverev was first to speak after his win but kept it short: \"Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment. I'm not going to speak much.\" Nadal then said: \"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's going to be the last time that I'm going to be here in front of all of you, honestly. \"I am not 100 per cent sure but if it's the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparation. \"And today, the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words but for me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most.\" He added: \"I have to congratulate Sascha [Zverev] for this great match and last week victory in Rome [Italian Open], I really wish you all the best for the rest of the tournament. \"2022 I know had been a super tough moment for you so you deserve many congratulations and all the best. \"For me, as I said before, I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through this process to try to... with the dream to be back here in Roland Garros. \"I hope to see you again\" Rafael Nadal gives a heartfelt speech after his loss to Alexander Zverev 🥹🎾 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/SPvDiyocAC \"It's true that the first round hasn't been the ideal one, so I just have to accept that, I needed something else. I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player like Sascha. \"For me, it's difficult to say what's going on in the future. It's probably a big percentage that I will not be back playing here at Roland Garros, but I can't say 100 per cent. \"I enjoy playing here a lot, I am travelling with the family and I'm having fun. The body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say, 'It's enough, I can't give anything else.' But this is something I don't feel yet, I have some goals in front [of me]. \"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me. That's going to be another chance and I really hope to be well prepared. \"The amount of feelings that I have on this amazing court during all my tennis career is just unbelievable, I never could imagine when I was a kid that I will be here almost 28... 38-years-old, I would love 28, with all the success that I had here winning so many times. \"Something I never could dream about and yeah, it has been a very beautiful process, all the memories every single year have been different but not less special than the others. \"And what makes me feel so special is everything, all the people who are in Roland Garros behind the scenes, helping me since the first time that I came here, have been unforgettable, all the support. \"The support of all my people there, family, team, friends, everybody who helped me in some moment of my life, I can't thank enough all of them. \"Last thing, all the people, the feelings that you made me feel here are just unforgettable. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart and I really hope to see you again, I don't know. Merci beaucoup!\" Nadal's dominance at the French Open commenced with his first title in 2005 before further success followed in the next three years. The 37-year-old the became the first and only player to ever win five successive titles at Roland Garros from 2010 to 2014. He won a further five titles after that to cement his legendary status in Paris, with his last triumph coming in 2022. Nadal missed the Australian Open at the beginning of the year due to a muscle problem and with retirement a possibility, he could be set to play two final Grand Slams. Next up is Wimbledon in July, a tournament he has won on two occasions, with the US Open the last major tournament in August.",

        "content": "MONACO (AP) — The sprinter who set the Under-20 world record at 100 meters has been banned for four years and had his record stripped after anti-doping officials ruled against his claim that his positive test for a performance-enhancer came from eating “recovery gummies.” The Athletics Integrity Unit, which runs track and field’s anti-doping operation, announced the penalties Monday for Issam Asinga, who ran an Under-20 record of 9.89 seconds in the 100 at the South American championships last summer. Asinga said in a statement released Monday he will appeal the decision. “Since I began competing, I have always been committed to the integrity of my sport,” Asinga said . “I have been hyper-vigilant and have NEVER used and would NEVER knowingly use any banned substance, risking a promising career and my entire future.” Asinga, who lives in Florida, burst onto the track scene by beating world champion Noah Lyles in April 2023 in a wind-aided time of 9.83. Asinga has been suspended since August, when he tested positive for a banned substance called GW1516, which was developed to build endurance and burn fat but failed medical trials when it was found to cause cancer during tests on rodents. Asinga claimed he took gummies that were supposed to aid in his recovery. He said two containers of the gummies revealed the presence of the banned substance but the AIU panel that heard the case said he did not satisfy the burden of proof that the gummies were the source of the drug found in his sample. His statement said the lot number of the Gatorade Recovery Gummies that Asinga consumed weren’t the same as the ones tested in his case. His statement said that requests to “obtain a sealed container from the exact lot number for testing were denied by PepsiCo.” “Sadly, in 2023 while I was still a high school senior, PepsiCo gave me a Gatorade gift package which contained Gatorade Recovery Gummies, displaying the industry-approved NSF Certified for Sport logo,” Asinga said. “The containers given to me were later tested at a WADA-accredited laboratory which identified that the product given to me was contaminated with GW1516, the same substance I tested positive for in trace amounts. Further, it turned out that the lot number on the containers given to me was NOT from an NSF-Certified for Sport lot.” Asinga added: “While I respect the AIU’s responsibility to protect the sport, I am devastated that they issued the harshest ruling without regard for these facts and the evidence presented, which showed that the product I was given and took the week before my positive test was contaminated. I am even more disheartened by misleading product labeling from a major corporation and their refusal to provide product samples needed to help an athlete they honored as their Gatorade Athlete of the Year.” The penalties, which can be appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, scrub all his results since July 18, including the world-record time and the 100 and 200-meter crowns from last year’s South American championships. “My goal has always been to use my gift to follow my dream of a track and field career, continuing my parents’ amazing legacy,” Asinga said. “I am a young man of integrity.” ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

        "description": "LONDON: Pakistan paceman Haris Rauf believes the three months he spent on the sidelines injured with a dislocated shoulder could yet prove a “blessing in disguise” as he gears up for the Twenty20 World Cup.The 30-year-old fast bowler made an encouraging return to competitive cricket, taking 2-34, in the second match of Pakistan’s warm-up series against T20 world champions England in Birmingham on Saturday.“I was injured the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,” he told a pre-match press conference in Cardiff on Monday ahead of the third T20.“Because you have time to recover and reassess your game-plans. I felt good coming back to cricket.

        "content": "LONDON: Pakistan paceman Haris Rauf believes the three months he spent on the sidelines injured with a dislocated shoulder could yet prove a “blessing in disguise” as he gears up for the Twenty20 World Cup. The 30-year-old fast bowler made an encouraging return to competitive cricket, taking 2-34, in the second match of Pakistan’s warm-up series against T20 world champions England in Birmingham on Saturday. “I was injured the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,” he told a pre-match press conference in Cardiff on Monday ahead of the third T20. “Because you have time to recover and reassess your game-plans.

        "content": "Justin and Hailey Bieber met as teens and the rest has been history. A video of Justin and Hailey's first time meet-up resurfaced after they announced that they were expecting their first child together . In the video, Justin greeted his now-wife and her father Stephen Baldwin in 2009. The two were at the TODAY show, which Justin performed at and Hailey was there supporting her father. Stephen introduces her to Justin backstage and it was quite awkward as Hailey had her arms crossed. Beliebers resurfaced the video of the meet up on X, formerly known as Twitter , and reminisced on the moment. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . READ MORE: Justin Bieber's sweet first time meeting Hailey Bieber resurfaces as fans gush over 'adorable' video Justin Bieber meeting his now-wife Hailey Bieber for the first time ( Image: Today/Youtube) One person wrote: \"Imagine having video proof of the very first time you made eye contact with the love of your life?\" Another person wrote: \"Who knew that awkward encounter would lead to a lifetime of love and happiness?\" A third person wrote: \"Bieber babies will have the sweetest bedtime love story of their parents.\" Hailey has talked about the awkward encounter in the past. On February 28, 2020 she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and reflected on the first time she met Justin. She said that it sounds \"like this weird arranged marriage situation\" but did not think anything about the situation at all. That day in 2009, she also met his mother, Pattie Mallete, who connected with Hailey's father as friends and invited Justin and Pattie over to the Baldwin's home the next day. She revealed that they had dinner and then went bowling. Fans reminisced on the moment ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) Hailey said: \"Nowhere was there a thought that I was like, 'Yeah, he probably has a crush on me.' I did not — that was not the case at all. We just were hanging and [now] that is my entire husband. It’s ridiculous.\" After their first interaction, the two remained good friends. Even though Hailey did not think she and Justin would be a married couple after their first time meeting, they both did always want to be parents. In the YouTube series, Justin Bieber : Our World, Hailey and Justin talked about having their own family one day after getting married. In a clip shown in the series, Justin said that his intentions for 2021 was to put his family first and to hopefully \"start trying\" to \"squish out a nugget,\" referring to a baby.",

        "content": "LEXXE stars in the “Baroque and Burlesque” production of “Queen of Hearts,” which is being performed at Theatre XIV by Company XIV in Brooklyn. It is their own distinct take on “Alice in Wonderland,” where they encouraged the audience members to go down the rabbit hole with them. The cast and company are able to dust off the Lewis Carroll classic book “ Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland ,” and they are able to give it a modern, refreshing twist to it, which is coupled with circus, dancing, acrobatics, burlesque, music, and vibrant designs. The end result is a show that is lush, campy, lavish, and theatrical. It encompasses elements of the “Moulin Rouge!” musical meets “Burlesque” (starring Cher and Christina Aguilera). Overall, “Queen of Hearts” is memorable from start to finish. Strong performances led by LEXXE gave this show its beating heart (who was Lady Gaga-caliber good talent-wise). It is not afraid to push the boundaries in a fun and provocative way. “Queen of Hearts” is well worth more than just a passing glance, and it is a keeper.

        "content": "Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have made a significant breakthrough in Alzheimer's disease research by identifying a novel way to potentially slow down or even halt disease progression. The study, which focuses on the role of reactive astrocytes and the plexin-B1 protein in Alzheimer's pathophysiology, provides crucial insights into brain cell communication and opens the door to innovative treatment strategies. It was published in Nature Neuroscience (DOI 10.1038/s41593-024-01664-w) on May 27. This groundbreaking work is centered on the manipulation of the plexin-B1 protein to enhance the brain's ability to clear amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Reactive astrocytes, a type of brain cell that becomes activated in response to injury or disease, were found to play a crucial role in this process. They help control the spacing around amyloid plaques, affecting how other brain cells can access and clear these harmful deposits. Our findings offer a promising path for developing new treatments by improving how cells interact with these harmful plaques.\" Roland Friedel, PhD, Associate Professor of Neuroscience, and Neurosurgery, at Icahn Mount Sinai and senior author of the study The research was driven by the analysis of complex data comparing healthy individuals to those with Alzheimer's, aiming to understand the disease's molecular and cellular foundations. Hongyan Zou, PhD, Professor of Neurosurgery, and Neuroscience, at Icahn Mount Sinai and one of the study's lead authors, highlighted the broader implications of their findings: \" Our study opens new pathways for Alzheimer's research, emphasizing the importance of cellular interactions in developing neurodegenerative disease treatments.\" One of the study's most significant achievements is its validation of multiscale gene network models of Alzheimer's disease. \"This study not only confirms one of the most important predictions from our gene network models but also significantly advances our understanding of Alzheimer's. It lays a solid foundation for developing novel therapeutics targeting such highly predictive network models,\" said Bin Zhang, PhD, Willard T.C. Johnson Research Professor of Neurogenetics at Icahn Mount Sinai and one of the study's lead authors. By demonstrating the critical role of plexin-B1 in Alzheimer's disease, the research underscores the potential of targeted therapies to disrupt the disease's progression. The research team emphasizes that while their findings mark a significant advance in the fight against Alzheimer's, more research is needed to translate these discoveries into treatments for human patients. \"Our ultimate goal is to develop treatments that can prevent or slow down Alzheimer's progression ,\" Dr. Zhang added, outlining the team's commitment to further exploring the therapeutic potential of plexin-B1. This study is supported by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) grants U01AG046170 and RF1AG057440 and is part of the NIA-led Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) Target Discovery and Preclinical Validation program. This public private partnership aims to shorten the time between the discovery of potential drug targets and the development of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease treatment and prevention.

        "content": "Despite Joe Burrow suffering a season-ending right wrist injury in Week 11 last season, the Cincinnati Bengals don't seem too concerned about the quarterback's health. Before the start of OTAs on Tuesday, Bengals offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher told Geoff Hobson of the team website that Burrow won't be on a pitch count. \"We designed the whole thing to stay within the constraints of where the medical people think he should be and where he wants to be right now,\" Pitcher said , via Hobson. \"Nobody is sitting there with a special pitch counter. But we've been smart in how we put it together.\" Pitcher also seemed to signal Burrow is making a quick recovery, noting how he has \"all his range and power.\" Burrow — a former No. 1 overall pick — is one of the best QBs in the league, but his durability is an issue. During his rookie season in 2020, he suffered a season-ending ACL tear. He also injured his calf during training camp last season. If Burrow stays healthy, he could help the Bengals win their first Super Bowl. The 27-year-old QB guided Cincinnati to Super Bowl LVI, where the Bengals lost 23-20 to the Los Angeles Rams. Plus, he leads active players in completion percentage ( 68 percent ), per Pro Football Reference. Joe Burrow connecting with Ja'Marr Chase for a 64-yard touchdown! (Via: NFL, CBS) pic.twitter.com/ZP7fFNRdKN The Bengals' decision not to place Burrow on a pitch count could be an excellent sign. It suggests that they're not worried about him suffering another injury, and he is making solid progress. In 2021, Burrow won Comeback Player of the Year. Perhaps he'll capture the award for a second time this upcoming season. As of Monday, DraftKings gives him the second-best CPOY odds (+200) behind New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers.",

        "description": "Do the Nuggets or the Avs have more heavy lifting left in order to get back to winning a championship?",
        "content": "OK, the reality of the Nuggets’ elimination clobbered me over the head Sunday. And scratched my arms and hurt my back. Instead of spending the day in Dallas preparing for the Western Conference Finals Game 3, I removed a bush in my front yard. The bush won. But after my light head regained its bearings, I started thinking: Who has more work to do this offseason to win a championship? Is it the Nuggets or the Avs, who also exited in the second round? Oh, that’s easy, compadre. It’s the Avalanche. Not only do the ’22 Stanley Cup champs have two holes among their top-6 forwards in the absences of Valeri Nichushkin and Gabe Landeskog, but the timetables involving both remain a mystery. With the former, he’s slated to get the first crack at applying for reinstatement from his suspension in November, which is great. But what happens after that? Big Val made it 40 games this last regular season before having to re-enter the player assistance program — and was brilliant for much of those 40 games, collecting 22 goals and 20 assists before leaving for roughly a month. How long will it take him to get back up to speed? How long will he be able to remain on the active roster under increased testing and monitoring cycles? Every week could feel like a roll of the dice. For me, it is also the Avs. They remain in an uncomfortable position with captain Gabe Landeskog and Valeri Nichushkin. Landeskog has five years remaining on his $56 million contract. He has not played in two years, and while his motivation remains fierce to play for his family and teammates, there is no guarantee he will return from cartilage replacement surgery in his right knee. And the Avs don’t just need him back. They need him back as an impact player. We all want Nichushkin healthy. He cannot return until November from his suspension, and only if he follows the protocol. It creates a squeamish scenario of bringing Nichushkin back to a potentially untrusting locker room while getting elite production and wondering if he will be banned for his next misstep. If anybody’s going to fight to get back on the ice, and leave on his own terms, it’s Landy. Gabe’s joke last week about his return landing at any point from “mid-September and start of April” got some chuckles, but it’s also getting less funny by the month. In order to move forward, even in the short term, the Avs need to figure out whether they’ve got the cap money from an LTIR designation to play with or not — or whether they’ve got an active captain or not. If you don’t respect what Landy brought to the Avs over more than a decade, you haven’t got a soul. But nobody’s winning another Cup until all this murky and vague stuff has clarity. The key for the Avs and Nuggets is winning in the margins. They need Botox, not facelifts. For the Avs, that means or, on the pricier side, Evan Rodrigues. They also should benefit from a full season of trade deadline acquisitions Casey Mittelstadt and Sean Walker. The Nuggets are likely to lose Kentavious Caldwell-Pope — the Sixers are the favorite — and Christian Braun is probably a year away from being ready to start on a championship team. So would the Nuggets consider a trade for a viable replacement? And let’s be honest, Nikola Jokic needs a backup to log minutes during the regular season, so how about dealing for Kelly Olynyk? The Nuggets cannot stand down and elevate next year. The good news? The floors for both the Nuggets and Avs are still relatively high and the cores are largely intact. For now. But the clock is ticking for Calvin Booth, too. There’s KCP. Jamal Murray can become an unrestricted free agent after next season. Aaron Gordon has a player option with a June 29, 2025 deadline. Jokic’s player-option deadline looms two years after that. Even if the Avs are happy to play the “long game” by waiting out Val and Landy, if the Nuggets think they’ve got the same luxury, they’re fooling themselves. Time flies when you’re having this much fun.",

        "content": "QUÉBEC — The Tri-City ValleyCats (6-9) fired on all cylinders for a 5-1 victory against the Québec Capitales (7-8) on Sunday at Stade Canac. Zeke Wood was utilized as an opener and retired all six batters he faced across two frames, striking out two. Both teams were held scoreless for the first five innings. Tri-City broke the deadlock in the sixth. Abdiel Saldana walked Ryan Cash and allowed a single to Jaxon Hallmark. Javeyan Williams and Alec Olund collected back-to-back RBI singles to give the ValleyCats a 2-0 lead. Tri-City added some insurance in the seventh. Ian Walters walked, and Kyle Novak moved him to second with a single. Dylan Broderick went to first on a 5-4 fielder’s choice, and Novak advanced to third. Elvis Peralta doubled in a run, off Ryan Sandberg. Broderick came around on a wild pitch, and Peralta went to third. Cash drove in Broderick by reaching on a fielder’s choice, which gave the ValleyCats a 5-0 advantage. Québec avoided the shutout in the ninth. Jhon Vargas issued a walk to Kyle Crowl before Tommy Seidl picked up an RBI double to cut the deficit to 5-1. Vargas (3-0) induced two consecutive groundouts from Francisco Hernandez and Tyler Osik to seal the victory. He twirled seven innings of one-run ball, walking three, and striking out seven. Saldana (1-1) received the loss. He pitched 6.1 innings, yielding four runs on five hits, walking three, and striking out three. Tri-City starts a three-game set against the Ottawa Titans at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium on Tuesday, May 28. First pitch is scheduled for 6:30 p.m.",

        "content": "Muscat – The Environment Authority (EA) has achieved a significant milestone by successfully cultivating wild myrrh seeds in its nursery in Salalah, outside their original habitat. This accomplishment marks a rare feat, as the myrrh trees were propagated from seeds in a climate vastly different from their natural environment – a first for the sultanate of Oman. An EA official emphasised the importance of this achievement, highlighting its potential to open new avenues for preserving myrrh trees and bolstering their population in their native regions. Myrrh trees, belonging to the frankincense family, are characterised by their small, perennial and spiny nature, reaching heights up to 3m. They typically thrive in semi-desert environments or rain shadow areas in the Dhofar mountains, extending to the Najd region. The dwindling number of myrrh trees in Oman’s wild habitats prompted the EA to act. With fewer than 250 trees remaining in Oman, it conducted a comprehensive survey in 2023, revealing the species to be in a ‘very critical stage’. The EA advocates urgent reassessment of the species’ national classification in alignment with the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s guidelines. The EA stressed the need for joint efforts of all stakeholders and relevant authorities at regional and international levels to safeguard this threatened species. Myrrh tree resin has been historically utilised for various purposes such as perfumes, incense, and medicine. Similar to frankincense, myrrh resin is produced by trees of the Commiphora genus, distinct from the Boswellia trees that yield frankincense. A study conducted by the EA’s Office for Conservation of Environment in Dhofar identified the primary threats to myrrh trees, with overgrazing being the most significant challenge, followed by pests, drought, and unsustainable harvesting methods. In response to these threats, the EA established a dedicated garden for myrrh trees aimed at conserving ‘mother trees’ and setting up a nursery for myrrh seed and seedling production. The study assessed the age of myrrh trees, with the oldest estimated to be around 40 years.",

        "content": "In an interview with Fightful , Kid Lykos spoke about his goals for the second half of 2024, which include a return to Japan and more. Lykos also said he was hoping to improve during his time in RevPro. He said: “ As cringe as it is, my lock screen since like February time has been just list of things i want to achieve. Because I want to move forward and progress with this. One of those things is I want to go back to Japan. My last time I was there, I learned so much in such a short space of time. I think i have something I can offer there. I think I can learn and progress at a good standard there. I obviously want to, like I said to you earlier, I want to achieve the next level of what this is. I think it’s finding in my way there. There’s a lot of goals. As far as immediate goals for the current situation, I think it’s to keep this progress title and keep having great matches and keeping the audience enthused. It would be to progress with my standing in RevPro. I want to prove that I can be one of the guys there as well. Be that in Tag Division, be that if the Cruiserweights need someone to wrestle, be that whatever. Be that if Michael needs a challenger, I will be there. Then all around, there’s goals to be found everywhere, but not necessarily ones that I’m thinking about at current. I just had an opportunity to attack pro wrestling title and didn’t succeed. But being a tag pro wrestling champion would be a very full circle and an important moment for me. So there’s something there. If Attackdecides to reinstate tag titles or whatever, regaining that would be important to me because that was the belt that me and Chris kind of made in that company. So that would be an interest. There’s loads of goals to be had in the immediate vicinity. There’s loads of goals for the future. But for this year, returning to Japan and keeping this progress title are two very important things to me. “",

        "content": "This weekend, former President Donald Trump spoke at the Libertarian National Convention. I give him great credit for that. He was booed mercilessly, except when he promised to pardon a notorious criminal. Although his speech was solid and tailor-made for a Libertarian audience, what really stood out to me was that because he knew he wasn't speaking to an adoring crowd, he left the ad-libs and off-prompter stories for another day. This served him well. I hope he continues with this approach. Advertisement READ MORE: Trump's Speech at the Libertarian National Convention Was a Wild Ride, but Had Some Cheering by the End However, in the context of the upcoming presidential election, the Republican and Libertarian parties really should forge a strategic alliance to challenge incumbent President Joe Biden. Despite their differences, the two parties share several philosophical tenets that could serve as a foundation for collaboration. By focusing on limited government, individual liberty, fiscal conservatism, and free-market principles, Republicans and Libertarians can present a united front that appeals to a broad spectrum of voters. RELATED: Libertarian Chair Just Levels Biden Team After Their Hot Take About Rowdy Reaction to Trump Speech One of the most significant philosophical overlaps between the Republican and Libertarian parties is a belief in limited government. Both parties believe in reducing the size and scope of federal government intervention in citizens' lives. This principle is rooted in the belief that government should not overreach into personal freedoms and that local and state governments are better positioned to address many issues. Trump made it clear in his speech to the Libertarians that he firmly believes in and supports the 10th Amendment. Advertisement Republicans have historically championed deregulation and state sovereignty, arguing that a smaller federal government leads to greater efficiency and individual autonomy. Similarly,...

        "content": "President Joe Biden's campaign has announced his next \"Real President of Genius\" move. When the verdict comes in for the New York Donald Trump lawfare case, where, as I said before, there is no actual crime, and even if there were a crime, it would still be all about sex, Joe Biden \"plans to break his vow of silence and publicly address\" the verdict \"in a White House setting — not a campaign one — to show his statement isn't political.\" Further: Advertisement If the jury convicts Trump, Biden's team will then argue that the result shows Trump is ill-suited for office and that it demonstrates the extremes to which the former president would go to win again. The campaign's social media team is considering leveraging the line of attack further, with discussions underway about referring to the ex-president online as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump.\" Sometimes, it is hard to fathom the stupidity of the Biden campaign. As I said a month ago, the New York case is a \"historic mistake\" by the Democrats and Biden – a Biden former Department of Justice plant is clearly directing it – and as we have seen from the polling, the ridiculously biased case has actually \"backfired spectacularly on the Democrats\" and is helping Donald Trump to a consistent lead in the Presidential polling. There are, of course, three possible outcomes – \"guilty,\" \"not guilty,\" or a hung jury. If Trump is found \"guilty\" by the heavily biased Democrat jury, Biden and his crack crew of political consultants really believe that Biden speaking about it at the White House and calling Trump a \"convict\" is going to be perceived as non-political and will ignite a voter rebellion against Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

In the latest, we see the success of Florida's school choice programs, which represent a step towards a great goal — getting government, at all levels, out of education. Advertisement This is the Way. Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Republicans have spent years aggressively turning the state into a haven for school choice. They have been wildly successful, with tens of thousands more children enrolling in private or charter schools or homeschooling. Now as those programs balloon, some of Florida's largest school districts are facing staggering enrollment declines — and grappling with the possibility of campus closures — as dollars follow the increasing number of parents opting out of traditional public schools. Now, as to that statement about \"...some of Florida's largest school districts are facing staggering enrollment declines,\" I can only reply, \"Yes, and?\" To those school districts, and to the public school absolutists who are clutching their pearls and complaining about the likely closures, I would say: \"If the public schools were doing a better job, parents wouldn't be choosing to enroll their kids elsewhere.

        "content": "The U.S. Government has asked British archaeologists for help in locating the remains of a U.S. pilot whose plane crashed in the dense woodlands of England in 1944. Advertisement Eighty years after the Allies fought to defeat Hitler's Nazi army, there is still a desire to bring closure and honor to those fallen in battle. The crash site is near East Anglia, a rural area that served as a headquarters for the Allies in the 1940s. The unnamed pilot's plane went down after the controls on the B-17 he was flying failed, and it crashed carrying 12,000 pounds of explosives. Cotswold Archaeology will spend six weeks excavating the site. \"This excavation will not be easy — the crash crater is waterlogged and filled with 80 years' worth of sediment, the trees and undergrowth are thick, and all soil must be meticulously sieved to hopefully recover plane ID numbers, personal effects, and any human remains,\"...

Liberty (Bragg), North Carolina was under investigation after he shot and killed a 35-year-old Chechen man who was trespassing on his property. Since the original reports, some disturbing information about the deceased and the company he was allegedly contracting with has come out - and it's got special forces families nationwide spooked. Advertisement Here's a brief synopsis of what happened, courtesy of the Moore County Sheriff's Department: On the evening of May 3, 2024, at approximately 8:15 PM, Moore County Sheriff's Deputies were dispatched to a report of trespassing at a residence along Dowd Road in Carthage, North Carolina. The caller indicated that an individual was observed taking photographs on the property and had become aggressive towards another resident outside their home. Upon arrival, deputies discovered the body of 35-year-old Ramzan Daraev from Chicago, Illinois, who appeared to have sustained gunshot wounds. Daraev was found approximately 250 yards from the roadway, along a powerline on the residential property. Identification was not found on Daraev; however, his identity was later confirmed through family members and an international identification located in his vehicle. Daraev was reported to have been working as a subcontractor for Utilities One, a company based in New Jersey, at the time of his death. Investigators are still working to verify his official employment status. At the time of the incident, Daraev was not in possession of any utility equipment, utility clothing, or identification. The incident has been reported to the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). There are quite a few red flags in just that initial story. First, most utilities send some kind of notice to residents that there will be workers/subcontractors out in the field who might access their property. This... Jennifer Van Laar",

No, it is not.\" Advertisement My father was a soldier. He did not set out to be one, but the world dictated otherwise back in the satanic onyx days of the early 1940s, and so he became a soldier. He fought long and well, huddled in his radio operator's station aboard a B-29 over Japan, focused on the task at hand while thinking about the young bride waiting for him back home again in Indiana. He did his job, and then he went home. This is the soldier's duty, after all: to fight long and well, do their job, and then go home to the place which, by doing their job, had been preserved as their home; theirs and everyone else's home.

        "content": "Another day, another round of this horrible hell in the Israel-Gaza war. On Sunday, the IDF struck a Hamas compound in Rafah, targeting senior Hamas officials. They believe the strike to be successful. Advertisement The densely populated area is a prime location for the Hamas officials to settle down, considering that they have designed this war around their method of using civilians as human shields. Not surprisingly, it is reported that approximately 35 civilians were killed in the strike and the fire that ensued. Of course, reliable numbers are a hard thing to come by these days. While media outlets, celebrities, and others cry \"Injustice!\", there was silence on Saturday as Hamas fired more than a dozen rockets from the \"displacement camp\" at civilians in Tel Aviv. There was no military target and not even an attempt at an excuse. And, of course, no reprimand from any of the aid agencies or the U.N. for operating from a civilian area. This story, quite frankly, is getting old. This generation operates on the currency of virtue. The only way to get anything in life these days is to convince others of your noble heart.

Liberty (Bragg), North Carolina was under investigation after he shot and killed a 35-year-old Chechen man who was trespassing on his property. Since the original reports, some disturbing information about the deceased and the company he was allegedly contracting with has come out - and it's got special forces families nationwide spooked. Advertisement Here's a brief synopsis of what happened, courtesy of the Moore County Sheriff's Department: On the evening of May 3, 2024, at approximately 8:15 PM, Moore County Sheriff's Deputies were dispatched to a report of trespassing at a residence along Dowd Road in Carthage, North Carolina. The caller indicated that an individual was observed taking photographs on the property and had become aggressive towards another resident outside their home. Upon arrival, deputies discovered the body of 35-year-old Ramzan Daraev from Chicago, Illinois, who appeared to have sustained gunshot wounds. Daraev was found approximately 250 yards from the roadway, along a powerline on the residential property. Identification was not found on Daraev; however, his identity was later confirmed through family members and an international identification located in his vehicle. Daraev was reported to have been working as a subcontractor for Utilities One, a company based in New Jersey, at the time of his death. Investigators are still working to verify his official employment status. At the time of the incident, Daraev was not in possession of any utility equipment, utility clothing, or identification. The incident has been reported to the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). There are quite a few red flags in just that initial story. First, most utilities send some kind of notice to residents that there will be workers/subcontractors out in the field who might access their property. This... Jennifer Van Laar",

        "content": "President Joe Biden's campaign has announced his next \"Real President of Genius\" move. When the verdict comes in for the New York Donald Trump lawfare case, where, as I said before, there is no actual crime, and even if there were a crime, it would still be all about sex, Joe Biden \"plans to break his vow of silence and publicly address\" the verdict \"in a White House setting — not a campaign one — to show his statement isn't political.\" Further: Advertisement If the jury convicts Trump, Biden's team will then argue that the result shows Trump is ill-suited for office and that it demonstrates the extremes to which the former president would go to win again. The campaign's social media team is considering leveraging the line of attack further, with discussions underway about referring to the ex-president online as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump.\" Sometimes, it is hard to fathom the stupidity of the Biden campaign. As I said a month ago, the New York case is a \"historic mistake\" by the Democrats and Biden – a Biden former Department of Justice plant is clearly directing it – and as we have seen from the polling, the ridiculously biased case has actually \"backfired spectacularly on the Democrats\" and is helping Donald Trump to a consistent lead in the Presidential polling. There are, of course, three possible outcomes – \"guilty,\" \"not guilty,\" or a hung jury. If Trump is found \"guilty\" by the heavily biased Democrat jury, Biden and his crack crew of political consultants really believe that Biden speaking about it at the White House and calling Trump a \"convict\" is going to be perceived as non-political and will ignite a voter rebellion against Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

They believe the strike to be successful. Advertisement The densely populated area is a prime location for the Hamas officials to settle down, considering that they have designed this war around their method of using civilians as human shields. Not surprisingly, it is reported that approximately 35 civilians were killed in the strike and the fire that ensued. Of course, reliable numbers are a hard thing to come by these days. While media outlets, celebrities, and others cry \"Injustice!\", there was silence on Saturday as Hamas fired more than a dozen rockets from the \"displacement camp\" at civilians in Tel Aviv. There was no military target and not even an attempt at an excuse. And, of course, no reprimand from any of the aid agencies or the U.N. for operating from a civilian area. This story, quite frankly, is getting old. This generation operates on the currency of virtue. The only way to get anything in life these days is to convince others of your noble heart.

        "content": "This weekend, former President Donald Trump spoke at the Libertarian National Convention. I give him great credit for that. He was booed mercilessly, except when he promised to pardon a notorious criminal. Although his speech was solid and tailor-made for a Libertarian audience, what really stood out to me was that because he knew he wasn't speaking to an adoring crowd, he left the ad-libs and off-prompter stories for another day. This served him well. I hope he continues with this approach. Advertisement READ MORE: Trump's Speech at the Libertarian National Convention Was a Wild Ride, but Had Some Cheering by the End However, in the context of the upcoming presidential election, the Republican and Libertarian parties really should forge a strategic alliance to challenge incumbent President Joe Biden. Despite their differences, the two parties share several philosophical tenets that could serve as a foundation for collaboration. By focusing on limited government, individual liberty, fiscal conservatism, and free-market principles, Republicans and Libertarians can present a united front that appeals to a broad spectrum of voters. RELATED: Libertarian Chair Just Levels Biden Team After Their Hot Take About Rowdy Reaction to Trump Speech One of the most significant philosophical overlaps between the Republican and Libertarian parties is a belief in limited government. Both parties believe in reducing the size and scope of federal government intervention in citizens' lives. This principle is rooted in the belief that government should not overreach into personal freedoms and that local and state governments are better positioned to address many issues. Trump made it clear in his speech to the Libertarians that he firmly believes in and supports the 10th Amendment.

In the latest, we see the success of Florida's school choice programs, which represent a step towards a great goal — getting government, at all levels, out of education. Advertisement This is the Way. Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Republicans have spent years aggressively turning the state into a haven for school choice. They have been wildly successful, with tens of thousands more children enrolling in private or charter schools or homeschooling. Now as those programs balloon, some of Florida's largest school districts are facing staggering enrollment declines — and grappling with the possibility of campus closures — as dollars follow the increasing number of parents opting out of traditional public schools. Now, as to that statement about \"...some of Florida's largest school districts are facing staggering enrollment declines,\" I can only reply, \"Yes, and?\" To those school districts, and to the public school absolutists who are clutching their pearls and complaining about the likely closures, I would say: \"If the public schools were doing a better job, parents wouldn't be choosing to enroll their kids elsewhere. All Florida has done is give them that option; Florida has opened the doors to the education market and created some competition, and it looks to me like the public schools... Ward Clark",

Jacobs said Trump was taken in by her son. \"Trump came to him with a sincerity, caring, genuine, heartfelt,\" she said. \"He hugged him the next time we saw him.\" The professional photographer said she had no idea they would encounter Trump that Memorial Day. \"Every year when we go there and you're at that area, you don't know who's going to come through there,\" she said. \"They had cleared out a path, and when he came through, Christian went to walk up--obviously I stayed back--and he walked up to the president and asked him: 'Do you want to meet my Daddy?'\" she said. \"President Trump followed him, and Christian went straight to the headstone,\" Jacobs said. As Trump looked along, her son, wearing Marine dress blues with the sergeant stripes with a white combination cover and white dress gloves, showed the president photos his mother had brought to the gravesite, she said. \"He was showing him pictures from our wedding, and he told him: 'This is the one where they threw rice on my Mom and Daddy,'\" she said. \"I would always bring pictures and stuff, and we would sit there and just talk about memories and stuff like that.

        "content": "Residents of Muscat have called for tougher measures after Muscat Municipality raised concerns over random parking of trucks and heavy equipment in many areas of the capital. A statement issued by Muscat Municipality highlighted the menace of random parking in residential and commercial areas of Muscat. ‘Muscat Municipality is making diligent efforts to address this issue to preserve the urban character of the city and maintain the beauty and safety of residential neighbourhoods for all residents,’ the statement read. The statement elicited a strong reaction from residents. Maimouna al Sulaimani said that the municipality should take legal action against truck drivers who park randomly in residential areas. “Unfortunately, some building owners allow these drivers to take on rent residential buildings, particularly in the area of Mawaleh Central Market for Fruits and Vegetables.” Maimouna added that while she supports efforts to combat this issue, it’s crucial to provide designated parking spaces for trucks in specific locations within each region before initiation of any legal measure. “I believe the municipality should establish designated parking areas for these trucks, away from the residential neighbourhoods.” Another Muscat resident Hammoud al Rubiei suggested that the concerned authorities should allocate a special area as a centre for trucks, with a small fee and protection. He proposed the old Mawaleh market area as an ideal location for this centre due to its excellent location and existing facilities such as offices, a prayer hall, housing and banking services. He noted that only some workshops are needed to complete the setup. Demanding punishment for whoever is responsible for illegal parking, resident Majdah al Shukairi informed that the residents of south Mawaleh, near Al Sahwa Park, suffer from this problem. She mentioned that these trucks distort the general view of the city and contribute to traffic congestion. The municipality called on citizens to report such violations through social networking sites or Muscat Municipality Call Center (1111).",

        "description": "Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5 000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future.",
        "content": "That figure is an increase from the 1 000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36 000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike.",

Those were some of the frank assessments of African leaders by the CIA, prepared for presidents ahead of meetings, a new research paper shows.

For decades, the CIA has analysed African heads of state ahead of their visits to the United States, profiling them through \"visit pieces\" for the use of government officials, according to Judd Devermont , a former White House Africa director.",

        "description": "The DA is filing an an application in the Electoral Court against President Cyril Ramaphosa, for violating the Electoral Code of Conduct and the EFF wants an investigating into the \"misuse\" of the state broadcaster, the SABC.",
        "content": "The DA is hauling President Cyril Ramaphosa before the Electoral Court, accusing him of abusing his office for political gain using a \"national address\" to the nation via the SABC. Opposition parties have lashed out at Ramaphosa over his address to the nation on Sunday night. According to the DA, Ramaphosa violated the Electoral Code of Conduct when he \"abused the highest office in the land for flagrant electioneering\". In his address, Ramaphosa detailed the progress made during the sixth administration. The EFF wants an investigation into the \"misuse\" of the SABC by Ramaphosa's office to avoid a repeat in the future. Ramaphosa also spoke on the significance of Wednesday's election and other security matters, but a large part of his speech was about his government's successes. These included the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, tackling corruption and gender-based violence. READ | 'We don't live in castles in the sky,' says Zille on DA's chances of winning 51% nationally in polls The signing into law of the National Health Insurance Bill was also one of Ramaphosa's major talking points. But DA leader John Steenhuisen is taking Ramaphosa to task on this issue by filing an application in the Electoral Court for violating the Electoral Code. In a statement, he said the Electoral Code of Conduct, as contained in the Electoral Act, states expressly that no person may abuse a position of power, privilege or influence, including parental, patriarchal, traditional or employment authority, to influence the conduct or outcome of an election. \"Ramaphosa's manipulation was cynical, calculated and designed to influence the outcome of the election by providing the ANC with unearned airtime [that was] not made available to any other party contesting the election. \"Not for the first time, Ramaphosa has chosen his corrupt political party over South Africa. As the president, he should have known better and must be held to account. This type of abuse cannot be allowed by anyone,\" Steenhuisen said. WRAP | COMMENT: Ramaphosa 'abuses' national address to cynically campaign for the ANC According to Steenhuisen, the \"desecration\" of the office Ramaphosa holds confirms that he is panicked. \"Because he has finally realised that the people are about to hold the ANC to account for the corruption, misrule and hardship they have inflicted upon the people of South Africa. The DA, therefore, calls on voters to turn out to the polling booths in their millions to help us bring an end to the ANC's impunity and abuse of our democracy for narrow personal and political gain,\" he said. Furthermore, Steenhuisen said Ramaphosa \"has clearly signaled that the ANC is prepared to undermine our constitutional democracy to try to cling to power\". \"This should serve as an urgent warning to all of our democratic institutions, including the IEC. If Ramaphosa is willing to abuse his office for narrow political gain even before the ANC has lost its majority, what else will he be willing to do to subvert the will of the people and cling to power after voters take away the ANC's majority on Wednesday? \"If voters needed any further confirmation that the hunger for power and the corruption of the ANC constitutes an urgent threat to the values upon which our constitutional democracy is based, Ramaphosa provided it last night,\" he said. Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told News24 the criticism is unfounded because Ramaphosa's address was a stately account of the work done during the course of the sixth administration. \"The president was, therefore, being accountable to the nation as we end the term of the 6th administration. Secondly, he was taking the responsibility of assuring South Africans that these elections are going to be free and fair and, more importantly, safe. That responsibility can only be discharged by a sitting head of state,\" Magwenya said. He also argued that in his address, Ramaphosa, did not mention the governing party, nor did he criticise other political parties. \"In fact, he commended all parties for the peaceful manner in which they have campaigned and thanked all parliamentarians for the work they've done over the concluding term. Lastly, the president paid tribute to all South Africans who worked together with government when the country was going through challenging times, like the Covid-19 pandemic, the floods in KZN and other parts of the country and during the 2021 riots,\" he said. According to Magwenya, the address was not about campaigning. \"The president, as he must, was being the president of all South Africans with the address,\" he said. Meanwhile, the EFF has also expressed its concern and condemned Ramaphosa for using the SABC for political gain. The party condemned the \"hijacking of the state broadcaster for partisan purposes\". \"It is clear that there is fear within the ANC ranks of an imminent loss and they are resorting to desperate measures to stay in power,\" the EFF said in a statement. \"The unscheduled address is a blatant misuse of presidential powers and state resources, aimed at furthering the interests of the ANC rather than serving the South African public.\"",

        "content": "Nigeria’s digital journey is accelerating; at the forefront of this unprecedented growth is the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and one of its key strengths lies in its collaborative method. Through collaboration with tech hubs, educational institutions, and industry stakeholders, the agency is laying the groundwork for a thriving digital economy. NITDA’s partnerships span across various sectors, and this multifaceted approach ensures a comprehensive strategy for digital literacy and innovation. Among the critical areas of focus are training programmes in artificial intelligence (AI), coding, cybersecurity, and basic digital literacy. These initiatives are not just about imparting knowledge; they are about equipping Nigerians with the skills necessary to thrive in a digital economy. The programmes are meant to engender a digital literate workforce, in line with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda. To equip citizens with the skills for the digital age, NITDA aims to achieve a remarkable target of 70% digital literacy by 2027. The agency is birthing a new generation of highly talented Nigerians. Tech hubs nationwide are buzzing with activity, where participants are immersed in learning experiences that cover the latest advancements in technology. Educational institutions are also critical, this NITDA is working with the Federal Ministry of Education to integrate these programmes into their curricula to produce graduates that are ready to meet the demands of the digital age. Beyond education and training, the agency, through regulations, co-creates policies that provide a conducive environment for tech companies, and ensure that innovation flourish while maintaining the security of digital infrastructure. One notable example is NITDA’s involvement in developing guidelines for AI and data protection, which are crucial as the world increasingly relies on data-driven decision-making. These regulations not only protect users but also provide a clear framework for companies to innovate confidently. This focus on collaboration extends beyond domestic partnerships. NITDA actively seeks partnerships with international stakeholders. A case in point was the alliance with the United States Consulate General, Lagos, to host the Global Tech Africa Summit. The event brought together African and international players in the tech space, fostering knowledge exchange and creating opportunities for cross-border collaboration. The agency has recognised the transformative power of skill-based training. This prompted it to deepen its strategic partnership with Cisco to harness these technologies for Nigeria’s development. This collaboration is not just a step forward; it is a leap toward a future where technology drives sustainable growth and innovation across multiple sectors. Pilot projects are being rolled out to demonstrate the practical applications of these technologies in real-world settings. NITDA has also partnered with TikTok to address some of the most pressing issues in the digital age. The cooperation promotes the responsible use of AI, and a secure online space. The importance of this cannot be overemphasised because social media is increasingly integral to daily life. NITDA aims to leverage the TikTok platform’s extensive reach and technological prowess to implement robust measures that safeguard users, particularly the younger demographic. Recently, NITDA partnered with GIZ (German Agency for International Cooperation) and Digital Transformation Center (DTC) to host a stakeholder event on the National Digital Literacy Framework (NDLF) in Lagos to address the digital divide and equip Nigerians with digital skills. An example is the joint effort on developing robust standards for digital literacy content to ensure learning materials are aligned with Nigeria’s National Digital Literacy Framework (NDLF). NITDA’s determination to foster innovation is evident in its establishment of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) – Office for Nigerian Digital Innovation (ONDI) and the National Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (NCAIR). These SPVs act as catalysts for collaboration within the tech ecosystem, allowing for the implementation of initiatives like the Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Support (TIES) Scheme and the iHatch Startup Incubation Programme. Speaking at a public outing, NITDA Director General, Kashifu Inuwa, stated: “Collaborating with stakeholders is fundamental to our mission. We can create an ecosystem that supports innovation and sustainable growth, so that Nigeria is not just a consumer of technology but a key player in the global tech arena. The goal is to create a sustainable digital ecosystem where everyone has the opportunity to participate and benefit. Our partnerships are crucial in bridging the skills gap and ensuring that Nigeria’s digital economy is inclusive and resilient.” As Nigeria stands on the cusp of a digital revolution, NITDA’s partnerships serve as a beacon of what is possible when government, industry, and academia come together with a shared vision. The journey to 70% digital literacy by 2027 is ambitious, but with the continued support and collaboration of all stakeholders, it is a goal well within reach. Through these efforts, Nigeria is not just preparing for the future, it is shaping it. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "A popular shopping hub in the nation's capital, Banex Plaza, has now been reopened after it was closed for a week due to clashes between soldiers and traders. According to PoliticsNigeria, the plaza resumed operations at 2:30 PM on Monday, May 27, marking the end of a tense period that had disrupted business activities. The closure was initiated after an incident involving personnel from the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police and traders at the plaza. The confrontation escalated into physical altercations involving passersby and security guards, leading authorities to temporarily shut down the facility to ensure public safety and order. According to reports, the reopening was agreed upon after successful resolutions between the traders involved in the altercations and military authorities. This agreement comes as a relief to many business owners and customers who frequent the bustling electronics and telecommunications market. The initial clash that prompted the closure occurred when four military police personnel retaliated against traders following a previous disagreement. The reopening signifies a return to normalcy and the restoration of business activities at one of Abuja’s major commercial centers.",

Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Mr Biden, joined by vice president Kamala Harris and defence secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Mr Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honouring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,” Mr Biden said, crediting the Pact Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right healthcare, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Mr Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Festus Keyamo, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, has described the controversial Nigeria Air unveiled by the Buhari-led administration as a fraud, adding that it remained suspended. Keyamo, who gave details about the project, noted that the ‘national carrier’ that was supposed to be an indigenous project and one that was supposed to spark hope for Nigerians, was flawed with a lot of secrecy and fraudulent activities. The Minister made the declaration on Nigeria Air while fielding questions from journalists during the second day of the Ministerial Sectorial update on Monday, May 27, in Abuja. According to him, Keyamo it was anti-Nigeria. Read also: Bayelsa tribunal upholds Gov Diri’s re-election He said: “It was never Air Nigeria. It was Ethiopian trying to flag our flag and not Air Nigeria. That is the truth; it was not Nigeria. “It only printed Air Nigeria. It was an Ethiopian airline trying to fly our flag. If it is so, why not allow our local people to fly our flag? Why bring a foreigner to fly our flag? “So nobody should deceive you that it is Air Nigeria. Air Nigeria must be indigenous, wholly Nigeria or must be for the full benefit of Nigerians. Not that 60 percent of the profit is given to another country. “How does that benefit us? It remains suspended. It remains so,” he said. Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "description": "NASA Langley researchers are heading to the Arctic Ocean to study the habitat's effect on climate worldwide.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Eliza Noe, The Virginian-Pilot, The Virginian-Pilot NASA Langley researchers are heading to the Arctic Ocean to study the habitat's effect on climate worldwide. The ARCSIX, or Arctic Radiation Cloud Aerosol Surface Interaction Experiment, airborne campaign will fly out of Pituffik Space Force Base in Greenland for seven weeks this summer to gather measurements of the sea ice, clouds , radiation and aerosols that are affecting the ice melt . \"The reason that we need this mission is because there are a lot of things that we don't know about how the Arctic climate system functions and operates,\" said Patrick Taylor, deputy mission science leader. \"There's a lot of uncertainty in our projections of how fast they warm. We know that it's going to warm fast, but it can go really fast. \"The idea of these observations is to understand how the sea ice is changing, so that we can use that data to improve our tests and hypotheses and improve our theories about how the sea ice is evolving. We can then put those ideas and our knowledge to improve our forecast models.\" Ice in the arctic has a pivotal role in cooling the Earth, and it's not every day that scientists are able to take detailed snapshots of the region. Taylor and Ewan Crosbie, platform scientists, said it's pivotal to learn about the Earth's warming climate now, and the data could be used to form strategies on how to reduce the effects of climate change. \"Having boots on the ground (and) people out in this region of the Arctic only happens once or twice every five years,\" Taylor said. \"It's not even that we get out there every year. We get these very periodic snapshots of what's happening there. We're going to have an unprecedented kind of dataset of it with all the different instruments.\" The mission is split into two. The group will go out to see how the ice is melting in late spring and early summer , and in July, a second part will collect data for the later parts of summer. Each flight will have two pilots, a flight scientist coordinating with researchers on the ground, a scientist for each of the three instruments collecting data and an extra seat for an additional scientist or operator. The aircraft is equipped with three components. The first are dropsondes, designed to be dropped from an aircraft at altitude and measure characteristics such as temperature, humidity and winds. Another is the AVIRIS, or Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer. AVIRIS is used as a very powerful camera, and will collect useful information about the sea ice clouds and aerosols. The third is HALO, or High Altitude Lidar Observatory. It uses a very short pulse of light to collect images, but where the AVIRIS takes images of what's happening horizontally, HALO collects data on what's happening vertically. \"When the ice starts to melt, we get liquid forming on the surface. We can see what that looks like (with the instruments), even though you couldn't see with the naked eye,\" Crosbie said. \"Also for clouds, an interesting science question that we'll go after is to try to understand the lifecycle of Arctic clouds. \"So understanding the distinction between clouds that contain predominantly liquid droplets versus ice particles is a critical piece to understanding the behavior of Arctic clouds, their lifecycle and the radiation impacts.\" Crosbie said this could be one of the last times to observe \"old ice,\" or ice that was able to survive the summer melt season and regrow during the polar night. He said the ice seen in the mission will be between 3–4 years old, and this could be one of the last chances to measure and collect data on it. \"We're really excited about the science,\" Taylor said. \"We don't get a dataset like this in this region of the Arctic—or the Arctic at all—very often, so really, some things we think we'll learn will probably surprise us. There's probably some things we're not expecting will pop out of the data.\" Provided byThe Virginian-Pilot",

        "content": "Former world middleweight champion Kostya Tszyu called the victory of Oleksandr Usyk (22-0, 14 KOs) over Tyson Fury (34-1-1, 24 KOs) a natural outcome. The Russian admired the level of boxing demonstrated by the opponents in the fight on May 18. He expressed this opinion in an interview with the propaganda publication Sport-Express. The legendary boxer noted that the first fight between Usyk and Fury will go down in history, and also emphasized the achievements of the Ukrainian champion, who has collected all the belts in the second weight category. \"I enjoyed the fight and I'm happy with the result – that Sasha won. He made a certain history – he became the absolute heavyweight champion, he became the absolute super heavyweight champion. I am very happy. According to my calculations, Sasha won the fight. The fight was equal. Of course, there were a lot of mistakes on both sides. I just enjoyed boxing. They gave me a good fight that will remain in my memory,\" said Ju. Earlier, he issued a conspiracy theory around the fight between Usyk and Fury. Before that, Russian MMA representative Oleg Taktarov was surprised by the victory of our champion and also said that Usyk cannot be considered a legend because of his pro-Ukrainian position. Another fighter from Russia, Vyacheslav Datsyk, called the fight between Oleksandr and Tyson pornography and wanted to fight the Ukrainian with axes. In turn, the promoter Vladimir Khryunov issued a nonsense that the result of the fight between Usyk and Fury was rigged. In addition, Russian boxer Timur Nikulin said that the fight on May 18 ended in a draw at least. Only verified information on our Telegram channel OBOZ.UA and Viber . Do not fall for fakes!",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Africa’s Travel Indaba was held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre. Hundreds of delegates were in Durban as part of the three-day trade show, Africa’s Travel Indaba is an iconic African leisure trade show owned by South African Tourism, with the specific objective of creating market access for the country’s vast array of African leisure tourism products. Dube-Ncube said the trade show provides the ideal platform for African tourism exhibitors to showcase their offerings to international and local buyers, destination marketing companies and leisure tourism services partners. As the tourism industry shows green shoots globally, she said one of the key sub-sectors the province wants to focus on is Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events (MICE). MICE make up a big part of global business travel since every industry has regular events of some kind. The main goal is always to bring professionals together, foster connections, promote new ideas and push growth. “As a province, we will be at the forefront of ensuring that KwaZulu-Natal gets the lion’s share of the tourism market. As we all know, one of the biggest trends in the tourism environment is the blending of leisure tourism and business, known as ‘Bleisure Travel’ [blending of business and leisure travel]. “We would like to thank all of you for your continued support of Africa’s Travel Indaba. Indeed, Africa has limitless possibilities, and we must seize the opportunity to ensure that Africa’s time is now,” Dube-Ncube said. The Premier noted that this year’s Africa’s Travel Indaba takes place at a time when South Africa is celebrating 30 years since the dawn of democracy, which ushered in a new era and assured our standing in the family of other nations.",

The group during the quarter posted a net income of N208.2 billion, which represents a 316% increase from the N50.1 billion net income posted in Q1 2023. The growth in profit was driven by a 153% year on year growth in interest income to N455 billion during the quarter from N180 billion recorded in Q1 2023. Related Stories Economic challenges slash Nigeria’s small-scale industrialists by nearly half in two years How to mine Hamster Combat coins and earn money from it The group posted an FX revaluation loss of N108.2 billion during the quarter as it posted an FX trading income of N13.4 billion, resulting in an FX loss of N94.8 billion. Key Highlights (Q1 2024 vs Q1 2023) The group posted a net interest income of N228.7 billion during the quarter, reflecting a 104% year-on-year growth from the N111.8 billion posted in Q1 2023. Impairment charges hit N42.9 billion, marking a 154% YoY growth from the N16.9 billion impairment provisions of Q1 2023. Net interest income after impairment charges hit N185.7 billion, a 96% YoY growth from N95 billion posted in Q1 2023. Net fee and commission income hit N54 billion, up by 53% YoY from N35.3 billion in Q1 2023. The group’s profit before tax hit N238.5 billion, representing 325% YoY growth from Q1 2023’s N56.1 billion. Profit after tax hit N208.2 billion, representing 316% YoY growth from N50.1 billion posted in Q1 2023. The group’s total assets appreciated by 27% to N21.6 trillion during the quarter, from N16.9 trillion as of FYE 2023. Customer deposits significantly contributed to the group’s asset growth, with customers’ deposits increasing by 24% during the quarter, rising from N10.7 trillion at the end of 2023 to N13.3 trillion. The group’s loan portfolio also grew by 41% during the quarter, as the total loans and advances to customers and banks hit N11.9 trillion, up from N8.4 trillion as of FYE 2023. As the bank’s loan portfolio expanded, rising interest rates—prompted by two hikes in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) during the quarter—resulted in the bank achieving its largest ever interest income for a single quarter. The group’s shareholders’ equity increased by 10% during the quarter to N1.92 trillion, from N1.75 trillion as of FYE 2023. During the quarter, the group’s retained earnings hit N794.4 billion, compared to N589 billion as of 2023 year-end. Despite the increase in shareholders’ funds, it does not affect the group’s recapitalization efforts. FBN Holdings still needs to raise N269.4 billion in new share capital to meet the Central Bank of Nigeria’s N500 billion minimum capital requirement for an international banking license. At the end of trading on May 27, 2024, FBNH’s share price closed at N21.10, reflecting a 3.18% improvement as investors display confidence in the bank’s shares.",

He mastered reading tides right into his passing. His purpose in his almost 95 years was his family and his people, he hated everything imposed on our people and indifference faced his entire lifespan. His greatest treasure was his beloved yard, garden and orchard and fishing the Coast in every sector. He had so much pride having bbq sockeye he caught, potatoes and corn he grew with a bowl of dzawadi gold. He took his many terms seriously as elected Chief and brought economic opportunities to Campbell River in his father's footsteps. He never boasted about being a hereditary chief, that's not our ways. He loved gambling whether it was horse races or casinos and trips to hot sandy beaches in the Bahamas. He leaves behind his wife Jean who just celebrated 66 years of marriage and their children Dawn Duncan, Tony Roberts Jr. Kim Roberts and Terena Roberts, numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren and brother Aubrey and sister Lou.

        "content": "THE leadership of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has condemned the recent increase in the killing of students in some of tertiary institutions in the country. NANS President, Comrade Lucky Emonefe, in a statement on Monday in Abuja, called on the Federal Government and security agencies to ensure that nation’s campuses are not only safe for teaching and learning, urgent action must also be taken to address the plight of students. One of the issues affecting students, he noted is the sexual harassment of students by lecturers. Emonefe noted a distressing incident of the death of Miss Favour Ugwuka, a final year student of Ebonyi State University, who reportedly committed suicide on Wednesday, 22nd May, because of pressure from a lecturer who repeatedly failed her in his course. “While we strongly believe that suicide is not a solution to any problem, we condemn the actions of the lecturer that led to the death of Miss Favour.

He said the unfortunate murder of James Michael Anajuwe and Musa Hussein, both students of Confluence University of Science and Technology (CUSTECH) Lokoja, Kogi state, were tragic events that pose a threat to education. The NANS President said: “We are concerned that incidents like these continue to instill fear in students who are eager to pursue their studies for the sole purpose of developing society. “We also demand justice for the soul of a student from Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, identified as Alex, who was unjustly killed on Saturday, May 25th by his fellow students over an allegation of phone theft. “It is crucial for authorities to fulfill their constitutional duty of ensuring the safety and security of students, both on and off campus. The recent incidents have exposed significant security gaps that must be addressed urgently. “NANS, under our leadership, will continue to advocate for justice for these innocent students who have untimely lost their lives,” he stated.

        "description": "Cracker Barrel's CEO said the restaurant chain has \"lost its shine\" and there is a new strategic plan to transform the company.",
        "content": "DENVER — Cracker Barrel is planning some major changes. The CEO announced changes May 16 in a conference call with investors for the company known for its country food dishes and rustic décor . Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Masino said the company has \"lost some of its shine,\" particularly in its recovery from the pandemic. \"We're just not as relevant as we once were,\" Masino said. Masino said some of the restaurant's dishes haven't been updated in decades, and while that is fine for some items, like handmade dumplings, there will be room for menu updates and pricing changes. \"[W]e are not leading in any area?\" Masino said. \"[T]he reality is we've lost some market share, especially at dinner.\" The company plans to begin a \"strategic transformation plan\" to bring back customers and improve business by driving relevancy, delivering food and an experience guests love, and growing profitability.\" Masino detailed pillars that could be rolled out at some or all of Cracker Barrel's stores under its strategic transformation plan. Masino said it will lean into innovation for its menu, particularly at dinner time. She said the company needs more items at dinner that are \"authentically\" Cracker Barrel yet appeal to a variety of current tastes. She said Cracker Barrel began testing new menu items in February with several modified items and new items. New green chili cornbread and banana pudding were among the most popular new items, Masino said. Masino said Cracker Barrel will continue to be a scratch-made food company but that its menu might be reduced with some items being removed. Masino said the chain will improve the way it prices items. Some stores will reduce prices and other stores might increase prices depending on location. \"For example, we have stores in metro areas with an average annual household income of $55,000 in the same pricing tier as one with $90,000,\" Masino said. Masino said there has been a lift of 3% in stores where the price changes started in January with no affect in store traffic. \"I want to emphasize that optimizing our price points across the menu doesn't mean just increasing prices,\" Masino said. \"In several places, it may actually mean taking the opposite approach. We understand the lower-end consumer is challenged, and value is and will remain an important part of the brand, and we will work vigorously to protect it.\" Cracker Barrel is testing a remodel of its restaurants. Masino said the tests stores are using \"a different color palette, updating lighting, offering more comfortable seating and simplifying decor and fixtures.\" \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" Masino said, adding that customer feedback has been positive. Masino said Cracker Barrel will debut a prototype merchandise store that is 15% smaller than its current store in fall 2025. She said there's potential to create an even smaller prototype. Masino said the \"treasure-hunt\" feel of Cracker Barrel's stores remains an important part of its business strategy. \"I am excited about our strategic transformation plans to drive relevancy, deliver food and experiences guests love, and grow profitability,\" Masino said . \"Cracker Barrel is an iconic brand with an exceptionally strong foundation, and I firmly believe our plans will allow us to capitalize on our strengths and deliver long-term success.\" \"Executing this strategy will require increased investment in our business, and we have reduced our dividend so that we can allocate capital to generate organic growth and drive meaningful value creation over time,\" Masino said. \"Our Board, our management, and our teams are excited about our plans and are already hard at work to make them a reality.\" > Top stories curated daily just for you!
