        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.",

However, in an exclusive conversation with PEOPLE magazine for this week’s issue, she revealed the secret to maintaining a young and glowing appearance. “The best facelift is a smile,” Seymour told the outlet adding, “If you want to look young, just smile from ear to ear.” But, “to set the record straight — because people were getting it wrong — they attempted to do something to my under-eyes when I was 40 because photographers kept saying that I had bulgy eyes,” the now 73-year-old Harry Wild star revealed. She continued, “The doctor told me it's actually a muscle, so there's nothing I can do about it.” Additionally, the British actress also quipped that she’s had “quite a good career considering the bulgy eye” however she mentioned that she does not want to “do anything permanent.” “I've been playing a lot of amazing roles, recently two women with Alzheimer's with very emotional scenes, and if you're going to be that emotional, you need every muscle in your face,” Jane Seymour added, explaining why she avoids synthetic procedures.",

        "content": "With the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 concluded, Pakistan’s legendary former cricketer Wasim Akram, while taking a jibe, hoped that now the Men in Blue will not make an excuse of being tired during the upcoming mega event. The final between KKR and SRH didn’t include a single Indian player who is going to the T20 World Cup which will be played in the United States and West Indies from June 1. Only Rinku Singh was a part of KKR but he is going to the World Cup as a travelling reserve. Talking to Sportskeeda Cricket , Akram joked: \"At least this time, Indian players will not make an excuse of being tired during the mega event.\" \"Well, now at least none of them will have to say that they are tired. They were thinking ahead, what is the point of reaching the final, India is more important, we will play with the country. But it could be a blessing in disguise for India,\" he said. \"We discussed in the previous show that I was worried that they might be tired, and they will be tired, no doubt. Even America is not their road. I think Pakistan's first match is Dallas if I remember. Now they will go and play there, one or two practice matches. It will be okay, I suppose. It is T20, the boys will recover, nowadays fitness levels are very high.” The first batch of Indian players, who did not play in IPL playoffs, left for the USA on Saturday evening including their captain Rohit Sharma and others. Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Dube, Mohammed Siraj, Axar Patel and Shubman Gill left India on Saturday night for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

        "description": "Rafael Nadal suffers crushing defeat at the hands of Alexander Zverev in French tennis tournament",
        "content": "Tennis star Rafael Nadal has been knocked out of the French Open 2024 in Round 1 by Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(5) and 6-3 on Monday. Nadal, who won 22 Grand Slams, tried to give his best similar to that of the old days to triumph on Court Philippe Chatrier, but the 37-year-old failed. In a post-match talk, the 14-time Roland Garros champion said Monday: \"It is incredible, I want to say thank you. It is difficult for me to talk. I am not 100% sure if this is going to be the last time I am in front of you. The feelings I have today are hard to describe.\" \"To feel the love in the place I love the most. I have to congratulate Sascha for this great match. I know 2022 has been a super tough moment for you and so I wish you the best.\" Rafael Nadal was able to secure 90 points over his opponent’s 109. He was served at 0-30 in his potentially last game, according to The Telegraph . The Spanish athlete underwent a hip surgery rendering him to only play four tournaments since January last year. Nadal won his maiden French Open title in 2005. Till then, he had 14 titles on his name. He said: \"I have been going through a tough moment, so many injuries but I went through it to get back here. I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. There is a big chance I won’t be back but I can’t say 100%. My body is feeling better than two months ago.\" The Spaniard’s impeccable record at Clay makes him as widely the greatest player of Clay's season as in 116 matches he played at Roland Garros, he only lost four times, which includes Monday’s defeat. Nadal added: \"I have amazing feelings on this court, I never dreamed as a kid I would be here at 28. Sorry, 38. I would love to be 28! All the memories have been different, so special. Support has been unforgettable. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here, to be honest. I'm not 100 sure.\"",

        "content": "Ryan Reynolds just remembered the Canadian actor and comedian, John Candy. On May 26, 2024, Sunday, the 47-year-old actor took to his official Instagram account to upload a subtle tribute the late star. The post, originally shared by the comedian Mathias Nastos was actually about missing Candy and his presence. “Sometimes outta nowhere...I’ll think of this guy and miss the living hell out of him,” a comment across a photo of Candy read in capital letters. Reynolds shared the post on one of his Instagram Stories, set to the instrumentals of the song, Power to Believe by The Dream Academy, the soundtrack of the late actor’s film, Plane Trains and Automobiles. “Retro Rewind 80s: The Candy Man Can,” the caption of the Instagram post added. “Although guys like Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd tend to get most of the recognition for their 80s comedies, John Candy was easily one of the funniest men in the movies,” the caption of the reposted upload read. It continued, “The man had perfect comedic timing on screen, charisma that was second to none, and the ability to make every film better with even the smallest of cameos.”",

        "description": "Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani signs Election Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024",
        "content": "ISLAMABAD: Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani on Monday signed two new ordinances, the Election Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024. After the promulgation of Election Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, the election tribunals will have the retired judges as its members besides the serving jurists. Meanwhile, the NAB Ordinance extended the period of remanding accused in National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cases from 14 days to 40 days. Moreover, the sentence duration for the officer convicted for framing cases based on ill will has been reduced to two years from five years. The promulgation comes after the federal cabinet’s approval of the amendments in the two ordinances. The acting president signed the Election (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as President Asif Zardari is currently in Dubai. The development comes ahead of the Supreme Court hearing of the NAB amendments case, which is slated to take place on May 30. A three-member bench of the SC, in September 2023, had approved Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan’s petition challenging amendments made to the country’s accountability laws during the tenure of the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led government. Headed by then-chief justice Umar Ata Bandial, and comprising Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ijazul Ahsan, the court held more than 50 hearings and in its majority 2-1 verdict restored graft cases against public office holders that were closed down following the amendments. The apex court ordered restoring all graft cases, worth less than Rs500 million against the political leaders belonging to different political parties and public office holders, which were closed and declared the amendments void. The verdict provisioned far-reaching consequences as the striking down of the amendments would mean that references against some of the country’s political bigwigs will once again land in the accountability courts. Following the verdict, the federal government filed an appeal under Section 5 of the Supreme Court law against the apex court’s order.",

        "content": "LAHORE: Announcing the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) intra-party elections, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Public and Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has said that party supremo Nawaz Sharif will be seen proactively \"playing his role in national politics soon\". Sanaullah, addressing a press conference in Lahore on Monday, announced that the ruling party commenced the process of the intra-party elections by the PML-N’s constitution and an election commission was also established by a central working committee. The former federal minister said that nomination papers were issued from 9am to 5pm today which would also be continued before 12pm by tomorrow (Tuesday). \"Scrutiny of the nomination papers will be performed at 1pm, whereas, candidates could withdraw their nominations by 2:30pm, tomorrow.\" He added: “Overall, 11 nominations have been issued so far. At 3pm tomorrow, final lists of the candidates will be issued and a general council’s session will be held afterwards.” He added that the party would organise the polls for electing its president at 4pm tomorrow. Sanaullah went on to say that Bashir Memon, Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, Ishaq Dar, Raja Muhammad Farooq, Hafiz Hafeez-ur-Rehman and Shah Ghulam Qadir have received their nomination papers today. He said that Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — a disgruntled PML-N leader who had applied to register a new political party last month — could also submit his nominations, however, the scrutiny committee will decide on his “eligibility” to contest the party’s intra-party polls. Regarding Nawaz, the PML-N senior leader said that the entire party agreed on the former premier’s name for the party’s presidency. \"However, the party would welcome if someone else wants to submit nominations for taking part in the upcoming polls.\" Sanaullah further said that Nawaz transformed the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz into a popular public party after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah that ruled the country four times. “In case no candidates, the party’s president would be elected unopposed, otherwise, polling will be held via a show of hands,” he added. The politico said that Nawaz was not angry with someone and was fully active in national politics. He added that all decisions of the federal and the Punjab governments would be taken after Nawaz's approval. He further said that lesser statements from the PML-N supremo would be ended, soon. The premier’s aide added that the ruling PML-N was considering recommendations to reshuffle the party positions. He said that Shehbaz Sharif would be the next leader after Nawaz on which the entire party was agreed upon for the presidency. He praised Shehbaz, the incumbent prime minister, for making maximum efforts to pull the country out of the economic crisis. To a question regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Sanaullah replied that he would continue to warn the nation against the former ruling party’s founder Imran Khan. He added that he was continuously warning the nation that the ousted premier would push the country into a big turmoil. The former security czar said that he was unaware of sources pushing the incarcerated PTI founder for making political blunders, however, “stupidity” could be committed by any individual. “I would pray for the PTI founder not to face the same consequences as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” he added.",

        "content": "KARACHI: The provincial authorities once again deferred the matriculation exams in Karachi slated for Tuesday as the country will observe national holiday tomorrow on account of Youm-e-Takbeer. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced a public holiday on Youm-e-Takbeer to mark the historic day when Pakistan conducted successful nuclear tests in the hills of Chaghai in 1998. Later, Sindh Universities and Boards Minister Mohammad Ali Malkani announced that the papers of IX and X classes will not take place in the metropolis tomorrow (Tuesday) due to the holiday. He said that a new date for tomorrow’s papers will be announced later. It may be noted that the Board of Secondary Education Karachi (BSEK) had announced a new schedule for the matric exams, which had been deferred for almost a week due to extremely hot weather. The BSEK had postponed the remaining papers of the IX and X classes, which were supposed to be held between May 21-27, in the wake of an expected heatwave in Sindh. Meanwhile, University of Karachi also announced holiday tomorrow in line with the official announcement. The exams due to be held tomorrow in the varsity have been deferred. In a statement released earlier in the day, PM Shehbaz said the Youm-e-Takbeer reminded the Pakistani nation of unity to make the defence of the country invincible. On this day, the premier said, the entire nation had resolved for the integrity of this country that no compromise would be made on the country’s defence by accepting any kind of external pressure. “The Youm-e-Takbeer reminds political and defence forces to unite under one flag, the green crescent flag, to strengthen the defence of this country,” he added.",

        "content": "The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has said the state under his watch has the lowest records of out-of-school children in Nigeria. He attributed the feat to the huge investment of his government in the education sector. Soludo disclosed this during the 2024 Children’s Day celebration held at the Alex Ekwueme Square on Monday, which witnessed March past by school children and uniformed organisations, cutting of cake, cultural dance and fashion parade, among other activities He said, “We’re here to celebrate our future, our future, and others who were not able to join us here. This is the third time I’ve witnessed Children’s Day since I assumed office, but this is the largest. “I can see the glorious future of Anambra and Nigeria as we behold their faces. We’re deliberately investing in our children, who are our bridge. “In two years, we’ve employed over 8,000 teachers because they’re our greatest asset. Currently, Anambra has the lowest number of out-of-school children in the country. We are targeting making it zero. “We’re having sleepless nights because of you. Roads will wash away, skyscrapers will collapse, but investment in children will stand the test of time.” While commending the teachers for their commitments to training the children, the governor assured that his government would not lower the bar in the recruitment of standard teachers, stressing that Anambra children deserved the best. “We call on everyone to invest in education because it is everyone’s responsibility. If you can save money on your favourite brand of drink, you can buy a pencil for the child. That’s a way of investing in education,” he added. The Commissioner for Women’s Affairs and Social Welfare, Hon. Ify Obinabo, urged parents to offer their children the needed parent-child relationship and make their homes more conducive for them to thrive amidst challenges. “Governor Soludo’s manifesto shows that enhancing the well-being of the Nigerian child through quality education and skill development is possible and achievable to build a livable and prosperous homeland. “Enhancing the well-being of the Nigerian child is not the sole responsibility of the government. It requires multi-stakeholder synergy, such as parents and guardians, whose major role focuses on creating the needed healthy environment for our children to blossom,” she said. The State Commissioner of Police, CP Nnaghe Obono Itam, who also witnessed the celebration, urges parents and guardians to be better role models for their children and wards by creating a deliberate relationship with them, as it will help to assess and direct them properly. In her brief congratulatory message, the Convener of WIGA (Umunwanyi Soludo), Hon. Mrs Amaka Obi, urged the children to always believe in themselves while pursuing their dreams in life. The Nigerian Tribune reports that the winners of this celebration include Girls Secondary School Awka (secondary category), Udoka Primary School Awka (practitioner school category), and Nadora Nursery School Awka (nursery school category).

        "content": "Despite Joe Burrow suffering a season-ending right wrist injury in Week 11 last season, the Cincinnati Bengals don't seem too concerned about the quarterback's health. Before the start of OTAs on Tuesday, Bengals offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher told Geoff Hobson of the team website that Burrow won't be on a pitch count. \"We designed the whole thing to stay within the constraints of where the medical people think he should be and where he wants to be right now,\" Pitcher said , via Hobson. \"Nobody is sitting there with a special pitch counter. But we've been smart in how we put it together.\" Pitcher also seemed to signal Burrow is making a quick recovery, noting how he has \"all his range and power.\" Burrow — a former No. 1 overall pick — is one of the best QBs in the league, but his durability is an issue. During his rookie season in 2020, he suffered a season-ending ACL tear. He also injured his calf during training camp last season. If Burrow stays healthy, he could help the Bengals win their first Super Bowl. The 27-year-old QB guided Cincinnati to Super Bowl LVI, where the Bengals lost 23-20 to the Los Angeles Rams. Plus, he leads active players in completion percentage ( 68 percent ), per Pro Football Reference. Joe Burrow connecting with Ja'Marr Chase for a 64-yard touchdown! (Via: NFL, CBS) pic.twitter.com/ZP7fFNRdKN The Bengals' decision not to place Burrow on a pitch count could be an excellent sign. It suggests that they're not worried about him suffering another injury, and he is making solid progress. In 2021, Burrow won Comeback Player of the Year. Perhaps he'll capture the award for a second time this upcoming season. As of Monday, DraftKings gives him the second-best CPOY odds (+200) behind New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers.",

        "description": "The Environment Authority has achieved a milestone by successfully cultivating wild myrrh seeds outside their original habitat.",
        "content": "Muscat – The Environment Authority (EA) has achieved a significant milestone by successfully cultivating wild myrrh seeds in its nursery in Salalah, outside their original habitat. This accomplishment marks a rare feat, as the myrrh trees were propagated from seeds in a climate vastly different from their natural environment – a first for the sultanate of Oman. An EA official emphasised the importance of this achievement, highlighting its potential to open new avenues for preserving myrrh trees and bolstering their population in their native regions. Myrrh trees, belonging to the frankincense family, are characterised by their small, perennial and spiny nature, reaching heights up to 3m. They typically thrive in semi-desert environments or rain shadow areas in the Dhofar mountains, extending to the Najd region. The dwindling number of myrrh trees in Oman’s wild habitats prompted the EA to act. With fewer than 250 trees remaining in Oman, it conducted a comprehensive survey in 2023, revealing the species to be in a ‘very critical stage’. The EA advocates urgent reassessment of the species’ national classification in alignment with the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s guidelines. The EA stressed the need for joint efforts of all stakeholders and relevant authorities at regional and international levels to safeguard this threatened species. Myrrh tree resin has been historically utilised for various purposes such as perfumes, incense, and medicine. Similar to frankincense, myrrh resin is produced by trees of the Commiphora genus, distinct from the Boswellia trees that yield frankincense. A study conducted by the EA’s Office for Conservation of Environment in Dhofar identified the primary threats to myrrh trees, with overgrazing being the most significant challenge, followed by pests, drought, and unsustainable harvesting methods. In response to these threats, the EA established a dedicated garden for myrrh trees aimed at conserving ‘mother trees’ and setting up a nursery for myrrh seed and seedling production. The study assessed the age of myrrh trees, with the oldest estimated to be around 40 years.",

        "description": "Residents of Muscat have called for tougher measures after Muscat Municipality raised concerns over random parking of trucks in residential areas",
        "content": "Residents of Muscat have called for tougher measures after Muscat Municipality raised concerns over random parking of trucks and heavy equipment in many areas of the capital. A statement issued by Muscat Municipality highlighted the menace of random parking in residential and commercial areas of Muscat. ‘Muscat Municipality is making diligent efforts to address this issue to preserve the urban character of the city and maintain the beauty and safety of residential neighbourhoods for all residents,’ the statement read. The statement elicited a strong reaction from residents. Maimouna al Sulaimani said that the municipality should take legal action against truck drivers who park randomly in residential areas. “Unfortunately, some building owners allow these drivers to take on rent residential buildings, particularly in the area of Mawaleh Central Market for Fruits and Vegetables.” Maimouna added that while she supports efforts to combat this issue, it’s crucial to provide designated parking spaces for trucks in specific locations within each region before initiation of any legal measure. “I believe the municipality should establish designated parking areas for these trucks, away from the residential neighbourhoods.” Another Muscat resident Hammoud al Rubiei suggested that the concerned authorities should allocate a special area as a centre for trucks, with a small fee and protection. He proposed the old Mawaleh market area as an ideal location for this centre due to its excellent location and existing facilities such as offices, a prayer hall, housing and banking services. He noted that only some workshops are needed to complete the setup. Demanding punishment for whoever is responsible for illegal parking, resident Majdah al Shukairi informed that the residents of south Mawaleh, near Al Sahwa Park, suffer from this problem. She mentioned that these trucks distort the general view of the city and contribute to traffic congestion. The municipality called on citizens to report such violations through social networking sites or Muscat Municipality Call Center (1111).",

        "description": "Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5 000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future.",
        "content": "That figure is an increase from the 1 000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36 000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike.",

        "description": "The DA is filing an an application in the Electoral Court against President Cyril Ramaphosa, for violating the Electoral Code of Conduct and the EFF wants an investigating into the \"misuse\" of the state broadcaster, the SABC.",
        "content": "The DA is hauling President Cyril Ramaphosa before the Electoral Court, accusing him of abusing his office for political gain using a \"national address\" to the nation via the SABC. Opposition parties have lashed out at Ramaphosa over his address to the nation on Sunday night. According to the DA, Ramaphosa violated the Electoral Code of Conduct when he \"abused the highest office in the land for flagrant electioneering\". In his address, Ramaphosa detailed the progress made during the sixth administration. The EFF wants an investigation into the \"misuse\" of the SABC by Ramaphosa's office to avoid a repeat in the future. Ramaphosa also spoke on the significance of Wednesday's election and other security matters, but a large part of his speech was about his government's successes. These included the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, tackling corruption and gender-based violence. READ | 'We don't live in castles in the sky,' says Zille on DA's chances of winning 51% nationally in polls The signing into law of the National Health Insurance Bill was also one of Ramaphosa's major talking points. But DA leader John Steenhuisen is taking Ramaphosa to task on this issue by filing an application in the Electoral Court for violating the Electoral Code. In a statement, he said the Electoral Code of Conduct, as contained in the Electoral Act, states expressly that no person may abuse a position of power, privilege or influence, including parental, patriarchal, traditional or employment authority, to influence the conduct or outcome of an election. \"Ramaphosa's manipulation was cynical, calculated and designed to influence the outcome of the election by providing the ANC with unearned airtime [that was] not made available to any other party contesting the election. \"Not for the first time, Ramaphosa has chosen his corrupt political party over South Africa. As the president, he should have known better and must be held to account. This type of abuse cannot be allowed by anyone,\" Steenhuisen said. WRAP | COMMENT: Ramaphosa 'abuses' national address to cynically campaign for the ANC According to Steenhuisen, the \"desecration\" of the office Ramaphosa holds confirms that he is panicked. \"Because he has finally realised that the people are about to hold the ANC to account for the corruption, misrule and hardship they have inflicted upon the people of South Africa. The DA, therefore, calls on voters to turn out to the polling booths in their millions to help us bring an end to the ANC's impunity and abuse of our democracy for narrow personal and political gain,\" he said. Furthermore, Steenhuisen said Ramaphosa \"has clearly signaled that the ANC is prepared to undermine our constitutional democracy to try to cling to power\". \"This should serve as an urgent warning to all of our democratic institutions, including the IEC. If Ramaphosa is willing to abuse his office for narrow political gain even before the ANC has lost its majority, what else will he be willing to do to subvert the will of the people and cling to power after voters take away the ANC's majority on Wednesday? \"If voters needed any further confirmation that the hunger for power and the corruption of the ANC constitutes an urgent threat to the values upon which our constitutional democracy is based, Ramaphosa provided it last night,\" he said. Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told News24 the criticism is unfounded because Ramaphosa's address was a stately account of the work done during the course of the sixth administration. \"The president was, therefore, being accountable to the nation as we end the term of the 6th administration. Secondly, he was taking the responsibility of assuring South Africans that these elections are going to be free and fair and, more importantly, safe. That responsibility can only be discharged by a sitting head of state,\" Magwenya said. He also argued that in his address, Ramaphosa, did not mention the governing party, nor did he criticise other political parties. \"In fact, he commended all parties for the peaceful manner in which they have campaigned and thanked all parliamentarians for the work they've done over the concluding term. Lastly, the president paid tribute to all South Africans who worked together with government when the country was going through challenging times, like the Covid-19 pandemic, the floods in KZN and other parts of the country and during the 2021 riots,\" he said. According to Magwenya, the address was not about campaigning. \"The president, as he must, was being the president of all South Africans with the address,\" he said. Meanwhile, the EFF has also expressed its concern and condemned Ramaphosa for using the SABC for political gain. The party condemned the \"hijacking of the state broadcaster for partisan purposes\". \"It is clear that there is fear within the ANC ranks of an imminent loss and they are resorting to desperate measures to stay in power,\" the EFF said in a statement. \"The unscheduled address is a blatant misuse of presidential powers and state resources, aimed at furthering the interests of the ANC rather than serving the South African public.\"",

        "content": "Nigeria’s digital journey is accelerating; at the forefront of this unprecedented growth is the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and one of its key strengths lies in its collaborative method. Through collaboration with tech hubs, educational institutions, and industry stakeholders, the agency is laying the groundwork for a thriving digital economy. NITDA’s partnerships span across various sectors, and this multifaceted approach ensures a comprehensive strategy for digital literacy and innovation. Among the critical areas of focus are training programmes in artificial intelligence (AI), coding, cybersecurity, and basic digital literacy. These initiatives are not just about imparting knowledge; they are about equipping Nigerians with the skills necessary to thrive in a digital economy. The programmes are meant to engender a digital literate workforce, in line with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda. To equip citizens with the skills for the digital age, NITDA aims to achieve a remarkable target of 70% digital literacy by 2027. The agency is birthing a new generation of highly talented Nigerians. Tech hubs nationwide are buzzing with activity, where participants are immersed in learning experiences that cover the latest advancements in technology. Educational institutions are also critical, this NITDA is working with the Federal Ministry of Education to integrate these programmes into their curricula to produce graduates that are ready to meet the demands of the digital age. Beyond education and training, the agency, through regulations, co-creates policies that provide a conducive environment for tech companies, and ensure that innovation flourish while maintaining the security of digital infrastructure. One notable example is NITDA’s involvement in developing guidelines for AI and data protection, which are crucial as the world increasingly relies on data-driven decision-making. These regulations not only protect users but also provide a clear framework for companies to innovate confidently. This focus on collaboration extends beyond domestic partnerships. NITDA actively seeks partnerships with international stakeholders. A case in point was the alliance with the United States Consulate General, Lagos, to host the Global Tech Africa Summit. The event brought together African and international players in the tech space, fostering knowledge exchange and creating opportunities for cross-border collaboration. The agency has recognised the transformative power of skill-based training. This prompted it to deepen its strategic partnership with Cisco to harness these technologies for Nigeria’s development. This collaboration is not just a step forward; it is a leap toward a future where technology drives sustainable growth and innovation across multiple sectors. Pilot projects are being rolled out to demonstrate the practical applications of these technologies in real-world settings. NITDA has also partnered with TikTok to address some of the most pressing issues in the digital age. The cooperation promotes the responsible use of AI, and a secure online space. The importance of this cannot be overemphasised because social media is increasingly integral to daily life. NITDA aims to leverage the TikTok platform’s extensive reach and technological prowess to implement robust measures that safeguard users, particularly the younger demographic. Recently, NITDA partnered with GIZ (German Agency for International Cooperation) and Digital Transformation Center (DTC) to host a stakeholder event on the National Digital Literacy Framework (NDLF) in Lagos to address the digital divide and equip Nigerians with digital skills. An example is the joint effort on developing robust standards for digital literacy content to ensure learning materials are aligned with Nigeria’s National Digital Literacy Framework (NDLF). NITDA’s determination to foster innovation is evident in its establishment of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) – Office for Nigerian Digital Innovation (ONDI) and the National Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (NCAIR). These SPVs act as catalysts for collaboration within the tech ecosystem, allowing for the implementation of initiatives like the Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Support (TIES) Scheme and the iHatch Startup Incubation Programme. Speaking at a public outing, NITDA Director General, Kashifu Inuwa, stated: “Collaborating with stakeholders is fundamental to our mission. We can create an ecosystem that supports innovation and sustainable growth, so that Nigeria is not just a consumer of technology but a key player in the global tech arena. The goal is to create a sustainable digital ecosystem where everyone has the opportunity to participate and benefit. Our partnerships are crucial in bridging the skills gap and ensuring that Nigeria’s digital economy is inclusive and resilient.” As Nigeria stands on the cusp of a digital revolution, NITDA’s partnerships serve as a beacon of what is possible when government, industry, and academia come together with a shared vision. The journey to 70% digital literacy by 2027 is ambitious, but with the continued support and collaboration of all stakeholders, it is a goal well within reach. Through these efforts, Nigeria is not just preparing for the future, it is shaping it. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "A popular shopping hub in the nation's capital, Banex Plaza, has now been reopened after it was closed for a week due to clashes between soldiers and traders. According to PoliticsNigeria, the plaza resumed operations at 2:30 PM on Monday, May 27, marking the end of a tense period that had disrupted business activities. The closure was initiated after an incident involving personnel from the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police and traders at the plaza. The confrontation escalated into physical altercations involving passersby and security guards, leading authorities to temporarily shut down the facility to ensure public safety and order. According to reports, the reopening was agreed upon after successful resolutions between the traders involved in the altercations and military authorities. This agreement comes as a relief to many business owners and customers who frequent the bustling electronics and telecommunications market. The initial clash that prompted the closure occurred when four military police personnel retaliated against traders following a previous disagreement. The reopening signifies a return to normalcy and the restoration of business activities at one of Abuja’s major commercial centers.",

        "content": "Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Mr Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Mr Biden said under grey skies in the memorial amphitheatre. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Mr Biden, joined by vice president Kamala Harris and defence secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Mr Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honouring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,” Mr Biden said, crediting the Pact Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right healthcare, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Mr Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Festus Keyamo, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, has described the controversial Nigeria Air unveiled by the Buhari-led administration as a fraud, adding that it remained suspended. Keyamo, who gave details about the project, noted that the ‘national carrier’ that was supposed to be an indigenous project and one that was supposed to spark hope for Nigerians, was flawed with a lot of secrecy and fraudulent activities. The Minister made the declaration on Nigeria Air while fielding questions from journalists during the second day of the Ministerial Sectorial update on Monday, May 27, in Abuja. According to him, Keyamo it was anti-Nigeria. Read also: Bayelsa tribunal upholds Gov Diri’s re-election He said: “It was never Air Nigeria. It was Ethiopian trying to flag our flag and not Air Nigeria. That is the truth; it was not Nigeria. “It only printed Air Nigeria. It was an Ethiopian airline trying to fly our flag. If it is so, why not allow our local people to fly our flag? Why bring a foreigner to fly our flag? “So nobody should deceive you that it is Air Nigeria. Air Nigeria must be indigenous, wholly Nigeria or must be for the full benefit of Nigerians. Not that 60 percent of the profit is given to another country. “How does that benefit us? It remains suspended. It remains so,” he said. Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "description": "NASA Langley researchers are heading to the Arctic Ocean to study the habitat's effect on climate worldwide.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Eliza Noe, The Virginian-Pilot, The Virginian-Pilot NASA Langley researchers are heading to the Arctic Ocean to study the habitat's effect on climate worldwide. The ARCSIX, or Arctic Radiation Cloud Aerosol Surface Interaction Experiment, airborne campaign will fly out of Pituffik Space Force Base in Greenland for seven weeks this summer to gather measurements of the sea ice, clouds , radiation and aerosols that are affecting the ice melt . \"The reason that we need this mission is because there are a lot of things that we don't know about how the Arctic climate system functions and operates,\" said Patrick Taylor, deputy mission science leader. \"There's a lot of uncertainty in our projections of how fast they warm. We know that it's going to warm fast, but it can go really fast. \"The idea of these observations is to understand how the sea ice is changing, so that we can use that data to improve our tests and hypotheses and improve our theories about how the sea ice is evolving. We can then put those ideas and our knowledge to improve our forecast models.\" Ice in the arctic has a pivotal role in cooling the Earth, and it's not every day that scientists are able to take detailed snapshots of the region. Taylor and Ewan Crosbie, platform scientists, said it's pivotal to learn about the Earth's warming climate now, and the data could be used to form strategies on how to reduce the effects of climate change. \"Having boots on the ground (and) people out in this region of the Arctic only happens once or twice every five years,\" Taylor said. \"It's not even that we get out there every year. We get these very periodic snapshots of what's happening there. We're going to have an unprecedented kind of dataset of it with all the different instruments.\" The mission is split into two. The group will go out to see how the ice is melting in late spring and early summer , and in July, a second part will collect data for the later parts of summer. Each flight will have two pilots, a flight scientist coordinating with researchers on the ground, a scientist for each of the three instruments collecting data and an extra seat for an additional scientist or operator. The aircraft is equipped with three components. The first are dropsondes, designed to be dropped from an aircraft at altitude and measure characteristics such as temperature, humidity and winds. Another is the AVIRIS, or Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer. AVIRIS is used as a very powerful camera, and will collect useful information about the sea ice clouds and aerosols. The third is HALO, or High Altitude Lidar Observatory. It uses a very short pulse of light to collect images, but where the AVIRIS takes images of what's happening horizontally, HALO collects data on what's happening vertically. \"When the ice starts to melt, we get liquid forming on the surface. We can see what that looks like (with the instruments), even though you couldn't see with the naked eye,\" Crosbie said. \"Also for clouds, an interesting science question that we'll go after is to try to understand the lifecycle of Arctic clouds. \"So understanding the distinction between clouds that contain predominantly liquid droplets versus ice particles is a critical piece to understanding the behavior of Arctic clouds, their lifecycle and the radiation impacts.\" Crosbie said this could be one of the last times to observe \"old ice,\" or ice that was able to survive the summer melt season and regrow during the polar night. He said the ice seen in the mission will be between 3–4 years old, and this could be one of the last chances to measure and collect data on it. \"We're really excited about the science,\" Taylor said. \"We don't get a dataset like this in this region of the Arctic—or the Arctic at all—very often, so really, some things we think we'll learn will probably surprise us. There's probably some things we're not expecting will pop out of the data.\" Provided byThe Virginian-Pilot",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Africa’s Travel Indaba was held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre. Hundreds of delegates were in Durban as part of the three-day trade show, Africa’s Travel Indaba is an iconic African leisure trade show owned by South African Tourism, with the specific objective of creating market access for the country’s vast array of African leisure tourism products. Dube-Ncube said the trade show provides the ideal platform for African tourism exhibitors to showcase their offerings to international and local buyers, destination marketing companies and leisure tourism services partners. As the tourism industry shows green shoots globally, she said one of the key sub-sectors the province wants to focus on is Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events (MICE). MICE make up a big part of global business travel since every industry has regular events of some kind. The main goal is always to bring professionals together, foster connections, promote new ideas and push growth. “As a province, we will be at the forefront of ensuring that KwaZulu-Natal gets the lion’s share of the tourism market. As we all know, one of the biggest trends in the tourism environment is the blending of leisure tourism and business, known as ‘Bleisure Travel’ [blending of business and leisure travel]. “We would like to thank all of you for your continued support of Africa’s Travel Indaba. Indeed, Africa has limitless possibilities, and we must seize the opportunity to ensure that Africa’s time is now,” Dube-Ncube said. The Premier noted that this year’s Africa’s Travel Indaba takes place at a time when South Africa is celebrating 30 years since the dawn of democracy, which ushered in a new era and assured our standing in the family of other nations.",

        "content": "FBN Holdings Plc has released its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2024, posting a pre-tax profit of N238.5 billion, which marks 325% year-on-year growth from the N56.1 billion posted in the same quarter of 2023. The group during the quarter posted a net income of N208.2 billion, which represents a 316% increase from the N50.1 billion net income posted in Q1 2023. The growth in profit was driven by a 153% year on year growth in interest income to N455 billion during the quarter from N180 billion recorded in Q1 2023. Related Stories Economic challenges slash Nigeria’s small-scale industrialists by nearly half in two years How to mine Hamster Combat coins and earn money from it The group posted an FX revaluation loss of N108.2 billion during the quarter as it posted an FX trading income of N13.4 billion, resulting in an FX loss of N94.8 billion. Key Highlights (Q1 2024 vs Q1 2023) The group posted a net interest income of N228.7 billion during the quarter, reflecting a 104% year-on-year growth from the N111.8 billion posted in Q1 2023. Impairment charges hit N42.9 billion, marking a 154% YoY growth from the N16.9 billion impairment provisions of Q1 2023. Net interest income after impairment charges hit N185.7 billion, a 96% YoY growth from N95 billion posted in Q1 2023. Net fee and commission income hit N54 billion, up by 53% YoY from N35.3 billion in Q1 2023. The group’s profit before tax hit N238.5 billion, representing 325% YoY growth from Q1 2023’s N56.1 billion. Profit after tax hit N208.2 billion, representing 316% YoY growth from N50.1 billion posted in Q1 2023. The group’s total assets appreciated by 27% to N21.6 trillion during the quarter, from N16.9 trillion as of FYE 2023. Customer deposits significantly contributed to the group’s asset growth, with customers’ deposits increasing by 24% during the quarter, rising from N10.7 trillion at the end of 2023 to N13.3 trillion. The group’s loan portfolio also grew by 41% during the quarter, as the total loans and advances to customers and banks hit N11.9 trillion, up from N8.4 trillion as of FYE 2023. As the bank’s loan portfolio expanded, rising interest rates—prompted by two hikes in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) during the quarter—resulted in the bank achieving its largest ever interest income for a single quarter. The group’s shareholders’ equity increased by 10% during the quarter to N1.92 trillion, from N1.75 trillion as of FYE 2023. During the quarter, the group’s retained earnings hit N794.4 billion, compared to N589 billion as of 2023 year-end. Despite the increase in shareholders’ funds, it does not affect the group’s recapitalization efforts. FBN Holdings still needs to raise N269.4 billion in new share capital to meet the Central Bank of Nigeria’s N500 billion minimum capital requirement for an international banking license. At the end of trading on May 27, 2024, FBNH’s share price closed at N21.10, reflecting a 3.18% improvement as investors display confidence in the bank’s shares.",

An official from the Buraimi Governor’s Office said that bids are being solicited for establishment of an entertainment area – named Mahdah Oasis – in the wilayat of Mahdah and for the development of the entrance to the same wilayat. “These initiatives are part of the broader efforts to boost domestic tourism and provide recreational spaces for citizens,” said the official. Similarly, in the wilayat of Buraimi, interested firms are invited to submit bids for the development of Al Saara Park, the establishment of a children’s playground in the Al Khadra area, the enhancement of Al Buraimi Walk, improvements to the area surrounding the Sultan Qaboos Mosque roundabout, and the development of the Buraimi Central Market. “In the wilayat of Sunaina, tenders have been invited for the enhancement of Falaj al Sunaina and Falaj al Rihani, as well as the construction of a children’s playground in the Al Awaida area,” the official further informed. “These projects underscore the commitment of the local authorities to the advancement of infrastructure across the governorate,” he added. The tender documents can be collected from June 6, while the last date for submission of bids is July 2. The projects have been chosen as per the Governorate Development Plan, under which each governorate has been allocated RO20mn during the 2021-25 Five-Year Plan period serving as incentive for competitiveness and economic growth.",

        "content": "Spain's Rafael Nadal looks dejected after losing his first round match against Germany's Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros today in the French Open. Photo: Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 today in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favourite tournament. It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4. The match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout. Nadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after today's defeat. His three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.",

        "content": "RAFAEL NADAL’S record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end on Monday when the 14-time champion slumped to a demoralising first round defeat against Alexander Zverev. Nadal, who turns 38 on 3 June, went down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to world number four Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut. It was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport. “I don’t know if this is the last time I will be here, I am not 100% sure but if it is then I wanted to enjoy it,” said Nadal. “The feelings today are difficult to describe in words.” Plagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris. However, he insisted on the eve of the tournament that he was “100% keeping the door open” on his future in a sport which has brought him 22 Grand Slam titles. In a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances. He was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent. Chants of “Rafa, Rafa” had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule. They subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game. Nadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net. It was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros. Nadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn’t back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set. A tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally. Nadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set. However, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention. The effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.",

        "content": "Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.

Food Banks Canada’s 2024 Poverty Report Card gives B.C. a D-plus. “I would say that the grade itself is very concerning as it was last year and we were optimistic that we would see B.C. improving on that,” Dan Huang-Taylor, executive director of Food Banks BC, said.“It (the final grade) was disappointed but also unexpected because this is what we are seeing at the front lines of food banks , more people needing services, which only tells that the situation of many British Columbians has gotten worse.” The provincial poverty rate of 11.6 per cent is “substantially higher” than the national average of 9.9 per cent, according to the report. More British Columbians are also experiencing some form of food insecurity in the face of rising costs for necessities like housing coupled with inadequate assistance rates. Huang-Taylor said B.C.’s poverty rates partly reflect economic factors completely out of its control. “But we are also certainly looking at government policies that are currently inadequate to meet the needs of people, particularly those who are most impacted by poverty — people on fixed incomes, racialized communities and Indigenous peoples.” Huang-Taylor said solutions must involve all societal partners: all levels of government; non-profits and corporations, adding that his organization looks forward to the upcoming release of B.C. poverty reduction strategy. RELATED: Food bank report fails B.C. on several poverty tests, but commends efforts “We are encouraged by what’s happening in B.C. with housing,” Huang-Taylor said, adding more needs to be done to adequately house hundreds of thousands of people. The Poverty Report Canada gives B.C. a B for government efforts to address some poverty issues, especially when it comes to housing. “(B.C.) has developed an ambitious and aggressive housing plan that is widely regarded as among the best in Canada,” it says. Speaking at a housing event Thursday (May 24) in Metro Vancouver, Premier David Eby acknowledged the report. “The issues facing many British Columbians around affordability are serious and on-going,” he said. “Today’s announcement is just one example of how we are responding to one of the biggest drivers of affordability for people, which is the cost of housing,” he said. Eby pointed to many of the factors which Huang-Taylor later identified outside of B.C.’s control, including Bank of Canada interest rates. RELATED: B.C. offering one-time rental benefit for some low-income families, seniors RELATED: $214M coming to B.C. school districts to create, expand food programs RELATED: $110-rebate coming to B.C. drivers by end of July: ICBC CEO Eby also pointed to other initiatives, including the expansion of the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters program and the Rental Assistance Program; the creation of breakfast programs for school children; and the creation of subsidized, in some cases, free child care spaces. Eby also pointed to the one-time B.C. Hydro rebate of $100 part of this year’s budget and the just announced ICBC rebate of $110 coupled with a freeze on auto insurance rates as steps to make life more affordable. “We know got a lot of work to do to respond to this,” he said. When asked which specific policies British Columbians might expect to hear about when it comes to reducing poverty rates during the upcoming election campaign, Eby questioned the commitment of B.C. United and Conservative Party of B.C. Under the B.C. NDP, B.C. now has the highest minimum wage, while maintaining top credit rating and one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios, Eby added. Since coming to power, the B.C. NDP has raised social assistance three times. “We increased disability assistance, we doubled the senior supplement...I could go on,” he said. “But all of these pieces were available under the previous administration and they didn’t do it.” Eby also warned that a future centre-of-right government would roll back these programs.

        "content": "Operatives of the Rivers State Police Command have arrested four serving personnel of the Nigerian Army and nine others for hijacking and diverting trailer-loads of goods in Rivers State. Also arrested was a personnel of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and eight other civilians who are members of a 13-man syndicate that specialises in hijacking and diversion of trailer-loads of goods. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Grace Iringe-Koko, in a statement in Port Harcourt on Monday, gave the names of the soldiers as West Isaac, Abdul Musa, Mgbe Geoffrey and Innocent Okwoli. Iringe-Koko also disclosed the identity of the NSCDC personnel as Jabila Kammangar, while their civilian collaborators are Olisa Emeka, George Obilor, Sampson Wilson, Alfred Abeke, Barry John, Auwalu Aliyu, Uchenna Nwali, and Alhaji Sofinu Haruna. The statement reads in part: “Investigations by the Rivers State Police Command, following arrests for attempted burglary, have revealed a wide range of criminal activities. “On March 4, 2024, at approximately 11 pm, the Rivers State Police Command received a distress call about burglars who were attempting to vandalise warehouses in Elimgbu owned by Mr. Emmanuel Nwangwu and Mrs. Ndifreke Ekanem. The police promptly mobilised to the scene and arrested five suspects who had been severely beaten by a mob. “The wounded suspects were taken to the police hospital as investigations began. During the investigation, it was discovered that one of the suspects, West Isaac (08NA/61/2653), was a corporal in the Nigerian Army serving in Delta State. “Another suspect, Jabila Kammangar, also known as ‘Kaka,’ was an officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps serving in Kabba, Kogi State. They confessed to abandoning their posts to engage in criminal activities in Rivers State due to its lucrativeness. “Corporal West, a 36-year-old father of four from Buguma, Rivers State, joined the Army in 2008 and was assigned to the 3rd Battalion in Warri. He left his base on a sick pass and failed to return even after it expired, remaining absent for over a month until his arrest. “West disclosed to the police that he met Kaka while serving in the Army’s Anti-Bunkering Unit, and together, they engaged in several illegal activities. He further revealed that he came to Port Harcourt after receiving a call from Kaka about raiding warehouses, which led to their capture. “Further investigations revealed that they were part of a larger criminal ring specialising in armed robbery, hijacking, and goods diversion. Corporal West disclosed to the police that he and other Army personnel had been key players in the group. Besides ransacking warehouses, they had a network of informants who provided information about the schedules of goods-bearing trailers. “They would then dress in full military gear, lay in wait for the trailers, and accost them with a white Hilux van as they approached. They would intimidate the drivers, assault them, and hand their keys to designated drivers, who would then divert the trailers to waiting receivers. “Based on his confessional statement, the police were able to track down and arrest Lance Corporal Abdul Musa (13NA/70/10545), Lance Corporal Mgbe Jeoffrey (16NA/75/6896), and Corporal Innocent Okwoli (12NA/68/6552), all personnel of the Nigerian Army. “Additionally, eight civilian collaborators in the syndicate were arrested: Olisa Emeka, George Obilor, Sampson Wilson, Alfred Abeke, Barry John, Auwalu Aliyu, Uchenna Nwali, and Alhaji Sofinu Haruna. “The group’s key coordinator was Corporal Innocent Okwoli, a native of Otakpo in Benue State and a soldier stationed at Intels in Onne. Okwoli stated that he started leading hijacking operations after being introduced to the activity by an individual named Abbas and two unnamed Naval officers. Following a successful operation, he formed his team.” Police listed their numerous crimes to include hijacking of a trailer loaded with fertiliser valued at N25 million belonging to Alhaji Sadiq Adams on February 17, 2024. “On March 4, 2024, the group attempted to burgle warehouses owned by Emmanuel Nwagwu and Ndifreke Ekanem. “In February 2024, a 40-foot container filled with imported clothing from China was hijacked and diverted. “In February 2024, a trailer carrying POP cement was hijacked and diverted. The police have since recovered the stolen POP cement and are working to retrieve a trailer load of fertiliser from its receiver. Additionally, a white Toyota Hilux used in the gang’s operations has been recovered from the NSCDC officer. Three of the affected soldiers have been dismissed by the Nigerian Army after being handed over by the police.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Rivers State, Olatunji Disu, has expressed his profound appreciation for the swift and decisive cooperation of the military authorities. Disu lauded their prompt actions in addressing the involved officers’ misconduct and subsequent handover to the police for prosecution. The Police Commissioner, who emphasised that this collaborative effort underscores a strong commitment to upholding justice and maintaining public trust in law enforcement institutions, praised the officers involved in the arrest and urged them to remain vigilant.",

        "content": "Mike Tyson is \"doing great\" following a reported health scare the former heavyweight champion had on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday. According to a report by , Tyson -- who is scheduled to face Jake Paul in a boxing match on July 20 -- had a medical issue that required paramedics to board the plane upon landing and assist. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" Tyson's representatives said in a statement. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" There were rumors that the flight was delayed because of Tyson's medical issue, but his representatives debunked that. \"It's false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,\" the rep stated. \"This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" Tyson, 57, is slated to return to the boxing ring for his first professional fight in nearly two decades when he faces Paul, 27, in a blockbuster showdown at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix. By the time the two combatants step into the ring for their heavyweight clash, Tyson will have celebrated his 58th birthday and be 31 years older than Paul. The fight will be contested over eight 2-minute rounds with each fighter using 14-ounce gloves.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal, the 14-time French Open champ, was eliminated in the first round of the Grand Slam tournament for the first time in his career, losing to Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "PARIS -- lost in the first round of the French Open to 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that . And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the \"incredible the amount of energy\" it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. \"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\" It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of \"Ra-fa!\" from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 US Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against in 2010 and against in 2015 and 2021. \"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It's Rafa's moment.\"",

The Mavericks outworked, outhustled, and out-strategized the Timberwolves who were looking for an answer to their superb attack. Led by their dynamic backcourt duo Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, the Mavericks sliced up the Wolves’ defense with their scoring and passing in the pick-and-roll. The Timberwolves’ no.1 defense in the regular season could not do anything with Doncic and Irving throwing up lob after lob while also scoring at will. Minnesota star guard Anthony Edwards was better in Game 3 however co-star Karl-Anthony Towns struggled once again vs the physical and scrappy defense by the Mavs against him. Dallas will try to close it out and sweep Minnesota in Game 4 on Tuesday.

        "content": "The gubernatorial of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Kogi state, Alhaji Murtala Yakubu Ajaka has said his loss at the tribunal to Governor Usman Ododo is just a temporary setback as he is set to pursue the case to the highest court. Ajaka, who was reacting to the verdict of the Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, which dismissed his petition against Governor Ododo said “A long walk to freedom has just begun” According to him “Today, I come before you with a heavy heart, but also with a fire of optimism burning in my soul. We have just received the news that our election petition has been unsuccessful at the tribunal. “It is a setback, a moment of disappointment, and it is natural for us to feel disheartened. But let me tell you this, my fellow Kogites, this is not the end of our journey. This is just a chapter in our fight for justice, truth, the rights of our people and freedom”. Ajaka affirmed that “Despite the outcome at the tribunal, I am proud to say that we had a team of brilliant lawyers who did an outstanding job in proving the case of overvoting during the election. “Their dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to upholding the principles of democracy have left an indelible mark on our case as we push further”. The SDP candidate disclosed that “Throughout the entire process, our lawyers exhibited the highest level of professionalism and tenacity. They meticulously gathered evidence, scrutinized data, and presented a compelling case to the tribunal, but the tribunal despite agreeing to over-voting struck our case out. According to him,”These lawyers did not fail us. We are very optimistic that they will be vindicated by the end of the petition. I can assure you that this judgment will not stand the test of time. “Yes, we may have lost the battle at the tribunal, but the war is far from over. Our stolen mandate, our voice, our power, will not be silenced. We will rise from the ashes of this defeat, stronger and more determined than ever before. “Today, we must encourage each other to be hopeful, to be relentless in our pursuit of justice, and to keep our faith unwavering”. According to him, “It is in times like these that our resilience is tested. We must remember why we embarked on this political journey in the first place. Our dreams, our hopes for a better future for Kogi, for a fairer society, for the upliftment of the marginalized, for the protection of our people, and the progress of our state – these dreams are not dependent on a single election outcome. “We must remind ourselves that our fight is not just about winning an election; it is about standing up for what is right, for what is just, and for what we believe in. “Our opponents may have won this first round, the battle, but they have not won the war. We will take this fight to the very end, where justice will prevail. We will reclaim our stolen mandate and restore the faith of our people in the democratic process. “Let us not lose sight of the bigger picture. We have been given an opportunity, a platform to make a difference. Losing at the tribunal does not make us losers; it makes us fighters, warriors who will not back down in the face of adversity. “The violence, aggression and intimidation we faced during the election did not stop us. We will not be deterred by temporary setbacks, because our spirit is unbreakable. “I call upon every one of you, my fellow Kogites to stay united, to stand strong, and to continue the fight. Our journey may be long and challenging, but together, we can overcome any obstacles that come our way. Let us not lose hope, let us not lose faith, and let us not lose sight of the ultimate goal. “Remember, my fellow Kogites, that history is filled with stories of triumph against all odds. We are the authors of our destiny, and we have the power to shape the future. Let our determination be our guiding light, and let our relentless pursuit of justice be the fuel that propels us forward. “In conclusion, I want to remind you all that we are not alone in this fight. The people who believe in us, who have placed their trust in us, are counting on us to fulfil our promise. Let us not disappoint them. Let us rise above this setback, and together, let us reclaim our stolen mandate”. Also read: BREAKING: Tribunal affirms Ododo as Kogi gov, dismisses Ajaka’s petition",

        "content": "Baldur’s Gate 3 players can’t believe others avoid Bernard, a Construct NPC who guards the Underdark’s Arcane Tower. Players who will meet Bernard on the top floor. The Construct guardian will only attack under certain circumstances, but, due to the difficulty of the fight, many players have decided to skip the encounter completely. Redditor counts as one such Baldur’s Gate 3 player, claiming Bernard’s is the only battle they avoided during their Honour Mode run. The user explained in part, “Just fought him in Tactician for the first time, and YIKES am I glad I skipped him in Honor; he just about took me apart.” While several people in the comments agreed that leaving Bernard alone on harder difficulties is a smart choice, many others questioned the need to fight him at all. It’s possible to encounter the Construct and walk away from him on a friendly note; , too. One popular comment under the post notes, “...you don’t even have to fight him when you meet him. Just read some of the books. He can even hug you.” Someone who’s played Baldur’s Gate 3 four times added, “Me just sitting here like ‘wait, people fight Bernard?'” To make nice with Bernard, players must find command phrases written on documents scattered around Arcane Tower. Answering each of his questions with the correct answer will turn him passive, thus avoiding a fight. However, those who do face off against Bernard will have to best him in regular combat. One person in the Reddit thread suggested planting Sussur Flowers near the smaller robots to shut them down. From there, it’s a matter of drawing Bernard to the building’s edge, so Wyll can shoot him with an that knocks him off the ledge.",

        "description": "Dumisani Dlamini has shared his belief that his daughter, US singer Doja Cat will 'come home' to South Africa...",
        "content": "A clip of Dumisani Dlamini talking about his daughter Doja Cat has re-emerged amid her latest rant, in which she calls him a “deadbeat dad.” The US singer was born in 1995 to the South African actor and muso and his then-partner, Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. Dumisani – who also fathered a son, Doja’s brother Raman Dalithando – left the US to return home. Doja has yet to visit South Africa. It’s unclear if she has ever met Dumisani. DUMISANI DLAMINI ON DOJA CAT: ‘ONE DAY SHE’LL COME HOME’ On social media, Doja Cat and Dumisani Dlamini became trending topics because of her choice of words regarding her South African father. One tweep reposted a clip of Dumisani talking about his daughter in an old interview on Mzansi Magic. Speaking of his Grammy-winning child, he said: “She’s my daughter. It just blew up now as if there is something wrong. People are changing stories.” He added, “We don’t want to dwell [on the past]. One day, she will come home, and everyone will see her.” Dumisani insisted he was proud of Doja “even before she became a superstar”. Speaking to Tshisalive, Dumisani claimed that he planned to bring his US family back to South Africa – a move that never materialized. Dumisani has yet to address Doja Cat’s latest rant WHAT DID DOJA CAT SAY ABOUT HER DAD? On Monday, 27 May, Doja Cat launched a foul-mouth social media rant aimed at her father, Dumisani Dlamini. In it, she called him out for “abandoning” his family and being a “b*tch”. One follower – likely a South African – was not impressed with Doja’s words, commenting: “You are messing with the wrong one. Zulus don’t play...your ancestors will humble you”. Doja Cat clapped back: “Go give the deadbeat a kiss on the lips for me.” She added: “[Dumisani] gave me a lazy eye and dipped.” Under a post on Dumisani’s Instagram account, Doja Cat commented: “F**k you”. In a 2019 interview with Leah Henry and DJ Quicksilva, Doja opened up about not knowing her father. She said: “I have never [met him], and he’s on Instagram. And he comments on my pictures sometimes. He’s an incredible dancer and great actor, but yeah, I don’t know him very well”. ‘SHE’LL REGRET WHAT SHE’S DOING’ Meanwhile, several South Africans are calling out Doja Cat for disrespecting not only her father but also her African roots. @theHirohito : “Can we all agree that in African culture, swearing at your parents publicly is an equivalent to cursing yourself, like Doja Cat is doing there on IG? @Priddyzaddy: “She’s playing with fire this one.” @__ThapeloM : “She’ll regret what she’s doing.”",

The company said on its website Sunday that the Series B funding round will be used to take xAI’s first products to market and speed up research. xAI said it has made “significant strides” during the past year in developing the technology, which will continue in the coming months. Investors in the latest round include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity Management & Research, Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and Kingdom Holding. Musk wrote on the social media site X that before the investment, xAI had a valuation of $18 billion. The funding should help Musk’s company compete in a race to develop artificial intelligence against Microsoft and Open AI, which created Chat GPT. Musk announced formation of the company in July of last year and released its artificial intelligence chatbot called Grok in November. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources (MAFWR) has initiated a programme for rural women in the wilayat of Ibri, Dhahirah governorate, to help them attain self-sufficiency through poultry farming. An official from MAFWR referred to a recent workshop titled ‘Poultry Raising and Chick Production’, which had been designed to uplift and market the agricultural products of rural women in Ibri. The workshop provided participants with critical insights into hatching processes and their significance in poultry farming, under the guidance of Yasmine al Majarifi, an animal production specialist. Yasmine explained the intricacies of artificial hatching, including the use of various hatching machines and maintenance of optimal conditions for artificial hatching. Participants also discussed sanitary practices for handling eggs and shared experiences to enhance their understanding and skills in poultry management. Under the initiative, essential tools and equipment such as refrigerators, hatching devices and packaging machines were distributed to 32 beneficiaries in February this year, empowering them to effectively manage and expand their agricultural projects. The Directorate General of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources in North Batinah governorate signed an agreement on last week with Oman Flour Mills to support livestock breeders in the wilayat of Liwa. Abdullah bin Mohammed al Hadabi, Director General of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources in North Batinah, explained that this agreement comes within the framework of supporting livestock projects in the governorate, focusing on breeders from ‘productive’ families in order to enhance the success of their projects. The agreement paves the way for a livestock products exhibition with 12 stalls dedicated to food safety and quality, veterinary clinics and laboratories, rural women’s products and feed company products.",

        "content": "Bhubaneswar: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday slammed the BJD government’s 5T (transformative initiative) model of governance. Addressing election rallies in Patkura and Kakatpur, the senior BJP leader asked, “One ‘T’ means teamwork. Is there any teamwork in Odisha? The elected MLAs, MPs and ministers don’t have any power to exercise. Here only a team exists...that is in between Pandian and his wife and only one T, which stands for Tamil Nadu.” Neither the State Cabinet nor any officer has the power in Odisha. Only two persons (Pandian and his wife) have all the powers, Himanta alleged. He blamed the BJD government for the rising unemployment in Odisha. “Today, the youth of Odisha are migrating to other States due to unemployment. On the other hand, one lakh government posts are lying vacant in the State and the Odia youth are not being employed in local industries”, he said.",

        "content": "The 9th Region baseball tournament got underway on Monday with all four quarterfinal games played at Thomas More Stadium in Florence. The four winners move on to Wednesday’s semifinals at Thomas More Stadium, with those games set to be played at 5 and 7:30 p.m. Here’s how Monday’s action went down: Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) CONNER 2, BEECHWOOD 0 The Cougars put an end to Beechwood’s four-year reign on the region, denying the Tigers a chance at a fifth straight region title. Conner rode Aaron Wichmann to victory, the senior hurler pitching a complete game, three-hit shutout as he struck out eight and walked four in 99 pitches. Wichmann got 10 outs via a fly ball and kept the Tigers hitters off-balance for the majority as Beechwood had runners in scoring position only twice all game. “My breaking stuff I got over, they threw their hands at it and I get outs,” Wichmann said. “Just being efficient early in the count. The fastball was working pretty well and blew it by them and got ahead early in the counts.” Brady Bushman’s home run in the top of the sixth inning broke the scoreless tie, taking a 1-0 pitch just over the right center field wall. Bushman had struck out in his prior two at-bats, the home run the first of his varsity career. “I was sitting fastball the whole time,” Bushman said. “The prior at-bat I watched a fastball go right down the middle and I was mad after that. So after that one fastball I was sitting on the whole time, I decided to turn on it and it went pretty far and felt good off the bat.” Wichmann helped his own cause in the same inning, his sacrifice fly to left scoring Rex Richter as the Cougars manufactured the insurance run with Richter drawing a walk, stealing second, advancing to third on a groundout and scoring on Wichmann’s fly ball to left. “You could feel the tension as the innings went on,” Cougars coach Mike Hart said. “It was like who was going to flinch first. Aaron has been our guy and he loves that role. I like to call him our bulldog and he loves that role of getting the ball, putting the team on our shoulders and let’s go.” Conner had struggled leading up to this one, losing 15 of their last 18, but eight of those losses came by three runs or less. “We’ve prepared for this. The schedule we played, all the close games we’ve played and we’ve played some really good teams down the stretch,” Hart said. “We may not have come out on top in those games, but it made us better and built some confidence in knowing we could play some of the top teams in the state. It was time for us to breakthrough on one and it was a great time to do it.” Chase Flaherty was just as good on the bump in defeat for the Tigers, pitching a complete-game two-hitter as he struck out nine and walked four on 103 pitches. “Chase had a great year for us. This was his first loss of the season. He didn’t deserve to lose, you give up two hits and kid just hit a good shot,” Tigers coach Kevin Gray said. “When you don’t score and get any opportunities to bunt guys over that’s what happens.” The Tigers just couldn’t get much going offensively as they loaded the bases in the bottom of the second and thought they had a runner at third in the bottom of the fifth, but Carson Welch was called out at second for apparently leaving early on a fly ball to left and tagging up. “Only had one runner get to third,” Gray said. “You have to tip your cap, he kept us off balance. We prepared for him for four days and sometimes when they pitch that well, it’s hard to get guys on.” You’d have to go back to 2017 the last time the Tigers lost in the first round of the region tournament. The future is still bright in Fort Mitchell as they graduate six seniors, but return eight of the 10 players that started in Monday’s contest. “We got a good core coming back and they’re ready to get back to work tomorrow,” Gray said. “We haven’t had this feeling in a while. I thought it was incredible when Highlands did it (won four straight from 2015-18). Winning this region one year is hard, but to do it four years in a row is incredible. It’s a feeling we don’t like, but it’s baseball and that’s the way it is.” Conner will face the Dixie Heights-Newport Central Catholic winner on Wednesday at 5 p.m. DIXIE HEIGHTS VS NEWPORT CENTRAL CATHOLIC, 1 P.M.

        "content": "Juicy and sweet seasonal peaches are a great base for a standalone dish. It can be very nutritious and healthy and is ideal for breakfast. It is especially tasty to fill the fruit with granola – this combination will give you energy for the whole day or even become a dessert for guests. The idea of making baked peaches with granola was published on the Instagram page of food blogger Inna Levenets ( inna_levenets ). Ingredients: Method of preparation: 1. Cut off the top part of the peaches – the lid. Carefully cut out the \"cup\" with a knife, take out the seeds and pulp, and leave about half a centimeter of the wall. 2. Cut the peach flesh into cubes, throw it into a saucepan with a thick bottom, and add butter and sugar with cinnamon. And keep it on low heat until the peaches are soft. 3. Divide the peaches from the saucepan among the three \"cups\" and put the granola on top of them. 4. Put the \"cups\" in the oven for 10-12 minutes at 180 degrees. It is very convenient to bake peaches in a muffin tin. 5. Serve the finished peaches with yogurt, ice cream, and caramel topping.",

Aaron Agbaya Herrera, SMS Richie Ledesma Yuayan, SSg Henry Mascariña Mago, Cpl.Rainier Reyes Zaballa, Cpl. Allan Daluz Abdon, Cpl. Wilson Peñaverde Bantilan, Cpl. Rene John Martinez Bartolata and SSg. Junar Cabuyao Cabalsa.In her complaint, Rianzales recounted that around 3.15 a.m. on Friday, she was awakened by loud banging on her door as unidentified armed men wearing dark clothes and masks kicked at her door until it gave in.The armed men then barged into her unlocked bedroom, identified themselves as policemen and pointed their guns at her.The operatives, apparently, were looking for Jonathan, the live-in partner of Rianzales.When asked where Jonathan is, Rianzales said he is not home but at work in Laguna.The policemen searched the rest of the house and left when they could not find Jonathan.Rianzales, who was with her two grandchildren inside the house at that time, said she counted five men who entered her house and later learned there were three more posted outside.After around 30 minutes, Rianzales sought the help of Armando Paderon who accompanied her to the police station to report the incident.While she was giving the investigator her statement, Rianzales was informed that a police drug operation was scheduled in her barangay by intelligence personnel on the same day.When the operatives were presented to her, she recognized the armed men who harassed her by the build of their bodies and other bodily marks.Upon learning of the men's identity, Rianzales immediately filed complaints against them.The eight police intelligence personnel are now detained at the Lucena PNP temporary lockup facility while cases were filed against them on Friday. They were also inquested on the same day.Lucena police chief LtCol. Reynaldo Reyes was also relieved of his post on the same day and was replaced by LtCol. William Angway as officer in charge.",

        "content": "INEOS are \"convinced\" Manchester United and Nice will both be allowed to compete in the Europa League next season. Erik ten Hag's side qualified for the competition by winning the FA Cup on Saturday. 1 Ineos are confident Manchester United and Nice will both be allowed to play in the Europa League Credit: Alamy But Nice, who are owned by Ineos, also booked their place in the Europa League by finishing fifth in Ligue Un. However Ineos, who own a 27.5 per cent stake in United , are confident both clubs will be allowed to feature following talks with Uefa. Ineos issued a statement which read: “We are aware of the position of the two clubs and we are in direct dialogue with UEFA. \"We are convinced that we have a solution for next season in Europe.\" There were fears the Red Devils could be bumped down to the Europa Conference League as Nice finished higher in their respective league, with United coming eighth in the Premier League. But United appear to have reached an agreement with Uefa as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's stake is less than the 30 per cent threshold for multi-club ownership rules to apply. However Ineos' stake reportedly includes a plan to invest a further £245m for infrastructure works which would take their ownership to more than 30 per cent. Passing this threshold would put Ineos in violation of ownership rules and force one of the teams to be relegated to the Conference League.

Article 5.01 b. of the Uefa regulations states no individual \"may simultaneously be involved, either directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition.\" This would have seen United being booted out of European football entirely. Man Utd set to battle Arsenal for transfer of £35m wonderkid, 18, team-mates call 'best youngster they've seen' Fortunately for them, in March Uefa relaxed its rules on multi-club ownership ahead of the 2024/25 season. And Article 5.04 now says a club that is replaced in one competition \"may still be admitted to another UEFA club competition (i.e. in descending order: UEFA Europa League or UEFA Conference League) to which the relevant national association has access”. Earlier this season, Brighton and Aston Villa were only allowed to play in Uefa competitions when their owners reduced their stakes in clubs on the continent to under 30 per cent.",

Yuma County Sheriff’s officials said 47-year-old Jason Bradley Martin remains jailed on suspicion of arson, criminal damage and other charges. They announced Saturday night that Martin was identified as a suspect in the case and taken into custody. The county’s jail website didn’t list an attorney for Martin as of Sunday. The wildfire was reported around 2 p.m. Saturday in the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge, which was established in 1941 to protect 30 miles (48 kilometers) of mostly wetland habitat along the Lower Colorado River. Authorities said the blaze was 20% contained after burning nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) of vegetation along the Arizona side of the Colorado River in Yuma County. Multiple agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and federal Bureau of Land Management, responded to the scene to assist firefighting crews Saturday.",

        "content": "U.Today - Ethereum is finally showing what it is capable of after rumors of the preapproval of the Ethereum ETF have spread around the crypto circle. For now, the price is getting ready for a swing toward or above $4,000, but its true strength is yet to be shown. Ethereum has been seen in an uptrend that recently broke through $3,900. Currently, ETH is trading around $3,898, showing a gain of 1.92%, and the upsurge is supported well by swift trading volumes. The technical indicators are aligning to suggest further upward movement. The 50-day EMA stands near $3,225, while the 100-day EMA lies close to $3,175. Both moving averages have provided strong support and confirmed the current trend. In addition, the RSI is at 72, which means that, at the moment, ETH is slightly overbought. Yet, this is not critical and, therefore, in case of a minor overheating, the asset can continue to grow a bit higher. Two major price targets have emerged for Ethereum: the immediate level now seems to be that psychological $4,000. Anything lower would imply the prevalent bearish sentiment confirmed at the moment. This will most probably see buyers join in and push the price even higher or, in other words, liquidate some substantial amount of short orders. As for the liquidation heatmap: at the time, there was a huge cumulative long liquidation leverage all the way down to $3,200, meaning there were $3 billion worth of longs open — theoretically meaning there might be a massive sell-off in the case of liquidation. More than $1 billion in short orders get closed if the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market surges, causing a squeeze and sending bears away.

        "content": "Regina has been home to many Canadian aviation firsts including the first licensed pilot, aircraft and airfield. Now, the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan is seeking information about another possible aviation first – a 1929 marriage in an aircraft. Archivists going through photos at the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan have found one of a wedding party standing next to an aircraft at the Regina airport in 1929. Written across the bottom is a caption that reads, “First wedding performed in the air in Canada.” Leanne Tremblay, an outreach coordinator for the archives, said the team was able to gather some information on the photo. “We know who was married, we know who the pilot was, the reverend and even the bridesmaid but we did ask the public when we posted it on our social media platforms if they knew even more information,” she told CTV News. Download the CTV News app to get breaking news alerts sent to your device A number of amateur historians submitted newspaper clippings that documented the 25 minute flight over Regina. The bride and groom standing in the photo were Howard Robinson of Regina and Muriel James of Chaplin, Sask. “They kind of set off and flew above the legislative buildings in Wascana Park and that the actual wedding and the official kind of “I Do’s” took place above the RCMP Depot,” Tremblay explained. Regina is already known for many firsts in Canadian aviation including the first licensed airfield, pilot and aircraft. Now the first airplane wedding be added to the list. “Written on the photo here it says the first in Canada but I wouldn’t be surprised if someone wanted to contest that,” Tremblay added. “It would be hard to confirm.” The Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan would like to know for sure and is seeking more information about the couple and whether this in fact was the first marriage in the sky over Canada.",

        "description": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has criticised a “siloed” approach to disability services and problems in Ireland as he encouraged local authorities to help solve the housing crisis.",
        "content": "At the launch of his party’s local and European manifesto in Dublin, Mr Harris said that he was “sick and tired of the national pass the parcel” in relation to disability services in Ireland. He said Fine Gael would promote a universal design approach for travel and playgrounds and invest in sensory spaces in libraries. “Parents don’t care, children don’t care about it, I don’t care about who does the job – we just need to get it done,” he said. He also said that housing was “the defining societal issue” in Ireland and went beyond a crisis to an “inter-generational anxiety”. He called for a review of the bulk purchase of houses by institutional investors. “I’m pleased with a number of the measures the housing minister and the finance minister have brought in, I think they’ve been good, I think they’ve been effective, but I don’t think we can close our ears in relation to this.” He also said local authorities would be “held to account” for their housing delivery, and said it was “about time every part of the public service puts their shoulder to the wheel”. Asked about the comments afterwards, Mr Harris said: “I don’t say this to be critical, but there isn’t a consistency in relation to the delivery of housing across the country. “And I don’t say that to be critical, the reason I make that point is because sometimes there can be blockages. So this is not about local government and national government having a spat here.” He said he wanted to know if there were “blockages” or resourcing issues behind why some local authorities take longer than others to “turn a vacant property into a home for a family”. He added: “I don’t want to be blaming anybody, nor them blaming us, but I want every arm of this state to work together because what I can tell you, seven weeks as Taoiseach, I am concerned genuinely about the siloed approach that is taken to problems in this country. “I have huge respect for our public servants, I described them as the best in the world today at the National Economic Dialogue, that is my view. But I do sometimes think there can be ‘that’s a matter for somebody else’, ‘that’s a matter for that agency’. The public are sick and tired of that. “I have a very low threshold in terms of tolerance for that. I want to fix housing once and for all and I want everyone to play their part in that.”",

I’m a fit guy of 36 and I work out at a boxing gym. My mate is 51 and he is a boxing coach. He’s been a friend of mine for ten years and I have great respect for him. He lost his driving licence recently due to having some sort of epileptic fit. We were all there for him and supported him. His wife is 40 and she’s been finding it difficult to get around as they live in a village with little public transport and she hadn’t ever learned to drive. Now they need her to learn, so they can use their car again. My friend asked me if I could take her out to practise driving at weekends and I was happy to oblige. Get in touch with the Dear Deidre team Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors. Fill out and submit our easy-to-use and confidential form and the Dear Deidre team will get back to you. You can also send a private message on the DearDeidreOfficial Facebook page or email us at: deardeidre@the-sun.co.uk We’d been out for a couple of lessons when she hit a rabbit in the road one evening. She was so shaken up I got her to pull over. My reassuring hug suddenly turned into a passionate kiss. We were both pretty hot under the collar and so when she suggested we go to a quieter area, and then pulled into a layby, I couldn’t help myself. We had sex in the back seat — it wasn’t the longest session I’ve had but it was the most intense. Afterwards she told me my mate hadn’t had sex with her for weeks because he’s been worried any excitement would bring on another seizure. We’ve had sex three times since, during her weekly lessons. I feel really bad but can’t help myself. MORE FROM DEAR DEIDRE DEIDRE'S STORIES Connor's controlling girlfriend finds out he's at the park DEAR DEIDRE My mummy's boy husband is a love rat & has been cheating since she passed away DEIDRE SAYS: This arrangement doesn’t sit well with you, or you wouldn’t have written in. I’m afraid you’re paying lip service to “respecting” your friend. While he’s been worrying about his health, you’ve been betraying him. You may not have been the instigator but you’ve enjoyed every moment. Encourage this woman to help your friend and get clear support from his doctor. Tell her that you aren’t comfortable taking advantage of a friend’s wife and do the decent thing and end it. If you don’t, you stand to lose this friend altogether and potentially other friends along the way. My support pack called Your Lover Not Free explains the pitfalls about these sorts of relationships. Dear Deidre: Cheating and can you get over it",

        "content": "Former senator representing Abia South Senatorial district in the ninth National Assembly, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has called for renewed reading culture and discipline of children to avoid the consequences of lack of knowledge and indiscipline. Senator Abaribe made this appeal in Abuja during the launch of five books written by Dr. Titilayo Kayode-Alabi in commemoration with this year’s Children’s Day celebration. He said; “I don’t think it is just for the child , it is also our responsibility to make sure that books of this nature get to the child and the child reads. “What is happening is that parents do not have time for their children, parents tend to have the teacher take responsibility for the child, not knowing that every parent has a responsibly to the child, we are encouraging every parent to do what is going on here today, give the children what will excite them, what will shape their thinking. “It is us, parents, that the children emulate , if you do something bad and think the children don’t know, they know , if you set the right footstep the child will take the footstep. “If the child is going wrong and you correct him, the child will know that doing right or wrong. And parents should not pamper their children , you must correct the child properly. “There is even a phrase in the Bible that say should not spare the rod for the child, because if you do so, you are going to reap the consequences later, the country will reap the consequences of a bad upbringing of a child, so what Dr Titi has done here is very wonderful, five books for children leading to moral regeneration within our children is wonderful, so we congratulate her.” Dr Titilayo Kayode-Alabi said she wrote the five books ‘Father’s Tiny Little Brother ‘, ‘Skunny’s Perfect Holiday ‘, We Do Not Like The New Ugly Ducks! Do we?’ ‘Aduke The Pregnant Girl ‘, ‘Somtochukwu And Dawn, The Medi-Fairy’ because she loves to read and as well push African heritage and culture to children for moral regeneration. “As a child, I loved to read a lot, I saw a lot written by the Westerners and it gave me that impression of Western culture compared to the African, growing I saw content created on witchcraft to even LGBQ and I thought that it is high time we began to create our content, to show our children our own story, our own culture, our heritage. “As a medical doctor, I see a lot of children and I noticed that when you tell them what they need to know, they are able to make something in their head, in their decision, in their choices that impact the outcome of their health, I said I work in Nyanya hospital, I have limited contact with children, why not broaden my reach? If I started to write and tell medical stories in a way that empowers them to make decisions concerning health. “I reach more children with my books, besides just writing and inviting people and the media to promote, the other is, I’m contact hoping these books can get ministry of education so that they can bring these into curriculum so that children more in number will read them.”",

The artist and designer joined forces with Watford Borough Council in 2020 to re-imagine the chapel at Vicarage Road Cemetery into a creative space where artists can originate and exhibit their work. That will continue but Amma, who moved to Watford from East London approaching 15 years ago, has been seeking a more central location in the town to reach more people. After speaking to the shopping centre management, a proposal was accepted and she has taken on a lease for the Gallery area on Level One, next to Palace car park. Amma Gyan in the House of Amma in the Gallery \"It's always been the Gallery but it's never been fully occupied as such,\" she said. \"I think the centre manager's very experience-driven and wanted to make the most of it. Art and all things creative is one of the ways you can do that because it's different and it changes. \"I think it was fortunate that I'd had the chapel so I had a bit of a track record of doing something similar that had been received well.\" Amma has taken the rooms at...

        "content": "It's probably no secret that the former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, has a warm relationship with his wife Olena, who has been married to him for over 20 years. Many Ukrainians are touched by the romantic nature of the \"iron man\", and a new selfie with his beloved is proof of this. In the latest photo, which has more than 43 thousand likes on Facebook , the couple looks happy. The retired general's subscribers pelted him with compliments in the comments. Therefore, OBOZ.UA decided to recall other photos of the Zaluzhnyis family, which show that true love is timeless. As the former commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine previously wrote, his wife is the closest person to him. So, on her birthday, Zaluzhnyi wrote a post where he talked about his crazy love, which has already withstood more than 20 years of marriage. \"I can't imagine how much patience, courage, and wisdom it takes to be there for me. Even when I didn't believe in myself, you believed in me and supported me. All I have and all I have achieved is you. Thank you for the air, for the heartbeat, and for the dreams that come true. Happy birthday, my love,\" he wrote. Not much is known about the \"iron general's\" chosen one. Before the full-scale war of the Russian Federation, she worked as a financier in a bank, but there is no information on whether she kept her job. Olena and her husband used to go on hiking trips around Ukraine. The couple is raising two children: Khrystyna and Arina. The older one is a soldier in the Kyiv garrison, and the younger one plans to become a doctor and is studying in Odesa at a medical institute. Only verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber . Do not fall for fakes!",

        "description": "IPL 2024: Everything that this season taught us – from a new style of batting to the ramifications with new rules.",
        "content": "What will be the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season remembered for? Recency bias might suggest the closely-contested matches it produced, or the underdog stories. Beyond the prima facie observations, however, the tournament was all about debunking narratives, as it taught us some consequential lessons, which could shape how the format, the tournament, and also the Indian cricket team , will transition from here onwards. Here are what we learned from IPL 2024: ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD 1. Adios Anchors, Make Way for the New Template IPL 2024: The likes of Jake Fraser-McGurk have established a new template for T20 batting. (Photo: BCCI) Two decades since its inception, the shortest format of the game has gone through a metamorphosis. The ideal T20 template – a phrase used in every debate across the Indian cricketing circles since the 2022 T20 World Cup – has been entrenched, and it has no provision for the now-anachronistic terms like ‘anchor,’ ‘holding the fort’ and ‘calculative cricket.’ The new format is all about being uninhibited with the bat, unceasingly attacking the bowlers. To contextualise – in the first 16 editions of the tournament, where 1032 matches were played, we witnessed only a couple of 250+ scores. In this edition, that barrier has been traversed an astonishing eight times in 74 matches. . @delhicapitals ' Flying Powerplay ð¤© Fraser-McGurk increases the temperature with some explosive stroke play ð¥ Watch the match LIVE on @JioCinema and @StarSportsIndia ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #DCvMI pic.twitter.com/e2VdyReaPu — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 27, 2024 0 A total of 1260 sixes were hit, which outclassed the previous best figure of 1124 by a mile. 42 of those sixes were struck in the match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings, which happens to be the highest-ever figure in any T20 match. Notably, Punjab chased down a target of 262 runs in that match, which was the highest successful chase in this format. The match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad saw 549 runs being scored, which is the highest aggregate in a T20 match. That, however, is not all, for the pre-IPL highest aggregate (517) was surpassed on two other occasions – Kolkata Knight Riders vs Punjab Kings, and Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Mumbai Indians. Hyderabad’s score of 287/3 was also the highest ever by a team in any franchise league across the globe.

Albeit, it cannot be denied that the rule has had a role to play in the monstrosity we witnessed this year. Orange Cap winner Virat Kohli, who recorded his best-ever strike rate this year, admitted having an additional batter led to the transformation in his approach, but is not a proponent of the rule. I say it how it is. Entertainment is on one side, but never in my life have I seen a situation where bowlers think they will concede a four or a six every ball. Not every team has a Jasprit Bumrah, or a Rashid Khan, or a mystery bowler. So what will you do? I am telling you, one extra batter is the reason why I am playing with a 200-plus strike rate in the powerplay. I know there is a batsman coming in at number 8 as well. Virat Kohli Virat Kohli on impact player and the downfall of bowling in IPL pic.twitter.com/GPHCBsI3VS — Agnik (@lordkohli18) May 20, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD This is one facet of the criticism of the rule. The other, and perhaps, more consequential facet, is that it has completely stagnated the development of potential all-rounders for the Indian cricket team. Consider Shivam Dube’s example as a case study. He already has 8 T20I wickets and 46 T20 wickets to his name, but since the impact player rule was introduced, has only bowled a solitary over. Among the reasons why KKR found it justifiable to retain Venkatesh Iyer ahead of Shubman Gill prior to the 2022 mega auction was the former’s all-round skills, with Iyer picking up three wickets in IPL 2021. He also made it to the Indian team and picked up five wickets. Since the rule was implemented, however, he has bowled only one over like Dube, with the teams no longer requiring jacks of all trades. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Speaking on this, Indian captain Rohit Sharma told on the Club Prairie Podcast: I am not a big fan of impact substitute rule. It is going to hold all-rounders back. Eventually, cricket is played by 11 players, not 12 players. You are taking out so much from the game to make it entertaining for people around. If you look just from the cricketing aspect of it I feel guys like Shivam Dube and Washington Sundar aren't getting to bowl, which for us is not a good thing. Rohit Sharma ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Crores of Rupees Down the Drain? You Better Think Again IPL 2024: Eyebrows were raised when KKR signed Mitchell Starc for Rs 24.75 crore, but in the end, it was all worth it. (Photo: BCCI) The IPL 2024 auction saw more eyebrows being raised than paddles, with a few preposterous price tags floating around. Pat Cummins was the first cricketer who broke the record for the highest-ever bid, as Sunrisers Hyderabad spent Rs 20.50 for his services. Cummins might have the honour of being called the World Cup-winning captain for eternity, albeit the honour of being IPL’s most expensive cricketer lasted only a few minutes. The abdication took place when Kolkata Knight Riders spent Rs 24.75 crores on Cummins’ Australian teammate, Mitchell Starc. The general consensus on 19 December 2024 was that the Sunrisers and the Knight Riders have all but lost their rationale, and have committed to almighty blunders. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Six months down the line, those two teams competed in the final. With his 18 wickets, and his excellent leadership, Cummins led the Hyderabad resurgence, taking the last-placed team of IPL 2023 to second in the standings. Starc, meanwhile, had a difficult start to his life in purple and gold. Yet, considering the way he bowled in the second half of the competition – ending up with 17 wickets, and delivering arguably the ball of the tournament in the final – it seemed that he had taken co-owner Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Haar kar jeetne waalon ko Baazigar kehte hain’ a bit too seriously.

That, with teams deploying analysts and strategists like Nathan Leamon and Gaurav Sundaraman, it is likely that they know what they are doing. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Pace-Bowling All-Rounder – Found. Power-Hitting Finisher – Found. IPL 2024: Nitish Reddy could be the pace-bowling all-rounder India are looking for. (Photo: BCCI) An uncontested prior to IPL 2024 was that India lacked youngsters for two specific roles – a pace-bowling all-rounder, and a power-hitting finisher. Let’s consider the former first. The ‘Who after Hardik Pandya?’ question has been doing rounds in the Indian cricketing circuit for a while now, with answers being only names without any corroboration. But this edition saw the emergence of a certain Nitish Reddy – the 21-year-old all-rounder from Andhra, who won the Emerging Player of the Season award. Not only did he score 303 runs at a strike rate of 142.92, but Reddy also scalped three wickets in the limited bowling opportunities he was provided with.

The presumed lack of a power-hitting Indian finisher sparked bidding wars whenever Shahrukh Khan came to auction, for he was among the rare cricketers to fit the bill. That list has had new additions, with arguably the most prominent among those being Ashutosh Sharma. The Punjab Kings batter scored 189 runs at a strike rate of 167.25, including a 28-ball 61 against Mumbai. Another player on this list, albeit comparatively older, is Ramandeep Singh. The Kolkata Knight Riders batter scored 125 runs at a strike rate of 201.61, including an unbeaten 6-ball 25 against Lucknow Super Giants.

(Photo: BCCI) Barring the Virat Kohli-led team of 2008, the 2018 batch was contestably the most proficient Indian U-19 team, considering the panache and flair with which they blew away every single opponent who stood in their way. It seemed that the majority of those players will represent the nation in the years to come, albeit, only Shubman Gill has managed to carve his identity. But when India take on Zimbabwe for a five-match T20I series in July, expect a couple of Gill’s teammates to debut in blue, in Abhishek Sharma and Riyan Parag. ð toð half-centuries for Riyan Parag He continues his good form with the bat ðð Watch the match LIVE on @JioCinema and @StarSportsIndia ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #MIvRR | @rajasthanroyals pic.twitter.com/tAnDaCghYm — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 1, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD The former had an excellent campaign in 2022, but the foundation for escalation slipped from under his feet when he could only score 226 runs last season. This year, however, Abhishek was among the standout performers, scoring 484 runs at a strike rate of 204.22 – the highest among players with 350+ runs. Parag’s case is slightly different, for despite making his IPL debut way back in 2019, he had never really established himself. Having scored 600 runs in the first five seasons, he has quietened the sceptics with a 573-run season, at an average of 52.09. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Questions on Umpiring Standards IPL 2024: The umpiring standard this season has raised questions. (Photo: BCCI) Considering this tournament is called the Indian Premier League, it is only right that over 80% of the umpires are Indians – 17 among 21. However, the standard on display this season has sparked questions. There were plenty of controversial decisions across the 74 matches, despite having the assistance of technology. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), alongside the players and coaches, will be hoping for a better show from the umpires next season.

        "content": "The midfielder was not part of David Moyes’ plans for the 2023/24 season and it was decided that the 25-year-old would gain more experience in England’s second division. Downes helped the Saints achieve promotion to the Premier League and was impressive in the play-off final against Leeds on Sunday. Downes featured in 37 games for Southampton this season, scoring two goals and providing a further three assists; however, it was the Englishman’s overall performances that have impressed Saints fans. Many supporters would have been hoping to keep the midfielder at St Mary’s Stadium for their return to the Premier League, but West Ham may have dropped some hints that he will be returning to London. Southampton are believed to have a in Downes’ loan deal, but the Hammers may well keep the 25-year-old. West Ham hint at Flynn Downes’ return According to , West Ham have dropped hints that Downes will be returning to the Premier League club for the 2024/25 campaign. In an article on the after Southampton’s play-off victory on Sunday, the East London outfit made a point of clearly stating it was the end of the 25-year-old’s time with the Saints. On four separate occasions, West Ham referenced the fact the game represented the end of the player’s loan deal. It is uncertain if Downes will have a big role to play under Julen Lopetegui next season but the midfielder could be a solid squad player throughout the campaign.",

        "content": "New Plymouth boss Wayne Rooney has promised to give the club’s young players a chance to follow in his footsteps and make their names as teenagers. Rooney, who burst on to the Premier League scene as a 16-year-old at Everton, has been handed the reins at Home Park less than five months after losing his job at Birmingham.

Asked about his management style, the 38-year-old told Argyle TV: “Obviously I had my playing career, which I loved, but if you want to go into management, you quite quickly have to move on from there. Advertisement “I’ve put a lot of work in, a lot of time in to try to develop myself as a coach, try to improve, try to get better, and I want to be a coach who helps players, helps teams, develops players, academy players. Advertisement “Academy players are really important as well, to try to improve them, because I was a player who came into the first team at 16. I think a lot of young players are good enough, but maybe don’t get the chance, so I’ve got a real passion for that as well.” Rooney, who acknowledged his journey to Plymouth via spells at Derby, DC United and Birmingham had its challenges, is excited about the latest phase of his career, which will see him link up once again with the club’s director of football Neil Dewsnip. Advertisement Plymouth director of football Neil Dewsnip. Photo: Steven Paston/PA. Dewsnip was the head of Everton’s academy who eased him through the ranks and the pair will now work together to plot the way forward for Argyle. Rooney, who admitted the two men had not seen each other for around 10 years until Birmingham played at Plymouth in December last year, said: “Of course with Neil’s role at the club and my role at the club, it’s going to have to be a daily basis I’m speaking to Neil now. “I think ultimately the important thing in that is we’re both trying to do the right thing, we both want the right thing, we’re both on the same wavelength now to make sure the club moves forward on players coming into the football club, style of play, how we want to move forward.

        "content": "Nigerian banks appear poised for another round of losses as investors continue to weigh their options regarding the impending bank recapitalization plans. The NGX Banking Index fell sharply at the end of last week, shedding a whopping 7.35%, one of the worst weekly performances this year. Aside from Stanbic IBTC, all the major banking stocks posted losses, with UBA, FBN Holdings, and ETI shedding 12%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. UBA and Zenith Bank closed the week at a year-low of N19.2 and N30, respectively. A worried investor opined, “The Central Bank recapitalization policy has decimated bank stocks. How can they raise N3 trillion at these valuations? Investors are spooked, and I doubt the capital raise will be successful.” Month-to-date, banking stocks are down 5.29%, 28.77% for the quarter, and 18.26% year-to-date. This is a stark contrast to the end of the first quarter of the year when banking stocks were up 14.76%. Banks like Access Holdings are trading below their earnings per share, delivering a price-to-earnings multiple of 0.837x. UBA, with a price-to-earnings multiple of 0.96x, is also trading below its earnings per share. Zenith Bank, which is trading at its year low, has a borderline 1x multiple to its earnings. READ ALSO: UBA leads as banks generate N425bn from e-transactions in 2023 The sell-offs are all the more remarkable when you consider the massive profits being declared by Nigerian banks and the record amount of dividends being paid. However, it appears investors are more concerned about the spate of rights issues planned by commercial banks as they struggle to meet their banking recapitalization targets. Most banks have announced plans for rights issues, which many investors view as a major first step toward achieving their recapitalization goals. Investors with knowledge of the situation opine that the strategy of raising capital via rights issues may be the major reason why the share prices are depressed. Rights issues are typically capital raises that only allow existing shareholders to exercise their rights by purchasing the shares of the company. This suggests that a lower share price might be favourable to insiders, especially those with majority control, even though it could lead to the creation of more shares. READ ALSO: CBN directs banks to suspend charges on deposits For example, for Access Corporation to raise N300 billion via a rights issue, it would have to sell 18 billion shares at the current share price of N16.4 versus just 10 billion shares if it sold at its year high of N30 per share. However, this means investors will pay nearly twice the current share price of N16.24. Most rights issues are also priced at a discount to their current share price, even as existing regulations do not require the trading of the stock to be suspended. This suggests the rights issue price could initially be lower than the current share price. Another reason given by some analysts is the amount of dividends declared by most banks, which have been in record figures. For example, Zenith Bank declared about N100.4 billion in dividends in 2023 compared to N125.5 billion declared this year already. GTCO also declared N94 billion this year versus N91 billion a year earlier. UBA also declared N95 billion in dividends this year versus N37.6 billion reported a year earlier. Fidelity Bank, which plans to raise about N370 billion, also declared dividends of N27.2 billion this year versus N22.4 billion in 2023. This perhaps explains why bank share prices have plummeted in recent weeks and could fall further as the rights issue dates are confirmed and selling prices revealed. READ ALSO: U.S. bankrolling creation of deadlier, more contagious bird flu strains Most analysts also suggest some of the dividend payouts may be reinvested in the company by the beneficiaries in the form of subscribing to their rights issues. Just last week, the chairman of UBA, Tony Elumelu, promised to invest his entire dividend in the rights issue. Most bank majority shareholders are expected to do the same. While this benefits the market, especially retail investors, the adjustments of share price following dividend payments also add to the pressure on their share price as they achieve lower lows. One other concern some investors have is that most bank stocks are not just experiencing a price decimation, but they are also doing this at a higher volume of trade, which suggests even lower prices. For example, FBNH traded 20.4 million shares on Friday at a lower price close. Zenith Bank, UBA, and ETI also experienced a similar trend. For instance, ETI recorded a volume of 554.9 million shares on Friday at a closing price of N21.65, compared to the previous day’s volume of just 347,214 shares at N24.05. This suggests there are likely more sellers in the market than buyers.",

        "description": "The council law is being reviewed to address the existing loopholes in governing the maritime sector.The post Tajudeen, Oyetola, others back review of shippers’ council law appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives , Abbas Tajudeen, and the Minister of Blue Economy, Gboyega Oyetola, have expressed support for the repeal and enactment of the Shippers’ Council and Economic Regulatory Bill. Messrs Tajudeen and Oyetola backed the bill on Monday at the public hearing organised by the House Committees on Shipping Services, Ports and Harbours, Maritime Safety, Education, and Administration. The repeal and enactment bill seeks to address the loopholes in the existing law which governs the maritime sector. According to its synopsis, the bill seeks to create a robust economic regulatory framework that prevents unfair practices, promotes fair pricing, and encourages competition. It also seeks to protect the interests of both service providers and users by ensuring transparency and accountability in the imposition of tariffs and charges, as well as automate and digitalise cargo-related processes to align with international best practices. Mr Tajudeen, represented by a member of the House, Sada Soli (APC, Katsina), said the bill would create an enabling environment for investors to invest in the maritime sector with their investments guaranteed. The speaker said the mandate of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council has evolved significantly from its original role as a protector of shippers’ interests, noting that “it has now become the economic regulator of the entire Nigerian port system, a responsibility that extends beyond the Nigerian Ports Authority.” PREMIUM TIMES delivers fact-based journalism for Nigerians, by Nigerians — and our community of supporters, the readers who donate, make our work possible.

Mr Tajudeen said the bill is critical to ensure the Nigerian Shippers’ Council performs in its expanded role. “To effectively fulfil its expanded mandate as the Port Economic Regulator, it is imperative, therefore, that the necessary legislative bill is passed. This bill will formally empower the Council, providing it with the authority and tools required to oversee and manage the economic activities within Nigerian ports, ensuring efficiency, fairness, and competitiveness across the sector,” he said. On his part, Mr Oyetola, while canvassing the need to establish the regulatory agency, said the bill would improve the nation’s economy. The minister, represented by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Oloruntola Olufemi, said it would be a welcome development if the bill became an Act. The Chairperson of the Shipping Line Association of Nigeria, Boma Alabi, however, raised concerns about some specific parts of the bill and called for the intervention of the lawmakers. She said the association had already raised some of the clauses with the committee. She said the association is ready to back any measure that will improve efficiency, lower cost, and reduce the bottleneck in the sector, but some of the clauses leave room for abuse. “We must be more efficient, and we welcome this regulatory agency that will be created to make things more efficient. “We have expressed our concern internally and externally, and this committee, which has been involved in this process, must work on some areas of concern.

        "description": "The Dolphins' star receiver had some playful jabs to dish out to Wes Welker over the weekend.",
        "content": "Back in January, the marched into Arrowhead in the Wild Card round of the playoffs after blowing a massive lead in the AFC East. The team had lost ten straight games when kickoff occurred in sub-40 degree temperatures before that game. Unfortunately, their streak continued as the handled them with ease, 26-7, in one of the . Despite leading the team with five receptions and 62 receiving yards, as well as scoring the team's lone touchdown in the loss, star receiver was for his lackluster performance (relative to his regular season success). Wide receivers coach Wes Welker has been working closely with Hill this offseason, and it's clear the rapport between them has grown. When prompted by a Twitter post, Hill joked that Welker's reputation had exceeded his actual production while in the NFL. Hill's post is all in good fun, as earlier this offseason that Welker deserved more offensive coordinator and head coaching interview. If Welker's tutelage can help arguably the league's best wide receiver get even better, opportunities for those gigs will come knocking soon. Welker: Hill Has \"Separated Himself\" From WR Pack Hill is , and it's a scary thought to imagine that he could improve even further. Yet, he and Welker appear hellbent on making that happen. In an of the Palm Beach Post, Welker had lofty praise for Hill, calling him a complete receiver, and even going so far as to compare him to Hall of Fame receiver (and Welker's former teammate) Randy Moss: \"Randy Moss was the best deep ball receiver in the game. Tyreek Hill runs the whole route tree. Name a route he can't run. How he approaches every day and every game is very impressive. That's where he separates himself.\" Hill's marks of 7.4 receptions and 112.4 yards per game were both near the top of the league last year (the latter stat led the NFL), and he's somehow become even more dominant since the fateful trade that sent him from Kansas City to Miami. Outside of maybe , it's hard to make the case for any receiver currently in the league over Hill. He's wholly dominant as a vertical target, and he's proven to be more than adept at filling the traditional possession x-receiver role in recent years. After not eclipsing more than 87 catches in any of his first five seasons in the league, he's gone over 110 receptions in each of the last three. Over the last two seasons, Hill has finished top-ten in MVP voting and top-five in Offensive Player of the Year voting. He is the first wideout to accomplish that feat since Jerry Rice in 1994 and 1995. Welker, Hill and the Dolphins must now attempt to regroup despite this offseason. Due to salary cap issues, some of the franchise's biggest faces and personalities, such as and , were forced out of South Beach. The good news is that all six players who earned for the Dolphins last year - , Raheem Mostert, , Alec Ingold, Terron Armstead, and Jalen Ramsey - are returning for the 2024 season. The team also just on receiver Jaylen Waddle and edge rusher Jaelan Phillips, which should keep the core of the team in place for a little while longer. There's still time for the team to earn its first playoff victory since 2000, especially as long as McDaniel is calling the plays for the league's most prolific offense (NFL-leading 401.3 yards per game in 2023). If Hill somehow continues to improve while working with Welker, then the Dolphins may be truly unguardable come next season.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4. The match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout. Nadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat. His three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Carol Thompson, The Detroit News, The Detroit News A pair of federal fish experts braced themselves as they cradled a hulking fish over the side of their boat just north of the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge. Its kick would be strong enough to unhorse a novice angler, but the duo had performed this routine 31 times in a handful of weeks and were on pace to do it maybe a hundred more before the season's end. Still, it felt like a lucky catch. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Gibraltar-based lake sturgeon team had been out all day without finding much more than a mudpuppy. It was early May, and by then, the water had reached above 50 degrees, warm enough that their targets were less likely to feed on the bits of round goby serving as bait. But finally, after pulling hundreds of empty hooks out of the Detroit River, they caught one. Into the tank he went, all 70 pounds and 5-plus feet of him, a fish that had sustained multiple sea lamprey bites and probably spent his near-50 years meandering the waterways that connect lakes Huron and Erie. He's far from alone. Throughout the Great Lakes, lake sturgeon populations have been decimated to approximately 1% of their historic numbers, but that's not the story in the Detroit and St. Clair rivers. Here, the species holds strong at about 30,000 fish. The rivers boast the most resilient lake sturgeon population in the Great Lakes basin. That's despite the legacy of industrialization that still impairs the two waterways. The Detroit and St. Clair rivers were contaminated by decades of sewage overflows, coal burning and industrial ooze. Their shorelines were hardened, lined with seawalls and factories. They are major thoroughfares for shipments of coal, salt and iron ore. Those actions swept away fish spawning habitat and damaged ecosystems. Still, the rivers' robust lake sturgeon numbers have become central to endeavors to rehabilitate the species throughout the Great Lakes. \"I've been working here for 14 years now, and people think 'the Detroit River? There's no fish there. Why are sturgeon there?'\" said Justin Chiotti, fish biologist for the Fish & Wildlife Service's Alpena conservation office's Detroit River Fish Laboratory in Gibraltar. \"But they don't see the thousands of people that are out here walleye fishing every day, don't see that this is home to the largest lake sturgeon population in the Great Lakes.\" The Gibraltar-based lake sturgeon team sets 700-foot lines targeting lake sturgeon throughout the Detroit River and checks them at least weekly through April and May. Some are set alongside natural areas, such as Fighting Island. Others are within clear sight of steel mills, factories and chemical waste sites. When they hook a sturgeon, the biologists pull it on board to collect data on its size, sex, age, injuries to help them understand more about the population's size, growth and trajectory. They also install tags used to monitor where the fish moves during its life, which likely will last longer than a biologist's career. Then, they return the fish to the water. Although the rivers maintained a sizeable lake sturgeon population throughout the industrial age, the species has benefited from a surge in attention and restoration planning, said Sheri Faust, executive director of Friends of the St. Clair River. That has largely been financed by the federal Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, launched in 2010. Since then, local groups have received millions of dollars for habitat restoration projects, including new artificial reefs aimed at providing more spawning habitat for sturgeon and other fish. \"The restoration work that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and Michigan DNR (Department of Natural Resources) have been doing for a decade, I think, is a testament to the success of this threatened and endangered species,\" Faust said. \"It's an example that can be modeled and replicated elsewhere to also protect and preserve lake sturgeon.\" As individuals, lake sturgeon are formidable. Adults typically grow between four and six feet long, weigh 30 to 80 pounds and live 50 to 100 years, although the largest and oldest can reach seven feet, 300 pounds and 150 years. They once were formidable as a collective, too, in numbers so great that lore says \"You could walk across the river\" on their backs, said Andrew Briggs, Michigan Department of Natural Resources fisheries research biologist. That wasn't just in the Great Lakes or big connecting channels like the Detroit, St. Clair or St. Mary's rivers, said Michael Kelly, director of the Virginia-based nonprofit Conservation Services' Great Lakes office, which is helping to finance restoration work in the Saginaw Bay river system. Lake sturgeon also thrived in tributaries such as the Saginaw River. \"At one time, these rivers were full of them,\" Kelly said. \"They've been around for 150 million years largely unchanged, but it's only in the last 200 years where they've run into problems. Coincidentally, it's only been 200 years since European settlers appeared on the scene. There's no question that mankind is to blame for the near extinction of this species.\" Logging, a primary Michigan industry in the late 19th century, crowded lake sturgeon out of their spawning habitats in Great Lakes tributaries. Loggers sent their harvest down rivers to mills. Along the way, the logs scoured river bottoms and eroded their banks, piling sediment over the rocks where sturgeon spawn. Many Great Lakes anglers also saw the abundant behemoths as problems. Lake sturgeon were large enough to tangle nets designed for smaller fish. By some accounts, sturgeon were numerous enough to capsize fishing boats. Sturgeon were slain, discarded, tossed ashore. Sometimes, their oily flesh was used for fuel. \"There's stories of how they'd stack them up like cordwood until they realized their market value,\" said Corey Jerome, biologist for the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians in Manistee. \"Then it changed from nuisance fish to market fish.\" Sturgeon caviar became a highly popular delicacy. Though the fish was then prized instead of derided, the result—overfishing—was the same. Twentieth-century environmental protection laws pulled the region beyond the Gilded Age era of overharvesting and habitat destruction, but they didn't fix the problem sturgeon experts said is a significant challenge to sturgeon's ability to rebound. Dams built to generate electricity, power grain mills, control water or create lakes continue to block sturgeon from reaching their historic spawning grounds. That's significant since sturgeon \"imprint\" on the environment in which they are born and return to that place to reproduce. If their access is blocked, they might not reproduce. \"Overfishing decimated the population levels,\" the DNR's Briggs said. \"With lake sturgeon being long-lived, it takes them a long time to mature... If you remove the majority of the adults out of the population, it is going to take a very long time for them to recover. It takes them a long time to reach maturity and, if you keep taking out the adults before they can reach maturity, they're just never going to repopulate. That was a big problem. \"But then once we started putting dams in, the fish that were able to spawn couldn't even reach their spawning grounds.\" That may be the secret behind the Detroit and St. Clair rivers' hardy lake sturgeon population, Chiotti said. No dams. The other ills facing the river systems, namely the contamination of sediment from historic and ongoing industrial releases and dredging that ripped up much of their spawning habitat, don't seem to affect sturgeon's ability to reproduce as much as dams do. \"We went through that time period of heavy industrialization, and they still made it somehow,\" Chiotti said. \"One of the theories is that there's no dam on this (river). It's a connecting channel with fast-flowing water. A lot of other systems, they blocked that habitat.\" The Saginaw Bay stands as a contrast to the Detroit and St. Clair river system. The bay maintains only a remnant of its once-sizeable sturgeon population, Kelly said. Its tributaries are peppered with dams. That's why dam removal projects are crucial to restoring lake sturgeon in the bay and its connecting river systems, Kelly said. The nonprofit he works for, Conservation Services, is helping to finance dam removal projects as part of sturgeon restoration work in partnership with natural resources agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Michigan DNR. The coalition of groups has been working on dam removal projects for roughly two decades, Kelly said. So far, they have dismantled almost two dozen dams on the Flint, Cass, Tittabawassee and Shiawassee rivers. Those removals have opened more than 200 miles of stream to sturgeon and other fish, but there are hundreds of dams left, Kelly said. An upcoming project to build a fish passage around the Dow Dam in downtown Midland will open up another 300 miles of fish habitat. Kelly called that project \"the holy grail of fish passage in the Saginaw system.\" The work kicks off this coming fall or spring. Once rivers become suitable for sturgeon spawning, state, federal and tribal natural resource agencies and nonprofits stock them with young sturgeon they hope will someday return to reproduce. Stocking programs, alongside dam removals and habitat projects, were credited with keeping lake sturgeon off the list of federal endangered species list this year. Tribal governments' natural resources departments are key players in those efforts. Many, including the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the Little River Band, raise sturgeon and stock them in nearby rivers. Jerome said the Little River Band's leadership sees their community reflected in the trajectory of lake sturgeon. \"Some of the same things that were happening to sturgeon as their population was declining was similar timing to when a lot of the tribal issues were occurring,\" he said. \"Trying to help both of those would help revitalize the tribal community as well.\" Sturgeon are clan animals for the Anishinaabek people of the Great Lakes region, said Frank Ettawageshik, executive director of the United Tribes of Michigan and citizen of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. Protecting them is an inherent responsibility within their culture, he said. \"We don't think of the natural world as property,\" Ettawageshik said. \"We think of it as relationships. They're our relatives. So we have to protect them. Things that we do, we're doing not because we're trying to protect something we own. It's because we're trying to protect the relatives.\" St. Clair River sturgeon are a major source of the eggs and milt—the seminal fluid of fish—that will be raised in hatcheries around the region to stock Great Lakes tributaries with young fish. Approximately 3,000 of their offspring will be released into the Maumee River and 500 into the Saginaw River this year, the Fish & Wildlife Service's Chiotti said. Other Lake Erie tributaries, including the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, are being evaluated for future stocking programs. The St. Clair River maintained sturgeon spawning ground during the Industrial Revolution and dredging navigational pathways, said Faust with Friends of the St. Clair River. The fish also adapted to the changed environments; some have been seen spawning on coal cinders, Chiotti said, and approximately 20,000 will spawn under the Blue Water Bridge at some point in their lifetimes. Chiotti, biological science technician Michala Burke, fish biologist Jason Fischer, fish biologist Jorden McKenna and biological science technician Eric Adams are the scientists that power the Fish & Wildlife Service's Gibraltar-based \"sturgeon team.\" Just before Memorial Day weekend, the team dispatched north to the St. Clair River for spawning season. The work is similar to what they did between Gibraltar and Detroit in early May—catch fish, measure them, collect a tail clip for a genetic sample and insert tags—but at a much more frantic pace. Their work will coincide with an annual Sturgeon Festival thrown by the Friends of the St. Clair River to celebrate the species and raise money for conservation programs. This year's festival is scheduled for June 1. Sturgeon serve as a character the friends group uses to teach people about their restoration work in the river that along with the Detroit River has been designated one of the most degraded places in the Great Lakes region, although the St. Clair River is well on its way to being removed from that list of toxic hot spots. \"When we talk about the health of the St. Clair River—can we drink the water, can we go swimming at the beaches—lake sturgeon help us tell that story,\" Faust said. \"They help us make the connection between the water that we use for recreation and enjoyment, bird watching and freighter watching. It's the same water. The water that we drink is the same water that the sturgeon are swimming in.\" Provided byThe Detroit News",

        "content": "Bhubaneswar: Tension prevailed in Osara under Dharmasala police station of Odisha’s Jajpur district as an SUV drove into an election rally of BJD MLA Pranab Balabantray leading his supporters to ransack a market complex in the area. According to sources, Balabantray, who is the BJD candidate for Dharmasala, was taking out a bike rally along with his supporters in his constituency as part of election campaign. As the rally was crossing Osara village around noon, the SUV of former sarpanch Dilip Behera ran into the bikers. Some BJD workers were injured and their bikes damaged in the incident. It sparked off tension as the BJD workers reportedly went on a rampage and vandalised the market complex owned by Behera at Mandia Chhak. They also damaged his SUV. However, the situation was brought under control as police rushed to the spot. Jajpur SP Vinit Agrawal also went to the village to take stock of the situation and additional forces were deployed there. The SP said three to four people were injured as the SUV ran into the crowd. The police would investigate into the matter and the those found responsible would face legal action, he added. Neither BJD nor Balabantray has issued any comment on the incident.

        "description": "A group of NATO members who share a border with Russia intend to ramp up the use of drones ostensibly to protect their territory against unspecified “provocations.”",
        "content": "Lithuanian Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite has touted the so-called “drone wall” scheme, claiming that Estonia, Latvia Finland, Norway and Poland are also on board. \"This is a completely new thing, a drone wall stretching from Norway to Poland, and the goal is to use drones and other technologies to protect our borders,\" Bilotaite told media. This endeavor supposedly looks to help those countries involved to “protect against provocations from unfriendly countries and to prevent smuggling,” Bilotaite added. While this “drone wall” concept is a new idea, it is “more evolutionary than revolutionary,” said former Swedish Armed Forces officer and politician Mikael Valtersson. “ Drones are already in use for border protection, but a drone wall must mean that there will be around-the-clock surveillance with drones along the entire border,” he told Sputnik. The problem with this “drone wall” scheme is that it is also expected to include an anti-drone component as well, and it remains unclear exactly how the countries involved are going to do that, Valtersson noted. “Efficient large-scale air defense systems are based on long-range missiles like the S-400. Short-range systems are mainly used for protection of certain specific targets,” he explained. “You can't build a wall of anti-drone defenses with short-range air defenses, since you would need a tremendous amount of short-range AD systems. And it would be a total overkill to use very expensive long-range systems to defend against cheap drones.” { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:381:3072:1610_640x0_80_0_0_bfcf6d6016bdbd90f9567a23930f22db.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:131:3072:1859_640x0_80_0_0_88db720f16276c01cadb4ae4a4f3794c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:131:3072:1859_640x0_80_0_0_88db720f16276c01cadb4ae4a4f3794c.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_251:0:2982:2048_640x0_80_0_0_9b0b173cac0e1bc8231fcf6dc980f271.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_251:0:2982:2048_640x0_80_0_0_9b0b173cac0e1bc8231fcf6dc980f271.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_592:0:2640:2048_640x0_80_0_0_ebfea7c949641f2e59ba551ca28b905b.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_592:0:2640:2048_640x0_80_0_0_ebfea7c949641f2e59ba551ca28b905b.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:381:3072:1610_1280x0_80_0_0_b4f5d58b32756281798523144108772c.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:131:3072:1859_1280x0_80_0_0_b88bf5a711737a6bf80dd19b82f02599.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:131:3072:1859_1280x0_80_0_0_b88bf5a711737a6bf80dd19b82f02599.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_251:0:2982:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_49b49fcdd20daf90a0e128a9c11eb71c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_251:0:2982:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_49b49fcdd20daf90a0e128a9c11eb71c.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_592:0:2640:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_d933258a3284b50675af3aca280cd944.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_592:0:2640:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_d933258a3284b50675af3aca280cd944.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:381:3072:1610_1920x0_80_0_0_0ffe9de759aa409ea4ba1ee774870e30.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:131:3072:1859_1920x0_80_0_0_867a8a19b3e9a9554b9f2b8162853962.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_0:131:3072:1859_1920x0_80_0_0_867a8a19b3e9a9554b9f2b8162853962.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_251:0:2982:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_487cf38e6e59eefa1ddf83c945c7ac9d.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_251:0:2982:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_487cf38e6e59eefa1ddf83c945c7ac9d.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_592:0:2640:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_972fcd91a1990a43e527e31aa81b9118.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1b/1118653115_592:0:2640:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_972fcd91a1990a43e527e31aa81b9118.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } World Estonian Drone Maker Expands Unmanned Ground Vehicle Production 12:54 GMT Electronic warfare capabilities seem like a more efficient solution but, as Valtersson pointed out, their efficiency “might be limited both in range, but also against totally independent drones that aren't remotely piloted.” “The practical use of a drone wall is probably rather limited. It might be a cost-efficient method of strengthening traditional border security but it will not be a game changer,” he surmised. “Both private (criminal) and state actors will be able to bring down reconnaissance drones and avoid detection, but refugees will, of course, be detected easily.” So far, the whole “drone wall” initiative appears to be just an attempt by the countries involved to show off “their toughness against Russia and the [alleged] Russian threat,” according to Valtersson. “They do something with limited efficiency, but proclaim it like it was a revolutionary thing,” he added. “They might even believe that they are increasing their security, but in reality this is just another step down the slippery slope towards a large-scale confrontation between the Western powers and Russia. This heightens tension and lowers security, at a great cost, not the other way around.”",

        "content": "RAF grounds Battle of Britain planes after tragic death of pilot who was killed in crash during memorial show Mark Long was tragically killed in a Spitfire crash on Saturday afternoon By Dan Grennan Published: 17:11, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:54, 27 May 2024 e-mail 4 View comments The RAF has grounded the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) planes after a Spitfire pilot was killed in a shock crash. Squadron Leader Mark Long's plane crashed a few minutes after taking off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire as part of a memorial show to mark the 85th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Saturday afternoon. The RAF have now said they have taken the decision to ground BBMF aircraft - which operates six Spitfires, two Hurricanes, a Lancaster, a C47 Dakota, and two Chipmunk aircraft - while investigations into the crash take place. A spokesperson said: 'Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF).' Squadron Leader Mark Long pictured pictured beside an RAF aircraft Sqn Ldr Mark Long pictured reading a map on an RAF airplane Mark Long flying the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire MK356 Pictured are floral tributes and handwritten notes left at the scene yesterday Tributes left by supporters at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, for renowned pilot Mark Long Grief-stricken supporters Nicki Housam, 53, a former prison officer and partner Andy George, a construction manager, pay their respects to the pilot The RAF also paid tributes to the father-of-two in a touching statement, describing him as 'a great friend, colleague and a passionate, professional aviator' who will be 'sorely missed'. The Typhoon pilot took to Instagram just weeks before the memorial show to share his excitement. In a post dated March 4, the Squadron Leader shared videos of Hurricane and Spitfire airplanes in flight with the caption: 'We are only a few weeks away from getting back flying in these iconic aircraft. Cannot wait!!!' In a post dated March 4, the Squadron Leader shared videos of Hurricane and Spitfire airplanes in flight with the caption: 'We are only a few weeks away from getting back flying in these iconic aircraft. Cannot wait!!!' In an older post, the experienced pilot shared a video explaining why they have to be careful about the conditions they fly the vintage aircrafts in. 'We have landed here with the Hurricane and Spitfire ready for react later this afternoon. The reason we landed in Gloucester is actually for cross winds. 'I'll show you around the aircraft and you will see what we are operating and why we are so precious about how we pick our winds, surface and flying conditions.' From under the Hurricane, Long said: 'What a lovely summer we are having right now as temperatures are soaring. The unique element of the Hurricane is that it gets really hot inside but it actually does quite well at keeping itself cool, 'So you have got the massive propeller at the front of the 17-litre Merlin engine but that on the ground forces the air through the radiator'. Leading tributes to the pilot yesterday, Gp Capt Robbie Lees, commander of the RAF's Display Air Wing, said: 'Mark was a Typhoon pilot here at RAF Coningsby and for the last four years he has been a pilot with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. 'A great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator he will be sorely missed by all that knew him.' He said an investigation into the cause of the 'tragic event' was now underway. 'I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the RAF personnel, and our emergency services colleagues who responded so swiftly yesterday. Squadron Leader Mark Long shared footage of a World War II-era plane in flight just weeks before his tragic death. In the post, he said he 'cannot wait' to fly the vintage aircraft in a few weeks The scene where the pilot died in a crash during a Battle of Britain event near RAF Coningsby A Spitfire flown by the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight pilot Mark Long in April The RAF said in a touching statement that he was 'a great friend, colleague and a passionate, professional aviator' 'Our thoughts remain with Mark's family and friends to whom we offer our deepest sympathies. We ask that their privacy be respected at this tragic and shocking time.' This was the first fatality involving a BBMF aircraft since its creation in July 1957, a retired RAF leader told the BBC. BBMF operates six Spitfires, two Hurricanes, a Lancaster, a C47 Dakota, and two Chipmunk aircraft. The pilot qualified to fly Spitfires in 2021 and was lined up to take over running the BBMF next year. His most recent RAF posting was as a flight commander flying Eurofighter Typhoons. He joined the Air Force in 2003, having graduated from the University of Warwick. During his career, Sqn Ldr Long was posted to 11 Squadron at Coningsby, deploying to the Baltics and the South Atlantic. A spectator who witnessed the horrific moment the Spitfire plane nose-dived to the ground, killing the pilot instantly, said: 'Sadly he didn't stand a chance.' The former RAF air craftsman, speaking after the death of the experienced and respected flier during a Battle of Britain event, said: 'I've seen a lot of terrible things in my life but this is up there with the worst.' Sqn Ldr Long flying the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire MK356 last weekend Mark, who declined to be fully named, saw the horror unfold as he was plane spotting with his partner and her RAF fan 10-year-old son from a car park overlooking the base. Read More BREAKING NEWS Prince William and Princess Kate say they are 'incredibly sad' to hear of death of pilot in Spitfire crash during Battle of Britain event at RAF Coningsby Recalling the tragedy, he said: 'There was an event going on and I saw a Spitfire taking off and flying at about 300 feet towards East Kirkby. 'It was in the distance and suddenly it turned round and was coming back to base. It was swaying and swaying from one side to the other. He would have known there was a problem with the craft and it was awful to watch. 'The pilot would have realised there was a fault and was coming back to try and land safely but suddenly it just plummeted from about 150 feet. 'It just nose-dived, sadly the pilot didn't stand a chance. The way it went down so quickly and people were watching from the car park in horror and disbelief. 'I was hoping it would be a different outcome but I knew there was no surviving that. 'I was there with my partner and her son, who was beside himself with sadness, like many of us. It was devastating to watch. 'You just don't expect something like this to happen .' Tony, speaking yesterday as he lay flowers at the much loved RAF base along with dozens of air enthusiasts and supporters, added: 'A Hurricane was going to take off after the Spitfire but his flight was aborted.' He said the pilot 'must have known there was a problem and he was in difficulty' and would have raised the alarm, saying: 'He would have radio called because in less than a minute the fire service and ambulances were there. 'The whole episode from take off to crash probably only lasted two and a half minutes. Tributes left by supporters at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire to the deceased pilot Dozens of flowers have been left lined up along the fence by the airfield Heartwarming handwritten notes accompany some flowers, reading 'fly high' The location where the Spitfire crashed in a field on on Langrick Road at RAF Coningsby Emergency services arrived following reports of a crash of a single-occupant aircraft in a field on Langrick Road (stock image) 'It is too difficult to estimate the speed.' 'I couldn't clearly see the spot it came down but pictures show it was right beside a house and a tractor so no doubt other people witnessed it too. It is a terrible tragedy.' The man, who lives locally, told how he often took his step son to watch the planes in action at the airfield. He paid warm tribute to the pilot as a 'remarkable and wonderful man' and thrilled children with his 'pep talks.' He recalled: 'At the end of a flight Mark would always make a point of coming up to the big wire fence and give the kids a pep talk through it. 'He'd still be in his uniform, and he'd still have his flight maps pinned to his trousers, above the knees and would pass them to the children through the fence. 'I didn't know him personally but I knew him by reputation as a great pilot and a remarkable and wonderful man. 'He always made time to speak to people so I had to come here today to pay my respects. 'He told the kids that it was dream to become a pilot but he had failed four or five times. 'His message to them was never to give up and that you can always live your dream. 'It is such a terrible tragedy that it was to end in this way for him.' The Spitfire came down at around 1.20pm on Saturday during a display at RAF Coningsby. File image shows the Prince and Princess of Wales with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, at RAF Fairford last year Photos from the scene show emergency services gathered around the wreckage of the plane just feet away from a house. It had been taking part in a civilian airshow just nine miles from the base to commemorate the RAF's role in fending off German attacks during the Second World War This year represents the 85th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. The Prince and Princess of Wales have shared their condolences, saying they were 'incredibly sad' to hear of the tragedy. Kate and William, who himself served as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot, said in a joint statement that it was 'incredibly sad to hear of the news' and added that their 'thoughts this evening are with the pilot's loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family.' Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote on X: 'Awful news to see the life of a serving RAF pilot cut short in this tragic event. My thoughts are with their family and loved ones.' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was 'deeply saddened' by the news, and thanked the emergency services for their response, adding 'my thoughts are with the pilot's family at this awful time.' The crash has been described as a 'tragic accident' by officials but an investigation has been opened into the cause. Police and ambulance crews raced to the scene and a rescue helicopter was scrambled from neighbouring Humberside. A statement from the Ministry of Defence stated: 'It is with great sadness that we must confirm the death of an RAF pilot in a tragic accident near RAF Coningsby today [Saturday]. 'The pilot's family has been informed and we ask that their privacy is respected at this time.' The pilot who was tragically killed in a Spitfire crash during a Battle of Britain event has been named as a Squadron Leader Mark Long (pictured) due to take over the memorial fight next year Spitfires played a crucial role in the war, especially during the Battle of Britain which earned the plane's power status. Designed as a short-range, high-performance plane, over 20,300 Spitfires were built to secure British success during WW2. It proved to be a watershed moment for the Nazis' territorial aims as they then shifted their focus to conquering Britain. Aware of the resilience of the RAF, German aircrafts bombarded British airfield bases until the autumn of 1940.

        "content": "The State House has listed major road projects of President Bola Tinubu in the first one year in office. It was highlighted that at the commissioning of the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Superhighway on Sunday, President Tinubu also unfurled his other bold road programmes. These include: work will soon start from the Calabar end off the Lagos-Calabar Superhighway. Minister of Works, Dave Umahi, had said the designs have been done and the procurement will follow. According to the State House report, also on is the design and procurement for the 1,000km Sokoto-Badagry Highway, which is expected to connect Sokoto to Badagry in Lagos State, passing through Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, and Oyo States. President Tinubu had virtually flagged off the design and procurement for the 461km Enugu-Abakaliki-Ogoja Road, which will traverse Benue, Kogi, and Nasarawa States, terminating at Apo in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). President Tinubu had also performed the virtual flag-off of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of 330 roads and bridges across the six geo-political zones of the country. President Tinubu formally commissioned the Apapa-Oworonsoki concrete road, financed by Dangote Industries and built by Hitech in Lagos last Sunday. The President also commissioned the refurbished Third Mainland Bridge, completed by General Ibrahim Babangida in 1990.",

        "content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin is reminding home and business owners about Arkansas laws affecting post-storm clean-up. Griffin said that the governor’s state of emergency declaration on Sunday triggered a specific Arkansas law into effect to prevent price gouging. The law prevents businesses from charging more than 10% over pre-disaster prices for goods and services. The ban is in place for 30 days and may be extended for an additional 30 days, Griffin said, adding that for home repairs the law is in effect for 180 days. Goods listed in the state law include food and water, fuel, blankets, medicine, bandages, flashlights, batteries and construction materials. “Price gouging will not be tolerated as Arkansas recovers, and I will bring the full power of my office to bear on anyone who violates our law,” Griffin said. Griffin also offered advice for those contracting for repairs to avoid scammers. “Those with storm damage should call their insurance company before paying any company or individual a deposit,” Griffin said. “Post-storm scammers will offer quick repair jobs for an immediate deposit and may even claim that insurance will reimburse the purchaser.” Griffin encouraged anyone eyeing such a contract not to feel pressured into taking an immediate solution that appears too good to be true. Arkansans who wish to report concerns about the subject of this Consumer Alert or desire more information should contact the Arkansas Attorney General’s Office by calling , emailing consumer@arkansasag.gov or by visiting .",

The post Economic challenges slash Nigeria’s small-scale industrialists by nearly half in two years appeared first on Nairametrics.",
        "content": "The number of small-scale industrialists in Nigeria has experienced a sharp decline over the past two years as businesses struggle with economic challenges in the country. The 2023 Social Statistics Report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) highlights a 45% decrease in the total number of individuals operating as small-scale industrialists across various economic sectors, dropping from 246,200 in 2020 to 170,098 in 2022. The education sector: consistently recorded the highest number of small-scale industrialists throughout the years, though the numbers reveal a downward trend. Related Stories Top 10 fastest growing sub-sectors of Nigeria’s economy in Q1 2024 Nigeria’s GDP declines to 2.98% in Q1 2024 – NBS In 2020, the sector had 56,321 small-scale industrialists, which decreased to 49,749 in 2021, and further dropped to 39,876 in 2022. This represents a 29% decrease over the two years, indicating significant challenges within the sector. Factors such as reduced funding, policy shifts, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to this decline. The real estate sector: also saw a substantial reduction in the number of small-scale industrialists. In 2020, there were 19,956 small-scale industrialists in the sector, which dropped to 12,720 in 2021, and then to 8,313 in 2022. The sector witnessed a 58% drop, reflecting the broader economic challenges and the potential impacts of policy changes or market conditions. The agriculture sector: experienced a relatively moderate decline. In 2020, there were 39,109 small-scale industrialists in agriculture, which decreased to 36,431 in 2021 and slightly declined to 36,348 in 2022. This 7% decline suggests that while the sector faces challenges, it remains somewhat resilient, possibly due to efforts to promote agricultural activities and support from government policies. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector: experienced a more pronounced decline. The number of small-scale industrialists in ICT was 33,842 in 2020, which decreased to 28,816 in 2021, and further dropped to 23,101 in 2022. This sector experienced a 32% reduction, highlighting the potential impact of technological and market shifts. In the manufacturing sector : there were 27,723 small-scale industrialists in 2020, which decreased to 20,736 in 2021 and further to 17,450 in 2022. With a 37% decrease, the manufacturing sector shows significant vulnerability, possibly due to supply chain disruptions, economic policies, and increased production costs. The mining sector: faced a modest decline compared to other sectors. In 2020, there were 24,852 small-scale industrialists in mining, which decreased to 22,721 in 2021 and slightly declined to 22,522 in 2022. The 9% decline indicates some level of stability in the mining sector, which may be attributed to increased extraction activities and investments in mining operations. However, challenges such as regulatory changes and fluctuating commodity prices may still impact the sector. The wholesale and retail trade sector: saw a significant reduction in the number of small-scale industrialists. In 2020, there were 44,397 small-scale industrialists in the sector, which decreased to 42,229 in 2021, and then sharply dropped to 22,488 in 2022. This 49% decrease reflects the severe impact of economic conditions on consumer behaviour and business operations. Factors such as reduced consumer spending, market competition, and economic uncertainties may have contributed to this decline. The aggregate data shows a sharp overall decline in the number of small-scale industrialists across various sectors. In 2020, there were a total of 246,200 small-scale industrialists, which decreased to 213,402 in 2021 and further dropped to 170,098 in 2022. Several factors likely contribute to the decline in the number of small-scale industrialists in Nigeria. These include economic instability, policy and regulatory challenges, access to finance, infrastructure deficiencies, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant decline in the number of small-scale industrialists in Nigeria has far-reaching implications for the country’s economy. Small-scale industries are a critical component of Nigeria’s economic structure, providing employment opportunities, contributing to GDP, and fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. The 45% reduction in this sector could lead to higher unemployment rates, reduced economic diversification, and diminished economic resilience. The decline further affirms the need for targeted interventions to support small businesses, which are crucial for economic growth and employment.",

        "content": "Leeds are coming to terms with the stark realisation that they will play Championship football for a second successive campaign after missing out on the chance of an instant return to the Premier League following a shattering loss to Southampton in the play-off final at Wembley . The result will have major financial ramifications for Leeds, who face the prospect of sanctioning some key sales with the club still having £79m in existing transfer instalments to pay.

In 2023-24, Leeds’s first year of parachute payments following relegation from the top flight, they received 55 per cent of the amount paid to Premier League clubs - around £45m. Next season, that will drop to 45 per cent - and should they fail to get promoted in 2024-25, they would fall dramatically to 20 per cent, accentuating the need for the club to go up in the next campaign. The future of a host of players loaned out last season including Jack Harrison , Brendon Aaronson, Marc Roca, Rasmus Kristensen and Max Wober remains unclear. Harrison has been linked with a permanent move to Everton. While any sales could help improve the financial shortfall, the expectation is that Leeds will have to cash in on some of their leading lights from 23-24 to help balance the books. Advertisement Advertisement Crysencio Summerville and Wilfried Gnonto are widely perceived to be two players who would not want to stay in the Championship next season, while there is highly likely to be considerable interest in star asset Archie Gray. Farke says that the club had made contingency plans in the event of failing to be promoted on Sunday and they will now be acted upon. Stressing that he has full belief in the project at Elland Road under owners 49ers Enterprises, Farke said: “I totally trust this club. \"I totally trust also the key people because my experiences since I sign the contract was, after a difficult start (last summer) with the (player) exit clauses that we had to suffer until more or less September, this club is totally on the right path. Advertisement Advertisement “Yes, it is always a bit difficult when you don’t know at the end of May exactly in which league you are because of different scenarios. “For sure, it's always a bit tricky, but in the background we’ve prepared a lot. There will be lots of work to do also over the upcoming weeks, that's definite for sure. \"I am not sure if everything (with the squad for next season) will be ready by pre season, but once the new season starts, we will definitely be prepared.” Bringing in some more top-level Championship experience to compliment the club’s younger players is likely to be a thrust of recruitment, with Farke also admitting that his side badly missed the injured Patrick Bamford on Sunday.

It would have definitely helped to have Patrick Bamford available for such a game like this, but it was not meant to be.”",

        "content": "Fresh blow for Rishi Sunak as outgoing Tory MP Lucy Allan QUITS the party in order to back Reform UK's candidate as her replacement in her Telford seat By Greg Heffer, Political Correspondent For Mailonline Published: 12:09 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:01 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 31 View comments Outgoing MP Lucy Allan tonight quit the Tories in order to support a Reform UK candidate to replace her in her Telford constituency. Ms Allan, who is standing down at the general election, endorsed Reform's Alan Adams to succeed her in the Shropshire seat. Following her public declaration of support for Mr Adams, the Conservatives took immediate action and suspended Ms Allan from the party. But, in the latest blow to Rishi Sunak during a bumpy start to the PM's general election campaign, she claimed she had already quit the Tories in order to back Mr Adams' bid. Ms Allan claimed the Reform hopeful was 'genuinely the best person for the job' and warned against allowing the Labour candidate a 'walkover' in Telford. Outgoing MP Lucy Allan has quit the Tories in order to support a Reform UK candidate to replace her in her Telford constituency Ms Allan, who is standing down at the general election, endorsed Reform's Alan Adams to succeed her in the Shropshire seat It is the latest blow to Rishi Sunak during a bumpy start to the Prime Minister's general election campaign She said: 'I have resigned from the Conservative Party to support Alan Adams to be Telford's next MP. 'I have known Alan for many years and he is genuinely the best person for the job. I want the best for Telford and I can't just let the Labour candidate have a walkover. ' Ms Allan added: 'As a Royal Navy veteran, Alan knows what it means to serve. 'He is the candidate who is most in touch with Telford people and best able to represent them. He will serve all residents, not just those who vote for him. 'Alan is not in it for personal advantage, power, or control over people. Alan's motivation for standing for election is profoundly honourable. He will be honest with Telford and put Telford first. 'Alan gives Telford a choice, so that Telford does not have to settle for more of the same politics and more of the same politicians.' Ms Allan had made her astonishing endorsment of Mr Adams in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. She wrote: 'I am supporting Alan Adams to be Telford's next MP. If you want to help Alan or donate to his campaign, sign up on his website alanadams.co.uk.' Reform MP Lee Anderson, a former Tory deputy chairman, replied: 'Thanks Lucy. A great move.' Asked about Ms Allan's revolt against the Tories, Mr Sunak said: 'I think when it comes to Reform, I understand people's frustrations, but it is very simple: either Keir Starmer or me is going to be PM on July 5. 'So if you are someone who wants strong borders and wants to get a grip of illegal migration, if you are someone who wants a more pragmatic, serious, hard-headed approach to Net Zero which prioritises energy security and cutting people's bills, I am going to deliver that, not Keir Starmer. 'That is the choice at this election. So for people who are thinking about voting for other parties, but particularly Reform, all that is going to do is put Keir Starmer in power and you are not going to see any change on the issues that you care about.' A Conservative Party spokesperson said: 'Lucy Allan has been suspended from the Party with immediate effect. 'The people of Telford now have the chance to vote for a dedicated and hardworking new candidate who will put Telford first. A vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer .' Responding to Ms Allan's endorsement of their candidate a Reform spokesman said: 'Of course we are absolutely delighted that she is backing our candidate in Telford. 'She, like many Conservatives, feels that the Reform Party represents traditional centre-right values and priorities in a way that the Conservative Party has long forgotten.' Ms Allan was first elected as Conservative MP for Telford at the 2015 general election, when she won the seat off Labour. She defended the seat with a near-11,000 vote majority at the 2019 general election. The Conservatives chose Hannah Campbell as their candidate in the constituency in December last year, after Ms Allan announced her decision to stand down at the general election. It is the latest sign of unrest within the Tory ranks following Mr Sunak's decision to call a general election much earlier than most of his MPs had been expecting. Tory peer Lord Goldsmith, an ally of former prime minister Boris Johnson, hit out at Mr Sunak and indicated he believed the Conservatives were on course for an electoral disaster. 'I understand the anger towards Sunak who has damaged the party almost beyond repair and all but guaranteed the majority of his MPs will lose their job next month,' the former minister said. 'But it's hard to muster much sympathy given that none of this would have happened without the complicity of a majority of the party and what is now unfolding was entirely predictable – indeed predicted. 'The hope is that when Sunak disappears off to California in a few weeks there are at least some decent MPs left around which to rebuild.' Mr Sunak this evening insisted he would remain in the UK, whether or not he won the election. Asked about the claim he would move to California, he told ITV News: 'It's simply not true. I mean, it's just simply not true.' Southampton fan Mr Sunak added: 'This is my home. I mean, my football team just got promoted back in the Premiership and I hope to be watching them for years to come in the Premier League.'

They had hoped to avoid customs by travelling via Mumbai passing through domestic channels instead of international arrivals. But luck ran out for them and they were caught. New Delhi : The Customs officials arrested 5 travellers from Uzbekistan at the Delhi airport for allegedly smuggling gold into the country. At least 3 kg of gold was found on them, the market value of which was Rs 1.92 crore, said reports. Passengers came via Dubai to avoid detection The accused were intercepted at Delhi Airport’s domestic terminal T-1 on Thursday. They had come from Mumbai, said officials. Officials said that they had hoped to pass through the domestic terminal easily and therefore bought a Mumbai-Delhi ticket, after landing in Mumbai from Dubai. Officials said that they had hoped to evade scrutiny of the customs department by passing through the domestic terminal of Delhi, instead of international arrivals at the Mumbai Airport. However luck ran out for them and they were caught. The passengers after disembarking from the Mumbai flight were brought by the customs officers at the Office of Preventive Customs (Shift) located at the international arrival hall of T-3, IGI Airport in New Delhi. They were checked personally and their baggage was also examined thoroughly. Customs officials found 9 gold chains weighing 2.8 kg on the passengers. The ornaments were worth Rs 1.92 crore in the international market at present, said officials. The passengers confessed that they had bought a ticket from Dubai to Mumbai and then Delhi so as to avoid customs, as they knew that it would be moved out through domestic arrivals and not through international arrivals in Delhi. All of them have now been arrested and proper action will be taken against them, said officials at the Customs Department. Officials also seized the gold they were carrying.",

They’re like 90% literal trash and 10% treasure lol. You have to be dedicated, but I’ve made some amazing purchases there,\" yet another reader chimed in. Why is Le Creuset so expensive? Le Creuset cookware is on the wishlists of many home cooks and bakers. But the French brand's Dutch ovens can cost between $260 and $750, and even a bread loaf pan will set you back $180. So what warrants such hefty price tags? Le Creuset's Dutch ovens are among its most popular items, and they — along with several other pieces of their cookware — are made with high-quality enameled cast iron. They're meant to last a long time and even carry a lifetime warranty \"to be free from defects in material and workmanship.\" \"It’s like, do you really wanna buy a $50 piece of something over and over again, or do you wanna invest in something and know that you’re gonna have it for a long time?\" Nate Collier, Le Creuset's director of marketing and communications, said to Eater . According to Cookware Insider , 15 quality control officers inspect each of the brand's items before they're sold. Of course, they're pretty, too, and quite the status symbol. \"You think of it as a simple piece of cookware, but even the silhouette of our Dutch oven is recognizable,\" Collier said. \"You could show someone a line drawing without any color, and most people that are familiar with cookware would be able to tell you that it's specifically a Le Creuset Dutch oven.\" Celebrity fans include Julia Child, Marilyn Monroe, Jennifer Garner, and Taylor Swift.",

        "content": "In an interview with Fightful , Mark Haskins spoke about Ring of Honor in its current incarnation, which he feels takes a backseat to AEW. Haskins was a part of the original ROH during its final years between 2018 and 2021. He said: “ I think that it’s a very cool take on Ring of Honor. From what I’ve seen, I think that it definitely gets me excited. I’m just glad that things ended, especially with my relationship with it, the way they did because they took so good care of us during COVID. They didn’t release us. They kept us on board. They kept paying us. Then that was one of the biggest driving forces for me was I wanted to be able to come back and be able to repay them in any way that I could. It was a huge motivation for me to be a greater asset by the time that I could get back to America than the time that they last saw me because I was so grateful for the care that they had given towards all of us. So the fact that things ended the way that they did, you know, I’m sad, but what can you do? Do you know what I mean? I’m kind of gutted that they didn’t have another investor just from the The sole point that I think that Ring of Honor was, especially around January, February time, 2020, there was such this vibe that we were, yeah, we’re going to step up. We’re going to take on the world. We’re going to do this, right? So it felt like there could have been another big promotion fighting in that competition between all the big promotions, right? Whereas it’s great that Tony Khan bought it, but I do feel that then it kind of takes a second place to AEW rather than stepping up and being another contender as such. ”",

And the former Manchester United and England forward has backed his ability to develop potential talent in Devon. Asked about his management style, the 38-year-old told Argyle TV: “Obviously I had my playing career, which I loved, but if you want to go into management, you quite quickly have to move on from there. “I’ve put a lot of work in, a lot of time in to try to develop myself as a coach, try to improve, try to get better, and I want to be a coach who helps players, helps teams, develops players, academy players. “Academy players are really important as well, to try to improve them, because I was a player who came into the first team at 16. I think a lot of young players are good enough, but maybe don’t get the chance, so I’ve got a real passion for that as well.” Rooney, who acknowledged his journey to Plymouth via spells at Derby, DC United and Birmingham had its challenges, is excited about the latest phase of his career, which will see him link up once again with the club’s director of football Neil Dewsnip. Dewsnip was the head of Everton’s academy who eased him through the ranks and the pair will now work together to plot the way forward for Argyle. Rooney, who admitted the two men had not seen each other for around 10 years until Birmingham played at Plymouth in December last year, said: “Of course with Neil’s role at the club and my role at the club, it’s going to have to be a daily basis I’m speaking to Neil now. “I think ultimately the important thing in that is we’re both trying to do the right thing, we both want the right thing, we’re both on the same wavelength now to make sure the club moves forward on players coming into the football club, style of play, how we want to move forward. “That relationship now is going to be so important.”",

        "description": "A home that was rescued from demolition and a site of a major regeneration programme have won awards for being “outstanding” pieces of architecture.",
        "content": "The awards have been given by RIBA, the Royal Institute of British Architects, as they name “outstanding works of the built environment” for 2024. The institute has been celebrating architecture for over 180 years and running the awards for 50 years. It claims that its awards and prizes are “regarded internationally as a mark of excellence”, recognising architecture, architects, research and students. A spokesperson for RIBA said: “Successful projects reflect changes and innovations in architecture, but at their core display a commitment to designing and developing buildings and spaces for the improvement and enhancement of people’s lives.” Here are the some of the places awarded in north London: The house at Templewood Lane was created by modernist architect Trevor Dannatt in 1960, and was at risk of being demolished. However it was reimagined by Coppin Dockray, who contacted Mr Dannatt about the home for an American client. A description by the RIBA reads: “Their coherent new interventions and careful conservation demonstrate a real understanding of how to make the most of light and views. “Poor ground-floor additions have been rationalised to establish the kitchen as the heart of the house, with living rooms to the rear. Above, a new metal-clad extension houses bedrooms. Sustainable through its retention and upgrading of building fabric and services, the house revels in a quiet mastery of its materials palette, both inside and out.” This three-storey office near King’s Cross station, was designed by the Coffey Architects. A description reads: “ Using a diagonal grid optimised the lightweight concrete and steel structure, whilst improving orientation both for views and heat gain. It also enabled the creation of a sawtooth roofline which not only references the industrial context of King’s Cross, but also creates a natural landmark on this corner site. “The façades deploy embossed and intricately perforated aluminium panels over a variety of transparent, translucent and solid curtain walls, providing a fascinating interplay of dappled light over the façade and within.” Work for the Brent Cross Town regeneration is still ongoing, as it’s set to deliver 6,700 new homes, workspaces for 25,000 people, as well as leisure facilities including restaurants and a cinema. But the first building as part of its redevelopment – the three-storey visitor pavilion – has won an award. A description reads: “The project creates both private and public spaces for events, exhibitions, show apartments, and offices, which, together with a café, provide a dedicated venue for the local and wider public to learn about the masterplan. “It is designed as two short two-storey wings acting as galleries off a central double-height space, with a rooftop terrace and further accommodation on part of the third storey. The architects have conceived it with an eye towards sustainability as well as its inevitably changing role over time.” Unity Place introduced 235 social rent homes as part of the 15-year South Kilburn regeneration programme. It offers what is described as affordable homes of different sizes, along with a community hub, play space and parking. A description reads: “Infrastructure constraints and the proximity to conservation areas and listed buildings posed challenges for the design. The architects met these with a varied but unified scheme that reinstates historical street patterns, harmonising high-density housing with the surrounding low- to medium-rise buildings through contextually sympathetic materials.” After the sudden death of his wife, architect Jonathan Wilson crafted a two-storey home for himself in Haringey. A description reads: “A comprehensively rigorous approach to low-energy sustainability has guided every design move. A small oasis in this corner of the city, the house is a simple, calming environment, with a strong inside–outside connection and a piano at its heart. “It succeeds in effortlessly and elegantly meeting the specific living needs of its owner while serving as a demonstration project for how to go about creating a fully Passivhaus-certified dwelling.” King’s Cross has had a major redevelopment after it was first granted planning permission in 2006. The estate includes 100 shops, bars and restaurants and 1,750 homes and 10 public spaces. It resulted in 50 new buildings introduced to the area. The RIBA description reads: “From the start, the project team set out their ‘principles for a human city’, based on offering character, variety, choice, and a sense of belonging which can underpin rapidly changing patterns of social and economic behaviour. \"These have been deployed not in a grandiose manner, but through careful understanding and reshaping of found geometries, stitching a previously cut-off part of the city back into the wider urban fabric. \"Excellent buildings by a range of architects characterise the campus, but all in a way that informs and substantiates the critical open spaces and routes which are the project’s true legacy.",

Asked about his management style, the 38-year-old told Argyle TV: “Obviously I had my playing career, which I loved, but if you want to go into management, you quite quickly have to move on from there. “I’ve put a lot of work in, a lot of time in to try to develop myself as a coach, try to improve, try to get better, and I want to be a coach who helps players, helps teams, develops players, academy players. “Academy players are really important as well, to try to improve them, because I was a player who came into the first team at 16.

Dewsnip was the head of Everton’s academy who eased him through the ranks and the pair will now work together to plot the way forward for Argyle. Rooney, who admitted the two men had not seen each other for around 10 years until Birmingham played at Plymouth in December last year, said: “Of course with Neil’s role at the club and my role at the club, it’s going to have to be a daily basis I’m speaking to Neil now. “I think ultimately the important thing in that is we’re both trying to do the right thing, we both want the right thing, we’re both on the same wavelength now to make sure the club moves forward on players coming into the football club, style of play, how we want to move forward. “That relationship now is going to be so important.”",

        "description": "Trump's constant criticism of his trial judge will not play well with the jury, a former prosecutor has said.",
        "content": "Former President 's repeated attacks on the judge in his criminal hush money case will be seen as disrespectful by the jury, a former prosecutor has said. Jim Walden, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, said that Trump doesn't seem to understand that juries have a good relationship with judges. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden told on Monday. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound.\" \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be—a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician—he's a dumb lawyer,\" Walden said. He added that Trump was too involved in his own legal defense. Walden, who previously prosecuted organized crime cases in New York, said the worst defense mistake was calling attorney Robert Costello as a witness. Costello, who had given legal advice to Trump's former attorney and fixer , was called by the defense to undermine Cohen's evidence. Judge Juan Merchan was infuriated by Costello and accused him of interjecting with comments, rolling his eyes and staring at Merchan from the witness stand. Merchan eventually cleared the courtroom of reporters and accused Costello of \"contemptuous\" behavior. He also challenged Costello to stare at him one more time. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden said. \"The defense finally got some momentum, and it all got dialed back because Costello was playing to Trump instead of playing it straight. He had a good story to tell, and instead, they put the throttle right back in the prosecutor's hands.\" reached out to Trump's attorney via email for comment on Monday. Costello told on Friday that he had no comment. The prosecution that before the 2016 presidential election, Trump paid or discussed paying adult film star not to discuss an affair she says they had in 2006. Trump, the presumptive 2024 nominee for president, denies the affair. Manhattan District Attorney charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in April 2023, arguing that the payment to Daniels was made through Cohen and that the payment was an illegal campaign contribution because it was intended to silence Daniels and thereby influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintains that the case is politically motivated. Cohen was later jailed for illegal campaign contributions, tax fraud and other charges. He is now an implacable opponent of Trump and they have attacked each other's characters on social media posts since the trial began.

        "content": "This year's Memorial Day sales include Asus' slimmest gaming laptop. You can get the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 Gaming Laptop at Best Buy for $1,000 (was $1,500) . Better act fast, though. After Memorial Day passes, so does this deal. You can see the countdown timer underneath the price on the listing page. This 16-inch Asus gaming laptop is currently 30% off its usual price, a generous discount for a higher-end laptop. It doesn't have the absolute latest specs, but this 2023 model of the G16 still holds up as one of the beefier options on the market with its RTX 4060 GPU and 13th gen Intel core. Many laptops with the same specs cost around the full price of $1,500, so $1,000 is a steal. If you want another deal just as good, you’ll have to wait for the next holiday. Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 Gaming Laptop: was $1,500 now $1,000 at Best Buy The Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 is the 16-inch version of Asus' slimmest gaming laptop.

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Five academic staff drag UNN to court over removal from governing board Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Five academic staff drag UNN to court over removal from governing board Published on May 27, 2024 By Matthew Atungwu Five academic staff of the University of Nigeria Nsukka, UNN, have filed a lawsuit against the management of the university at the Federal Court High sitting in Enugu for refusing to allow elected members of the Governing Council to serve out their tenure. The aggrieved academics, comprising three professors, argued that they were elected for a four-year tenure as internal members of the governing board but were not allowed to continue in office after the dissolution and reconstitution of the governing councils of the federal universities. The applicants, through their counsel, Chidioke Ezeh, urged the court for an interlocutory injunction stopping the university from conducting fresh elections into the governing council of the institution. Joined in the suit marked FHC/E/CS/97 2024, were the university governing council, the Senate of the university, Vice Chancellor and the pro-Chancellor of the institution. The applicants prayed for an order compelling both parties in the suit to maintain the peace and status quo pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. They also demanded any other order or such further orders as the honourable court may deem fit and proper to make in the circumstances. The applicants, in a motion on notice, said they were distinctively elected as internal members of the governing council of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, from the various categories of Senate, convocation and congregation. They stated that they have their own distinct memoranda to council, election results, notice of meeting and minutes of meetings. The suit equally urged the court to construe relevant provisions of the Interpretation Act as to what constitutes four-year under the law. The applicants disclosed that they have held several meetings with the 4th defendant, who is the vice Chancellor of the university, but he has remained obstinate and recalcitrant in doing the unlawful act probably because his tenure as vice chancellor will come to an end sometime in June 2024. “We have held several meetings with the 4th defendant, but he has remained obstinate and recalcitrant in doing the unlawful thing probably because his tenure as vice chancellor will be coming to an end sometime in June 2024. “That the contention and reason of the 4th defendant upon which he is currently acting arbitrarily was that the Federal Government of Nigeria at a time suspended all boards of the Federal Government institutions decision of which we know has been rescinded since,” the motion on notice read in parts.

As the talented actress prepares for the launch of the show, she continues a cherished 13-year tradition that has become an integral part of her creative journey. For over a decade, Nia has been visiting the revered Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai, seeking divine blessings and guidance before embarking on new projects. This time is no different, as Nia expresses, \"Before every new venture, I make sure to visit Siddhivinayak. I have been going there for 13 years now, and this time is no exception. Seeking Bappa's blessings today fills me with gratitude. I'm thrilled to be a part of Suhagan Chudail and eagerly await the audience's reaction.

The actress posed for photos and was presented a picture of Siddhivinayak. She shared a video of her visit to the famous temple and captioned it as, \"Continuing the 13 year long tradition of seeking #blessings at Siddhivinayak Ganpati bappa Moryaa🙌 The journey begins tonight..

        "content": "The Rivers Police Command said an investigation by its operatives has led to the arrest of 13 suspects who hijacked and, diverted trailer loads of goods in the state. Grace Iringe-Koko, Spokesperson for the Command in a statement explained that on March 4, 2024, at approximately 11 pm, the Command received a distress call about burglars who were attempting to vandalize warehouses in Elimgbu owned by one Emmanuel Nwangwu and Mrs. Ndifreke Ekanem. Iringe-Koko said the police promptly mobilized to the scene and arrested five suspects who had been severely beaten by a mob. She explained that the wounded suspects were taken to the police hospital as investigations began and during the interrogation, it was discovered that one of the suspects, known as West Isaac (08NA/61/2653), was a corporal in the Nigerian Army serving in Delta State. She further said another suspect, Jabila Kammangar, also known as ‘Kaka,’ was an officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps serving in Kabba, Kogi State. She said: “They confessed to abandoning their posts to engage in criminal activities in Rivers State due to its lucrativeness. “Corporal West, a 36-year-old father of four from Buguma, Rivers State, joined the Army in 2008 and was assigned to the 3rd Battalion in Warri. “He left his base on a sick pass and failed to return even after it expired, remaining absent for over a month until his arrest. “West disclosed to the police that he met Kaka while serving in the Army’s Anti-Bunkering Unit, and together, they engaged in several illegal activities. He further revealed that he came to Port Harcourt after receiving a call from Kaka about raiding warehouses, which led to their capture.” She further said that further investigations revealed that they were part of a larger criminal ring specializing in armed robbery, hijacking, and goods diversion. She added: “Corporal West disclosed to the police that he and other Army personnel had been key players in the group. Besides ransacking warehouses, they had a network of informants who provided information about the schedules of goods-bearing trailers. “They would then dress in full military gear, lay in wait for the trailers, and accost them with a white Hilux van as they approached. They would intimidate the drivers, assault them, and hand their keys to designated drivers, who would then divert the trailers to waiting receivers. “Based on his confessional statement, the police were able to track down and arrest Lance Corporal Abdul Musa (13NA/70/10545), Lance Corporal Mgbe Jeoffrey (16NA/75/6896), and Corporal Innocent Okwoli (12NA/68/6552), all personnel of the Nigerian Army. Additionally, eight civilian collaborators in the syndicate were arrested: Olisa Emeka, George Obilor, Sampson Wilson, Alfred Abeke, Barry John, Auwalu Aliyu, Uchenna Nwali, and Alhaji Sofinu Haruna. “The group’s key coordinator was Corporal Innocent Okwoli, a native of Otakpo in Benue State and a soldier stationed at Intels in Onne. Okwoli stated that he started leading hijacking operations after being introduced to the activity by an individual named Abbas and two unnamed Naval officers. Following a successful operation, he formed his team. Iringe-Koko said their numerous crimes include: “The hijacking of a trailer loaded with fertiliser valued at N25 million, owned by Alhaji Sadiq Adams, occurred on February 17, 2024.On March 4, 2024, the group attempted to burgle warehouses owned by Emmanuel Nwagwu and Ndifreke Ekanem.In February 2024, a 40-foot container filled with imported clothing from China was hijacked and diverted. “In February 2024, a trailer carrying POP cement was hijacked and diverted. The police have since recovered the stolen POP cement and are working to retrieve a trailer load of fertiliser from its receiver. Additionally, a white Toyota Hilux used in the gang’s operations has been recovered from the NSCDC officer.” She stated that the three affected soldiers had been dismissed by the Nigerian Army after being handed over by the police. Meanwhile, the State Commissioner of Police, CP Olatunji Disu, lauded the prompt actions in addressing the involved officers’ misconduct and subsequent handover to the police for prosecution expressed his profound appreciation for the swift and decisive cooperation of the military authorities. He emphasised that this collaborative effort underscores a strong commitment to upholding justice and maintaining public trust in law enforcement institutions. He praised the police officers involved in the arrest and urged them to remain vigilant. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. The veteran centre will be in the lineup tonight when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 after Dallas picked up a 3-1 victory to even the series over the weekend. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, the 34-year-old has a goal and an assist in six playoff games. Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch.

        "content": "PARIS - Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100 per cent sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. Top sports headlines, all in one place When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.”",

        "content": "Bay Area air quality officials have launched an investigation into Tesla, charging the electric automaker with letting massive amounts of harmful toxins escape into the air from its Fremont car factory. In a double blow, an environmental group has filed a new lawsuit against the company over such pollution releases. Since 2019, Tesla, which made $17.7 billion in profit last year according to regulatory filings, has allowed 112 illegal toxic releases, each containing as much as 750 pounds of harmful contaminants, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District said in a news release early this month. Even low levels of ozone created when the emitted chemicals meet sunlight can harm health, especially for children, older people and those with asthma, the district said. Other released contaminants can cause cancer and, even at low levels, neurological damage and reproductive and developmental damage, according to the regulatory agency, which pointed to Tesla's paint-spraying booths and paint-baking ovens as sources of the pollution. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on the district's investigation and allegations or claims in the lawsuit. District officials announced May 2 that they were seeking an order to shut down the Fremont plant's two car-painting departments if Tesla would not agree to hire outside experts to help stop the emissions. The district said this week that it had previously probed Tesla's pollution from the factory and found it resulted from repeated problems in the painting departments' containment systems and production lines. \"Operational changes were made by Tesla, but ultimately, they were not enough,\" said district spokeswoman Kristina Chu, adding that the agency may sue Tesla over the emissions. Despite \"extensive discussion\" between district officials and the company, Tesla has not stemmed the emissions, the district said in its request for an order from its hearing board, which rules on regulatory-compliance issues. Meanwhile, the car maker led by notoriously regulation-hostile CEO Elon Musk is facing a new lawsuit by a local claiming Tesla's \"extensive and ongoing\" pollutant releases are exposing residents and workers in the area to harmful chemicals, including arsenic. \"It feels to us like profits are more important than actually being a good neighbor and supporting ,\" said Tanya Boyce, executive director of the Environmental Democracy Project, a nonprofit corporation that filed the lawsuit last week in San Francisco U.S. District Court. Boyce noted that children attend Bringhurst Elementary school within a mile of the Tesla plant. Her group's lawsuit, which cites \"a long history of noncompliance with environmental laws\" at the factory, alleged Tesla broke federal air quality rules more than 160 times between January 2021 and January 2024. Records from Tesla submitted with the lawsuit list more than 90 violations between January 2022 and June 2023 of the company's permit from the air quality district. Tesla attributed the causes nearly every time to \"unforeseen\" breakdowns and malfunctions, according to the records. The air quality district in its news release described Tesla's emissions as \"foreseeable.\" The Environmental Democracy Project targets pollution affecting communities of color. The City of Fremont describes itself as \"one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse cities in the Bay Area,\" with 63% of residents speaking a language other than English at home. U.S. Census data show the city's population is 62% Asian, 21% White, 12% Latino and 3% Black. In a March letter to Musk, the Environmental Democracy Project said it was planning to sue Tesla in federal court over its alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act because the air quality district had not done so already, \"leaving it to citizens like EDP to bring their own enforcement action.\" The nonprofit is seeking a court order barring Tesla from violating air quality regulations, and fines of up to $121,000 per day for each alleged violation of the Clean Air Act. The Fremont factory, where Tesla makes its models 3, X, Y and S, has long been a target for regulatory and legal action. In February, eight Bay Area counties sued Tesla, claiming it illegally dumped produced in its Fremont plant and its auto service centers around the region. District attorneys in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano and Sonoma counties along with 17 other California DAs allege in San Joaquin County Superior Court that the company broke a host of laws on labeling, transportation and disposal of toxic materials. In a February 2022 settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Tesla agreed to pay a $275,000 fine for breaking the Clean Air Act at the Fremont plant over a three-year period. Tesla in 2021 was fined $750,000 in a settlement with the air district for committing 33 air quality violations since 2015. In 2019, the company agreed to pay a $31,000 penalty over hazardous waste violations at the Fremont factory in another settlement with the U.S. EPA. Boyce believes the \"very small\" penalties are just \"the cost of doing business\" for Tesla. Musk has frequently defied and disparaged regulations and regulators and tweeted last year, \"Like Gulliver, tied down by thousands of little strings, we lose our freedom one regulation at a time.\" In 2018, Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charge that he misled investors with a tweet about taking Tesla private—then he took to Twitter to mock the SEC. At the start of the COVID pandemic, Tesla kept the Fremont plant running for nearly a week in violation of a public health order, with Musk tweeting that an \"ignorant\" Alameda County health officer was violating \"our Constitutional freedoms.\"",

        "content": "Baxter. Courtesy of Midcoast Humane A gorgeous 6-year-old mix, Baxter came to Midcoast Humane from Oklahoma with an old injury to his front leg. Because it appeared to still be causing him discomfort, our medical team took X-rays and determined that removing the leg would be the best for Baxter’s long-term outcome. Now healed from his surgery, Baxter is ready for his new family! He has had a lot of transitions and he needs a home that understands it may take him a little while to settle in. Only having three legs doesn’t slow him down at all, and he’ll happily go for walks with you and then have a good snuggle on the couch. If Baxter sounds like he could be your boy, come on in to the Brunswick campus and ask to meet him! Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

        "content": "Kick streamer ‘ShaktyG’ challenged himself to repeat the word ‘Kick’ a whopping one million times in an epic charity subathon. Imagine repeating the same word one million times? It sounds ridiculous and time-consuming, but that’s exactly what happened when streamer ‘ShaktyG’ set out to raise money for charity. After being live for over 233 hours, ShaktyG finally completed his goal, but the journey was not easy, to say the least. Over 233 hours streamed himself saying Kick 1,000,000 times for charity! 💚 Like most , the timer increases with each sub or follow, but ShaktyG faced a problem after taking 115 hours to get half-way through his goal. Even though he was only having 3-4 hours of sleep during the challenge, he remaining to say Kick 1M times, so he decided to keep going, even if the countdown hit zero. Fortunately, the Kick community came through with a massive boost, giving him more time to complete the challenge as originally intended. 70% of the way through! I underestimated the power of the Kick community. I thought the timer was going to run out today and hit 0, but the followers and subs came through, and we still have more than 5 hours on the countdown timer! Eventually, when all was said and done, he was able to hit 1,432 subs and 2,646 follows. Upon saying the final ‘Kick,’ the streamer was on the verge of tears and was visibly trying to hold back his emotions. Following the end of the stream, ShaktyG thanked everyone involved for helping him on his quest. “From fellow streamers raiding and dropping by with words of encouragement, to the Kick staff boosting my reach, and to my parents and girlfriend who even donated because they couldn’t bear to see the countdown timer hit zero! I’m truly blessed to share this moment with you all and am incredibly thankful to be part of this amazing community,” he . “Saying ‘Kick’ a million times was not just about charity; it was a personal challenge to prove to myself that I can achieve anything I set my mind to. No matter how many times I stumble, I’ll always find a way to rise and make you all proud.” The money raised will be donated to the appropriately-named food distribution project ‘Kick out Hunger.’ As for ShaktyG, he’s already about what he’ll tackle next and if it’s anything like his ‘Kick’ subathon, expect big things from this up-and-coming content creator.",

        "description": "THE 17th edition of the annual Toyota Road Trek unfolded on May 15, 2024. This event serves as Toyota's gesture of appreciation to its media allies for their yearlong support, and doubles as an opportunity to showcase the brand's latest products, either recently launched or scheduled for later release.Not everyone receives an invitation to the Toyota Road Trek. It might be perceived as an exclusive gathering, akin to an old boys club (inclusive of women, of course), but it's primarily a logistical matter. Toyota can only accommodate a limited number of automotive journalists for the event, or else risk financial strain.This year's journey promised to be extraordinary as we aimed for Davao City, followed by a retreat at the enchanting Discovery Resort on Samal Island. The plan was straightforward: depart at 8:30 a.m. from Terminal 2 in NAIA, and arrive at Davao International Airport by 10:30 a.m.The itinerary included driving the latest Toyota models around scenic and cultural spots in Davao City and nearby areas upon landing, allowing ample time for picturesque snapshots of the vehicles against stunning backdrops.However, things didn't go as planned.Due to unfortunate circumstances or subpar fleet management, our flight via Philippine Airlines (PAL) was delayed by six hours, departing Manila at 2:30 p.m., throwing the Toyota Road Trek schedule into disarray.This delay not only inconvenienced our plans but also incurred significant costs for Toyota Motor Philippines.Subsequently, we learned that PAL was operating with constraints. Out of the 78 aircraft intended for service, 14 were reportedly grounded for maintenance. Yet PAL persisted with its flight schedules without adjustments, resulting in delays and involuntary boarding denials.In such instances, passengers are often rescheduled onto subsequent flights, potentially on smaller aircraft, necessitating a reduction in the number of passengers accommodated.Four members of our group narrowly avoided being denied boarding, thanks to the intervention of PAL's Corporate Communications head Cielo Villaluna, who ensured our group boarded together.Yet, it's disheartening to note PAL's apparent disregard for customer welfare. Despite the extensive delay, passengers received only fast-food burgers and water to satiate their hunger, surpassing the airline passenger rights threshold of four hours without appropriate compensation.On the return journey, Toyota collected our contact details, indicating PAL's assurance of compensation. However, as of writing, no compensation has been received, leaving doubts regarding its adequacy in compensating for the six-hour disruption caused by flight delays.Nevertheless, Toyota's Road Trek persisted amid the challenges, celebrated with fervor within the limited time available. Once again, Toyota demonstrated its commitment, allowing us to explore the Philippines in their vehicles.Salamat po Toyota! Sa uulitin! (Thank you Toyota! Until next time!)As for PAL ... booooo!!!!",

        "content": "AzmanJaka/E+ via Getty Images It has been a very long time since I covered shares of OSI Systems ( NASDAQ: OSIS ), in fact, it was the summer of 2016 when I concluded that appeal was increasing despite a somewhat troubled deal. Fast forwarding in time, OSI has seen solid growth and this has resulted in real value being delivered for its shareholders, all of which makes an update on the investment case long overdue. Fast forwarding some 8 years in time, OSI has seen continued growth. On a trailing basis, OSI has grown sales towards the $1.5 billion mark, aided by a couple of huge security orders in recent times. This created a strong 2024, although more orders keep the backlog flat here, creating interesting dynamics going forward, as not all segments are putting in their fair share here. Advanced, Reliable And Critical Electronics Solutions OSI provides advanced and reliable electronics solutions for critical applications across various diversified essential markets. The company is active across three segments which includes security, optoelectronics and healthcare. The security business is by far the largest segment, and the most profitable one, responsible for about 60% of sales. These revenues are generated from the development and manufacturing of security screening systems and solutions for governments, civil infrastructure, border & port security, among others. Optoelectronics is responsible for a quarter of sales, with revenues generated from components and solutions such as photodetectors, laser diodes and lex circuits in a wide range of applications. The remaining 15% of sales are generated in healthcare settings, including patient monitoring, cardiology, connected care and remote monitoring in various healthcare applications. In terms of geographies, half of sales are generated in the US, with the remainder generated notably in the EMEA region, APAC and the remainder of the Americas. When I last looked at the shares in 2016, the company had just completed a decade long period during which the company doubled its sales and grew adjusted earnings to $3 per share, while shares traded at a relatively modest $50 valuation. This was in part the result of shares falling at the time due to some operating hiccups, as the company announced a somewhat troubled acquisition as well. Between 2016 and today, the company has grown sales from around a billion to $1.3 billion in 2023, although that earnings doubled to $6 per share over this point in time. All this means that shares, which traded at $50 in 2016, have traded in a $50-$100 range all the way until the spring of last year. A $100 stock in the spring of last year was unleashed and rose to the $145 mark as of recent, actually trading at all-time highs here. Picking Up The Valuation Here In August of last year, OSI posted its fiscal 2023 results. Full year revenues were up 8% to $1.28 billion, aided by very strong results in the final quarter of last year when sales were up 22%. The company actually saw actual gross profitability down, as the company posted operating profits of $121 million, with the company posting GAAP earnings of $6.45 per share. That however included a one-time gain on the sale of property, with adjusted earnings of $5.81 per share actually being down forty cents on the year before. The company operated with net debt of $288 million, a very manageable amount. The company guided for a spectacular improvement in 2024 results, with revenues seen up more than 18%, with adjusted earnings seen up more than 25% on the year before. This was supported by a huge backlog, which rose some 46% to $1.8 billion after the company took in a few large orders, including a huge $600 million border inspection order from Mexico's Department of National Defense. In October of last year, the company posted first quarter results with sales up 4% to $279 million, with adjusted earnings up a modest four cents to $0.91 per share. While these results were not that spectacular, it prompted the company into hiking the full year earnings per share guidance, calling for more than 27% growth on an annual basis Second quarter sales were up some 26% to $373 million, with adjusted earnings up a dollar to $2.21 per share. Following this impressive quarter, the company now saw full year sales grow by more than 19%, with earnings per share growth seen in excess of 29%. In April, third quarter sales were reported up 34% to $405 million, with adjusted earnings up 45% to $2.16 per share. With earnings growth seen in excess of 30% per share here, earnings are expected to surpass $7.50 per share here. Given the greater earnings power here, net debt is down to about a quarter of a billion, as all this momentum is aided and supported by a continued backlog of $1.8 billion here. What Now? With 17.4 million shares of OSI trading at $145, equity of the company is valued at $2.52 billion, for a $2.77 billion enterprise valuation. This values the operations at less than 2 times sales with shares trading at 19 times earnings, after a great momentum run seen, with net leverage seen around 1.5 times. What is of interest is that here is great divergence between the segments. Irony will it that through the first nine months of the year, revenues for the optoelectronics and healthcare division are down, and the same applies for margins. This shows that all this momentum is driven by the security division, which has reported a 42% increase in sales so far this year to $700 million, pushing up its share to two-thirds of sales. This also shows the potential for other value accretive moves as the healthcare segment is barely profitable here, leaving potential for OSI to over time, become a more focused business, as the security business is notably the biggest, fastest growing business and also the most profitable segment out there. Amidst all this, I am performing a balancing act. A 19 times earnings multiple, given the organic growth performance, looks appealing, but arguably a few big orders have been driving 2024 growth. That said, after conversion of these orders one were to expect a decline in sales next year, but the backlog has been rather constant, as the order intake remains sound. This looks positive, but of course, growth has been rather dismal in recent years. Given this, I am performing a balancing act, but expect much tougher comparables here going forward. Given this, and the fact that shares have been doing quite well, having risen to fresh all-time highs here, I am leaning cautious here, anticipating some kind of normalization in fiscal 2025. On the other hand, there is potential for segments outside the security business to create value here as well, and despite the interesting dynamics and set-up, I am quite cautious and not willing to chase the shares here.

        "content": "The Bayelsa State governorship election petition tribunal has dismissed the petition filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Timipre Sylva, challenging the re-election of Governor Douye Diri. In a unanimous decision, the three-man panel led by Justice Adekunle Adeleye held that the petitioners failed to provide credible evidence to support their allegations of irregularities in the governorship poll. The tribunal struck out additional proof of evidence and witness statements filed by the petitioners, citing a breach of electoral laws. It also dismissed allegations of forgery against Deputy Governor Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stating that the issue was a pre-election matter that had become statute barred. The tribunal noted that the petitioners’ prayers were contradictory, seeking both a declaration as winners and a nullification of the election. It held that the petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proof and unable to show specific polling units where irregularities occurred and how it affected the outcome. Justice Adeleye, who read the lead judgment, noted that some allegations contained elements of criminality that ought to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The tribunal upheld preliminary objections filed by the respondents, challenging the competence of the petition. Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "A man died after I didn't speak up, and I still feel guilty about it, says DR SCURR. But second opinions aren't enough to save lives - it's the culture of hospitals that has to change By Dr Martin Scurr Published: 11:55 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 12:41 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 7 shares View comments The tragic death of 13-year-old Martha Mills following poor, possibly negligent care at a major London hospital brought back bitter memories of the death of one of my own patients. It also confirmed for me why, sadly, the plan to introduce Martha’s rule — which would give every patient in hospital the right to a second opinion from other experts at the same hospital — won’t help. In February, the Government announced that hospitals in England were to be offered funding to roll out the rule. Already 143 have signed up, it was reported today, and should be operating the scheme by 2025. Martha’s parents have been heroic in their efforts to try to spare others the awful, needless loss of a loved one . Martha's rule follows the tragic death of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who died after developing sepsis in 2021 under the care of King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South London But Martha’s rule, while laudable, cannot, I am afraid, do one thing that’s vital to its success: and that is to change our hospital culture . I don’t mean just that people are afraid to speak up, to challenge the hierarchy of senior doctors, for that is still an issue (although it is improving, slowly). I mean the lack of continuity of care — no longer taking full responsibility for a patient for their whole hospital ‘journey’ — which came when the structure of hospital care changed from the late 1990s. There’s no doubt that when you have concerns, questioning the doctor is an entirely acceptable and justified approach. And it can save lives. I have never forgiven myself for not intervening more aggressively on one of my own patient’s behalf, with hindsight knowing that if I had, he would have survived. The only way to stop preventable deaths occurring in the NHS is to change our hospital culture, writes Dr Martin Scurr He’d taken himself to A&E — as in Martha’s case, to a top London hospital (although a different one) — on a Friday night with a high temperature, rigors (sweating and shivering) and severe pain down one side of his abdomen. Yes, he was nearly 90 and had type 2 diabetes and a history of heart surgery, but until the day he fell ill with a kidney infection, he’d been able to work — full time. Always dressed in a three-piece suit and the upright bearing of a gentleman, he was the image of how many of us would like to be seen at that seniority: elegant and cognitively intact. But when I went to the hospital to see him on the Monday afternoon after my morning appointments — with three days’ beard growth, desperately ill with developing sepsis, dehydrated and now slightly confused — he was lying parked in a corner bed, where he’d spent all weekend on a small dose of an antibiotic, by mouth: with sepsis he should have been on an antibiotic drip. I was worried about his state and I phoned the consultant (the ward staff were unhelpful, but I found the name of the consultant over the head of the bed). The consultant told me that as it was nearly 5pm, the patient would now be handed over to a new team. That was where I should have intervened — even though as just his GP, I had as much authority as any loved one. What my patient needed was immediate intensive care, but as I suspect many medics would do, I deferred to the hierarchy — I was treading on territory where I had no mandate, hoping instead that the consultant would inform the colleague who was about to take over, about my concern. But I should have stepped over that invisible line. For while those who cared for him in the real world knew this man in his normal, healthy and magnificent self, the hospital team clearly viewed him as a pre-terminal geriatric with a urinary infection. He died the next day having received minimal care with nobody keeping an eye on him to witness his rapid deterioration. I took his death very badly. I felt very guilty that I had not intervened more successfully. As I see it, a major contribution to this sort of tragedy is fragmentation of care — lack of continuity under one single hospital team. This is the result of the loss of the old system where care was provided by a traditional ‘firm’, a team headed by one or two consultants with senior registrars (just below the level of consultant), registrars, senior house officers (two to three years out of medical school) and housemen (recent graduates from medical school). Read More 'Changing the culture of the NHS': As Martha's Rule comes into force, what it means for you and your loved ones - and the complete list of hospitals already signed up In the old ‘firm’ system there was accountability going up through each level of the team: the most junior members saw the most of the patients and when things went badly, they aired their concerns with the next level up; for example, to the registrar, who may well discuss with the senior registrar, and at times the consultant was then involved. This might sound like a recipe for ‘group think’, a sort of mindless consensus of opinion — but my argument would be that the recurrent audit and introspection about whether the right action is being taken countered that. Also, it was not unheard of for a consultant or senior registrar to make a decision to ask another team to come and have a look — a sort of joint team meeting. The sense of responsibility of the firm meant you would often see the senior doctors pop in on the weekend if they were worried about a particular patient. But in my patient’s case, the old type of ‘firm’ had long gone (the victim of the shift in power to management and new restrictions on working hours). It was a weekend and so there was probably only one harassed junior doctor around, there was no Saturday ward round, probably nobody came to see my patient at all unless maybe one of the nursing team called the duty doctor to come along, who may have then shrugged their shoulders and noted that this was an old person on their way out... The old tight-knit team — caring for patients right through the duration of their period of treatment, holding full responsibility — has evolved into what we have now, with experience and increasing responsibility (and full accountability) lost. We will never get the genie back into the bottle and no amount of increased regulation or Care Quality Commission inspections and sanctions can possibly achieve the diligence of the past. Nor will a legal framework, Martha’s rule, enforcing the option of a second opinion when requested. Despite its undoubtedly good intentions, driven by such heartbreaking and needless tragedy, I believe that such a rule will be a non-starter: fiddling while Rome burns.

Eyebrows were raised when the Magpies made the trip Down Under just days after the conclusion of a long season with a summer of international football ahead. Newcastle beat Tottenham on penalties in a friendly in Melbourne before seeing a second string XI get hammered 8-0 by an A-League All Stars team just two days later. Few could see the justification of the two games on the other wise of the world with club legend Alan Shearer labelling it 'madness' and 'crazy'. And Staveley, who spent the weekend at the Monaco Grand Prix, admits she understands the concerns.

        "description": "Arguing for police remand, the police said that they wanted to investigate the hospital records, mobile phone details and other connected aspects, but accused Dr. Taware's lawyer Jitendra Sawant and others argued strongly against the police custody.",
        "content": "A Pune court magistrate A.A. Pande on Monday remanded two doctors of a government hospital and a peon to police custody till May 30 (Thursday) for alleged tampering of the blood samples of a minor boy whose Porsche car killed two techies. The medicos are -- Sassoon Hospital's Head of Forensics Department, Dr. Ajay Taware and Blood Bank head, Dr. Shrihari Halnor, besides a peon Atul Ghatkamble, who was the alleged conduit for the illegal gratification in the matter. Arguing for police remand, the police said that they wanted to investigate the hospital records, mobile phone details and other connected aspects, but accused Dr. Taware's lawyer Jitendra Sawant and others argued strongly against the police custody. Marking a sensational twist, Pune Commissioner of Police Amitesh Kumar said earlier on Monday that the blood samples analysed by the Sassoon Hospital did not match with the minor accused in the Porsche car crash. Kumar said that the purported blood sample of the 17-year-old who was caught in the car crash, was \"thrown in the dustbin\" and the blood sample analysed was of a 'third person', which is being probed now. The shocking details emerged barely hours after the Pune Police raided and arrested the senior doctors and the peon of the Sassoon Hospital for allegedly 'tampering' with the minor accused's blood report. \"We had taken a second blood sample which was given to another hospital for analysis with the intention of carrying out a DNA test later. Now, it has come to light that the Sassoon Hospital blood forensic report was of some other person,\" Kumar told mediapersons. Kumar said that Vishal A. Agarwal (the accused's father) had telephoned Dr. Taware on WhatsApp which is being probed, and the police now have sufficient technical evidence in the matter to prepare a water-tight case against all the accused. The three accused have been shunted to police custody for three days, as the charges of manipulating the crucial blood samples of the 17-year-old boy and submitting a fake blood test report could directly impact the prosecution case and the direction of the police investigation. \"I shall repeat... our case does not rest on the blood samples. The minor boy was in his full senses and aware of the consequences of drinking and driving the car at high speed,\" reiterated Kumar. The 'clean chit' in the blood test report of the accused minor boy, the son of a prominent realtor Vishal S. Agarwal, had sparked a huge row as it enabled him to get off on bail within 15 hours of the fatal May 19 crash in Kalyani Nagar area. In the same case, Vishal S. Agarwal, who was sent to judicial custody for 14 days, was booked in a case pertaining to the tampering of evidence, confining, luring and threatening driver Gangaram Poojari to take the blame for the accident, but he refused and has become a prime prosecution witness. The fatal crash claimed the lives of two IT engineers -- Ashwini Koshtha and her friend Aneesh Awadhiya -- both 24, and hailing from Madhya Pradesh. The minor boy is currently lodged in a Juvenile Correctional Home in Pune. His father is in judicial custody while his grandfather Surendra Kumar Agarwal is in police custody in the same case that has sparked a nationwide furor. So far, at least 9 persons have been arrested in the Porsche case, including three generations of the Agarwal family. They are -- the 17-year-old boy, his father Vishal S. Agarwal, his grandfather Surendra Kumar Agarwal, the two doctors, a peon, the three owners-managers of the pub and bar where the boy and his friends had partied on Saturday-Sunday night -- while two cops of Yerwada Police Station, PI Rahul Jagdale and API Vishwanath Todkari have been suspended for alleged dereliction of duty and other lapses pertaining to the accident, as public anger continues to simmer.",

        "description": "Two Texas metropolitan areas were the only two in the country to experience price drops in the four weeks ending May 19, according to a recent Redfin report.",
        "content": "While house prices in the U.S. reached another record high during the four weeks ending May 19, , two metropolitan areas in Texas have seen them sliding down in the same time frame, going against national trend. San Antonio and Fort Worth experienced the biggest—and only—year-over-year median sale price decreases in the four weeks ending May 19, with drops of respectively -1 percent and -0.6 percent. As of April, the latest data available on Redfin's website, the median sale price of a home in San Antonio was , up 1.5 percent year-over-year; in Fort Worth, it was $330,000, down 2.9 percent compared to April 2023. In the four weeks ending on May 19, the median U.S. home sale price hit a record $387,600, up 4 percent compared to a year earlier—an all-time high. The national median asking price reached a record $420,250 in the same period, up 6.6 percent year-over-year—another all-time high. contacted Redfin for comment by email on Monday. The steady rise of the price of homes in the U.S., which followed a brief housing market correction between late summer 2022 and spring 2023, is mainly being driven by a historic shortage of homes in the country. But stubbornly high mortgage rates are also playing a role, pricing out aspiring homebuyers and discouraging homeowners from letting go of their lower-mortgage properties and putting them on the market. ​​\"Move-up buyers feel stuck because they're ready for their next house, but it just doesn't make financial sense to sell with current interest rates so high,\" said , a Redfin agent in tah, in a news release. \"The homeowners listing right now are often doing so because they need to: one of my clients is selling because of a family emergency, and another couple is selling because they had a baby and simply don't have enough room,\" he added. \"Buyers should take note that many of today's sellers are motivated; if a home doesn't have other offers on the table, offer under asking price and/or ask for concessions because many sellers are willing to negotiate.\" High housing costs have led to one of the biggest declines in home sales in three months, according to Redfin. In the four weeks ending May 19, home sales were down 4.2 percent year-over-year. In the previous four-week period, home sales were down 4.4 percent compared to a year earlier. Three of the top five metropolitan areas with the biggest year-over-year increases were in California. In Anaheim, California, the median sale price of a home increased by 20.1 percent; in San Jose, California, by 12.9 percent; and in Oakland, California, by 12.5 percent. The other two cities in the top five were Detroit, Michigan, which experienced an increase of 16.9 percent and West Palm Beach, Florida, where the median sale price of a home rose by 12 percent.

        "content": "A couple of days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the infamous \"mujra\" remark about the opposition INDIA bloc in Bihar during the Lok Sabha election campaign, former Bihar chief minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Rabri Devi on Monday hit back in the same coin. She didn't hesitate to ridicule PM Modi when journalists drew her attention to the remark. She said, as quoted by news agency , \"And what does Modi do? Play the tabla?\" Rabri Devi, RJD's founding president and Lalu Prasad Yadav's wife, stated that facing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had “gone crazy and taken to blabbering\". On being asked to respond to a comment by PM Modi, who alleged that the INDIA bloc was receiving support from 'jihadis' sponsored by Pakistan, she said, \"If it is indeed so, what are the intelligence agencies doing? And before indulging in the dog whistle over Pakistan, they should remember one of their tallest leaders Lal Krishna Advani, who went on to become the deputy prime minister, was born in that country.\" What Asaduddin Owaisi said? Slamming the PM for making such comments, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi said the PM was doing a disco dance with China when the latter's troops reportedly captured around 2,000 square kilometres of the Indian territory. He took to X and wrote, \"@narendramodi Ji, you talked about Mujra, so Asaduddin Owaisi wants to ask you that for the last 3 years, China has occupied 2 thousand square kilometers of Indian land, Modi ji, you are not removing China, so were you doing Disco Dancing with China?\" \"Is this the type of language the prime minister should use? Does Modi think we do not have mouth to speak? ( ),\" Owaisi said. What PM Modi had said Addressing multiple poll rallies in Bihar, PM Modi attacked the INDIA bloc over the reservation issue and accused it of doing ‘mujra’ for the Muslim vote bank. \"I am giving the guarantee to Bihar SC, ST, OBC communities, till Modi is alive, I will not let them snatch away their rights. For Modi, the Constitution is supreme, for Modi, Babasaheb Ambedkar's sentiments are supreme... if the INDI alliance wants to accept the servitude of their vote bank, they are free to do so...if they want to perform mujra (dance), they are free to do... I will still stand with the SC, ST, and OBC reservations staunchly. ,\" he said. Following his comments, he was criticised by several opposition leaders, including Congress' Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, National Conference's Farooq Abdullah, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal's Tejashwi Yadav.

        "description": "Michael Higgs is best known for his role as Andy Hunter in Eastenders but the star is looking worlds away from his Walford days, sporting grey hair and glasses in his recent roles",
        "content": "BBC star Michael Higgs is barely recognisable two decades after his departure from the soap. He first graced Albert Square as Andy Hunter in 1993, initially working for The Firm and serving as the main enforcer for boss Jack Dalton. However, when Jack was bumped off by Dennis Rickman in 2003, Andy stepped up to fill the void. He eventually made Walford his home and took over The Firm. During his stint on Albert Square, Andy had run-ins with Den Watts, Billy Mitchell and Minty Peterson. He also had romantic entanglements with Kat Slater and Sam Mitchell. After hiring a hitman to take out Paul Truman, Andy met his end at the hands of fellow gangster Johnny Allen. Since leaving the show, he has led a totally different life. The 61-year-old has enjoyed a really successful career and appeared in Casualty twice, playing different characters in 2010 and 2016, and has had roles in New Tricks and Midsomer Murders, reports . He also made his mark on the big screen, featuring in films such as Assassination Games, Prisoners of the Sun and The Marine 6: Close Quarters. Michael is also well known for his role in the Bill.

The 52-year-old met her husband on the set of the police drama The Bill where she played the character of Rosie Fox The couple are parents to two children - Sonny Higgs, born in 2001, and Honour Higgs, born in 2006.

        "content": "With Young Africans' Stephane Aziz Ki still being linked with a move to the DStv Premiership and his contract on the brink of expiration, the attacker's preferred next destination has reportedly been revealed. The Burkina Faso international's future in Dar es Salaam hangs in the balance. The Tanzanian Premier League season is approaching its end and, consequently, so is the attacking midfielder's time with Yanga, as things stand. The 28-year-old's contract at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium expires at the end of the campaign, and his team is seemingly desperate to keep hold of his services after he helped them tremendously both domestically and on the continent. The Ivory Coast-born attacker has 17 goals in the league and is vying for Golden Boot honours, and also has two goals and two assists in the 12 CAF Champions League matches he played in for his club. As such, Yanga want to retain the 12-cap Burkinabe's services, and club president Hersi Said is believed to have initiated negotiations over an extension, but so far, Aziz Ki has not put pen to paper on a new deal. According to , the reason for his reluctance to commit his future to Young Africans is because he is leaning towards a move outside of Tanzania, preferably South Africa. The record Tanzanian champions are believed to have made a lucrative offer for him to extend his stay, but Aziz Ki is believed to be more receptive to accepting a move to the PSL. In recent weeks, the Adjame native has been linked with possible moves to the likes Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, and given that he is approaching free agency, he has his destiny in his own hands.

        "content": "Holidaymakers in Menorca have been barred from its picturesque streets after fed up locals have taken to chaining them off. Residents in the whitewashed town of Binibeca Vell have blocked off some of their labyrinthine, Instagrammable streets which have earned it the title of the \"Mykonos of Spain\". Locals claim the small, cobbled streets have been flooded with tourists intruding on their private properties vying for the perfect holiday snap. Some claim rowdy tourists have even scaled balconies and entered their doorways. Thick ropes and chains with 'no pedestrians' signs have now been strung across some streets in a bid to keep out non-residents between 8pm and 11am. The small town of 500 people on the south of the Balearic island has become increasingly popular with tourists, with 800,000 annual visitors. The blockades are among a spate of drastic measures taken across popular destinations in Europe protesting against mass tourism. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly The town's stunning cobbled streets have been cordoned off to tourists ( Image: MMN/SOLARPIX.COM) Binibeca residents are set to take a vote in August on whether to ban tourists altogether, The Telegraph reports. Head of the town's residents association Óscar Monge has accused Menorcan authorities of not doing enough to mitigate the impact of mass tourism. \"Binibeca is promoted by the administration and tourism companies, but what benefit do we get out of it?\" he said. \"We pay dearly for being the most potent tourist attraction in Menorca.\" Locals in Ibiza have taken to street protests over the number of boozed-up, partying tourists making life chaos for permanent residents, while graffiti in a Majorcan town left the stark message, \"tourist go home\". Meanwhile, thousands staged demonstrations in the Canary Islands last month over fears the influx of visitors is damaging the environment. The town receives 800,000 visitors a year despite only 500 permanent residents ( Image: MMN/SOLARPIX.COM) A statement on Binibeca's website has already asked tourists not to visit in the evenings or early mornings, with pictures showing people splayed out across steps and even sitting in one resident's chair. Mr Monge previously told The Guardian the town was \"not a place of adventure\" but a \"private housing development\". Residents in the town were given nearly £13,000 by the Spanish government to deal with rubbish left by tourists, but it's understood the deal has not been renewed. Some 1.2million people live permanently on the Balearics, which consists of Menorca, Majorca, and party hotspot Ibiza. The figure of full-time residents however is outnumbered dramatically by the 18million who visited in 2023 - a record-high for the archipelago.",

        "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves are facing a seemingly insurmountable task following their loss to the Dallas Mavericks in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, but Anthony Edwards is nowhere near ready to throw in the towel. Edwards had 26 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists against the Mavericks on Sunday night, but it wasn’t enough to keep the Timberwolves from falling into a 3-0 series hole. There have been 154 teams in NBA history that have gone down 3-0 in a series, and none have come back to win. Following Minnesota’s loss on Saturday, Edwards could be heard in the locker room telling his teammates to get ready to make history. “Time to make history, fellas,” Edwards told the Timberwolves, via Sam Amick of The Athletic . “I still don’t feel like they can beat us, bro. We haven’t all been clicking at one time. One game. One game.” Edwards then acknowledged that no team has ever come back from a 3-0 series deficit and asked his teammates, “What are we gonna do?” The Timberwolves swept the Phoenix Suns in the opening round of the playoffs. They then beat the Denver Nuggets in seven games after going up 2-0, so they are plenty battle tested. The problem is Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are both playing incredible basketball, which has made the Mavericks difficult to beat. Edwards made a big statement when he threw down the dunk of the playoffs in Game 3, but Doncic and Irving scored 33 points each to lead the Mavs to another win. There is almost no chance Minnesota will win four straight games, but Edwards is doing what he can to be a leader in a nearly impossible situation.

        "description": "Even newbies are clambering aboard at record levels, with a surge in younger passengers deciding weeklong trips at sea aren’t “only for the elderly.”",
        "content": "Virgin Voyages' Scarlet Lady cruise near Weymouth, United Kingdom. Finnbarr Webster | Getty Images News | Getty Images Lots of people will be getting their sea legs this summer. Ports have been packed with cruise ships over the last few years, as vacationers flock to ever larger vessels and operators race to accommodate a surge in post-pandemic bookings — many of them from first-time passengers. The industry expects even more this year. Benjamin Xiang, a San Francisco-based flight attendant, went on his first cruise last August, setting aside his reservations about \"cruise people\" and a type of trip he'd imagined would be \"not my travel style.\" Taking advantage of a Virgin Voyages promotion that let him use credit card points to cover the $2,500 bill, Xiang booked a weeklong, all-inclusive, adults-only cruise from Barcelona, with stops at Mallorca, Ibiza and along the French Riviera. \"I invited my best friend, we prepaid a $600 bar tab, and we were like, 'We'll just hang by the pool, read a book or something,'\" said Xiang, 35. \"Turned out we partied every single night and had a blast.\" He's among the many cruise newbies who've helped power the industry's recent growth. Some 27% of cruise passengers over the past two years have been first-timers, up 12% from the prior two-year period, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), a trade group. \"Will I go back? I think yes,\" Xiang said. \"Will I pay this time? Yes.\" That's exactly what cruise operators are hoping for, and so far they're getting it: 82% of all cruisers say they'll book again, CLIA's latest report found. After welcoming 31.7 million passengers last year, 7% more than in 2019, the industry expects volumes to swell to 34.7 million by the end of 2024. Experts say a combination of newcomers, repeat bookers and younger travelers are powering the uptick. Like Xiang, many first-time cruisers are groups of friends traveling together, said Jennifer Klaussen, who owns Sundari Travel in Malibu, California. \"Once they get on a cruise and realize it's not what they thought it would be, they're usually interested in future cruises and diverse destinations,\" she said, adding that newer operators have managed to \"reduce the stigma associated with cruising — that it's only for the elderly.\" Onlookers gather at South Pointe Park to watch Royal Caribbean's \"Icon of the Seas\", the world's largest cruise ship, as it sails from Port Miami on its maiden cruise, in Miami Beach, Florida on January 27, 2024.

Tesla shareholders get to vote America's child care shortage is pushing military families to a breaking point Passengers under age 40, including kids, made up around 42% of cruisegoers last year, up from 35% in 2019, according to CLIA. While the average age of a cruise customer is 46 industrywide, millennials now make up nearly the same share — 22% — as baby boomers and Gen Xers, who each comprise 24%. \"The cruise industry has been hard at work to launch new ships and experiences that are attractive to a younger, newer demographic,\" said Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic, \"whether that's a big, new ship with eye-catching attractions for families, or more bucket-list-worthy experiences like sailings in the Galapagos or Antarctica.\" Amenities don't hurt either, said Nathan Rosenberg, chief brand officer at Virgin Voyages, which began sailing only in 2021, as the cruise industry rebounded from the pandemic. \"Millennials and Gen Z love the fact that everything is included. Think meals foodies would love, tips covered, Wi-Fi to stay connected and a ton of fitness classes,\" he said. Vessels are getting bigger to handle the growing demand. In January, Royal Caribbean Group launched Icon of the Seas — currently the world's largest cruise ship, with 20 decks, 40 restaurants and room for more than 7,000 passengers and 3,000 crew members. The company, meanwhile, reported a 16% increase in new cruisegoers between this year and last across its various cruise lines. Nearly half of all Royal Caribbean guests are millennials or younger, CEO Jason Liberty said on the company's first-quarter earnings call. Similarly, Norwegian Cruise Lines CEO Harry Sommer told CNBC earlier this month, \"We appeal obviously to older customers, but millennial and Gen Z is the fastest-growing segment of our cruising right now.\" Cruises generally aren't cheap, though, and Sommer noted that the company's target customer is middle- or upper-income. As consumer spending cools down across much of the economy, Americans are adjusting their summer vacation plans to fit their budgets. The share of travelers put off by steep prices hit 32% in Deloitte's annual summer travel survey , up sharply from 24% last year. But more affluent vacationers still seem eager to shell out on everything from first-class airfare to luxury train trips , as the industry continues to push premium offerings . \"More higher-income travelers are headed to cruises,\" whereas \"lower-income travelers are going camping,\" the Deloitte report, released Tuesday, said. (\"RV trips are up across the board,\" it added.) That doesn't mean cruise passengers aren't paying attention to price.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jaclyn Groh will be going on her first cruise in March 2025, sailing around the Caribbean. The 34-year-old therapist and social work professor at Ohio State University in Columbus typically takes her family on boat trips on a lake, beach visits, \"and of course the occasional Disney adventure for the kiddos,\" said Groh. While some of her friends have done family cruises, she's never been interested in the largest cruise ships because they seem \"overwhelming.\" But in shopping around for a vacation next year for just her and her husband, Groh said her travel agent's description of the packages available won her over. The smaller Explora II vessel she opted for has a \"boutique feel that we love,\" she said. And it's priced about the same as the resort in Curaçao where the couple will be celebrating their 10th anniversary this fall. That week on land will run about $6,500, while the cruise comes to about $6,700. \"The price seems very reasonable for all of the inclusions, and yet with the cruise we will get to experience so many new locations and excursions,\" said Groh, who's looking forward to \"a perfect combination of resting in luxury and adventuring.\"",

        "content": "Three of the six outgoing Cyprus MEPs seem to be set for re-election and a far-right party could win its first European seat on June 9, when voters will also have to choose new mayors, municipal and village councillors, a recent opinion poll found. Incumbents Loucas Fourlas from the Democratic Rally (DISY-EPP), Giorgos Georgiou of the left-wing AKEL (GUE-NGL) and Costas Mavrides of the centre-right Democratic Party (DIKO-S&D) could hold on to their seats in the European Parliament, with DISY and AKEL expected to secure two seats each and DIKO one, according to the Kathimerini Cyprus survey. The poll, conducted by Symmetron Market Research among 800 respondents, found that DISY would garner 22.8% of the votes and retain two seats, AKEL would get 21.6% and also secure two seats, while far-right ELAM could win third place with 10.7% of the votes, ahead of DIKO’s 9.1%. With Fourlas expected to get 62% of the DISY preference votes, it will be a close race for the second seat between former Cabinet members Michalis Hadjipantelas (ex-Minister of Health) and Constantintinos Petrides (ex-Finance), who would get 33% and 31%, respectively, according to the Kathimerini survey. From the party of The Left, Giorgos Georgiou is expected an easy win with 49% of the preference votes, followed by newcomer economist Anna Theologou at 28%, marginally ahead of University of Cyprus professor Niyazi Kizilyurek, the only Turkish Cypriot MEP since Cyprus joined the EU in 2004. The surprise of this election race could be ELAM winning its first seat in the European Parliament, with the far-right nationalist party represented by its party spokesman, Geadis Geadi, who is expected to get 46% of the preferences, outbidding former government spokesman Marios Pelekanos who switched camps from DISY, after the EPP-aligned party overlooked him for the EP ticket. The sixth Cyprus seat will probably go to incumbent Costas Mavrides, by far the most popular within DIKO, who would get 62% of the preference votes, ahead of local MP Chrysis Pantelides (26%) and former MEP Dr Eleni Theocharous (24%). The sixth seat was held by Demetris Papadakis, formerly of socialist EDEK (S&D) who broke away from the party, before being sacked, over a conflict with the leadership. Only one woman? This would mean that once again Cyprus could have just one woman MEP in Brussels and Strasbourg, with the traditional parties making a poor showing when it comes to female candidates. The Democratic Front (DIPA), an offshoot from DIKO, would be far below the threshold with 3.8% and would not elect an MEP, nor would EDEK (3.3%), Volt (2.6%) or the Greens (2.3%). The Kathimerini poll also found that the Cypriot public had a positive opinion (60%) about the European Union and 52% had a favourable view about the European Parliament, with 61% saying they would show up to vote on June 9, while 25% said they would not. The economy and rising costs are the determining factor for voters, followed by the Cyprus problem, and migrants. The pollsters Symmetron also asked about the three leading political personalities on the island, with public opinion being generally negative about President Nikos Christodoulides (57%, 31% positive, 12% “don’t know”). Opposition AKEL’s General Secretary Stephanos Stephanou also had a negative view among those polled (46%, 34% positive and 20% “don’t know”) House Speaker and DISY leader Annita Demetrious had a better view among those questioned, with 49% in her favour, 39% negative and 12% “don’t know”. Deputy government spokesman Yiannis Antoniou sufficed to say that these are not presidential elections. “We are watching with respect, avoiding comments,” he said, adding that, “any messages arising from the elections will be reviewed in due course.”",

        "content": "Alexander Zverev scripted history at the Philippe-Chatrier Court after beating Spanish ace Rafael Nadal at the French Open . The German star claimed a 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 victory in the first round to knock out Nadal. Notably, Zverev has become only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros. The latter, who owns 14 Roland Garros titles, returned to Paris after batting successive injuries. Here are the match stats Zverev won a total of 112 points and 44 winners throughout the match. He served eight aces compared to Zverev's two. The German had a win percentage of 58 and 48 in the first and second serves, respectively. Nadal won 19 of his 21 net points. Both Nadal and Zverev recorded 30 unforced errors. They registered three double-faults each. Third man to beat Nadal at French Open Before this match, Nadal had only lost to Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic at the French Open. Soderling defeated him in the fourth round in 2009, while Djokovic remains the only player to defeat Nadal twice in the tournament (quarter-finals, 2015 and semi-finals, 2021). Between 2015 and 2021, Nadal was unbeaten in as many as 35 matches at the French Open. Fourth Roland Garros defeat for Nadal Nadal now has a win-loss record of 112-4 at Roland Garros. He has been knocked out for the first time before the fourth round. Notably, the Spaniard also holds the record for winning 39 consecutive French Open matches. It is worth noting that Nadal won four French Open titles without losing a set (2008, 2010, 2017, and 2020), the most for a player. 14-time French Open winner Nearly two decades after winning his maiden Grand Slam title, Nadal owns a total of 14 French Open honors (2005-2008, 2010-2014, 2017-2020, and 2022). The Spaniard has won eight more Roland Garros titles than Bjorn Borg , who owns six titles (second-most). Nadal also holds the record for winning most titles at a Grand Slam and on a single surface (clay). Unwanted numbers for Nadal As per Opta , this was only the second instance of Nadal trailing by two sets to 0 at the French Open, after the quarter-finals in 2015, whre he lost to Novak Djokovic. Notably, Nadal won nine of his previous 11 matches at the French Open after having lost the first set. Zverev coming off title in Rome As mentioned, Zverev became the third player to claim a French Open win over Nadal, who has faced 74 different opponents at this event. Notably, the German is coming off a title-winning run at Rome Masters. Earlier this year, he lost the Australian Open semi-final to Daniil Medvedev . Zverev is now 29-9 on the ATP Tour in 2024.",

        "content": "This news has been read 98 times! KUWAIT CITY, May 27: Salmiya Club has renewed the contract of Libyan professional Senussi Al-Hadi for two seasons, following his standout performance since joining the team during the winter transfer period last January. Al-Hadi, who has earned the trust of Salmiya’s technical staff led by Croatian coach Ante Misha, played a pivotal role in the team’s success. Coach Misha, who originally brought Al-Hadi to the club, personally requested the renewal of the Libyan professional’s contract. Additionally, Brazilian player Alex Lima’s contract has been extended for another season, as per Misha’s request. Coach Misha himself has a contract with Salmiya until the end of the next season. Meanwhile, decisions are pending regarding the future of three other foreign players: Brazilian Sebastião Junior “Seba”, Ghanaian Issaka Abudu, and Gambian Sang Pierre. While Seba seems likely to continue for another season, Abudu and Sang Pierre’s futures remain uncertain. In addition to securing their foreign players, Salmiya Club has also announced contract renewals with several local players. Badr Jamal and Muhammad Al-Huwaidi have both signed on for two more seasons, while Moaz Al-Asmaa’s contract has been extended for three seasons. Team captain Fahd Al-Mujamd and players Abdul Mohsen Al-Turkmani and Yousef Al-Onaizan have all renewed for one season each. Further decisions regarding the remaining local players are pending, with the club management awaiting a comprehensive report from Coach Misha, which is expected by the end of the week. Looking ahead to next season, Salmiya Club aims to bolster its roster with skilled local and foreign players, to compete for local championships. Despite recent setbacks, including a loss in the Amir Cup final, the club remains determined to return to championship form. Their last major title was the Crown Prince Championship in the 2014-2015 season. Hassan Musa Al-Seyassah/Arab Times Staff This news has been read 98 times!",

        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Whitewater kayaking or rafting on the Ottawa River is a totally unique way to discover Canada's ... [+] national capital. (Photo by David E. Klutho) Between Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Quebec City, Canada boasts four amazing urban areas that should be on everyone’s travel bucket list. Now it’s time to add a fifth — Ottawa . That may seem like an odd choice. Without doubt, it’s a bastion of bureaucrats, politicians and government agencies. Normally the recipe for a bland or boring visitor experience. Yet Ottawa bucks the trend with a variety of cultural attractions and outdoor adventure experiences, plus a surprisingly good culinary scene — and maybe you can blame the politicians for this last one — great drinking establishments. Located around halfway between Toronto and Montreal, Canada’s national capital sprawls along the south side of the Ottawa River in eastern Ontario , and as such lies on the cusp of both English and French speaking Canada. Yet Ottawa never would have made the leap from backwoods outpost to big city if it wasn’t for widespread paranoia that the Americans wanted to make British Canada part of their new United States. Fearing a Yankee invasion of the St. Lawrence River valley, the Canadians created the Rideau Canal as a watery bypass in case of war. Located at the confluence of the canal and the Ottawa River, it wasn’t long before Bytown (as it was called then) began to boom. Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time At Lower Price Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50% Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone When her Canadian subjects couldn’t decide on a national government location, Queen Victoria intervened and named Ottawa as the capital in 1857. Yet it’s only recently — thanks to a bevy of new experiences and attractions — that Ottawa has burst onto the global tourism scene. Navigating the Rideau Canal between Parliament Hill and the Fairmont Chateau Laurier. Outdoor Adventure in an Urban Setting Ottawa makes great use of its riverside location with a range of ways to work up a sweat. One of the most thrilling is Interzip , a 1,200-foot-long double zipline that whisks riders 120 feet above the Ottawa River at a speed of around 25 miles per hour. Farther upstream, Wilderness Tours offers guided whitewater trips in rafts, kayaks and sportyak flexible one-person dinghies on the Ottawa River. The aquatic adventures range from low to extreme intensity, and there’s also flatwater tubing for those who prefer it slow and easy. One of the coolest ways to explore Ottawa is scooting around town on a muscle-powered or electric bike. Escape Bicycle Tours on the Sparks Street pedestrian mall rents various types of bikes and scooters, and offers guided cycling tours that include Parliament Hill, Rideau Hall park, and two bridge crossings over the Ottawa River. Running right through the middle of the city, the historic Rideau Canal provides plenty of scope for outdoor fun. The Rideau Canal Eastern Pathway , a leafy hiking and biking trail, stretches five miles between the Senate Building and Prince of Wales Falls. Or hire a cabin cruiser at Le Boat on Dow’s Lake for overnight voyages down the Rideau Canal from Ottawa into the Ontario wilderness. T-Rex ambush in the dinosaur gallery at the Canadian Museum of Nature. Indoor Art and Adventures Located in the castle-like Victoria Memorial Building, the Canadian Museum of Nature offers a cutting-edge glimpse of the nation’s incredibly diverse flora, fauna and geology. With many hands-on exhibits and a dinosaur gallery with more than 200 specimens, the museum is ideal for families with children. Over on the art side, the National Gallery of Canada runs all the way from the Renaissance and Baroque through Impressionism 20 th -century Canadian and American painters and sculptors. Designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie, the gallery is an artwork all on its own. And don’t forget to snap a selfie with Maman , the giant metal and marble spider by artist Louise Bourgeois out front. Duck into the Canadian Senate and House of Commons on Parliament Hill on short, guided tours, or a self-guided (free) immersive experience that includes a 360° multimedia show. Even if you don’t go inside, scan the lofty Peace Tower for stone gargoyles and grotesque human figures. Ottawa’s most unusual indoor attraction is on the outskirts of the city and underground — Diefenbunker: Canada's Cold War Museum . Between 1961 when it was completed and 1994 when it was decommissioned, the massive, four-story concrete bunker was a fallout shelter where the Canadian government would take refuge in case of a nuclear attack. One-hour guided tours cover the bunker’s history and highlights. Colorful cocktails at Stolen Goods. Ottawa Eats and Sleeps Sure you can get poutine, butter tarts and salmon steak. But the city’s culinary scene has grown increasingly diverse, restaurants that focus on various global cuisines or modern Canadian cooking. One of the hottest tables in town is Riviera on Sparks Street. The menu offers modern takes on Canadian favorites like smoked duck breast, Alberta sirloin steak, steelhead trout and Newfoundland codfish and mussels in a revitalized Art Deco interior that was once a bank. Slated to open later this year, Antheia restaurant is the latest creation from chef and owner Briana Kim, who won top prize at the 2023 Canadian Culinary Championship with her innovative takes on vegetarian and vegan foods. Ethnic eats step into the limelight in the Byward Market neighborhood, which includes the historic redbrick market pavilion (built in the 1920s) and surrounding streets. The selection ranges from dim sum and Southeast Asian street food at Sidedoor and classic Canadian-style shawarma at Three Brothers to Indian cuisine at Shafali Bazaar and tasty leaves from around the planet at Teastore . Ottawa’s best new bar is Stolen Goods , a tiny cocktail lounge on Sparks Street with a racoon mascot, delicious seafood snacks and offbeat drinks like the Three Brothers vegan gimlet and the Jungle Adventures tropical cocktail with Fruit Loops foam. Unveiled in 1912 as one of Canada’s elegant railway hotels, the Fairmont Château Laurier remains the iconic place to overnight in Ottawa. Located beside Parliament Hill and the Rideau Canal, it affords an ideal base to explore the city by foot or bike. If modern designer-savvy is more your style, book a room with a view at the high-rise Le Germain Hotel , which is right beside the Ottawa Art Gallery and walking distance to Byward Market. Or go totally homey at the Auberge King Edward Bed & Breakfast , in a 1902 Victorian manse between Ottawa University and Byward Market. Halibut with clams and fava beans at Riviera restaurant.

        "description": "Former chief executive Paula Vennells was booed by wrongly convicted subpostmasters last week",
        "content": "News | UK Scotland Yard has recruited around 80 detectives for its criminal investigation into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, it emerged on Monday. The Metropolitan Police announced a nationwide probe will examine potential offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice by senior executives and tech giant Fujitsu. Since January 2020, a core team of officers and staff has been looking at wide-ranging allegations following a referral from the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Guardian reported Yard chiefs asked the government for a special grant of at least £6.75 million to fund the operation. Resources will be similar to UK-wide counter-terrorism investigation. Last week former Post Office boss Paula Vennells was booed by wrongly convicted subpostmasters at the ongoing public inquiry in central London . More than 700 were prosecuted by her investigators and handed criminal convictions between 1999 and 2015. Fujitsu’s faulty Horizon IT system made it appear as though money was missing at their branches. Hundreds are still awaiting compensation despite the Government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts. Commander Stephen Clayman, overseeing the probe, said on Monday: “We understand the widespread and devastating impact the Post Office IT Horizon scandal has had on hundreds of sub-postmasters across the country. “The Met began a criminal investigation in January 2020 focused on offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice. “A team of detectives has been painstakingly working through millions of documents manually and with the help of specialist software, in parallel with the Public Inquiry. “This is very time consuming and we cannot cut corners and risk missing evidence.

        "content": "The Texas A&M baseball team’s path to Omaha will run through College Station. The Aggies were selected as the No. 3 overall seed in the NCAA tournament Monday, and will have the opportunity to play on their home field the first two weekends of the postseason. A&M (44-13) will face fourth-seeded Grambling (26-26) on Friday at noon on ESPN+. Texas is the No. 3 seed in the Bryan-College Station Regional and will face second-seeded Louisiana on Friday at 5 p.m. on ESPNU. The regional round is a four-team, double-elimination format. The winner of the regional advances to the super regional round where the winner of the best-of-3 series moves onto the eight-team College World Series. A&M's regional is paired with No. 14 overall seed UC-Santa Barbara, which is hosting Oregon, San Diego and Fresno State. This will be the third time A&M has been paired with rival Texas in a regional during the schools' 13-year hiatus as conference foes. The Aggies were eliminated by the Longhorns in the 2014 Houston Regional final and lost to the Longhorns in a winner's bracket game in the 2018 Austin Regional. A&M beat Texas 9-2 this season on March 5 in a midweek game played in Austin. The Longhorns are 35-22 overall this season and were 20-10 in Big 12 Conference play. A&M is 2-0 all-time vs. Grambling. The schools last met in 2013. The Aggies are 14-9 all-time vs. Louisiana. The Cajuns were in the College Station Regional in 2022. The Aggies beat the Cajuns in a winner's bracket game. In 2007, A&M came through the loser's bracket and beat Louisiana twice in one day to advance to the super regionals. The Aggies learned Sunday night they would host a regional for the 13th time in school history. This marks the highest seed in program history as the Aggies earned a national seed for the fourth time. The NCAA announced the Aggies would be a top-four seed on Monday morning. Tennessee, which won the Southeastern Conference regular and tournament titles, is the No. 1 seed. Kentucky is the No. 2 overall seed. Success in conference play and an undefeated nonconference record helped the Aggies secure a high seed despite losing two of their last three conference series and going 0-2 in the SEC tournament. The Aggies get to return home, though, where they are 32-3 this season. Should A&M advance, it would get to play on its home field in the super regional round as it pursues an eighth appearance in the College World Series. The last time A&M was an NCAA tournament host was 2022 when the Aggies earned the No. 5 seed and went unbeaten in the regional and super regional rounds en route to the College World Series.

        "content": "Decision soon on Enzo Maresca to Chelsea plus update on other candidates We keep hearing so many stories about the Chelsea manager situation, which is normal of course after the departure of Mauricio Pochettino, and with so many other clubs also changing managers this summer, but I wanted to clarify some things here. As things stand, Ruben Amorim is not in talks with Chelsea – my understanding is that he is not a candidate as Chelsea would prefer someone with experience of working in English football. So, despite rumours, Amorim is not holding talks over the Chelsea job. Kieran McKenna also looks to be out of the running now, though he’s also wanted by Brighton and they’re waiting for his decision. They want an answer from him soon as they search for a replacement for Roberto de Zerbi. Finally, Xavi has also been linked with the Chelsea job but again I’m not hearing anything concrete on that one. Xavi is open to opportunities after leaving Barcelona, but at the moment it’s all quiet there and I have no news on any talks taking place or being planned with Chelsea. So, the situation is that Chelsea are interested in Enzo Maresca and he’s also interested in the Chelsea job after positive contacts took place over the weekend. It’s now up to Chelsea – decision time is coming soon, and Leicester are waiting to see what happens there before they then decide on who to hire as a replacement. Sofyan Amrabat drops hint over future but it could depend on the manager situation While there has understandably been a lot of talk about the Manchester United manager situation, with Erik ten Hag’s future recently looking about 50-50 for him to stay or leave Old Trafford, there was also another interesting story to follow after the Red Devils’ FA Cup final win over Manchester City. Sofyan Amrabat had a good game for United and spoke afterwards to hint that he could still end up staying at the club. However, my understanding is that nothing has been communicated to Fiorentina or the player side yet. It will depend also on the manager situation, so it will be part of the review that Man United will do this week. In January, Juventus and Barcelona were interested but Man United never opened doors for Amrabat to leave. Liverpool have scouted Leny Yoro but Lille’s asking price will be important One of the top young centre-backs in Europe right now and one to watch on the market is Leny Yoro of Lille. I’ve reported on his future before, with a lot of interest, a lot of clubs scouting him, and now we’re seeing more reports and links about strong interest from Liverpool. As I’ve mentioned previously, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are absolutely in the race for Yoro. It’s also the case that Liverpool have been scouting him, but at the moment the situation is really based on what kind of price Lille will ask for – all clubs are basically waiting for that. Liverpool could strengthen at centre-back this summer, as I’ve reported before, but let’s see if this scouting and monitoring of Yoro turns into anything more concrete. For now, it’s just normal scouting of a top talent, and my understanding is that PSG and Real Madrid are very much in the race for his signature. Arsenal linked with left-back, plus possible exit It could be an important summer for Arsenal, but at the moment some of the we’re seeing may be a little premature. I’m aware, for example, of a lot of stories coming out involving Fenerbahce left-back Ferdi Kadioglu, but I don’t have concrete updates on that for the moment. Kadioglu is always been linked with several clubs – there have been stories about Aston Villa as well as Arsenal – but there is no news yet. A move to the Premier League is concrete possibility, but for now we have to wait a bit longer and see which club will really go for it. It’s also been reported that Fabio Vieira could leave Arsenal after a lack of playing time. My understanding, however, is that it depends on proposals. So far it’s quiet but for players like Vieira (not all of them) there’s a chance to leave in case of a good proposal coming in. We just have to be patient on that one.",

        "content": "DEAR DEIDRE: When I said I didn’t want another baby until our relationship improves my partner went into a full-blown rage. He works away most of the time on the oil rigs. He is 38 and I’m 35. He’s a good dad when he’s here but most of the time, I feel like a single parent. I had postnatal depression after our little one was born and my partner only stayed a week at home. I was left to cope. He comes home and all he wants is sex. If I refuse him, I get the big sulk which can last days. He doesn’t trust me. If I arrange to go out while he’s away, he contacts my friends to check that I’m with them. He thinks I cheat on him but I don’t. It’s caused such arguments, so when he said he wanted a baby brother or sister for our toddler, I said no. Get in touch with the Dear Deidre team Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors. Fill out and submit our easy-to-use and confidential form and the Dear Deidre team will get back to you. You can also send a private message on the DearDeidreOfficial Facebook page or email us at: deardeidre@the-sun.co.uk I feel things between us are toxic right now. He loves our little boy but he doesn’t help me with DIY or general chores. I don’t think this is the right time to bring another baby into our family. MORE FROM DEAR DEIDRE DEIDRE'S STORIES Connor's controlling girlfriend finds out he's at the park SO HOSTILE I'm dating a girl my mum hates but don't know how to tell her DEIDRE SAYS: You’re right. A child deserves two loving parents, not two warring ones. People often think that a baby will paper over the cracks in a relationship but the stress caused with deprivation of sleep and a diminished bank balance can drive a wedge between the strongest of couples. Give a child the best start in life by making your relationship as good as it can be. Tell your partner that you need more emotional support and a better understanding about your sex life – when you say no, it doesn’t mean that you don’t love him. There’s no shame in asking for help so find couples counselling locally or contact the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (bacp.co.uk, 01455 883 300).

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email Maintaining seamless business connectivity is more crucial than ever in today’s digital age. Companies rely on robust IT networks to ensure they remain competitive, agile, and capable of meeting operational demands. Effective network support is the backbone of uninterrupted business processes, supporting everything from basic internet connectivity to complex data analysis tasks. The importance of network support At its core, network support ensures that a company’s network infrastructure functions optimally. This infrastructure includes various components such as servers, desktops, mobile devices, and connectivity hardware. IT network support encompasses monitoring, maintaining, and continuously improving these systems to prevent downtime and ensure efficient operations. Enhancing security with managed firewall services A managed firewall is a key aspect of network support that significantly enhances security. A managed firewall is a service that provides enhanced security measures to protect a company’s network from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and data breaches. By having a dedicated team managing the firewall, businesses can ensure that the firewall’s configurations are continually updated to defend against the latest threats. This proactive approach secures the IT environment and optimizes the network’s performance, ensuring that security measures do not impede business operations. The role of IT professional services To further strengthen network infrastructure, businesses often turn to IT professional services . These services provide expertise and technical skills that many businesses may not possess in-house. IT professional services can include everything from network design and configuration to troubleshooting and ongoing support. By leveraging these professional services, businesses can ensure their network is robust, secure, and aligned with their needs and growth objectives. Business benefits of robust IT network support Below are the key business benefits of maintaining a strong and responsive IT network, each contributing significantly to the operations’ overall success and scalability. Increased productivity A well-supported IT network directly contributes to higher productivity levels. Employees can perform their duties more efficiently with fewer interruptions due to technical issues. A strong network keeps business operations running smoothly, whether it’s faster internal communication, quicker access to cloud resources, or reliable remote access capabilities. Improved customer experience In the digital economy, customer expectations are continually rising . A reliable network ensures that customer-facing platforms are always operational, enhancing the customer experience. Online transactions, customer support interfaces, and digital product delivery systems depend heavily on uninterrupted network performance. Cost efficiency Investing in quality network support can reduce the overall IT costs for a business. Regular maintenance and timely upgrades prevent costly downtime and expensive emergency repairs. Moreover, with managed services, businesses can predict their monthly IT expenditures more accurately, which aids in better financial planning. Scalability As businesses grow, their network needs evolve. Quality IT network support includes scalability as a core feature. As your business expands, your network grows, seamlessly supporting more users, processing more data, and integrating new technologies without performance lapses. Final thoughts In today’s dynamic business environment, mastering IT network support is essential for organizations aiming for long-term success and resilience. By incorporating comprehensive IT professional services like network support and managed firewall capabilities, companies can enhance operational efficiency, fortify security measures, and ensure seamless communication across all channels. With a trusted IT management partner like Vital Integrators , your company can fully leverage the benefits of advanced technology to foster growth, innovation, and enhanced customer engagement. Keeping up with the latest trends and adopting best practices will ensure that your IT network support strategy is effective and flexible, ready to adapt to future challenges and opportunities in the ever-changing world of technology.

        "content": "Don't criticise Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer for asking Erik ten Hag proper questions. They rose above TV football's wasteland of vacuous chummery and prehistoric banter, writes OLIVER HOLT The BBC duo have been criticised for their post-FA Cup questions of Erik ten Hag But all criticism of their interview with the Man United boss should be laughed at Their second goal was one of the great FA Cup goals... Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Oliver Holt Published: 17:23, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:07, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Let me tell you what happened after the FA Cup Final finished and the BBC moved into the post-match phase of its coverage late on Saturday afternoon. It’s not complicated. Neither man fawned over Erik ten Hag after United’s shock victory over Manchester City . Neither man attempted to make him laugh with a lame joke because they were scared of angering him. Neither man ducked the responsibility of confronting the issue everyone was talking about. Neither of them took the easy way out of blaming ‘the media’ for the criticism that Ten Hag has received over recent months, a favourite of former athletes who have a habit of forgetting that they are now ‘the media’, too. Lineker and Shearer are superb broadcasters and both of them did their job as interviewers. They were respectful and polite towards Ten Hag but they are not wide-eyed kids talking to their heroes. Gary Lineker quizzed Erik ten Hag on his future in the immediate aftermath of Man United's FA Cup triumph Lineker and Shearer have defended themselves following criticism, insisting they did not overstep the mark The Dutchman's FA Cup victory means United have now won two trophies in two seasons under Ten Hag Podcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola? EPISODE 90: How Manchester United CAN win crunch FA Cup clash EPISODE 89: Why Manchester City aren't the reason the League is boring 'It hasn't worked!' Is VAR the problem or the solution? EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify So they asked the questions they needed to ask, about why United, who finished eighth in the Premier League, had not played like this before. And whether Ten Hag knew if he would still be at the club next season. They were entirely legitimate questions. They many not have been the questions Ten Hag wanted to answer but that is irrelevant. READ MORE The secrets behind the success of Chelsea's next manager: Enzo Maresca has Johan Cruyff quotes as his WhatsApp profile image and even wrote a THESIS on tactics... but 'Diet Pep' will have to reign in his erratic behaviour It’s the BBC. It’s not a fan-channel. It’s not MUTV. It’s not Pravda. It’s not Sky Sports, whose reporters in the north east, for example, boast about being fans first. Lineker and Shearer asked the questions we should expect to be asked by a competent broadcast network. And then, because television audiences in this country have been force-fed a diet of vacuous, flaccid, tame post-match interviews for too long, because they have grown used to that diet, Lineker and Shearer were roundly criticised for their conduct towards Ten Hag. They were accused of being disrespectful, aggressive, rude, of not letting Ten Hag enjoy his moment. All those accusations should be laughed out of town. For a start, if Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the United minority owner, had simply said Ten Hag’s job was safe and that he would be the manager next season, no one would have needed to ask Ten Hag the question. Ratcliffe has let him swing. And if Ten Hag is within his rights to be irritated by ongoing questions about his job prospects at Old Trafford, maybe he should direct his ire at the people who are, inadvertently perhaps, encouraging speculation through their silence. A previous regime at United sacked Louis van Gaal the day after he won the FA Cup for the club in 2016. It’s not much of a stretch to ask Ten Hag, who presided over a dismal league season, if he fears the same fate. Part-owners INEOS - headed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe (left) are expected to make a decision on Ten Hag's future this week Ten Hag's future is yet to be decided as United chiefs weigh up whether to terminate his contract early United's majority owner Avram Glazer (right) looked delighted as he shook hands with Ten Hag at Wembley So the criticism of Lineker and Shearer is pathetic. What is wrong with a robust question, anyway? Ten Hag’s a grown man in a high-profile job. If he can’t cope with a couple of gentle inquiries, he should be in another line of work. They were supposed to wait, apparently, and let Ten Hag enjoy his moment. Television doesn’t work like that. News doesn’t work like that. And football doesn’t work like that. The question has to be asked when the man is in front of you or it will not be asked at all. The absurd reaction to the interview hinted at a bigger picture: the arid landscape of the post-match, post-fight, post-race television interview has been allowed to become, over the past few years in this country, a wasteland of gurning ingratiation, vacuous chummery and self-congratulatory, prehistoric lad-banter. The BBC’s coverage of the Olympic Games often sets the gold standard in this hyperventilating medium where being friends with an athlete appears to be valued above all else, sycophancy is a pre-requisite and looking the other way when bad things happen – particularly if it happens to British competitors - is non-negotiable. United endured a miserable second season in the Premier League under Ten Hag as they finished eighth United's FA Cup victory - their 13th in the competition - might have given Ten Hag a lifeline Ten Hag’s a grown man in a high-profile job. If he can’t cope with a couple of gentle inquiries, he should be in another line of work Every viewer is different. We all value different qualities in our interviewers. For those of us who value insight over jocularity and prefer our analysts to analyse rather than throw themselves into the arms of a former teammate as they leave the pitch or the track, sober, serious, intelligent interviewers like Gabriel Clarke are increasingly hard to locate in the genre. READ MORE It would now seem MAD to sack Erik ten Hag: OLIVER HOLT explains why this FA Cup final is different to Louis van Gaal's Wembley last hurrah It is a failed state peopled increasingly by those so dazzled by the light of the game, which they recognise instinctively as the light that once shone from them, that they are incapable of any meaningful interaction with interviewees beyond the non-negotiable imperative of establishing that they, too, once were warriors. So, the exceptions to the rule, when they come, are even more welcome. There are many of these exceptions, by the way. Too many to mention here but it was a particular treat to listen to the radio show hosted by Jim White and Simon Jordan on TalkSport last week and hear their conversation with the boxing promoter, Frank Warren. If Ten Hag is within his rights to be irritated by ongoing questions, maybe he should direct his ire at the people who are, inadvertently perhaps, encouraging speculation through their silence For 20 minutes or so, they engaged in an argument about Tyson Fury, one of Warren’s fighters, who had lost an epic world heavyweight title battle with Oleksandr Usyk a few days earlier. Some might call it a row. Both sides stood their ground in an articulate, passionate exchange of views. It was utterly compelling. Nobody won or lost. Neither Warren, nor Jordan gave ground. Both stuck to their arguments and maintained their loyalties and their opinions. Again, it was the kind of conversation that happens far too rarely. Jack Stephens showed his true leadership values against Leeds I went to the Leeds United-Southampton Championship play-off final on Sunday. It was a brilliant atmosphere but it wasn’t the best game. Southampton deserved to win. They had one chance and they took it. But the thing that made the biggest impression on me all afternoon happened after the final whistle. As the Southampton players sprinted away towards their fans, I looked over at the other end of the stadium where the Leeds players had collapsed to the turf in despair. Saints captain Jack Stephens consoled Leeds players immediately after Southampton's victory in the Championship play-off final Stephens (left) showed his true leadership qualities as Southampton were promoted at Wembley Jack Stephens, the Southampton captain, had not run to celebrate with his club’s supporters and his teammates. Instead, he made his way from one Leeds player to another, consoling them, hugging them, lifting them from the floor. In the melee, Stephens’ leadership shone through. IShowSpeed is football's new publicity mogul I didn’t think anyone could make more publicity off the back of football than Salt Bae. IShowSpeed is proving me wrong. Chelsea's appalling track record Good luck to Enzo Maresca, or whoever it is who takes hold of the poisoned chalice that is the Chelsea job these days. Chelsea have moved a step closer to appointing Leicester's Enzo Maresca as their new boss Given that the manager at the club is now expected to be, in many ways, a subservient part of the hierarchy, it will be interesting to know if the first to pay the price for the next failure at Stamford Bridge will be the manager or the sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, who seem to be higher up the food chain. Their record so far has been appalling but there is only so long, surely, that they will be able to wield power without taking responsibility.

        "content": "The 17 'red flag' colorectal cancer symptoms young people need to look out for, according to study of 25million patients READ MORE: You should get a colonoscopy if you have two common symptoms By Emily Joshu Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 15:51, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:51, 27 May 2024 e-mail 29 View comments A major study has revealed the 17 most common symptoms of the fastest growing cancer in young people. Colorectal cancer diagnoses in people under 50 were most often preceded by rectal bleeding, stomach pain, and changes in bowel movements. Unexpected weight loss , fatigue, changes to appetite and other digestive issues were among the most common symptoms associated with the disease. Researchers in six countries including the US made the finding after analyzing data from more than 80 studies, which included nearly 25million colorectal cancer patients under 50. Young patients are being urged to get checked if they suffer any of these symptoms because they are not routinely screened for the disease. The above table shows the most common signs of colorectal cancer in young people, according to a study in JAMA Network Open The above graph shows colon cancer cases among under 50s by year. There is a drop in 2020 because the Covid pandemic led to fewer people coming forward for screenings The finings come as colorectal cancer rates are expected to double from 2010 to the end of the decade . Doctors are still trying to work out what's behind the rapid rise. Processed foods, chemical contamination and the overuse of antibiotics have all been touted as possible factors. 'Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as a diagnosis at younger than age 50 years, is increasing, and so-called red flag signs and symptoms among these individuals are often missed, leading to diagnostic delays,' the researchers wrote. 'Improved recognition of presenting signs and symptoms associated with EOCRC could facilitate more timely diagnosis and impact clinical outcomes.' The research team used the data to determine which symptoms were most common, which signs put patients most at risk of colon cancer, and how long it took patients to get a colon cancer diagnosis. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: health@dailymail.com Advertisement They found that rectal bleeding was linked to a five-fold increase in early onset colon cancer risk, making it the largest risk factor. Additionally, one in 10 patients had their symptoms come on quickly and severely . The researchers initially combed through 12,859 research papers and narrowed down the list to 81 studies conducted between 2000 and 2023. They found that 45 percent of patients experienced rectal bleeding or blood in their stool, and 40 percent suffered abdominal pain. Additionally, 27 percent had changes in their bowel habits, which could include having more or fewer movements. Weight loss was seen in 17 percent of patients, while 15 percent had a loss of appetite. And while 12 percent had an acute presentation, meaning their symptoms came on quickly, it took an average of four to six months for them to get a diagnosis. 'Younger patients may experience ongoing signs and symptoms and delay seeking medical attention,' the researchers wrote. 'Potential reasons for these delays include a patient believing they are too young to worry about cancer or a lack of access to primary care of health insurance.' Rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel movements are the key signs of colorectal cancer in young people, according to a study in JAMA Network Open The researchers looked at 81 studies to determine the most common signs of colorectal cancer in young people. They found that rectal bleeding or blood in the stool was the most common sign Rates of GI cancers rose most sharply in the youngest age group, followed by the 20-29 year old cohort. There were also more cases of GI cancers among older people, though in that case it is still considered early-onset cancer And even if a patient does seek medical help, 'patients and clinicians alike may downplay symptom severity and fail to recognize key red flags and clinical cues that should trigger suspicion of colorectal cancer,' the team said. They noted that, too often, rectal bleeding, the most common sign, is attributed to harmless conditions like hemorrhoids. A 2020 survey from Colorectal Cancer Alliance , for example, found that 68 percent of patients experienced blood in their stool, and many of them were misdiagnosed or dismissed. Read More EXCLUSIVE 'If we can get colon cancer, anyone can': These three patients were 45 and in the 'best shape of their lives' when they were diagnosed with 'death sentence' disease - now they're issuing a plea to young people More than half of the participants said they were misdiagnosed with conditions such as hemorrhoids, IBS, anemia, and mental health issues. Patients ages 19 to 39 were the most likely to feel dismissed, the team found. Alarmingly, these are the age groups that colon cancer is rising the quickest in. Recent statistics suggest that colon cancers have grown by 500 percent in children ages 10 to 14 and 333 percent in teens ages 15 to 19. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 106,590 cases of colon cancer and 46,220 instances of rectal cancer this year, along with 53,010 deaths. It's currently the fourth most common cancer in the US behind lung, prostate, and breast cancers. And nearly one in four patients are diagnosed after the disease has already spread to other organs. Overall, 'delays in diagnostic workup after sign or symptom presentation are up to 40% longer compared with older individuals with colorectal cancer,' the researchers wrote. They advised doctors to work with patients to ensure they are diagnosed quickly. They also suggested patients should ask for a colonoscopy or stool test if they experience symptoms. The review was published last week in the journal JAMA Network Open .

        "content": "One of the most recognizable homes in movie history is officially on the market – and could be yours for just $5.25million. The house from Home Alone , the 1990 Christmas classic starring Macaulay Culkin, Catherine O’Hara, Joe Pesci and John Candy, has been listed for sale on Zillow. The five-bedroom, six-bathroom property, located in the Winnetka area of Chicago , Illinois, was actually used as the exterior for the film – and the 1992 sequel – but looks hugely different from when Kevin McCallister turned it into his own house of horrors to capture burglars Harry and Marv. Gone are any traces of his dastardly traps, the awkwardly-placed statue in the driveway, that creepy tarantula or that red and green wallpaper adorning all the walls. Instead, the previous owners renovated the entire place in 2018, with a tasteful monochrome color scheme throughout – Katie Moor of Coldwell Banker is currently listing the property. And what do you get for the whopping $5.25million price tag ? Well, quite a lot actually... As well as being able to own a piece of cinema gold dust , buyers can enjoy a ‘gracious foyer,’ with an ‘inviting’ back garden – housing a huge porch and a wood-burning fireplace overlooking the gigantic yard. They also get not one, but two living rooms, as well as two laundry rooms and a heated garage with space for three cars. The primary bedroom includes a fireplace, a walk-in closet and a dreamy ensuite, with a giant freestanding tub and separate sinks – meaning tenants can copy Kevin McCallister’s iconic shaving routine in peace. While the basement in the gym housed that creepy furnace in the movie, in real life it has been replaced by a gym, a movie theater, bathroom and indoor sports court. Basically, loads of hiding spaces if Harry and Marv ever pop by unannounced again. ‘A legendary holiday dream home, reimagined for modern-day luxury: The stately brick Georgian residence of Home Alone fame brings forward a rare opportunity to own one of the most iconic movie residences in American pop culture,’ the listing reads. ‘Nestled on a picturesque, tree-lined street in the heart of east Winnetka and elegantly poised behind a wrought-iron gate, the property epitomizes classic Chicago suburban architecture. ‘The residence itself is a masterpiece of traditional style with an effortlessly flowing floorplan brimming with warmth, character, and exquisitely crafted detail. ‘From the promise of movie nights and game days to holiday gatherings surrounded by loved ones, this magical family home truly transcends its architectural pedigree. ‘It’s a chance to own a piece of cinematic history and create lasting memories within its iconic walls.’ Although most of the interior scenes of Home Alone were filmed at a nearby school gym, the Winnetka property served as the exterior for the shoot, and was actually home to a family. Lauren Abendshien lived there at the time, and lifted the lid on what it was like to open her doors up to the biggest Christmas film ever made. Appearing on This Morning in 2020, Lauren – who was six years old when production came knocking – explained the wild measures they had to take in their own home to avoid interrupting the action. ‘We stayed in the house pretty much the entire period they were filming, between four and five months they were there,’ she said. What I Own: My partner and I bought our own home before we were 30 — through a loophole I pay £395 a month to live in an underground doomsday bunker 'Magical' town with two castles named best place to live in the South West What I Rent: 'I pay £1,925 for a one bed flat but it revived my social life after divorce' ‘In order to avoid appearing on screen, we would have to crawl around under the window line from room to room. ‘Especially in the evening when it would be much easier for that to show up on camera, You had to do an army crawl from spot to spot in the house.’ ‘They would spend time in the house when they weren’t actively filming their scenes,’ she continued. ‘Macaulay Culkin actually used my room as the place he would go to study with his tutor. His brother, who played his cousin Fuller in the film, Kieran [Culkin], he wasn’t filming as much so he would just hang out in my room.’ Got a story?

        "content": "Less than a week after rolling out of its two-year early access period into full release, Songs of Conquest has now surpassed 500,000 copies sold—and more importantly, developer Lavapotion has unveiled big plans for the future, including four DLC releases and a \"major expansion\" planned for summer 2025. The expansion, called Bleak East, will add two new factions to Songs of Conquest—the Vanir and the Roots—and \"a large singleplayer campaign that will tell the story of how they came to be and how they will affect the larger world of Aerbor.\" \"The Bleak East lies to the North-East of Patrium, and is the home of descendants from both Arleon and Barya,\" lead game designer Carl Toftfelt wrote on Steam . \"Hardy settlers who now live their lives free of their former masters on the coast of the Bleak East. But they are not alone, and we can barely wait to share their Song with you.\" Unfortunately, they—and you—will have to wait a full year for Bleak East to arrive, and that's where the four DLC releases come into play. \"We want to keep telling the story of Songs of Conquest at a higher pace than only faction expansions would allow,\" Toftfelt explained. \"So we’re introducing something we call Tales of Conquest in the form of DLC, releasing roughly every quarter. These Tales will move the story of Songs of Conquest forward, as well as expand our gameplay, through story missions following each one of the existing factions.\" The first Tales of Conquest DLC, called Rise Eternal , will focus on the Barony of Loth undead faction: An undead scholar named Kastus Maal will seek vengeance against Arleon baroness who killed him at the Battle of Grey Tor, \"and with his guidance the Risen will be more powerful than ever before.\" Rise Eternal is planned for release this fall, and will also include new artifacts, set bonuses, and \"general improvements to the Risen of Loth\" faction, most of which will be added to the base game for free, making them available to all players, even if they don't purchase the DLC. After that will come Essence Awakened, focusing on the Arleon, which is expected to be out \"around December,\" and then two more, based on the Barya and Rana factions, which are slated for sometime in the second half of 2025. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That schedule is vague, and even as far as it goes nothing is carved in stone—Toftfelt warned that \"things will always change, and timelines can shift forward and back\"—but Lavapotion clearly has big plans for the future: \"We just wanted to let you know right away that we plan to support Songs of Conquest for years to come.\"",

        "content": "Kolkata Knight Riders dismantled the batting powerhouse of Sunrisers Hyderabad for only 113 runs to set up an eight-wicket victory Sunday and a third Indian Premier League title. The $2.9 million signing Mitchell Starc rattled Hyderabad's top-order with 2-14, and all six Kolkata bowlers took wickets before the most aggressive batting team this season was bowled out for the lowest ever total in the history of IPL finals. Venkatesh Iyer then led Kolkata to 114-2 in 10.3 overs with a blazing 26-ball unbeaten 52. Rahmanullah Gurbaz scoring 39 in 32. \"It was comprehensive,\" said Kolkata captain Shreyas Iyer, who also played in an IPL final for Delhi Capitals in 2020 when his team lost to Mumbai Indians. \"This is what we demanded from the players and they stood up. It's difficult to express the feelings, so much to cherish right now. There was no one individual who took us here, it was a cumulative effort, it was a flawless season for us.\" Kolkata previously won the IPL titles in 2012 and '14 and had dominated this season by finishing on top at the end of league stage with nine wins from 14 games. It even dominated the most aggressive Hyderabad batting lineup by winning both in the league stage and also in the qualifier, where Australian paceman Starc stood out before routing Pat Cummins' team in a one-sided final. Starc and Cummins will combine in Australia's squad at the Twenty20 World Cup, which starts Saturday with the United States taking on Canada in Dallas. The IPL gave some of the world's leading players time to prepare for the World Cup in the U.S. and Caribbean. The six-week tournament culminated with the final, and Cummins had first choice had winning the toss and deciding to bat. But the Sunrisers were deflated inside the first seven overs as they limped to 47-4 against an impeccable attack of Starc, Harshit Rana (2-24) and Vaibhav Arora (1-24). Starc started the rout when he clean bowled Abhishek Sharma with a ball that swung away from the left-hander and knocked back the off stump. Travis Head, who regularly scored quick runs for Hyderabad this season, edged Arora's first ball and went for a golden duck. At 6-2 in two overs, Hyderabad struggled to recover from that double loss. Starc's three-over spell in the power play gave Kolkata another wicket when Rahul Tripathi top-edged the left-arm quick. There was no power-hitting from the South African pair of Aiden Markram, who made a struggling 20 off 23 balls, and Heinrich Klaasen (16 in 17) as Kolkata kept picking up wickets at regular intervals. Markram's weak pull shot against Andre Russell landed in the lap of Starc at long-on and Klaasen departed in the 15th over when he dragged Rana's off-cutter back onto his stumps. Russell mopped up the lower order with 3-19 and Hyderabad was in danger of not reaching 100 before Cummins hit 24 off 19 balls and was the last man dismissed in the penultimate over. \"Russell has got a magic wand and he is looking towards me to bowl,\" Shreyas Iyer said. \"In the majority of the games he gave us breakthroughs.\" Kolkata lost Sunil Narine before Venkatesh Iyer, who smashed three sixes and four boundaries, and Rahmanullah Gurbaz effectively sealed the game with some aggressive hitting in a 91-run stand. It was heartbreak for Hyderabad, which had toppled IPL batting records throughout the season and three times posted totals exceeding 265. However, it got bowled out for its lowest total of the season at a venue where Kolkata, owned by Bollywood celebrity Shah Rukh Khan, had happy memories of winning its first IPL title in 2012. \"We were outplayed,\" Cummins said. \"They didn't give us anything ... they bowled fantastically.\"",

        "content": "The weakening tropical storm Remal flooded dozens of coastal villages and left nearly 30 million people without power Monday in southern Bangladesh and eastern India. At least 10 people died in Bangladesh. About 3.7 million people along the coast were affected, said Bangladesh's junior minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibbur Rahman. More than 35,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 115,000 were damaged. Nearly 800,000 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas on Sunday. Bangladesh, a delta nation of nearly 170 million people, has a history of violent storms. Disaster preparedness programs have upgraded the capacity to tackle natural disasters, resulting in fewer casualties. Changing climate patterns have increased storms' intensity, making preparations more urgent. Remal weakened after making landfall in Bangladesh's Patuakhali district early Monday, with sustained winds of 111 kilometers (69 miles) per hour. India's Meteorological Department said it was likely to weaken throughout the day, but warned of heavy showers over Assam and other northeastern states for the next two days. India's Kolkata airport reopened after being shut Sunday. Bangladesh shut the airport in the country's second largest city, Chattogram, and canceled all domestic flights to and from the coastal district of Cox's Bazar. Loading and unloading at Chittagong seaport was halted. Strong rain and winds battered the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. Many roads were submerged. Authorities ordered all government officials to stay at their stations until the situation improved. Aid agencies said they deployed thousands of volunteers in Rohingya refugee camps and other affected areas to provide emergency support. Bangladesh has sprawling camps housing more than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in Cox's Bazar. In India's West Bengal state, thatched roofs on houses were blown away and electric poles and trees were uprooted in some coastal districts. Heavy downpours inundated streets and homes in low-lying areas of Kolkata. All schools in the region were closed until further notice.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died for.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,” Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.

        "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to actively monitor the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, also known as bird flu, and says that the public health risk remains low. Dr. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, says scientists and public health officials have known about avian influenza for decades. \"What's different today is that since 2020, we're seeing the largest outbreak of avian influenza among wild birds , poultry and backyard bird flocks,\" he says. \"The virus has also been found in certain mammalian species , most recently in dairy cattle, which is a little bit unprecedented and unique. And every time we see the virus go from birds into mammals, we worry about the virus adapting closer and closer to being able to infect and be transmitted efficiently between humans,\" Dr. Binnicker says. Bird flu has been detected in the milk of dairy cattle , raising concerns for potential transmission to humans. The Food and Drug Administration found no traces of live virus in dairy products available to the public. \"The good news is that the pasteurization process used in the United States and many countries inactivates avian influenza. The milk that we drink, if it's been pasteurized, is safe. Any animal products, such as eggs, beef or chicken, that you would cook to the recommended internal temperature renders that product safe to eat,\" says Dr. Binnicker. There are steps people can take to ensure their food remains safe from any viral or bacterial pathogen. \"As with any potential infectious disease associated with food, cooking to the recommended internal temperature that the CDC lists on their website is really important. And if you do that, you inactivate viruses like influenza, you inactivate bacteria and parasites that could cause a human infection,\" says Dr. Binnicker. The CDC recommends using a food thermometer to ensure foods are cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature. Always wash your hands with soap and water, and disinfect cooking surfaces when handling raw or uncooked meat and poultry. Dr. Binnicker says millions of birds have been infected with avian influenza, and the risk to humans remains low because the virus hasn't adapted to humans at this time. He recommends precautions for those who spend time outdoors or work with birds. \"If you're interacting with birds, either through a backyard bird flock or a poultry farm, and there are birds that are either sick or have died, you need to wear an N95 mask. You need to wear eye protection and gloves,\" says Dr. Binnicker. \"Most importantly, you need to contact your state or local public health officials so that they're aware of what's going on in your poultry facility or backyard bird flock.\" The bird flu doesn't normally infect people, but some rare cases have happened. Infection can range from no symptoms to mild illness (like pink eye) to very serious and even deadly, according to the CDC. \"If you come down with symptoms, especially after interacting with a sick or dead bird, get tested for influenza and let your doctor and local public health officials know,\" he says. \"The good news is that influenza tests that we currently use for human strains of influenza should be positive if an individual is infected with avian influenza. The current tests just won't tell us specifically that an individual has avian influenza .\" The CDC is working with diagnostic test manufacturers and clinical laboratories to develop tests to specifically determine if it's avian flu. Dr. Binnicker says those tools should be available in the months ahead.",
