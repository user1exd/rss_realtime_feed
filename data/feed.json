        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as \"vital\" in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has \"its own large reserves of uranium.\" Putin, in turn, vowed to \"do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan's (nuclear energy) market.\" If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia's influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China, where he expressed appreciation for China's proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin's ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",

        "content": "( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

        "content": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ( WNCN ) — Two people were rescued just before a $1 million luxury 80-foot sport yacht sank off the coast of Florida Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The incident was reported just after 11:35 a.m. about 3 miles off St. Augustine Beach, a news release from the Coast Guard said. The operator of the Atlantis, an 80-foot sport yacht, said the vessel hit an object in the water and was sinking. The Coast Guard sent out a boat crew to assist and coordinated with St. John’s County Fire and Rescue, which soon arrived and plucked both people from the yacht. The Atlantis yacht appears to be a 1999 or early 2000s model of the Sunseeker Predator 80. A larger Sunseeker Predator was featured in the 2006 James Bond film “Casino Royale.” A 2001 Predator that is 5 feet shorter than Atlantis, which sank Saturday, is listed for sale for $975,000. Sunseeker Predator 80 yacht, built in the United Kingdom, can accommodate up to six guests in four staterooms, with two crew members aboard. Atlantis has two Caterpillar diesel engines and can reach a top speed of 44 kn, or 50 mph, according to data from Boat International. A data sheet about Atlantis says the vessel is in the top 5% by speed in the world. After Saturday’s rescue, a hazard to navigation was broadcast to alert mariners about the yacht, which could cause damage to other vessels, according to the Coast Guard.

        "content": "The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico’s southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up, and water supplies are running out. Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "MADRID (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday secured from Spain a pledge of additional air defense missiles to help fight the about 3,000 bombs that he says Russia launches every month at Ukraine in the third year of the war. However, Ukraine still urgently needs another seven U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction, Zelenskyy said. “If we had these modern Patriot systems, (Russian) airplanes wouldn’t be able to fly close enough to drop the (glide) bombs on the civilian population and the military,” Zelenskyy told a news conference in the Spanish capital. Glide bombs are heavy Soviet-era bombs fitted with precision guidance systems and launched from aircraft flying out of range of air defenses. The bombs weigh more than a ton and blast targets to smithereens, leaving a huge crater. Two Patriot systems are needed to protect the northeastern Kharkiv region, where the Kremlin’s forces launched a cross-border offensive on May 10 that left Ukrainian troops reeling, Zelenskyy said. The death toll from a glide bomb attack on a Kharkiv shopping mall Saturday rose to 18, regional Gov Oleh Syniehubov said Monday, with five people still missing. The Kharkiv push has further strained Ukraine’s already depleted army, which in recent months has been fighting Russia’s intense drive deeper into the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the Kremlin’s army is mustering at another point in Russia, farther north but close to the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, aiming to stretch Ukraine’s depleted army thinner and crack its resistance in the area. Zelenskyy and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez signed a bilateral security agreement that allocates 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. More Leopard tanks and artillery ammunition also feature in the package. “After more than two years (of war), Russia’s aggression continues, and that’s why it is more necessary than ever to redouble our support,” Sánchez told the joint news conference. The Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system that was first deployed in the 1980s and can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles. It is expensive but is effective and sought after by armies around the world. European countries have hesitated to send Patriot systems to Ukraine, fearing they may need them. Spain’s King Felipe VI earlier welcomed Zelenskyy at the capital’s Barajas airport. Zelenskyy was due in neighboring Portugal on Tuesday. He had been due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia’s response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. A Ukrainian long-range drone set a new distance record by attacking overnight an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Ukrainian officials claimed. The operation was conducted by Ukraine’s military intelligence, GUR, an intelligence official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to comment publicly. Ukraine’s previous long-range attack record was at 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) when a drone struck an oil refinery in Russia’s Bashkortostan on May 9. It was not immediately possible to verify either claim. Meanwhile, a Western intelligence assessment suggested that Russia’s Kharkiv offensive has subsided. “The northern Kharkiv front has likely stabilized with Russian territorial control fragmented and not joined up,” the U.K. Defense Ministry said Sunday. “Russia’s gains in this axis will be limited in the coming week, as Russia’s initial momentum has been contained by Ukrainian resistance.” That is in line with Zelenskyy’s claim last Friday that Ukrainian forces have secured “combat control” of areas where Russian troops entered the Kharkiv region. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "content": "@XandertheWise It depends on when the first day of school is of that year. My high school typically started very early in August, then seniors wouldn't be around anymore in May. I graduated in 2008 and during that year they pushed our first day into late August. So while my graduation was the first day of June, on Sunday, our last day of classes was the 2nd week of May. Sorry for the late reply @Bundersvessel ! I pulled a back muscle and I was in so much pain over the weekend. The joys of getting old Yeah it was an extraction. It seems to be doing rather well now.. So surreal that it's gone though. Ooooh boy I don't envy you. Mine are already all grown up thankfully (Though that comes with it's own problems). I don't think I could manage with a baby/toddler at my age now... I deal with kids enough as a teacher ha ha Is this where @kyleforrester87 is at? @JohnnyShoulder nah but I have seen that in recent years. We are total bad asses! Went to a local Tekken 8 tournament last night and it was pretty cool. I didn't do great @Voltan Cool. How many took part in that? @oliverp It was actually quite big (and a Dojo event for Tekken World Tour) - 48 players in the bracket @Jimmer-jammer How are you man? I'm still downloading RotR, despite having completed the tutorial, as I have a very slow internet connection/set up my Ps5 with performance settings that somehow cause slow downloads, anyway, it is a big game as well so that probably contributes to that. Anyway, how's work and life treating you? Is your job anything like the TV Show 'The King of Queens'? 🤣 @Black_Swordsman Doing well, thanks! Yeah, RotR is a really big game, so that’s surely a factor. As for my job, it’s less King of Queens and more Highway Thru Hell. In fact, parts of the show were filmed in my neck of the woods. I haul petroleum crude, so there’s the added stress of dealing with a dangerous goods product but the nice thing is that I work a 9 on and 5 off schedule, which works well for managing my life, especially when my real passions are decidedly less blue collar. I did, for a time, deliver and service portable toilets across Calgary and Vancouver, including at the 2010 winter olympics, which probably could have been its own tv show 😂 How are you doing? Have you carried on with your studies? Still operating the helplines? @Jimmer-jammer Yeah, good thanks, I am applying for courses at the moment so hopefully I'll get on to a good one, and yes, still operating the helplines. It's quite rewarding and enjoyable. That's interesting about your former employment. Definitely a TV Show I would have paid to watch! @Black_Swordsman Glad to hear you’re doing well! Being an ear for people in need is a real gift and takes a tremendous amount of personal fortitude. Here’s hoping your courses pan out the way you’d like! Plan a game purchase for tomorrow (its the day when the salary comes here where I live so) feel like I deserve to buy a game then (have planed the purchase for quite some time). @oliverp Which one? I cna't wait to buy Paper Mario 2, but unfortunately I had an awful pay day this month. That on top of me having spent all my savings over the last year, makes it really hard to justify new game prices. Especially since I still have quite some games left unfinished. Finances will probably return to normal by next month, so it's nothing to be worried about. Just sad that the one game I was looking forward to happened to release this month. @kidfred Oh its a big one which I might announce in the purchase thread. I of course hope that you soon will be able to pick up some new games. @oliverp I might have an idea about which game 😉 I have decided to give up on the idea of being a professional musician and focus purely on psychology for a future career path. It was an accumulation of things that led to this decision, I suppose, but mostly the fact that I realised I had been holding on to my teenage dreams, mostly inspired by reading interviews with musicians, mostly from the band 'Iced Earth' and other rock and heavy metal bands about how you go \"all in\" when you're young if you're gonna make it, and then stick to it, kinda thing. I realised that at this age a career in psychology, another of my interests, is more realistic, and on a personal level, more fulfilling to me. I also felt like I had \"made my mark\" on the music industry, with a handful of gigs from my teens under my belt, in addition to SoundCloud recordings, which people liked, flatteringly, recorded more recently. I will now just play guitar for fun, along with games, and read and watch cricket as my primary hobbies and interests, whilst focusing on psychology for the career and personal fulfillment. I have \"met up\" with my college self in the best possible way now, still focusing on a couple of the same hobbies and interests I had at that age, but without applying the passion and drive necessary to become a professional musician to that unlikely end now, and instead applying it to becoming a professional psychotherapist. @Black_Swordsman I find your decision and self-awareness quite inspiring. I'm closer to retirement than I am to my early working years, and I still don't know what I would choose to do or have a passion for. I do have some experience in psychology having spent many years talking to professionals with my personal history of depression, anxiety and other related mental illnesses, and I can certainly see the appeal and fulfillment of such a career choice. The very best of luck to you! @Malaise Thank you for your feedback and for disclosing that, I sincerely wish you all the best with your mental health and everything else in your life. I hope you discover what you want to do, in terms of a particular ambition, what you and I both referred to as a passion, and if not, I hope you enjoy the things that you do do in life that you may not necessarily be passionate about in the sense of a specific ambition, goal, or drive.",

        "content": "Some of the polls before the general election may be overstating Labour’s huge lead over the Conservatives , a Tory election expert has said. According to Robert Hayward, a peer and former MP who first identified the phenomenon of “shy Tories” before the 1992 election, his analysis of local election results suggests that the Conservatives are getting more support from voters who say they are undecided than is showing up in the polls. “About 33 years on, I am yet again convinced that a statistical bias exists in the polls,” he said. Polling in the run-up to the election has shown commanding leads for Labour of more than 20 points in some surveys, such as YouGov, while others, such as Opinium, show a gap of about 14. Some constituency-level polling by YouGov suggests the Conservatives are heading for near wipeout. Its April projection points to more than 400 seats out of 650 going to Labour . Most experts, MPs and political strategists across the parties agree that Labour is almost certainly heading for victory, but the size of its lead will determine its majority in parliament. Hayward said it was “not shy Tories” all over again, and that Labour still undoubtedly had a large lead over the Conservatives, but he was concerned the polls were “getting it wrong”. “I think the biggest problem for me is how you allocate the Conservative 2019 voters who are now ‘don’t knows’. I do believe the ‘don’t knows’ will vote in fairly large numbers, and the indications from local council results is that they are beginning to break towards the Conservatives. “Because of the lack of commitment displayed so far, I’m not sure where things are going to end up, because events during this election could have more of an effect than in many elections because there are so many undecided.” One polling industry expert also agreed there was a risk the polls could contain methodological or structural errors. They said: “I think there are lots of reasons to be concerned about a polling error this time around. There are serious data quality issues across the industry, where it’s getting tougher to ensure the people taking part in surveys are real, taking the surveys seriously, and representative of the wider population. Pollsters are working harder to combat it, but that task is getting tougher, and there is a risk that it affects the accuracy of the polls this election. “The other issue is undecided voters. There’s three times more people who voted Conservative and are undecided than voted Labour and are undecided, and where these voters end up going will make a big difference. The pollsters make different assumptions about this group ... The range of this is probably like Labour 1997 to Canada 1993 – it’s a Conservative party historic defeat with one methodology, to complete wipeout with another methodology.” Sign up to Election Edition Make sense of the election campaign with Archie Bland's daily 5pm briefing, direct to your inbox. Jokes where available after newsletter promotion They added: “The last thing is that polls do tend to be less accurate in elections with lots of change. Polls were fairly inaccurate in 1997 but it didn’t matter, because the result was so decisive. When there are more voters moving between parties, polls become more chaotic, their accuracy tends to decrease.” Anthony Wells, head of European political and social research at YouGov, said it was likely that the differences between each company’s surveys would narrow as polling day approached. “There are still a substantial number of people who voted Tory in 2019 saying ‘Don’t know’ when asked how they will vote,” he said. “A large amount of the difference in leads between different polling companies is because of different choices in how to handle that. Some companies choose to model or predict how those people will vote come election day, while others report only what people currently say. “It is as much a philosophical decision as anything else. Are we measuring how people say they will vote, or predicting how we think they will vote? Either way, it is reasonable expectation that the differences between pollsters will narrow in the lead-up to July 4 as the number of people saying ‘Don’t know’ falls. However, whether that results in a narrowing lead or not depends on to what extent, if at all, those voters return to the Tory party.”",

        "content": "To improve your local-language experience, sometimes we employ an auto-translation plugin. Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. The gamification of cryptocurrency is changing how investors interact with digital assets. ‘s latest dashboard feature is a prime example of this trend, offering a gamified experience that engages users. This article will compare BlockDAG with Dogwifhat Price and Theta Network Prediction, highlighting their similarities, differences, and unique selling points. It also aims to provide useful and interesting content to generate excitement about BlockDAG’s mineable network and encourage readers to consider investing in the presale. Theta Fuel (TFUEL), the Theta Network’s operational token, is essential to on-chain processes like deploying smart contracts and compensating relayers for sharing video streams. Analysts and investors often discuss the potential for TFUEL to hit $1. Although it is currently undervalued, a number of factors could affect its price in the future. Technological developments, general market trends in the cryptocurrency industry, and the Theta Network’s overall growth and adoption are all significant factors. The market for TFUEL is anticipated to grow as Theta Network broadens its alliances and applications. Innovations in blockchain technology and the growing popularity of decentralised streaming services also contribute to the increase in its potential value. Reaching the $1 threshold is a difficult but attainable goal, though it takes significant market momentum and positive sentiment to do so. DogWiFhat, although not very well-known, has seen its price rise sharply due to significant investments by large players known as ‘whales’. These big investors have been buying substantial amounts, causing a noticeable increase in the cryptocurrency’s value. This activity has sparked curiosity in the crypto community, with many speculating about the reasons behind these large transactions. Whale activity has given DogWiFhat’s price a brief boost, but overall, the price has been extremely volatile. This has caught the eye of retail investors, who see it as a possible investment opportunity. However, opinions among analysts are mixed. Some believe the whale activity signals confidence in DogWiFhat’s potential, while others warn that the price surge may be short-lived and driven by speculative trading rather than real value. BlockDAG’s latest dashboard feature offers users comprehensive insights and tools to manage their investments. Upon entering the dashboard, users see the latest announcements, ensuring they’re always informed. The dashboard also displays the user’s current rank, wallet balance, and recent transactions, making it easy to track investment progress.

        "description": "Joe Sperry, a 2022 Lourdes grad, was set to play Division I baseball at Winthrop University after playing two years of junior college ball. But he decommitted after a coaching change at Winthrop.",
        "content": "ROCHESTER — Due to a coaching change at Winthrop University, Joe Sperry has had a change of heart. Sperry, a 2022 Lourdes grad, has spent the last two seasons as a standout for the University of South Carolina Lancaster junior college baseball team. He had planned to play at Division I Winthrop starting this fall, but decided to decommit when the head coach was fired following the 2024 season. “I don’t know who the (new) coach is going to be,” Sperry said. “The staff that recruited me to go there, or at least the coach, isn’t there anymore. So I think I should just find a new relationship with a coach at a different school. I had the option to do that so I chose to do that.” Sperry had to get a release from Winthrop after signing a letter of intent before he could begin the recruitment process again. “They gave me an opportunity to be successful, and I’m grateful for that,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT The right-handed hitting and throwing Sperry was a two-way player at Lancaster. He had a monster hitting season this year as a sophomore. He batted .398 with a lofty 1.264 OPS. He smashed 20 home runs, had 16 doubles, scored 56 runs and had a whopping 84 RBIs in just 54 games. On the mound, the 6-foot-2, 210-pounder went 3-4 with a 6.67 ERA with 56 strikeouts in 54 innings. His fastball topped out at 93 miles per hour and was regularly in the 88-92 range. He has already had some preliminary talks with coaches at other Division I schools, but is still early in the process. He would like to make his decision as soon as possible, but doesn’t want to rush it. “There could be a lot coming up here soon,” he said. “When you reopen your recruitment, it’s just crazy for the first couple of days. You don’t know who’s going to be talking to you or who’s interested.” Sperry is done with the school year and has returned home. He is training at The Yard Sports Training facility in Rochester. He is taking a little break from baseball but will play with the Rochester Honkers of the Northwoods League beginning July 3. “That’s still the same plan for the summer,” he said. “But who knows, I might have to take some time off with the Honkers in order to visit a school or something. But I’m sure they’ll understand that. But hopefully, I’ll find a new home by then.” — — Four area seniors have been selected to play in the Minnesota High School All-Star Baseball Series. The event will be held June 20-22 at Chaska Athletic Park. ADVERTISEMENT The event will feature six teams and each team will play a pair of games. Local seniors who will participate for the South squad include Isaiah Brennan of Byron, Preston Ohm of Zumbrota-Mazeppa, Reid Hartmann of Red Wing and Isaac Nelsen of Lyle/Austin Pacelli. — — Rochester Community and Technical College had six baseball players named MCAC South All-Division for the 2024 spring season. The Yellowjackets finished the season 29-17 and were one of the final four teams in the North Plains District Tournament. Yellowjackets coach Clark Jones was named the South Division Coach of the Year for guiding RCTC to a division title and a 14-2 record. Named to the first team were infielder Griffin Olson of Viroqua, Wis., catcher Augusto Mungarrieta of Valencia-Carabobo, Venezuela, and outfielder Luis Rodriguez of Coamo, Puerto Rico. Rees Campanale of Orlanda, Fla., was named to the second team as a pitcher and the third team as a designated hitter. Others named to the third team were pitcher Jerry Santiago Jr. of Coamo, Puerto Rico, and outfielder Ramon Teran of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. Guy N. Limbeck is a sports writer for the Post Bulletin.

        "description": "Minnesota has a new point person working with the state's Fortune 500 companies, educating them about NIL, all in search of the next 'game changer.'",
        "content": "Imagine a day when Gophers athletes are receiving millions of dollars in name, image and likeness (NIL) payments from Minnesota's big businesses, putting them on par with peers across major college sports. The Gophers are hoping for their own version of what the University of Memphis landed in April with a $25 million NIL contribution from FedEx. Why not dream big on getting an NIL supercharge from among the state's 15 Fortune 500 companies? \"FedEx is a game-changer,\" Gophers athletics director Mark Coyle said. \"There's no doubt.\" Brett Schreiner is the new point person trying to help Coyle and the Gophers attract a big-business NIL investment like the one Tigers athletics scored from the Memphis-based shipping giant. Schreiner was fundraising on the university's academic side before taking on his new role as Senior Manager, Business Development-NIL. He works for Learfield, the official rights holder for the Gophers and hundreds of other collegiate programs. The Gophers were the 13th program within Learfield's national footprint to hire someone for an NIL-specific job. \"We're trying to kind of be on the cutting edge with this role,\" Schreiner said. \"We're trying to work with a lot of companies to make NIL more important to them.\" Schreiner, who played Division III football at Wisconsin-Eau Claire and worked in athletics at his alma mater and Wisconsin-Stout, is trying to change the way big companies think of NIL in Minnesota. The most familiar NIL path involves donations to a collective, such as Dinkytown Athletes , which helps athletes get paid through endorsements. A challenge facing collectives is trying to explain to larger businesses how they can benefit from this process. Why should Minnesota's Fortune 500 companies, such as 3M, Target, Best Buy, Land O'Lakes and General Mills, invest in NIL deals with Gophers athletes? Many of these corporations already donate to the U in other areas. In 2017, 3M announced a 14-year, $11.2 million Gophers athletics naming rights sponsorship with the Mariucci hockey arena. NIL is completely different, but the Gophers have talked to 3M about giving. \"3M and the University of Minnesota have had a strong relationship for nearly 100 years and our involvement in Gopher Athletics is one piece of a larger partnership,\" 3M spokesman Mike Laninga said. \"The Gopher athletic department was very helpful in explaining how the NIL process works and how to properly engage if we chose to do so.\" Schreiner works closely with Jeremiah Carter, Gophers senior associate AD for NIL/Policy and Risk Management . Schreiner explained that a crucial step to convincing corporations to invest in NIL is getting them to see the value of influencer marketing. Using social media and video messaging, athletes can use their personal brand and social media following to bring exposure to companies big and small. \"I don't think this path has gotten as much press,\" Schreiner said. \"This basically gives student-athletes a chance to be influencer marketers for companies. That can mean a lot of different things. This can also teach athletes about developing their entrepreneurship and what they want their brand to be.\" Sure, Timberwolves' Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns or the Vikings' Justin Jefferson are popping up on billboards and ads all over town. Could Gophers athletes be in the running for similar opportunities? A recent example was Gophers women's basketball leading scorer Mara Braun's image being used on a billboard in town to promote Affinity Plus, a Minneapolis credit union. Braun has nearly 28,000 followers on Instagram. \"How can we pair a company with student-athletes and the Gophers' brand to touch the hearts of fans across the state and the nation?\" Schreiner said. \"We can humanize the companies with athletes from the University of Minnesota and not just from the local pro sports teams.\" U.S. companies went from investing an estimated $1.7 billion in influencer marketing in 2016 to $16.4 billion in 2022, according to data from influencermarketinghub.com . Other data from the site projects that investments in influencer marketing by businesses nationally could increase to $24 billion this year. In late February, state legislation stripped the NCAA's ability to regulate NIL in recruiting, opening doors for collectives to negotiate directly with prospects before they signed. That changed NIL in a big way. An agreement Thursday between the NCAA and Power Five conferences opened the door for direct payments to athletes -- another massive-change moment for college sports. This points toward Minnesota and other schools taking control of the NIL process, which would make Schreiner's goal of connecting large companies to NIL funding even more critical for the Gophers. \"It's part of the growth and evolution we will need as an athletics department to best position us for the future,\" Carter said. \"A position like Brett's is going to be relevant and needed no matter where NIL goes.\"",

        "content": "( WAVY ) — The final resting place for a U.S. Navy submarine that sank the most Japanese warships in World War II has been found more than 80 years after it was sunk. The USS Harder was found in the South China Sea, more than 3,000 feet below the surface off the coast of the Philippines’ northern island of Luzon, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. The sub, with its 79-man crew, was sunk during a 1944, battle. It was data collected and provided by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea and the Lost 52 Project, that helped find the sunken submarine. Previous submarines found by the Lost 52 Project include the USS Grayback, the USS Stickleback, USS R-12, USS S-26, USS S-28 and the USS Grunion. The first USS Harder was commissioned Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It now rests upright and is relatively intact. The NHHC said the excellent state of preservation of the site and the data it collected allowed it to confirm the wreck as the USS Harder. The first USS Harder (SS 257) was commissioned on Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It was lost at sea with 79 souls aboard on Aug. 24, 1944. “Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,” said NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, U.S. Navy rear admiral (retired). “We are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the ‘Hit ‘em Harder’ submarine that sank the most Japanese warships — in particularly audacious attacks — under her legendary skipper, Cmdr. Sam Dealey.” The Harder made six patrols before it was sunk, with its fifth being the most successful, according to the NHHC, sinking three Japanese destroyers and heavily damaging or destroying two more in four days. Its last known location was in the South China Sea off Luzon during its sixth and last war patrol. Japanese records later revealed Harder fired three torpedoes at its CD-22 vessel, the NHHC said. “The Japanese ship evaded the torpedoes and began a series of depth charge attacks, [with] the fifth depth charge attack sinking Harder and her crew,” the NHHC said. The USS Harder received the Presidential Unit Citation for her first five patrols, six battle stars for World War II service. Dealey was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor “for his outstanding contribution to the war effort on Harder’s fifth patrol.”",

        "content": "(Stacker) – Jam-packed parking lots, gridlocked roads, bustling crosswalks—these aren’t scenes from New York City or Los Angeles but from some of the country’s most popular national parks. According to reports from the National Park Service, destinations like Arches and Rocky Mountain National Parks have seen record visitation numbers in recent years, resulting in unprecedented overcrowding. Fortunately, the National Park Service is already taking steps to save our national parks from being visited to death. Most notably, several of the nation’s most-visited parks have implemented permit systems, which require visitors to make advance reservations to enter. This helps park officials manage traffic flow and prevents parks from becoming overwhelmed by numbers they can’t accommodate. These permit systems aren’t without their critics, as some have said this measure can make it much more difficult for visitors to experience the national parks. But it’s important to note that most of these permit systems only apply during peak visitation season (namely, the summer months), so you can still enjoy a spontaneous national park trip during much of the rest of the year—at least for now. Using information from Outside and the National Park Service , Stacker compiled a list of six national parks that will require entry permits in 2024, excluding parks that only require permits for specific landmarks. Don’t forget that permit reservation fees won’t cover national park entrance fees, typically charged when you enter the park. Read on to learn where you’ll need a permit—and how to get one—this year. Yosemite first instituted its timed entry system in 2020 to limit visitor numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, but even when cases began to subside, Yosemite kept the permit system around to alleviate longstanding overcrowding issues. After removing the system for one year in 2023, the park has brought back the entry permit requirement for 2024. Permits have been required to enter the park on weekends and holidays since April 13 and will be required every day from July 1 through Aug. 16. From Aug. 17 through Oct. 27, permits will only be required on weekends and holidays again. Most permits were released on Jan. 5 this year, but for last-minute trip planners, further permits can be reserved seven days before your expected arrival date. Inside Yosemite, you can marvel at the views of El Capitan and Half Dome or hike one of the park’s many scenic trails, all while enjoying the benefits of fewer crowds. Mount Rainier National Park has seen a 40% uptick in visitor numbers over the past 10 years. To preserve the park’s delicate environment and offer an improved visitor experience, Mount Rainier will require permits to enter both the Paradise and Sunrise Corridors during peak visitation days in 2024. Reservations are needed for Paradise Corridor from May 24 to Sept. 2, while Sunrise Corridor requires entry permits from July 4 to Sept. 2. Both the Sunrise and Paradise areas offer their own unique attractions—Sunrise features stunning views of Mount Rainier and the Cascade Range, while Paradise hosts the park’s main visitor center and abundant wildflower meadows. You’ll need to reserve two separate permits if you want to visit both spots this summer, but if the timed entry system works according to plan, you hopefully won’t have to share the park with too many other tourists. Anyone who’s visited Arches National Park in recent years won’t be surprised to find it on this list. After experiencing significant overcrowding for more than a decade, Arches implemented a timed entry program in 2022. Now in its third year, the system continues to evolve to accommodate visitors and provide the best experience possible. Entry permits are released in monthly blocks three months before each month (for example, permits for September visits are released on June 1). A small number of additional permits are released one day ahead of time, which allows for a certain degree of spontaneity in planning your trip, though these permits may get snapped up quickly. Explore the park’s namesake sandstone foundations and learn more about the unique combination of elements that led to their creation, keeping an eye out for wildlife like bighorn sheep that have made a home in this desert landscape. From May 24 through Oct. 20, every vehicle that enters Rocky Mountain National Park will need a timed entry permit . There are two different types of permits: Timed Entry+, which includes popular destinations along Bear Lake Road, and the regular Timed Entry option, which excludes Bear Lake access. You’ll have to pay close attention as you reserve your permit. It might seem onerous to plan your trip activities so far in advance. But considering you’re helping preserve the park’s gorgeous, one-of-a-kind alpine landscapes using the timed entry system, a little extra legwork doesn’t seem so bad. When hiking to Lake Haiyaha or soaking up the sights at Moraine Park, your permit will be all the more worth it. As most of its attractions are deep underground, Carlsbad Caverns is slightly different from the other parks on this list. Carlsbad requires timed entry permits 362 days a year , from January through December. The only exceptions are Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s, when the park is closed to the public. But park officials have long restricted entry to Carlsbad Caverns, reducing strain on the sprawling cave system and karst formations. You can view the caves on ranger-guided tours, which depart from the visitor center several times a day, or you can hike down alone. In the summer of 2024, Glacier National Park will require visitors to have a vehicle reservation to access Going-to-the-Sun Road, the North Fork area, and Many Glacier valley. Entry to these areas will be restricted between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. from May 24 through Sept. 8, exact start dates vary with each location. If you have your trip dates set ahead of time, try to snag one of the reservations available 120 days (four months) before your trip. If you’re unsure, log in to recreation.gov early the day before your arrival to book a permit. Those reservations will grant you access to some of the most spectacular natural landscapes in the western U.S. Going-to-the-Sun Road winds past snowy Rocky Mountain peaks, while Many Glacier valley features dramatic alpine scenery that draws hikers from all over the world.

        "content": "Listen to Story Tennis legend Rafael Nadal said that he’s unsure of Roland Garros 2024 being his last appearance in the French Open after being knocked out by Alexander Zverev on Monday, May 27. Notably, Zverev emerged victorious against the 14-time French Open champion with a scoreline of 3-6, 6-7, 3-6. Despite being dominated by his opponent for most of the three-hour-long game , Nadal continued to fight his way back into the match through some of his vintage shots. Following his loss, the Spaniard thanked the crowd for their tremendous support throughout the game and said that he was not sure whether it would be his last appearance in the tournament ever. “The amount of energy.. it’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know if it’s gonna be the last time here in front of all of you. I’m not sure. But if it’s the last time I enjoyed it. The crowd was amazing during the whole week of preparation. Today the feelings I have are difficult to describe in words. For me it so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most,” Nadal said after the game. We love you too Rafa, and we hope to see you again next year ðçá #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/7hX4Gw46WE — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 “I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than 2 months ago. Maybe in 2 months I say it’s enough. But it’s something I don’t feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. That’s going to be another chance,” he added. Notably, Rolland Garros 2024 was Nadal’s first Grand Slam appearance of the year after he missed out on the Australian open. The 22-time Grand Slam winner got a rousing reception upon his arrival at the court where he has lived some of the highest points of his career. The southpaw was handed just the fourth loss of his illustrious career at the Rolland Garros as Zverev became just the third man to beat him at the grand event. Earlier, Robin Soderling (2009) and Novak Djokovic (2015 and 2021) have also emerged victorious against Nadal in the competition.",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce.

Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.

        "content": "The West Lothian club announced on Monday that he will remain in charge in the wake of relegation from the Premiership. The Lions won only five of their 38 league fixtures as they finished a grim campaign ten points adrift at the foot of the table, leading to the manager’s future becoming a talking point. However, Martindale’s near-decade of “dedication” to the club, including his largely positive stint as manager since November 2020, have been taken into consideration by directors John McIlvogue, John Ward and Dave Black. The club also acknowledged that the team had been hindered by the fact Martindale’s playing budget was significantly cut for the campaign just finished. “There is no getting away from the fact that this season has been disappointing,” it read. “Every single member of staff inside the building is hurting with how the year transpired and we know full well that the same disappointment and upset is shared amongst our supporters. “However, we now have an opportunity to regroup, both on the park and in the stands, but we can only do with everyone pulling in the same direction. “David has been involved with the coaching set-up here for almost ten years now. “His involvement in the dugout has seen us lift a League One title, win the Premiership play-offs, two top-six finishes, two seasons just missing out on the top six on the final game before the split, a national cup final appearance and a club record six consecutive seasons in the top flight. “For a club of our size and stature, that is an incredible return – and a list of achievements that David deserves huge credit for. “As your board, we believe that David has earned the right to remain as first-team manager and have the opportunity to try to steer us back to the Premiership. “His commitment and dedication to the club over the years is unrivalled and whilst that alone can’t be the sole driver behind remaining in charge, his qualities as a manager, as a coach and as a leader give us full confidence that David is the man we want in charge of this football club going forward.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "description": "A doctoral thesis at the University of Oslo's Faculty of Dentistry points to the possibility of reconsidering standard treatment routines, aiming to improve the quality of life for people who survive head and neck cancer.",
        "content": "A doctoral thesis at the University of Oslo's Faculty of Dentistry points to the possibility of reconsidering standard treatment routines, aiming to improve the quality of life for people who survive head and neck cancer. Globally, head and neck cancer accounts for 5% of all cancer types , with a mortality rate of 50%. However, in the Nordic countries, head and neck cancer accounts for only 2.6% of all cancers, with a mortality rate of just 30%. But more survivors mean that many must live with extensive damage and side effects after cancer and cancer treatment. \"It is the exposed and vulnerable location that makes head and neck cancer one of the most mutilating types of cancer,\" explains Lisa Printzell. She works as a specialist in oral prosthetics at the ear, nose, and throat department at Rikshospitalet. Recently, she completed a doctorate at the University of Oslo, where she investigated an alternative rehabilitation pathway for head and neck cancer patients. \"Damage from surgery and radiation therapy can make it difficult for patients to chew, swallow, and speak afterward,\" says Printzell. In some, their appearance changes significantly, which they may find incompatible with a normal or dignified life. Printzell also explains that before patients can receive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, a number of teeth often need to be removed to prevent infections. \"For most patients, this news comes as a great shock. Some find the news of having to pull teeth almost as brutal as the diagnosis of serious cancer,\" says the researcher. \"Anatomical changes after cancer surgery can create significant functional and aesthetic challenges. However, the side effects of radiation therapy are perhaps what make oral rehabilitation most demanding,\" Printzell explains. Patients often have thin, dry, and very fragile oral mucosa after radiation therapy, making it difficult to use ordinary dental prostheses that rest on toothless jaws. \"To achieve satisfactory oral rehabilitation in these patients, dental implants are often used to support and attach prostheses or other dental replacements,\" Printzell explains. Dental implants are titanium screws that are surgically inserted and integrated into the patient's jawbone. These so-called osseointegrated implants then serve as an attachment for various types of dental replacements. A major challenge in this context is that irradiated tissue has a reduced ability to heal, leading to reduced and uncertain integration (osseointegration) of dental implants. \"The survival of dental implants placed in irradiated jawbones is significantly lower than those placed in non-irradiated patients,\" says Printzell. She notes that any surgical procedure in previously irradiated jawbone carries an increased risk of infection. Besides the lack of healing ability, it can, in the worst case, result in osteoradionecrosis, where the jawbone dies as a result of the radiation treatment. Due to the risks involved, rehabilitation with dental implants for these patients is not considered until at least one year after the completion of radiation therapy. Patients experience this as a long waiting period with significantly reduced quality of life. \"Therefore, we need research on alternative methods. At the very least, methods that can provide a faster oral rehabilitation for the group of these patients who need it the most,\" explains Printzell. One possibility for this is to install the implants before radiation therapy starts, in connection with cancer surgery or tooth extraction. Printzell explains that so-called primary installation of implants is not unknown. Studies have shown an increased use of this approach in the past decade, always justified by the increased quality of life for patients. However, despite the undeniable benefits of faster oral rehabilitation, clinicians remain somewhat hesitant and skeptical of this approach. One reason for this is the concern about the \"backscatter effect,\" which occurs when radiation hits the implants. \"When ionizing radiation is directed at a cancerous tumor and there is a titanium implant in the radiation field, not all the radiation will penetrate the metal. Instead, it will reflect back to the surrounding tissue,\" Printzell explains. Healthy cells on the implant's surface will then receive a higher radiation dose and may suffer more damage than they would if there were no implant present. \"There is a concern that this will negatively affect the ongoing osseointegration (healing) of the implant, and thereby also the survival of the implant,\" says Printzell. Printzell notes that very little is known about how harmful this backscatter effect really is. Therefore, she and her colleagues wanted to investigate this further. They assessed the effect of backscatter radiation from titanium on two of the most important cell types for bone healing and osseointegration of dental implants . These cell types are called human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts. Human mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to develop into many different cell types, including osteoblasts, which are the precursors to mature bone cells. Printzell adds, \"In our experiments, these cells were seeded on two different titanium surfaces, as well as a plastic surface. The cells were then exposed to various doses of ionizing gamma radiation, relevant to what is used in cancer treatment. The titanium surfaces generated backscatter radiation to the cells, while the plastic surface represented 'jawbone without an implant present.'\" In cancer treatment, radiation doses are measured in gray (Gy). Gray is the international unit for measuring absorbed radiation dose. Patients typically receive radiation therapy in small doses (often 2 Gy) 5 days a week until the total dose (50–70 Gy) is achieved after 5–7 weeks. The purpose of administering many small doses over time is to give healthy cells in the radiation field time to repair minor DNA damage between doses. \"We found that backscatter radiation from titanium generated as much as a 40% increased radiation dose to the cells closest to the titanium surface. However, the lowest doses (2 and 6 Gy) caused minimal effect on the cells,\" says Printzell. Higher radiation dose (10 Gy) significantly reduced the number of osteoblasts (bone-producing cells) on titanium surfaces compared to plastic surfaces but increased the surviving cells' ability to develop into mature bone cells. \"We also found that the highest dose of 10 Gy inhibited both cell types' ability to move from one place to another on titanium, while lower doses (2 and 6 Gy) neither caused significant DNA damage nor affected the cells' ability to move. \"The results indicate that backscatter radiation from titanium at doses of 2 Gy does not cause greater cell damage than the same dose does without an implant present,\" says Printzell. She says more research is, of course, needed to establish this treatment as the first choice for this patient group. \"Nevertheless, we can conclude that our findings are important for the question of whether backscatter radiation from titanium implants should be a reason to avoid the so-called primary installation of implants in patients who are to undergo radiation therapy.\" Printzell explains that when they started this study, they knew there is an increased risk of placing implants in previously irradiated jawbone. What they did not know was whether it involves greater, lower, or the same risk to insert implants in these patients just before they undergo radiation therapy. \"What we did know, and still know today, is that implant-supported dental replacements significantly increase the quality of life for head and neck cancer patients, and the earlier the patient can be rehabilitated in this way, the shorter the road back to a somewhat normal life,\" says Printzell.

        "description": "The Palm Beach Health Network has become the latest health provider accused of illegally sharing identities and private health information of its patients with the social media company Meta, owner of Facebook.",
        "content": "The Palm Beach Health Network has become the latest health provider accused of illegally sharing identities and private health information of its patients with the social media company Meta, owner of Facebook. A lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach says the health network's websites share code with Meta that enables patients to be targeted with advertising on Facebook based on \"highly sensitive personal information\" they share. It names as defendants the Palm Beach Health Network Physicians Group, doing business as Palm Beach Health Network, and Palm Beach Gardens Community Hospital, doing business as Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. Palm Beach Health Network is the largest health care network in Palm Beach County, the suit states. It includes a large multi-specialty physician group, ambulatory surgery centers, outpatient diagnostic facilities, and six hospital and care centers, including Delray Medical Center, Good Samaritan Medical Center, Palm Beach Children's Hospital, St. Mary's Medical Center, West Boca Medical Center and Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. The network, according to the lawsuit, has \"disregarded the privacy rights of their patients who used their web properties by intentionally, willfully, recklessly and/or negligently failing to implement adequate and reasonable measures to ensure that the users' personally identifiable information and protected health information was safeguarded.\" Andrew Lofholm, spokesman for the network, said on Thursday, \"We are not commenting on that,\" referring to the lawsuit. The suit claims that the network installed Facebook's Meta Pixel and other invisible third-party tracking technology on its websites to intercept patients' information \"with the express purpose\" of disclosing the information to Meta and other third parties. Meta encourages businesses to install its tracking code and does not offer any tools that allow users \"to opt out of such extensive tracking,\" the suit states, adding, \"even the most sophisticated users who enable cookie blockers cannot avoid having their information tracked through the various Meta tracking tools.\" The practice violates the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as state and federal law, the suit claims. The technology collects patient data regardless of whether they have a Facebook account, the suit states. \"Facebook maintains 'shadow profiles' on users without Facebook accounts and links information collected via the Pixel to the user's real-world identity using their shadow profile,\" it says. The lawsuit alleges that its lead plaintiff, Ron Prosky, used Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center's website and patient portal to search for doctors, make appointments, review medical treatments and review his medical records, including imaging results, for a specific health issue that the publicly available version of the lawsuit redacted. Prosky then began receiving advertisements on his Facebook account \"relating to his particular medical conditions and treatments,\" the suit claims. After receiving information about patients and their conditions, \"Meta then shares the information with additional unauthorized third parties whose businesses and advertisements are related to those conditions,\" the suit claims. Prosky relied on the health network's privacy policies and reasonably expected it would safeguard his private information, the suit alleges. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of claims since 2022 accusing health networks across the United States of illegally sharing patient information with third parties such as Facebook and Google. In January, North Carolina-based Norvant Health agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle claims against it. In 2022, the company admitted that 1.3 million patients' information was leaked to Facebook, saying Pixel was \"configured incorrectly.\" In 2023, Advocate Aurora Health agreed to pay $12.25 million to settle multiple lawsuits alleging pixel tracking tools, including Meta, Google and others. In a separate case, Milwaukee-based Froedtert Health reached a $2 million settlement over charges it installed the Meta Pixel tool without patients' knowledge, according to Becker's Hospital Review. Last July, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights and the Federal Trade Commission sent letters to 66 hospitals and health systems warning that they might be violating federal health privacy laws by installing pixel tracking technologies on their websites. Palm Beach Health Network was not among the systems notified, according to a post by Becker's Hospital Review. Meta itself is the subject of a class-action suit in California filed in June 2022 by plaintiffs who claim at least 664 medical entities use its technology, according to published reports. Meta blamed the providers, stating they control the code placed on their websites and they choose what information it sends to Meta. Meta also argued that the plaintiffs did not violate patients' health privacy, saying the only information the company received were the URLs of websites browsed by the plaintiffs. Two motions by Meta to have the lawsuit dismissed failed. One claimed patients hadn't sufficiently established the company's intent to collect their information. That was defeated by the judge in August. In January, the judge disagreed with Meta's contention that an amended complaint lacked specific examples that patients' information was transmitted. He ruled that the information provided was sufficient to allow the lawsuit to advance to the discovery phase. The lawsuit against the Palm Beach County providers seeks damages, other equitable relief, treble and/or punitive damages, interest and attorneys' fees. It was filed by Clarkson Law Firm of Malibu, California, and Almeida Law Group of Chicago.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese three under-the-radar growth stocks picked by the new GPT-4o AI bot could deliver massive gains if the AI model is right.The post 3 Growth Stocks the New ‘GPT-4o’ AI Bot Says Will Make You Rich appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "OpenAI has recently released its GPT-4o AI bot, touted as a more advanced version of its previous language models. This new bot is more focused on voice inputs and usefulness in day-to-day living than pure logic or reasoning. However, its improvements over previous GPT-4 models have not been groundbreaking, to say the least. That said, it is still worth exploring how this AI bot approaches the stock market. Playing with prompts and asking for different stock picks can provide some interesting ideas to research. I did precisely that on some stocks that the GPT-4o bot has picked. I asked it for more “under-the-radar” growth stocks , as it regurgitated the usual FAANG/Magnificent 7 tech giants when prompted for growth picks. Here are the three I got. MongoDB (MDB) I agree with GPT-4o that MongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB ) is a company well-positioned for growth. MongoDB provides a platform that allows developers to build and update applications with greater ease and efficiency. In the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, MongoDB again showed solid execution. Revenue increased 27% to $458 million . Additionally, both revenue and earnings exceeded expectations. Atlas, their cloud database offering, remains the key driver of growth, growing 34% and now accounting for 68% of the company’s total revenue. The company added over 7,000 new customers last year across both small startups and large Fortune 500 companies. MongoDB’s earnings per share metric is very bullish, considering the 86 cents figure beat analyst estimates by 39 cents. Paying 148-times forward earnings here is definitely quite the premium. However, the company should be able to sustain annual revenue growth well above 25% for years to come, along with juicy earnings growth averaging roughly 40%. Even if this stock’s premium remains 50% intact, MDB stock should deliver significant gains over the next decade. DexCom (DXCM) DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM ) is in the continuous glucose monitoring business. The company’s G7 system, which came out last year, has already made a big impact with how accurate and easy to use it is, plus how well it connects to popular devices. In Q1, DexCom saw their sales grow an impressive 25% to $921 million , beating estimates. Earnings per share also beat by 18.6%. It’s a major positive that more doctors are recommending the G7, and insurance is covering this device for more patients. What gives me hope is how fast DexCom innovates on new products. Since releasing the G7, the company has sent out monthly updates to improve how it functions, connects to other things, and is used. Getting approved to connect directly to the Apple Watch makes this device the first CGM that can do that. With more people (sadly) getting diabetes worldwide, DexCom’s top-notch glucose monitoring system sets up DexCom well for strong growth. If the company can keep making progress like this, I definitely think DXCM stock can outperform. The stock is still down some 19% from its 2021 high. Nutrien (NTR) Nutrien (NYSE: NTR ) is another solid pick by GPT-4o. A fertilizer company, Nutrien is also a different type of bet than the other two. That’s because Nutrien’s growth is relatively muted, so a recovery is what I’m hoping for. And I think that recovery is underway, since NTR stock has appreciated 24% since mid-February. Nutrien reported adjusted EBITDA of CAD$1.1 billion , aided by improved margins on crop nutrients, higher fertilizer production meeting strong demand, increased sales volume, and lower operational expenses. The company’s agricultural retail division also saw significant year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA. According to Nutrien’s estimates, global supply and demand for potash appear fairly balanced. The company is maintaining its full-year forecast for worldwide potash shipments at 68-71 million metric tonnes. I believe Nutrien is well-positioned to benefit from these favorable market dynamics and continue recovering. Indeed, NTR stock seems to have bottomed out at current levels.

        "description": "As consumers are more commonly using buy now, pay later programs to purchase big-ticket items, companies have new consumer protections they must follow.",
        "content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday in a new rule that buy now, pay later companies must provide consumers with the same legal rights and protections as credit card lenders. That includes the right to demand a refund and to dispute transactions. The agency began an inquiry into the short-term lending industry two years ago, and it issued the rule in response to ongoing consumer complaints, it said. Here's what you need to know. What's behind the new regulation? Buy now, pay later loans are typically marketed as zero-interest, or low interest, and allow consumers to spread out payments for purchases over several weeks or months. They’re marketed as a way to buy expensive products and services over time, and the service is typically offered at checkout for online shopping. It’s often used for big-ticket items, like furniture, clothes and airline tickets. In a report , the CFPB found that more than 13% of buy now, pay later transactions involved a return or dispute, and, in 2021, people disputed or returned $1.8 billion in transactions at the five companies surveyed. “Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. How is the industry responding to the rule? Two major buy now, pay later players — Affirm and Klarna — say they welcomed the regulation. “We are encouraged that the CFPB is promoting consistent industry standards, many of which already reflect how Affirm operates, to provide greater choice and transparency for consumers,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. Affirm currently offers “dispute and error resolution assistance,” the spokesman added. Company News Americans cutting back spending on nonessential items at major retailers Justin Boggs 8:34 AM, May 23, 2024 A spokesperson for Klarna said the company also already investigates consumer disputes and covers related refunds. The agency's announcement is a “significant step forward” in regulating the buy now, pay later industry, Klarna said in a statement. It said it has been calling for regulatory oversight “over many years.” While some in the industry have voluntarily chosen to operate at the standard now mandated by the CFPB's new rule, there remain significant differences between credit card lending and buy now, pay later loans. For instance, buy now, pay later lenders do not all report their loans to the three major credit bureaus. Some analysts have said this can lead consumers to overextend themselves or take on more debt than they can manage or afford. What rights do consumers have? The CFPB said that buy now, pay later lenders need to extend many of the same rights and protections as classic credit card providers. “Importantly, these cover dispute and refund rights,” the agency said. The agency clarified that, with its new rule, buy now, pay later lenders must: - Investigate disputes. Lenders must also pause payment requirements during the investigation and sometimes must issue credits. - Refund returned products or canceled services. Buy now, pay later lenders must credit the refunds to consumers’ accounts. - Provide billing statements. Consumers must receive periodic statements of money owed similar to the ones received for classic credit card accounts. “The failure to provide dispute protections can create chaos for consumers when they return their merchandise or encounter other billing difficulties,” the CFPB said.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",

        "content": "After a few weekends of not playing anything, I got the itch to just play something, so I went back to the FF7 remake. I won't say it \"clicked\" for me this time necessarily, I still think the combat is wildly overrated and the pacing of this game has been so far pretty horrible, but after a couple of really boring early chapters, Chapter 4 and 5 were significantly more interesting to me than basically anything that came before it outside of the opener. And I quite literally have nothing else to play right now, so I may as well see this to the end. Also I don't care if it is all a trick, Jessie you are welcome to ruin my life. Hopped back on Tekken 8 because I have a local tournament coming up this week. Starting again after a break was rough but after a couple days I think I can hold my own again. Also, finally started Hi-Fi Rush and it's been delightful. Dave The Diver and Animal Well are queued up next. Still playing FF7 Rebirth (102 hours, now in Chapter 12) and a little bit of Fallout 76 here and there. I’m having a lot of fun with Stellar Blade! For a game that actually has a lot of little issues that do add up, it’s getting enough right to keep me fully engaged, though I am surprised just how much it really does take from NieR. I was looking for something breezy and this is fitting the bill wonderfully. @Jimmer-jammer Did you play Fallen Order? If so, how does it compare to Stellar Blade? @Black_Swordsman Structurally, I’d say Fallen Order is actually a pretty fair comparison, though Stellar Blade is a fair bit more clumsy in it’s execution and its writing and characters just aren’t on the same level. Beyond that, little things like unpausable/unskippable cutscenes and a protagonist who tends to control like a dump truck at the most inopportune times chip away from what could be a smoother experience. Overall, it fits well within PlayStation’s portfolio of graphically sexy, straightforward and polished comfort food. @Jimmer-jammer I'm glad to hear it's not all bad, then. I loved Fallen Order but from what you say overall I think I will still give Stellar Blade a pass. Eyeing up RotR for when I end my gaming break, so I'll tag you when I have gotten round to the part of the game where you're past the early hours and the real experience begins! Got a specific build in mind, but not Berserk-related this time. 😉 I love the fact that there are preset character creation codes in the game. I'll give you a clue as to my build. \"Got the coin for it?\" 😃 @Black_Swordsman You actually get to make two characters, so you can probably role play that even farther than you might think 😊 I'm making my way through Sand Land and finding it pretty enjoyable. Definitely my type of game. Also still playing and loving Sea of Thieves. I'm playing Rise of the Ronin currently. So far it seems like Ghost of Tsushima with better combat which is a good thing because I loved that game. I'll probably make a start on WRC 10 tomorrow also. WRC 9 was great so I'm expecting more of the same. @xeofate I just started this as well (RotR) I went for a Geralt of Rivia build as I was saying to Jimmer-jammer above. Only played a bit so far, loving the combat which is excellent as you say. I remapped the controls to make them match the control scheme for the Souls games. 😃 Did you go for a specific type of character for your primary Blade Twin? @Black_Swordsman That's not a bad idea remapping the controls actually, might do that myself. I went with the Dex build of Breaker like I always do in souls games. For the main protagonist I kind of made him like an old greying Jin from Ghost of Tsushima. As for the other Blade Twin I made her like my pawn in Dragon's Dogma 2 which was named after my old German Shepherd dog Rusty I've been in a bit of a gaming slump since beating Dragon's Dogma 2 but I think this game is going to change that, liking it so far. xeofate wrote: I'm playing Rise of the Ronin currently. . Black_Swordsman wrote: @xeofate I just started this as well (RotR) I am many hours into RotR and have enjoyed my journey so far i think its a better game than GoT but that's just my opinion. Decided to give XDefiant a try. I've been looking for a game that I can play when I have a spare 15 minutes and this looks like it'll be perfect for that. I've put in a few hours on Deliver Us Mars. The story seems compelling enough, the graphics and score are fantastic and the exploration puzzle gameplay is pretty much what I'd expected from playing the first game. The only thing that's getting to me is the jankiness of the character animations, it's like half way between cartoon and realism and keeps throwing me out of full immersion. The spacey sci-fi geek in me is enjoying it so far though. Just started RotR properly. Looks promising so far. Loving the combat. Edit: Just beat the Prologue and first boss. Proper action rpg game so far. Edit 2: Haha, didn't realise the second boss that you're meant to defeat was actually the final boss battle of the prologue, completed and got the appropriate trophy this morning🤣 . @Jimmer-jammer Now let loose in the world! @xeofate Idk how it is for you but, also, RotR strongly reminds me of TW3 so far for some reason. I think it's related to the quest & leveling-up system.",

However, in an exclusive conversation with PEOPLE magazine for this week’s issue, she revealed the secret to maintaining a young and glowing appearance. “The best facelift is a smile,” Seymour told the outlet adding, “If you want to look young, just smile from ear to ear.” But, “to set the record straight — because people were getting it wrong — they attempted to do something to my under-eyes when I was 40 because photographers kept saying that I had bulgy eyes,” the now 73-year-old Harry Wild star revealed. She continued, “The doctor told me it's actually a muscle, so there's nothing I can do about it.” Additionally, the British actress also quipped that she’s had “quite a good career considering the bulgy eye” however she mentioned that she does not want to “do anything permanent.” “I've been playing a lot of amazing roles, recently two women with Alzheimer's with very emotional scenes, and if you're going to be that emotional, you need every muscle in your face,” Jane Seymour added, explaining why she avoids synthetic procedures.",

Talking to Sportskeeda Cricket , Akram joked: \"At least this time, Indian players will not make an excuse of being tired during the mega event.\" \"Well, now at least none of them will have to say that they are tired. They were thinking ahead, what is the point of reaching the final, India is more important, we will play with the country. But it could be a blessing in disguise for India,\" he said. \"We discussed in the previous show that I was worried that they might be tired, and they will be tired, no doubt. Even America is not their road. I think Pakistan's first match is Dallas if I remember. Now they will go and play there, one or two practice matches. It will be okay, I suppose. It is T20, the boys will recover, nowadays fitness levels are very high.” The first batch of Indian players, who did not play in IPL playoffs, left for the USA on Saturday evening including their captain Rohit Sharma and others. Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Dube, Mohammed Siraj, Axar Patel and Shubman Gill left India on Saturday night for the upcoming T20 World Cup. Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd. Siraj. Reserves: Shubman Gill, Rinku Singh, Khaleel Ahmed and Avesh Khan.

        "description": "Rafael Nadal suffers crushing defeat at the hands of Alexander Zverev in French tennis tournament",
        "content": "Tennis star Rafael Nadal has been knocked out of the French Open 2024 in Round 1 by Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6(5) and 6-3 on Monday. Nadal, who won 22 Grand Slams, tried to give his best similar to that of the old days to triumph on Court Philippe Chatrier, but the 37-year-old failed. In a post-match talk, the 14-time Roland Garros champion said Monday: \"It is incredible, I want to say thank you. It is difficult for me to talk. I am not 100% sure if this is going to be the last time I am in front of you. The feelings I have today are hard to describe.\" \"To feel the love in the place I love the most. I have to congratulate Sascha for this great match. I know 2022 has been a super tough moment for you and so I wish you the best.\" Rafael Nadal was able to secure 90 points over his opponent’s 109. He was served at 0-30 in his potentially last game, according to The Telegraph . The Spanish athlete underwent a hip surgery rendering him to only play four tournaments since January last year. Nadal won his maiden French Open title in 2005. Till then, he had 14 titles on his name. He said: \"I have been going through a tough moment, so many injuries but I went through it to get back here. I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. There is a big chance I won’t be back but I can’t say 100%. My body is feeling better than two months ago.\" The Spaniard’s impeccable record at Clay makes him as widely the greatest player of Clay's season as in 116 matches he played at Roland Garros, he only lost four times, which includes Monday’s defeat. Nadal added: \"I have amazing feelings on this court, I never dreamed as a kid I would be here at 28. Sorry, 38. I would love to be 28! All the memories have been different, so special. Support has been unforgettable. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here, to be honest. I'm not 100 sure.\"",

On May 26, 2024, Sunday, the 47-year-old actor took to his official Instagram account to upload a subtle tribute the late star. The post, originally shared by the comedian Mathias Nastos was actually about missing Candy and his presence. “Sometimes outta nowhere...I’ll think of this guy and miss the living hell out of him,” a comment across a photo of Candy read in capital letters. Reynolds shared the post on one of his Instagram Stories, set to the instrumentals of the song, Power to Believe by The Dream Academy, the soundtrack of the late actor’s film, Plane Trains and Automobiles. “Retro Rewind 80s: The Candy Man Can,” the caption of the Instagram post added. “Although guys like Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd tend to get most of the recognition for their 80s comedies, John Candy was easily one of the funniest men in the movies,” the caption of the reposted upload read. It continued, “The man had perfect comedic timing on screen, charisma that was second to none, and the ability to make every film better with even the smallest of cameos.”",

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani on Monday signed two new ordinances, the Election Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024. After the promulgation of Election Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, the election tribunals will have the retired judges as its members besides the serving jurists. Meanwhile, the NAB Ordinance extended the period of remanding accused in National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cases from 14 days to 40 days. Moreover, the sentence duration for the officer convicted for framing cases based on ill will has been reduced to two years from five years. The promulgation comes after the federal cabinet’s approval of the amendments in the two ordinances. The acting president signed the Election (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as President Asif Zardari is currently in Dubai. The development comes ahead of the Supreme Court hearing of the NAB amendments case, which is slated to take place on May 30. A three-member bench of the SC, in September 2023, had approved Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan’s petition challenging amendments made to the country’s accountability laws during the tenure of the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led government. Headed by then-chief justice Umar Ata Bandial, and comprising Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ijazul Ahsan, the court held more than 50 hearings and in its majority 2-1 verdict restored graft cases against public office holders that were closed down following the amendments. The apex court ordered restoring all graft cases, worth less than Rs500 million against the political leaders belonging to different political parties and public office holders, which were closed and declared the amendments void. The verdict provisioned far-reaching consequences as the striking down of the amendments would mean that references against some of the country’s political bigwigs will once again land in the accountability courts. Following the verdict, the federal government filed an appeal under Section 5 of the Supreme Court law against the apex court’s order.",

        "content": "LAHORE: Announcing the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) intra-party elections, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Public and Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has said that party supremo Nawaz Sharif will be seen proactively \"playing his role in national politics soon\". Sanaullah, addressing a press conference in Lahore on Monday, announced that the ruling party commenced the process of the intra-party elections by the PML-N’s constitution and an election commission was also established by a central working committee. The former federal minister said that nomination papers were issued from 9am to 5pm today which would also be continued before 12pm by tomorrow (Tuesday). \"Scrutiny of the nomination papers will be performed at 1pm, whereas, candidates could withdraw their nominations by 2:30pm, tomorrow.\" He added: “Overall, 11 nominations have been issued so far. At 3pm tomorrow, final lists of the candidates will be issued and a general council’s session will be held afterwards.” He added that the party would organise the polls for electing its president at 4pm tomorrow. Sanaullah went on to say that Bashir Memon, Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, Ishaq Dar, Raja Muhammad Farooq, Hafiz Hafeez-ur-Rehman and Shah Ghulam Qadir have received their nomination papers today. He said that Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — a disgruntled PML-N leader who had applied to register a new political party last month — could also submit his nominations, however, the scrutiny committee will decide on his “eligibility” to contest the party’s intra-party polls. Regarding Nawaz, the PML-N senior leader said that the entire party agreed on the former premier’s name for the party’s presidency. \"However, the party would welcome if someone else wants to submit nominations for taking part in the upcoming polls.\" Sanaullah further said that Nawaz transformed the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz into a popular public party after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah that ruled the country four times. “In case no candidates, the party’s president would be elected unopposed, otherwise, polling will be held via a show of hands,” he added. The politico said that Nawaz was not angry with someone and was fully active in national politics. He added that all decisions of the federal and the Punjab governments would be taken after Nawaz's approval. He further said that lesser statements from the PML-N supremo would be ended, soon. The premier’s aide added that the ruling PML-N was considering recommendations to reshuffle the party positions. He said that Shehbaz Sharif would be the next leader after Nawaz on which the entire party was agreed upon for the presidency. He praised Shehbaz, the incumbent prime minister, for making maximum efforts to pull the country out of the economic crisis. To a question regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Sanaullah replied that he would continue to warn the nation against the former ruling party’s founder Imran Khan. He added that he was continuously warning the nation that the ousted premier would push the country into a big turmoil. The former security czar said that he was unaware of sources pushing the incarcerated PTI founder for making political blunders, however, “stupidity” could be committed by any individual. “I would pray for the PTI founder not to face the same consequences as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” he added.",

        "content": "KARACHI: The provincial authorities once again deferred the matriculation exams in Karachi slated for Tuesday as the country will observe national holiday tomorrow on account of Youm-e-Takbeer. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced a public holiday on Youm-e-Takbeer to mark the historic day when Pakistan conducted successful nuclear tests in the hills of Chaghai in 1998. Later, Sindh Universities and Boards Minister Mohammad Ali Malkani announced that the papers of IX and X classes will not take place in the metropolis tomorrow (Tuesday) due to the holiday. He said that a new date for tomorrow’s papers will be announced later. It may be noted that the Board of Secondary Education Karachi (BSEK) had announced a new schedule for the matric exams, which had been deferred for almost a week due to extremely hot weather. The BSEK had postponed the remaining papers of the IX and X classes, which were supposed to be held between May 21-27, in the wake of an expected heatwave in Sindh. Meanwhile, University of Karachi also announced holiday tomorrow in line with the official announcement. The exams due to be held tomorrow in the varsity have been deferred. In a statement released earlier in the day, PM Shehbaz said the Youm-e-Takbeer reminded the Pakistani nation of unity to make the defence of the country invincible. On this day, the premier said, the entire nation had resolved for the integrity of this country that no compromise would be made on the country’s defence by accepting any kind of external pressure. “The Youm-e-Takbeer reminds political and defence forces to unite under one flag, the green crescent flag, to strengthen the defence of this country,” he added.",

        "content": "Kenyan content creator Brenda Jons has made a comeback citing spiritual renewal as the reason why she took a social media detox. In a recent post on social media, the born-again content creator revealed that she had taken a three-month hiatus to focus on deepening her connection with her faith. \"Fasting social media, I took 3 months away to just soak and hear God more clearly. It's been the best vacation ever!!!!\" Brenda Jons said. Jons confessed that for a significant period, she had allowed social media to define her identity, but felt it was time to rediscover herself through the lens of her faith quoting a verse from the book of Jeremiah. \"Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; before you were born, I sanctified you; and I ordained you a prophet to the nations,\" she said. \"I needed to know who that person is. How does He define me and what a faithful God.\" During her hiatus, Brenda Jons shared that she dedicated herself to reading the Bible more fervently, allowing its teachings to guide her. She highlighted the importance of meditation and cited the verse from the Gospel according to John; \"The sheep recognize the voice of the shepherd, the one who feeds them, guides them, and protects them.\" \"Now I can hear Him more. How beautiful,\" she expressed. \"I missed you friends, catch me up, what has the Lord been teaching you?\" she asked. In September 2022, the comedian revealed that she had “As humans we grow every day, things change every day, we develop every day and discover ourselves every day. And with time, I am realizing that wasn’t my identity. It wasn’t who I am but more of a phase,” she stated. The 25-year-old content creator explained that her previous lifestyle was a phase she needed to experience. She has since moved past it and is now focusing on a fulfilling relationship with God. “I accept change, I accept when my life is taking a different turn and I am never scared to start from scratch. I let life flow and I think at this point I am letting God take control of my life,” she stated. “I know people will point fingers saying that I had initially said am gay but I have seen the value of a man in a woman’s life and am telling you a different story and those that will find me to be confused good for you.”",

        "content": "The Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, has said the state under his watch has the lowest records of out-of-school children in Nigeria. He attributed the feat to the huge investment of his government in the education sector. Soludo disclosed this during the 2024 Children’s Day celebration held at the Alex Ekwueme Square on Monday, which witnessed March past by school children and uniformed organisations, cutting of cake, cultural dance and fashion parade, among other activities He said, “We’re here to celebrate our future, our future, and others who were not able to join us here. This is the third time I’ve witnessed Children’s Day since I assumed office, but this is the largest. “I can see the glorious future of Anambra and Nigeria as we behold their faces. We’re deliberately investing in our children, who are our bridge. “In two years, we’ve employed over 8,000 teachers because they’re our greatest asset. Currently, Anambra has the lowest number of out-of-school children in the country. We are targeting making it zero. “We’re having sleepless nights because of you. Roads will wash away, skyscrapers will collapse, but investment in children will stand the test of time.” While commending the teachers for their commitments to training the children, the governor assured that his government would not lower the bar in the recruitment of standard teachers, stressing that Anambra children deserved the best. “We call on everyone to invest in education because it is everyone’s responsibility. If you can save money on your favourite brand of drink, you can buy a pencil for the child. That’s a way of investing in education,” he added. The Commissioner for Women’s Affairs and Social Welfare, Hon. Ify Obinabo, urged parents to offer their children the needed parent-child relationship and make their homes more conducive for them to thrive amidst challenges. “Governor Soludo’s manifesto shows that enhancing the well-being of the Nigerian child through quality education and skill development is possible and achievable to build a livable and prosperous homeland. “Enhancing the well-being of the Nigerian child is not the sole responsibility of the government. It requires multi-stakeholder synergy, such as parents and guardians, whose major role focuses on creating the needed healthy environment for our children to blossom,” she said. The State Commissioner of Police, CP Nnaghe Obono Itam, who also witnessed the celebration, urges parents and guardians to be better role models for their children and wards by creating a deliberate relationship with them, as it will help to assess and direct them properly. In her brief congratulatory message, the Convener of WIGA (Umunwanyi Soludo), Hon. Mrs Amaka Obi, urged the children to always believe in themselves while pursuing their dreams in life. The Nigerian Tribune reports that the winners of this celebration include Girls Secondary School Awka (secondary category), Udoka Primary School Awka (practitioner school category), and Nadora Nursery School Awka (nursery school category).

        "content": "Andela, a leading private marketplace for technical talent, said it grew Nigeria’s technical talent by 791 per cent in the last four years, starting in January 2020. The growth milestone was announced as Andela celebrates its 10th anniversary with a series of international events recently held across the United States, the United Kingdom, and multiple African countries. Andela said in a statement on Thursday that it had played a significant role in transforming Africa’s tech landscape, training over 110,000 technologists since January 2020. “110,000 technologists have been trained through Andela’s programs, exceeding the original 10-year goal of 100,000. 15 per cent of Africa’s estimated 716,000 engineers were skilled through Andela,” the company stated. According to the co-founder and CEO of Andela, Jeremy Johnson, building a great company was fundamentally an exercise in hiring great people. The CEO remarked, “At Andela, I have been unbelievably blessed to work with extraordinary humans on this now decade-long journey. Bringing people together and fostering a sense of community in our marketplace has been part of our secret sauce. “As we look to the future, Andela will continue to show why we are the most trusted tech talent marketplace for enterprises. Our customers will continue to experience the world as a hiring pool, and technology will continue to enable us to extend that reach,” Johnson expounded. Abdela is backed by prominent investors such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Softbank, Google Ventures, Serena Ventures, and Generation Investment Management, making it the first talent marketplace to become a unicorn company and one of the seven unicorn companies founded in Africa. Through its rigorously qualified global marketplace of skilled technologists, Andela’s adaptive hiring model has emerged as a future-proof solution, empowering businesses such as MasterCard, GitHub, and Tawi Fesh to rapidly scale world-class teams on demand to meet their evolving needs, the company stated. By tapping into 60 per cent of Andela’s qualified tech talent pool from largely untapped markets like Africa and LATAM, these businesses gain access to cost-efficient tech expertise and diversity of thought while also benefiting from hiring speeds up to 70 per cent faster than traditional recruiting methods. The Community Programs Manager of Andela, Ofejiro Ikogho, said, “We, at Andela, celebrate a decade of impact and reflect on the transformative journey that began in Lagos. Over these years, our technologists have been instrumental in catalyzing the growth of tech communities across Africa, showcasing their profound talent and potential.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal cut an emotional figure after falling to a first round French Open defeat to Alexander Zverev. The tennis legend has won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles in Paris and is dubbed as the 'King of Clay' amid such immense success. Nadal missed last year's French Open due to injury and hinted that 2024 could be his final year of action ahead of retirement. And his hopes of winning the tournament one more time potentially came to an end on Monday in a 3-6 6-7 3-6 first round defeat to Zverev. Nadal appeared downbeat afterwards, with the crowd applauding him having set such a long-lasting legacy on the court. Zverev was first to speak after his win but kept it short: \"Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment. I'm not going to speak much.\" Nadal then said: \"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's going to be the last time that I'm going to be here in front of all of you, honestly. \"I am not 100 per cent sure but if it's the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparation. \"And today, the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words but for me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most.\" He added: \"I have to congratulate Sascha [Zverev] for this great match and last week victory in Rome [Italian Open], I really wish you all the best for the rest of the tournament. \"2022 I know had been a super tough moment for you so you deserve many congratulations and all the best. \"For me, as I said before, I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through this process to try to... with the dream to be back here in Roland Garros. \"I hope to see you again\" Rafael Nadal gives a heartfelt speech after his loss to Alexander Zverev 🥹🎾 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/SPvDiyocAC \"It's true that the first round hasn't been the ideal one, so I just have to accept that, I needed something else. I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player like Sascha. \"For me, it's difficult to say what's going on in the future. It's probably a big percentage that I will not be back playing here at Roland Garros, but I can't say 100 per cent. \"I enjoy playing here a lot, I am travelling with the family and I'm having fun. The body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say, 'It's enough, I can't give anything else.' But this is something I don't feel yet, I have some goals in front [of me]. \"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me. That's going to be another chance and I really hope to be well prepared. \"The amount of feelings that I have on this amazing court during all my tennis career is just unbelievable, I never could imagine when I was a kid that I will be here almost 28... 38-years-old, I would love 28, with all the success that I had here winning so many times. \"Something I never could dream about and yeah, it has been a very beautiful process, all the memories every single year have been different but not less special than the others. \"And what makes me feel so special is everything, all the people who are in Roland Garros behind the scenes, helping me since the first time that I came here, have been unforgettable, all the support. \"The support of all my people there, family, team, friends, everybody who helped me in some moment of my life, I can't thank enough all of them. \"Last thing, all the people, the feelings that you made me feel here are just unforgettable. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart and I really hope to see you again, I don't know. Merci beaucoup!\" Nadal's dominance at the French Open commenced with his first title in 2005 before further success followed in the next three years. The 37-year-old the became the first and only player to ever win five successive titles at Roland Garros from 2010 to 2014. He won a further five titles after that to cement his legendary status in Paris, with his last triumph coming in 2022. Nadal missed the Australian Open at the beginning of the year due to a muscle problem and with retirement a possibility, he could be set to play two final Grand Slams. Next up is Wimbledon in July, a tournament he has won on two occasions, with the US Open the last major tournament in August.",

        "content": "Despite Joe Burrow suffering a season-ending right wrist injury in Week 11 last season, the Cincinnati Bengals don't seem too concerned about the quarterback's health. Before the start of OTAs on Tuesday, Bengals offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher told Geoff Hobson of the team website that Burrow won't be on a pitch count. \"We designed the whole thing to stay within the constraints of where the medical people think he should be and where he wants to be right now,\" Pitcher said , via Hobson. \"Nobody is sitting there with a special pitch counter. But we've been smart in how we put it together.\" Pitcher also seemed to signal Burrow is making a quick recovery, noting how he has \"all his range and power.\" Burrow — a former No. 1 overall pick — is one of the best QBs in the league, but his durability is an issue. During his rookie season in 2020, he suffered a season-ending ACL tear. He also injured his calf during training camp last season. If Burrow stays healthy, he could help the Bengals win their first Super Bowl. The 27-year-old QB guided Cincinnati to Super Bowl LVI, where the Bengals lost 23-20 to the Los Angeles Rams. Plus, he leads active players in completion percentage ( 68 percent ), per Pro Football Reference. Joe Burrow connecting with Ja'Marr Chase for a 64-yard touchdown! (Via: NFL, CBS) pic.twitter.com/ZP7fFNRdKN The Bengals' decision not to place Burrow on a pitch count could be an excellent sign. It suggests that they're not worried about him suffering another injury, and he is making solid progress. In 2021, Burrow won Comeback Player of the Year. Perhaps he'll capture the award for a second time this upcoming season. As of Monday, DraftKings gives him the second-best CPOY odds (+200) behind New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers.",

        "description": "Do the Nuggets or the Avs have more heavy lifting left in order to get back to winning a championship?",
        "content": "OK, the reality of the Nuggets’ elimination clobbered me over the head Sunday. And scratched my arms and hurt my back. Instead of spending the day in Dallas preparing for the Western Conference Finals Game 3, I removed a bush in my front yard. The bush won. But after my light head regained its bearings, I started thinking: Who has more work to do this offseason to win a championship? Is it the Nuggets or the Avs, who also exited in the second round? Oh, that’s easy, compadre. It’s the Avalanche. Not only do the ’22 Stanley Cup champs have two holes among their top-6 forwards in the absences of Valeri Nichushkin and Gabe Landeskog, but the timetables involving both remain a mystery. With the former, he’s slated to get the first crack at applying for reinstatement from his suspension in November, which is great. But what happens after that? Big Val made it 40 games this last regular season before having to re-enter the player assistance program — and was brilliant for much of those 40 games, collecting 22 goals and 20 assists before leaving for roughly a month. How long will it take him to get back up to speed? How long will he be able to remain on the active roster under increased testing and monitoring cycles? Every week could feel like a roll of the dice. For me, it is also the Avs. They remain in an uncomfortable position with captain Gabe Landeskog and Valeri Nichushkin. Landeskog has five years remaining on his $56 million contract. He has not played in two years, and while his motivation remains fierce to play for his family and teammates, there is no guarantee he will return from cartilage replacement surgery in his right knee. And the Avs don’t just need him back. They need him back as an impact player. We all want Nichushkin healthy. He cannot return until November from his suspension, and only if he follows the protocol. It creates a squeamish scenario of bringing Nichushkin back to a potentially untrusting locker room while getting elite production and wondering if he will be banned for his next misstep. If anybody’s going to fight to get back on the ice, and leave on his own terms, it’s Landy. Gabe’s joke last week about his return landing at any point from “mid-September and start of April” got some chuckles, but it’s also getting less funny by the month. In order to move forward, even in the short term, the Avs need to figure out whether they’ve got the cap money from an LTIR designation to play with or not — or whether they’ve got an active captain or not. If you don’t respect what Landy brought to the Avs over more than a decade, you haven’t got a soul. But nobody’s winning another Cup until all this murky and vague stuff has clarity. The key for the Avs and Nuggets is winning in the margins. They need Botox, not facelifts. For the Avs, that means or, on the pricier side, Evan Rodrigues. They also should benefit from a full season of trade deadline acquisitions Casey Mittelstadt and Sean Walker. The Nuggets are likely to lose Kentavious Caldwell-Pope — the Sixers are the favorite — and Christian Braun is probably a year away from being ready to start on a championship team. So would the Nuggets consider a trade for a viable replacement? And let’s be honest, Nikola Jokic needs a backup to log minutes during the regular season, so how about dealing for Kelly Olynyk? The Nuggets cannot stand down and elevate next year. The good news? The floors for both the Nuggets and Avs are still relatively high and the cores are largely intact. For now. But the clock is ticking for Calvin Booth, too. There’s KCP. Jamal Murray can become an unrestricted free agent after next season. Aaron Gordon has a player option with a June 29, 2025 deadline. Jokic’s player-option deadline looms two years after that. Even if the Avs are happy to play the “long game” by waiting out Val and Landy, if the Nuggets think they’ve got the same luxury, they’re fooling themselves. Time flies when you’re having this much fun.",

        "content": "QUÉBEC — The Tri-City ValleyCats (6-9) fired on all cylinders for a 5-1 victory against the Québec Capitales (7-8) on Sunday at Stade Canac. Zeke Wood was utilized as an opener and retired all six batters he faced across two frames, striking out two. Both teams were held scoreless for the first five innings. Tri-City broke the deadlock in the sixth. Abdiel Saldana walked Ryan Cash and allowed a single to Jaxon Hallmark. Javeyan Williams and Alec Olund collected back-to-back RBI singles to give the ValleyCats a 2-0 lead. Tri-City added some insurance in the seventh. Ian Walters walked, and Kyle Novak moved him to second with a single. Dylan Broderick went to first on a 5-4 fielder’s choice, and Novak advanced to third. Elvis Peralta doubled in a run, off Ryan Sandberg. Broderick came around on a wild pitch, and Peralta went to third. Cash drove in Broderick by reaching on a fielder’s choice, which gave the ValleyCats a 5-0 advantage. Québec avoided the shutout in the ninth. Jhon Vargas issued a walk to Kyle Crowl before Tommy Seidl picked up an RBI double to cut the deficit to 5-1. Vargas (3-0) induced two consecutive groundouts from Francisco Hernandez and Tyler Osik to seal the victory. He twirled seven innings of one-run ball, walking three, and striking out seven. Saldana (1-1) received the loss. He pitched 6.1 innings, yielding four runs on five hits, walking three, and striking out three. Tri-City starts a three-game set against the Ottawa Titans at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium on Tuesday, May 28. First pitch is scheduled for 6:30 p.m.",

        "content": "Muscat – The Environment Authority (EA) has achieved a significant milestone by successfully cultivating wild myrrh seeds in its nursery in Salalah, outside their original habitat. This accomplishment marks a rare feat, as the myrrh trees were propagated from seeds in a climate vastly different from their natural environment – a first for the sultanate of Oman. An EA official emphasised the importance of this achievement, highlighting its potential to open new avenues for preserving myrrh trees and bolstering their population in their native regions. Myrrh trees, belonging to the frankincense family, are characterised by their small, perennial and spiny nature, reaching heights up to 3m. They typically thrive in semi-desert environments or rain shadow areas in the Dhofar mountains, extending to the Najd region. The dwindling number of myrrh trees in Oman’s wild habitats prompted the EA to act. With fewer than 250 trees remaining in Oman, it conducted a comprehensive survey in 2023, revealing the species to be in a ‘very critical stage’. The EA advocates urgent reassessment of the species’ national classification in alignment with the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s guidelines. The EA stressed the need for joint efforts of all stakeholders and relevant authorities at regional and international levels to safeguard this threatened species. Myrrh tree resin has been historically utilised for various purposes such as perfumes, incense, and medicine. Similar to frankincense, myrrh resin is produced by trees of the Commiphora genus, distinct from the Boswellia trees that yield frankincense. A study conducted by the EA’s Office for Conservation of Environment in Dhofar identified the primary threats to myrrh trees, with overgrazing being the most significant challenge, followed by pests, drought, and unsustainable harvesting methods. In response to these threats, the EA established a dedicated garden for myrrh trees aimed at conserving ‘mother trees’ and setting up a nursery for myrrh seed and seedling production. The study assessed the age of myrrh trees, with the oldest estimated to be around 40 years.",

        "description": "Residents of Muscat have called for tougher measures after Muscat Municipality raised concerns over random parking of trucks in residential areas",
        "content": "Residents of Muscat have called for tougher measures after Muscat Municipality raised concerns over random parking of trucks and heavy equipment in many areas of the capital. A statement issued by Muscat Municipality highlighted the menace of random parking in residential and commercial areas of Muscat. ‘Muscat Municipality is making diligent efforts to address this issue to preserve the urban character of the city and maintain the beauty and safety of residential neighbourhoods for all residents,’ the statement read. The statement elicited a strong reaction from residents. Maimouna al Sulaimani said that the municipality should take legal action against truck drivers who park randomly in residential areas. “Unfortunately, some building owners allow these drivers to take on rent residential buildings, particularly in the area of Mawaleh Central Market for Fruits and Vegetables.” Maimouna added that while she supports efforts to combat this issue, it’s crucial to provide designated parking spaces for trucks in specific locations within each region before initiation of any legal measure. “I believe the municipality should establish designated parking areas for these trucks, away from the residential neighbourhoods.” Another Muscat resident Hammoud al Rubiei suggested that the concerned authorities should allocate a special area as a centre for trucks, with a small fee and protection. He proposed the old Mawaleh market area as an ideal location for this centre due to its excellent location and existing facilities such as offices, a prayer hall, housing and banking services. He noted that only some workshops are needed to complete the setup. Demanding punishment for whoever is responsible for illegal parking, resident Majdah al Shukairi informed that the residents of south Mawaleh, near Al Sahwa Park, suffer from this problem. She mentioned that these trucks distort the general view of the city and contribute to traffic congestion. The municipality called on citizens to report such violations through social networking sites or Muscat Municipality Call Center (1111).",

        "description": "Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5 000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future.",
        "content": "That figure is an increase from the 1 000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36 000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike.",

Those were some of the frank assessments of African leaders by the CIA, prepared for presidents ahead of meetings, a new research paper shows.

For decades, the CIA has analysed African heads of state ahead of their visits to the United States, profiling them through \"visit pieces\" for the use of government officials, according to Judd Devermont , a former White House Africa director.",

        "description": "The DA is filing an an application in the Electoral Court against President Cyril Ramaphosa, for violating the Electoral Code of Conduct and the EFF wants an investigating into the \"misuse\" of the state broadcaster, the SABC.",
        "content": "The DA is hauling President Cyril Ramaphosa before the Electoral Court, accusing him of abusing his office for political gain using a \"national address\" to the nation via the SABC. Opposition parties have lashed out at Ramaphosa over his address to the nation on Sunday night. According to the DA, Ramaphosa violated the Electoral Code of Conduct when he \"abused the highest office in the land for flagrant electioneering\". In his address, Ramaphosa detailed the progress made during the sixth administration. The EFF wants an investigation into the \"misuse\" of the SABC by Ramaphosa's office to avoid a repeat in the future. Ramaphosa also spoke on the significance of Wednesday's election and other security matters, but a large part of his speech was about his government's successes. These included the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, tackling corruption and gender-based violence. READ | 'We don't live in castles in the sky,' says Zille on DA's chances of winning 51% nationally in polls The signing into law of the National Health Insurance Bill was also one of Ramaphosa's major talking points. But DA leader John Steenhuisen is taking Ramaphosa to task on this issue by filing an application in the Electoral Court for violating the Electoral Code. In a statement, he said the Electoral Code of Conduct, as contained in the Electoral Act, states expressly that no person may abuse a position of power, privilege or influence, including parental, patriarchal, traditional or employment authority, to influence the conduct or outcome of an election. \"Ramaphosa's manipulation was cynical, calculated and designed to influence the outcome of the election by providing the ANC with unearned airtime [that was] not made available to any other party contesting the election. \"Not for the first time, Ramaphosa has chosen his corrupt political party over South Africa. As the president, he should have known better and must be held to account. This type of abuse cannot be allowed by anyone,\" Steenhuisen said. WRAP | COMMENT: Ramaphosa 'abuses' national address to cynically campaign for the ANC According to Steenhuisen, the \"desecration\" of the office Ramaphosa holds confirms that he is panicked. \"Because he has finally realised that the people are about to hold the ANC to account for the corruption, misrule and hardship they have inflicted upon the people of South Africa. The DA, therefore, calls on voters to turn out to the polling booths in their millions to help us bring an end to the ANC's impunity and abuse of our democracy for narrow personal and political gain,\" he said. Furthermore, Steenhuisen said Ramaphosa \"has clearly signaled that the ANC is prepared to undermine our constitutional democracy to try to cling to power\". \"This should serve as an urgent warning to all of our democratic institutions, including the IEC. If Ramaphosa is willing to abuse his office for narrow political gain even before the ANC has lost its majority, what else will he be willing to do to subvert the will of the people and cling to power after voters take away the ANC's majority on Wednesday? \"If voters needed any further confirmation that the hunger for power and the corruption of the ANC constitutes an urgent threat to the values upon which our constitutional democracy is based, Ramaphosa provided it last night,\" he said. Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told News24 the criticism is unfounded because Ramaphosa's address was a stately account of the work done during the course of the sixth administration. \"The president was, therefore, being accountable to the nation as we end the term of the 6th administration. Secondly, he was taking the responsibility of assuring South Africans that these elections are going to be free and fair and, more importantly, safe. That responsibility can only be discharged by a sitting head of state,\" Magwenya said. He also argued that in his address, Ramaphosa, did not mention the governing party, nor did he criticise other political parties. \"In fact, he commended all parties for the peaceful manner in which they have campaigned and thanked all parliamentarians for the work they've done over the concluding term. Lastly, the president paid tribute to all South Africans who worked together with government when the country was going through challenging times, like the Covid-19 pandemic, the floods in KZN and other parts of the country and during the 2021 riots,\" he said. According to Magwenya, the address was not about campaigning. \"The president, as he must, was being the president of all South Africans with the address,\" he said. Meanwhile, the EFF has also expressed its concern and condemned Ramaphosa for using the SABC for political gain. The party condemned the \"hijacking of the state broadcaster for partisan purposes\". \"It is clear that there is fear within the ANC ranks of an imminent loss and they are resorting to desperate measures to stay in power,\" the EFF said in a statement. \"The unscheduled address is a blatant misuse of presidential powers and state resources, aimed at furthering the interests of the ANC rather than serving the South African public.\"",

        "content": "Nigeria’s digital journey is accelerating; at the forefront of this unprecedented growth is the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and one of its key strengths lies in its collaborative method. Through collaboration with tech hubs, educational institutions, and industry stakeholders, the agency is laying the groundwork for a thriving digital economy. NITDA’s partnerships span across various sectors, and this multifaceted approach ensures a comprehensive strategy for digital literacy and innovation. Among the critical areas of focus are training programmes in artificial intelligence (AI), coding, cybersecurity, and basic digital literacy. These initiatives are not just about imparting knowledge; they are about equipping Nigerians with the skills necessary to thrive in a digital economy. The programmes are meant to engender a digital literate workforce, in line with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda. To equip citizens with the skills for the digital age, NITDA aims to achieve a remarkable target of 70% digital literacy by 2027. The agency is birthing a new generation of highly talented Nigerians. Tech hubs nationwide are buzzing with activity, where participants are immersed in learning experiences that cover the latest advancements in technology. Educational institutions are also critical, this NITDA is working with the Federal Ministry of Education to integrate these programmes into their curricula to produce graduates that are ready to meet the demands of the digital age. Beyond education and training, the agency, through regulations, co-creates policies that provide a conducive environment for tech companies, and ensure that innovation flourish while maintaining the security of digital infrastructure. One notable example is NITDA’s involvement in developing guidelines for AI and data protection, which are crucial as the world increasingly relies on data-driven decision-making. These regulations not only protect users but also provide a clear framework for companies to innovate confidently. This focus on collaboration extends beyond domestic partnerships. NITDA actively seeks partnerships with international stakeholders. A case in point was the alliance with the United States Consulate General, Lagos, to host the Global Tech Africa Summit. The event brought together African and international players in the tech space, fostering knowledge exchange and creating opportunities for cross-border collaboration. The agency has recognised the transformative power of skill-based training. This prompted it to deepen its strategic partnership with Cisco to harness these technologies for Nigeria’s development. This collaboration is not just a step forward; it is a leap toward a future where technology drives sustainable growth and innovation across multiple sectors. Pilot projects are being rolled out to demonstrate the practical applications of these technologies in real-world settings. NITDA has also partnered with TikTok to address some of the most pressing issues in the digital age. The cooperation promotes the responsible use of AI, and a secure online space. The importance of this cannot be overemphasised because social media is increasingly integral to daily life. NITDA aims to leverage the TikTok platform’s extensive reach and technological prowess to implement robust measures that safeguard users, particularly the younger demographic. Recently, NITDA partnered with GIZ (German Agency for International Cooperation) and Digital Transformation Center (DTC) to host a stakeholder event on the National Digital Literacy Framework (NDLF) in Lagos to address the digital divide and equip Nigerians with digital skills. An example is the joint effort on developing robust standards for digital literacy content to ensure learning materials are aligned with Nigeria’s National Digital Literacy Framework (NDLF). NITDA’s determination to foster innovation is evident in its establishment of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) – Office for Nigerian Digital Innovation (ONDI) and the National Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (NCAIR). These SPVs act as catalysts for collaboration within the tech ecosystem, allowing for the implementation of initiatives like the Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Support (TIES) Scheme and the iHatch Startup Incubation Programme. Speaking at a public outing, NITDA Director General, Kashifu Inuwa, stated: “Collaborating with stakeholders is fundamental to our mission. We can create an ecosystem that supports innovation and sustainable growth, so that Nigeria is not just a consumer of technology but a key player in the global tech arena. The goal is to create a sustainable digital ecosystem where everyone has the opportunity to participate and benefit. Our partnerships are crucial in bridging the skills gap and ensuring that Nigeria’s digital economy is inclusive and resilient.” As Nigeria stands on the cusp of a digital revolution, NITDA’s partnerships serve as a beacon of what is possible when government, industry, and academia come together with a shared vision. The journey to 70% digital literacy by 2027 is ambitious, but with the continued support and collaboration of all stakeholders, it is a goal well within reach. Through these efforts, Nigeria is not just preparing for the future, it is shaping it. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "A popular shopping hub in the nation's capital, Banex Plaza, has now been reopened after it was closed for a week due to clashes between soldiers and traders. According to PoliticsNigeria, the plaza resumed operations at 2:30 PM on Monday, May 27, marking the end of a tense period that had disrupted business activities. The closure was initiated after an incident involving personnel from the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police and traders at the plaza. The confrontation escalated into physical altercations involving passersby and security guards, leading authorities to temporarily shut down the facility to ensure public safety and order. According to reports, the reopening was agreed upon after successful resolutions between the traders involved in the altercations and military authorities. This agreement comes as a relief to many business owners and customers who frequent the bustling electronics and telecommunications market. The initial clash that prompted the closure occurred when four military police personnel retaliated against traders following a previous disagreement. The reopening signifies a return to normalcy and the restoration of business activities at one of Abuja’s major commercial centers.",

Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Mr Biden, joined by vice president Kamala Harris and defence secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Mr Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honouring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,” Mr Biden said, crediting the Pact Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right healthcare, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Mr Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Festus Keyamo, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, has described the controversial Nigeria Air unveiled by the Buhari-led administration as a fraud, adding that it remained suspended. Keyamo, who gave details about the project, noted that the ‘national carrier’ that was supposed to be an indigenous project and one that was supposed to spark hope for Nigerians, was flawed with a lot of secrecy and fraudulent activities. The Minister made the declaration on Nigeria Air while fielding questions from journalists during the second day of the Ministerial Sectorial update on Monday, May 27, in Abuja. According to him, Keyamo it was anti-Nigeria. Read also: Bayelsa tribunal upholds Gov Diri’s re-election He said: “It was never Air Nigeria. It was Ethiopian trying to flag our flag and not Air Nigeria. That is the truth; it was not Nigeria. “It only printed Air Nigeria. It was an Ethiopian airline trying to fly our flag. If it is so, why not allow our local people to fly our flag? Why bring a foreigner to fly our flag? “So nobody should deceive you that it is Air Nigeria. Air Nigeria must be indigenous, wholly Nigeria or must be for the full benefit of Nigerians. Not that 60 percent of the profit is given to another country. “How does that benefit us? It remains suspended. It remains so,” he said. Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "description": "NASA Langley researchers are heading to the Arctic Ocean to study the habitat's effect on climate worldwide.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Eliza Noe, The Virginian-Pilot, The Virginian-Pilot NASA Langley researchers are heading to the Arctic Ocean to study the habitat's effect on climate worldwide. The ARCSIX, or Arctic Radiation Cloud Aerosol Surface Interaction Experiment, airborne campaign will fly out of Pituffik Space Force Base in Greenland for seven weeks this summer to gather measurements of the sea ice, clouds , radiation and aerosols that are affecting the ice melt . \"The reason that we need this mission is because there are a lot of things that we don't know about how the Arctic climate system functions and operates,\" said Patrick Taylor, deputy mission science leader. \"There's a lot of uncertainty in our projections of how fast they warm. We know that it's going to warm fast, but it can go really fast. \"The idea of these observations is to understand how the sea ice is changing, so that we can use that data to improve our tests and hypotheses and improve our theories about how the sea ice is evolving. We can then put those ideas and our knowledge to improve our forecast models.\" Ice in the arctic has a pivotal role in cooling the Earth, and it's not every day that scientists are able to take detailed snapshots of the region. Taylor and Ewan Crosbie, platform scientists, said it's pivotal to learn about the Earth's warming climate now, and the data could be used to form strategies on how to reduce the effects of climate change. \"Having boots on the ground (and) people out in this region of the Arctic only happens once or twice every five years,\" Taylor said. \"It's not even that we get out there every year. We get these very periodic snapshots of what's happening there. We're going to have an unprecedented kind of dataset of it with all the different instruments.\" The mission is split into two. The group will go out to see how the ice is melting in late spring and early summer , and in July, a second part will collect data for the later parts of summer. Each flight will have two pilots, a flight scientist coordinating with researchers on the ground, a scientist for each of the three instruments collecting data and an extra seat for an additional scientist or operator. The aircraft is equipped with three components. The first are dropsondes, designed to be dropped from an aircraft at altitude and measure characteristics such as temperature, humidity and winds. Another is the AVIRIS, or Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer. AVIRIS is used as a very powerful camera, and will collect useful information about the sea ice clouds and aerosols. The third is HALO, or High Altitude Lidar Observatory. It uses a very short pulse of light to collect images, but where the AVIRIS takes images of what's happening horizontally, HALO collects data on what's happening vertically. \"When the ice starts to melt, we get liquid forming on the surface. We can see what that looks like (with the instruments), even though you couldn't see with the naked eye,\" Crosbie said. \"Also for clouds, an interesting science question that we'll go after is to try to understand the lifecycle of Arctic clouds. \"So understanding the distinction between clouds that contain predominantly liquid droplets versus ice particles is a critical piece to understanding the behavior of Arctic clouds, their lifecycle and the radiation impacts.\" Crosbie said this could be one of the last times to observe \"old ice,\" or ice that was able to survive the summer melt season and regrow during the polar night. He said the ice seen in the mission will be between 3–4 years old, and this could be one of the last chances to measure and collect data on it. \"We're really excited about the science,\" Taylor said. \"We don't get a dataset like this in this region of the Arctic—or the Arctic at all—very often, so really, some things we think we'll learn will probably surprise us. There's probably some things we're not expecting will pop out of the data.\" Provided byThe Virginian-Pilot",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Africa’s Travel Indaba was held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre. Hundreds of delegates were in Durban as part of the three-day trade show, Africa’s Travel Indaba is an iconic African leisure trade show owned by South African Tourism, with the specific objective of creating market access for the country’s vast array of African leisure tourism products. Dube-Ncube said the trade show provides the ideal platform for African tourism exhibitors to showcase their offerings to international and local buyers, destination marketing companies and leisure tourism services partners. As the tourism industry shows green shoots globally, she said one of the key sub-sectors the province wants to focus on is Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events (MICE). MICE make up a big part of global business travel since every industry has regular events of some kind. The main goal is always to bring professionals together, foster connections, promote new ideas and push growth. “As a province, we will be at the forefront of ensuring that KwaZulu-Natal gets the lion’s share of the tourism market. As we all know, one of the biggest trends in the tourism environment is the blending of leisure tourism and business, known as ‘Bleisure Travel’ [blending of business and leisure travel]. “We would like to thank all of you for your continued support of Africa’s Travel Indaba. Indeed, Africa has limitless possibilities, and we must seize the opportunity to ensure that Africa’s time is now,” Dube-Ncube said. The Premier noted that this year’s Africa’s Travel Indaba takes place at a time when South Africa is celebrating 30 years since the dawn of democracy, which ushered in a new era and assured our standing in the family of other nations.",

The group during the quarter posted a net income of N208.2 billion, which represents a 316% increase from the N50.1 billion net income posted in Q1 2023. The growth in profit was driven by a 153% year on year growth in interest income to N455 billion during the quarter from N180 billion recorded in Q1 2023. Related Stories Economic challenges slash Nigeria’s small-scale industrialists by nearly half in two years How to mine Hamster Combat coins and earn money from it The group posted an FX revaluation loss of N108.2 billion during the quarter as it posted an FX trading income of N13.4 billion, resulting in an FX loss of N94.8 billion. Key Highlights (Q1 2024 vs Q1 2023) The group posted a net interest income of N228.7 billion during the quarter, reflecting a 104% year-on-year growth from the N111.8 billion posted in Q1 2023. Impairment charges hit N42.9 billion, marking a 154% YoY growth from the N16.9 billion impairment provisions of Q1 2023. Net interest income after impairment charges hit N185.7 billion, a 96% YoY growth from N95 billion posted in Q1 2023. Net fee and commission income hit N54 billion, up by 53% YoY from N35.3 billion in Q1 2023. The group’s profit before tax hit N238.5 billion, representing 325% YoY growth from Q1 2023’s N56.1 billion. Profit after tax hit N208.2 billion, representing 316% YoY growth from N50.1 billion posted in Q1 2023. The group’s total assets appreciated by 27% to N21.6 trillion during the quarter, from N16.9 trillion as of FYE 2023. Customer deposits significantly contributed to the group’s asset growth, with customers’ deposits increasing by 24% during the quarter, rising from N10.7 trillion at the end of 2023 to N13.3 trillion. The group’s loan portfolio also grew by 41% during the quarter, as the total loans and advances to customers and banks hit N11.9 trillion, up from N8.4 trillion as of FYE 2023. As the bank’s loan portfolio expanded, rising interest rates—prompted by two hikes in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) during the quarter—resulted in the bank achieving its largest ever interest income for a single quarter. The group’s shareholders’ equity increased by 10% during the quarter to N1.92 trillion, from N1.75 trillion as of FYE 2023. During the quarter, the group’s retained earnings hit N794.4 billion, compared to N589 billion as of 2023 year-end. Despite the increase in shareholders’ funds, it does not affect the group’s recapitalization efforts. FBN Holdings still needs to raise N269.4 billion in new share capital to meet the Central Bank of Nigeria’s N500 billion minimum capital requirement for an international banking license. At the end of trading on May 27, 2024, FBNH’s share price closed at N21.10, reflecting a 3.18% improvement as investors display confidence in the bank’s shares.",

        "content": "THE leadership of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has condemned the recent increase in the killing of students in some of tertiary institutions in the country. NANS President, Comrade Lucky Emonefe, in a statement on Monday in Abuja, called on the Federal Government and security agencies to ensure that nation’s campuses are not only safe for teaching and learning, urgent action must also be taken to address the plight of students. One of the issues affecting students, he noted is the sexual harassment of students by lecturers. Emonefe noted a distressing incident of the death of Miss Favour Ugwuka, a final year student of Ebonyi State University, who reportedly committed suicide on Wednesday, 22nd May, because of pressure from a lecturer who repeatedly failed her in his course. “While we strongly believe that suicide is not a solution to any problem, we condemn the actions of the lecturer that led to the death of Miss Favour.

He said the unfortunate murder of James Michael Anajuwe and Musa Hussein, both students of Confluence University of Science and Technology (CUSTECH) Lokoja, Kogi state, were tragic events that pose a threat to education. The NANS President said: “We are concerned that incidents like these continue to instill fear in students who are eager to pursue their studies for the sole purpose of developing society. “We also demand justice for the soul of a student from Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, identified as Alex, who was unjustly killed on Saturday, May 25th by his fellow students over an allegation of phone theft. “It is crucial for authorities to fulfill their constitutional duty of ensuring the safety and security of students, both on and off campus. The recent incidents have exposed significant security gaps that must be addressed urgently. “NANS, under our leadership, will continue to advocate for justice for these innocent students who have untimely lost their lives,” he stated.

The Kuwaiti Para team had remarkable success, securing two gold medals and one silver medal at the championship. Faisal Al-Rajhi clinched the gold medal in the 5,000-meter wheelchair race, while Faisal Sorour won the silver medal in the shot put competition. These victories ensured both athletes’ participation in the Paris Paralympic Games 2024. World champion Faisal Sorour expressed his joy over his significant achievement in one of the most prestigious global athletics championships. He dedicated his silver medal to His Highness the Amir Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the government, and the people of Kuwait. Sorour also praised the support from the Board of Directors of the Disabled Club, led by Shafi Al-Hajri, for their efforts in overcoming all obstacles to achieve optimal physical and technical readiness. “Kuwait’s disabled athletes continue to achieve outstanding international results season after season, thanks to the excellent teamwork and dedication of the club’s management. Their constant efforts to develop all sports and provide comprehensive support to players are commendable. We hope to continue this success at the Paralympic Games in Paris 2024,” said Sorour.

        "content": "Spain's Rafael Nadal looks dejected after losing his first round match against Germany's Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros today in the French Open. Photo: Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 today in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favourite tournament. It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4. The match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout. Nadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after today's defeat. His three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.",

        "content": "RAFAEL NADAL’S record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end on Monday when the 14-time champion slumped to a demoralising first round defeat against Alexander Zverev. Nadal, who turns 38 on 3 June, went down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to world number four Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut. It was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport. “I don’t know if this is the last time I will be here, I am not 100% sure but if it is then I wanted to enjoy it,” said Nadal. “The feelings today are difficult to describe in words.” Plagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris. However, he insisted on the eve of the tournament that he was “100% keeping the door open” on his future in a sport which has brought him 22 Grand Slam titles. In a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances. He was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent. Chants of “Rafa, Rafa” had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule. They subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game. Nadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net. It was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros. Nadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn’t back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set. A tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally. Nadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set. However, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention. The effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.",

        "content": "Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished—including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family—and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. — Reuters",

        "description": "It may come as a surprise to many that pain or weakness in the shoulder can be a sign of lung cancer. This may happen if a lung tumour exerts pressure on a nearby nerve that passes through the shoulders, or if lung cancer spreads to the bones in the shoulder or surrounding regions, according to Moffitt Cancer Center, a Florida-based non-profit cancer research centre.Shoulder pain is more likely to indicate lung cancer if it occurs while resting and worsens at night.

Know About Advanced Treatment Options And New ResearchShoulder pain as a result of pancoast tumoursA person suffering from pancoast tumour (superior sulcus tumour), a rare type of lung cancer that starts in the rounded upper section of the lung and spreads to surrounding areas of the body, may experience shoulder pain. Shoulder pain is the most common symptom of pancoast tumours. The pain may travel down the arm from the shoulder or up the head and neck, according to Cancer Research UK.The longer lung cancer goes undiagnosed, the more excruciating shoulder pain, if any, becomes. “Although shoulder pain is not commonly linked with lung cancer, there are several potential reasons why someone with lung cancer might experience it. These include pleuritic pain, pancoast tumours, metastasis, and referred pain. Pleuritic pain refers to inflammation of the lining around lungs, which is called pleura. Pancoast tumours can infiltrate nearby nerves and cause shoulder and arm discomfort. If lung cancer metastasises, it can spread to bones of the shoulder joint, resulting in pain in those regions. Pressure exerted by the lung cancer on nerves passing through the shoulders is referred to as referred pain,” Dr Rajesh Kumar Verma, Director and HOD, Orthopaedics, Trauma and Spine Surgery, Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram, told ABP Live.He also said that such associations are not exclusive to lung cancer and can occur as a result of other conditions too. “Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer, though lung cancer can also occur in people who have never smoked. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes you've smoked. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing lung cancer. Lung cancer typically does not cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages. Signs and symptoms of lung cancer typically occur when the disease is advanced,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, Consultant, Surgical Oncology, Manipal Hospital Gurugram.This means that shoulder pain may start occurring once lung cancer has reached an advanced stage.One must not immediately correlate shoulder pain with lung cancer, but may take it as a sign to be aware and get themselves checked if they experience other symptoms of lung cancer too.ALSO READ | What Is The Future Of Birth Control?

        "description": "B.C. Premier David Eby says issues around affordability ‘serious and on-going’ in commenting on report",
        "content": "The head of the association representing B.C. food banks said he hoped the province would have received a better grade from a report tracking poverty. Food Banks Canada’s 2024 Poverty Report Card gives B.C. a D-plus. “I would say that the grade itself is very concerning as it was last year and we were optimistic that we would see B.C. improving on that,” Dan Huang-Taylor, executive director of Food Banks BC, said.“It (the final grade) was disappointed but also unexpected because this is what we are seeing at the of , more people needing services, which only tells that the situation of many British Columbians has gotten worse.” The provincial poverty rate of 11.6 per cent is “substantially higher” than the national average of 9.9 per cent, according to the report. More British Columbians are also experiencing some form of food insecurity in the face of rising costs for necessities like housing coupled with inadequate assistance rates. Huang-Taylor said B.C.’s poverty rates partly reflect economic factors completely out of its control. “But we are also certainly looking at government policies that are currently inadequate to meet the needs of people, particularly those who are most impacted by poverty — people on fixed incomes, racialized communities and Indigenous peoples.” Huang-Taylor said solutions must involve all societal partners: all levels of government; non-profits and corporations, adding that his organization looks forward to the upcoming release of B.C. poverty reduction strategy. “We are encouraged by what’s happening in B.C. with housing,” Huang-Taylor said, adding more needs to be done to adequately house hundreds of thousands of people. The Poverty Report Canada gives B.C. a B for government efforts to address some poverty issues, especially when it comes to housing. “(B.C.) has developed an ambitious and aggressive housing plan that is widely regarded as among the best in Canada,” it says. Speaking at a housing event Thursday (May 24) in Metro Vancouver, Premier David Eby acknowledged the report. “The issues facing many British Columbians around affordability are serious and on-going,” he said. “Today’s announcement is just one example of how we are responding to one of the biggest drivers of affordability for people, which is the cost of housing,” he said. Eby pointed to many of the factors which Huang-Taylor later identified outside of B.C.’s control, including Bank of Canada interest rates. Eby also pointed to other initiatives, including the expansion of the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters program and the Rental Assistance Program; the creation of breakfast programs for school children; and the creation of subsidized, in some cases, free child care spaces. Eby also pointed to the one-time B.C. Hydro rebate of $100 part of this year’s budget and the just announced ICBC rebate of $110 coupled with a freeze on auto insurance rates as steps to make life more affordable. “We know got a lot of work to do to respond to this,” he said. When asked which specific policies British Columbians might expect to hear about when it comes to reducing poverty rates during the upcoming election campaign, Eby questioned the commitment of B.C. United and Conservative Party of B.C. Under the B.C. NDP, B.C. now has the highest minimum wage, while maintaining top credit rating and one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios, Eby added. Since coming to power, the B.C.

Food Banks Canada’s 2024 Poverty Report Card gives B.C. a D-plus. “I would say that the grade itself is very concerning as it was last year and we were optimistic that we would see B.C. improving on that,” Dan Huang-Taylor, executive director of Food Banks BC, said.“It (the final grade) was disappointed but also unexpected because this is what we are seeing at the front lines of food banks , more people needing services, which only tells that the situation of many British Columbians has gotten worse.” The provincial poverty rate of 11.6 per cent is “substantially higher” than the national average of 9.9 per cent, according to the report. More British Columbians are also experiencing some form of food insecurity in the face of rising costs for necessities like housing coupled with inadequate assistance rates. Huang-Taylor said B.C.’s poverty rates partly reflect economic factors completely out of its control. “But we are also certainly looking at government policies that are currently inadequate to meet the needs of people, particularly those who are most impacted by poverty — people on fixed incomes, racialized communities and Indigenous peoples.” Huang-Taylor said solutions must involve all societal partners: all levels of government; non-profits and corporations, adding that his organization looks forward to the upcoming release of B.C. poverty reduction strategy. RELATED: Food bank report fails B.C. on several poverty tests, but commends efforts “We are encouraged by what’s happening in B.C. with housing,” Huang-Taylor said, adding more needs to be done to adequately house hundreds of thousands of people. The Poverty Report Canada gives B.C. a B for government efforts to address some poverty issues, especially when it comes to housing. “(B.C.) has developed an ambitious and aggressive housing plan that is widely regarded as among the best in Canada,” it says. Speaking at a housing event Thursday (May 24) in Metro Vancouver, Premier David Eby acknowledged the report. “The issues facing many British Columbians around affordability are serious and on-going,” he said. “Today’s announcement is just one example of how we are responding to one of the biggest drivers of affordability for people, which is the cost of housing,” he said. Eby pointed to many of the factors which Huang-Taylor later identified outside of B.C.’s control, including Bank of Canada interest rates. RELATED: B.C. offering one-time rental benefit for some low-income families, seniors RELATED: $214M coming to B.C. school districts to create, expand food programs RELATED: $110-rebate coming to B.C. drivers by end of July: ICBC CEO Eby also pointed to other initiatives, including the expansion of the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters program and the Rental Assistance Program; the creation of breakfast programs for school children; and the creation of subsidized, in some cases, free child care spaces. Eby also pointed to the one-time B.C. Hydro rebate of $100 part of this year’s budget and the just announced ICBC rebate of $110 coupled with a freeze on auto insurance rates as steps to make life more affordable. “We know got a lot of work to do to respond to this,” he said.

The statement reads in part: “Investigations by the Rivers State Police Command, following arrests for attempted burglary, have revealed a wide range of criminal activities. “On March 4, 2024, at approximately 11 pm, the Rivers State Police Command received a distress call about burglars who were attempting to vandalise warehouses in Elimgbu owned by Mr. Emmanuel Nwangwu and Mrs. Ndifreke Ekanem. The police promptly mobilised to the scene and arrested five suspects who had been severely beaten by a mob. “The wounded suspects were taken to the police hospital as investigations began. During the investigation, it was discovered that one of the suspects, West Isaac (08NA/61/2653), was a corporal in the Nigerian Army serving in Delta State. “Another suspect, Jabila Kammangar, also known as ‘Kaka,’ was an officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps serving in Kabba, Kogi State. They confessed to abandoning their posts to engage in criminal activities in Rivers State due to its lucrativeness. “Corporal West, a 36-year-old father of four from Buguma, Rivers State, joined the Army in 2008 and was assigned to the 3rd Battalion in Warri. He left his base on a sick pass and failed to return even after it expired, remaining absent for over a month until his arrest. “West disclosed to the police that he met Kaka while serving in the Army’s Anti-Bunkering Unit, and together, they engaged in several illegal activities. He further revealed that he came to Port Harcourt after receiving a call from Kaka about raiding warehouses, which led to their capture. “Further investigations revealed that they were part of a larger criminal ring specialising in armed robbery, hijacking, and goods diversion. Corporal West disclosed to the police that he and other Army personnel had been key players in the group. Besides ransacking warehouses, they had a network of informants who provided information about the schedules of goods-bearing trailers. “They would then dress in full military gear, lay in wait for the trailers, and accost them with a white Hilux van as they approached. They would intimidate the drivers, assault them, and hand their keys to designated drivers, who would then divert the trailers to waiting receivers. “Based on his confessional statement, the police were able to track down and arrest Lance Corporal Abdul Musa (13NA/70/10545), Lance Corporal Mgbe Jeoffrey (16NA/75/6896), and Corporal Innocent Okwoli (12NA/68/6552), all personnel of the Nigerian Army. “Additionally, eight civilian collaborators in the syndicate were arrested: Olisa Emeka, George Obilor, Sampson Wilson, Alfred Abeke, Barry John, Auwalu Aliyu, Uchenna Nwali, and Alhaji Sofinu Haruna. “The group’s key coordinator was Corporal Innocent Okwoli, a native of Otakpo in Benue State and a soldier stationed at Intels in Onne. Okwoli stated that he started leading hijacking operations after being introduced to the activity by an individual named Abbas and two unnamed Naval officers. Following a successful operation, he formed his team.” Police listed their numerous crimes to include hijacking of a trailer loaded with fertiliser valued at N25 million belonging to Alhaji Sadiq Adams on February 17, 2024. “On March 4, 2024, the group attempted to burgle warehouses owned by Emmanuel Nwagwu and Ndifreke Ekanem. “In February 2024, a 40-foot container filled with imported clothing from China was hijacked and diverted. “In February 2024, a trailer carrying POP cement was hijacked and diverted. The police have since recovered the stolen POP cement and are working to retrieve a trailer load of fertiliser from its receiver. Additionally, a white Toyota Hilux used in the gang’s operations has been recovered from the NSCDC officer. Three of the affected soldiers have been dismissed by the Nigerian Army after being handed over by the police.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Rivers State, Olatunji Disu, has expressed his profound appreciation for the swift and decisive cooperation of the military authorities. Disu lauded their prompt actions in addressing the involved officers’ misconduct and subsequent handover to the police for prosecution. The Police Commissioner, who emphasised that this collaborative effort underscores a strong commitment to upholding justice and maintaining public trust in law enforcement institutions, praised the officers involved in the arrest and urged them to remain vigilant.",

        "description": "A report by UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran now has 142.1kg of uranium enriched up to 60 per cent – an increase of 20.6kg since the last report in February.",
        "content": "Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said on Monday. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3kg (13,671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8kg (1,489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “Further public statements made in Iran during this reporting period regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran’s nuclear doctrine only increase concerns about the correctness and completeness of Iran’s safeguards declarations,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in the report. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency’s September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear programme, but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran”. In the report, the IAEA said Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’”. 02:07 Iranian president dies in helicopter crash, raising questions about who will be next ruler Iran has maintained its nuclear programme is peaceful, but Grossi has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic programme. The IAEA’s acknowledgement shows the challenges its inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Middle East over the continuing Israel-Gaza war. Recent tit-for-tat missile strikes between Israel and Iran have added urgency to the IAEA’s years-long search to uncover the scope of Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. While the IAEA carries out daily inspections of declared atomic facilities, suspicions linger over whether Iranian engineers could be concealing work used for military purposes. Tehran has blocked the agency’s investigation into uranium detected at undeclared locations. While Iran insists it is not looking to produce nuclear weapons, international mistrust prompted a negotiated compromise in 2015 that restricted the country’s atomic activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Recent statements by current and former Iranian officials that the country could revisit its nuclear doctrine – and potentially build a weapon – prompted Grossi to renew attempts at diplomacy through his visit earlier this month. The United States issued an ultimatum to Iran at the IAEA’s last meeting: cooperate or face censure, which could lead to a referral to the UN Security Council and the renewal of sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Some European countries already wanted to dial up the pressure in March. The IAEA’s board convenes again on June 3 in Vienna, Austria.",

        "content": "Mike Tyson is \"doing great\" following a reported health scare the former heavyweight champion had on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday. According to a report by , Tyson -- who is scheduled to face Jake Paul in a boxing match on July 20 -- had a medical issue that required paramedics to board the plane upon landing and assist. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" Tyson's representatives said in a statement. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" There were rumors that the flight was delayed because of Tyson's medical issue, but his representatives debunked that. \"It's false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,\" the rep stated. \"This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" Tyson, 57, is slated to return to the boxing ring for his first professional fight in nearly two decades when he faces Paul, 27, in a blockbuster showdown at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix. By the time the two combatants step into the ring for their heavyweight clash, Tyson will have celebrated his 58th birthday and be 31 years older than Paul. The fight will be contested over eight 2-minute rounds with each fighter using 14-ounce gloves.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal, the 14-time French Open champ, was eliminated in the first round of the Grand Slam tournament for the first time in his career, losing to Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "PARIS -- lost in the first round of the French Open to 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that . And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the \"incredible the amount of energy\" it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. \"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\" It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of \"Ra-fa!\" from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 US Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against in 2010 and against in 2015 and 2021. \"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It's Rafa's moment.\"",

The Mavericks outworked, outhustled, and out-strategized the Timberwolves who were looking for an answer to their superb attack. Led by their dynamic backcourt duo Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, the Mavericks sliced up the Wolves’ defense with their scoring and passing in the pick-and-roll. The Timberwolves’ no.1 defense in the regular season could not do anything with Doncic and Irving throwing up lob after lob while also scoring at will. Minnesota star guard Anthony Edwards was better in Game 3 however co-star Karl-Anthony Towns struggled once again vs the physical and scrappy defense by the Mavs against him. Dallas will try to close it out and sweep Minnesota in Game 4 on Tuesday.

        "content": "The gubernatorial of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Kogi state, Alhaji Murtala Yakubu Ajaka has said his loss at the tribunal to Governor Usman Ododo is just a temporary setback as he is set to pursue the case to the highest court. Ajaka, who was reacting to the verdict of the Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, which dismissed his petition against Governor Ododo said “A long walk to freedom has just begun” According to him “Today, I come before you with a heavy heart, but also with a fire of optimism burning in my soul. We have just received the news that our election petition has been unsuccessful at the tribunal. “It is a setback, a moment of disappointment, and it is natural for us to feel disheartened. But let me tell you this, my fellow Kogites, this is not the end of our journey. This is just a chapter in our fight for justice, truth, the rights of our people and freedom”. Ajaka affirmed that “Despite the outcome at the tribunal, I am proud to say that we had a team of brilliant lawyers who did an outstanding job in proving the case of overvoting during the election. “Their dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to upholding the principles of democracy have left an indelible mark on our case as we push further”. The SDP candidate disclosed that “Throughout the entire process, our lawyers exhibited the highest level of professionalism and tenacity. They meticulously gathered evidence, scrutinized data, and presented a compelling case to the tribunal, but the tribunal despite agreeing to over-voting struck our case out. According to him,”These lawyers did not fail us. We are very optimistic that they will be vindicated by the end of the petition. I can assure you that this judgment will not stand the test of time. “Yes, we may have lost the battle at the tribunal, but the war is far from over. Our stolen mandate, our voice, our power, will not be silenced. We will rise from the ashes of this defeat, stronger and more determined than ever before. “Today, we must encourage each other to be hopeful, to be relentless in our pursuit of justice, and to keep our faith unwavering”. According to him, “It is in times like these that our resilience is tested. We must remember why we embarked on this political journey in the first place. Our dreams, our hopes for a better future for Kogi, for a fairer society, for the upliftment of the marginalized, for the protection of our people, and the progress of our state – these dreams are not dependent on a single election outcome. “We must remind ourselves that our fight is not just about winning an election; it is about standing up for what is right, for what is just, and for what we believe in. “Our opponents may have won this first round, the battle, but they have not won the war. We will take this fight to the very end, where justice will prevail. We will reclaim our stolen mandate and restore the faith of our people in the democratic process. “Let us not lose sight of the bigger picture. We have been given an opportunity, a platform to make a difference. Losing at the tribunal does not make us losers; it makes us fighters, warriors who will not back down in the face of adversity. “The violence, aggression and intimidation we faced during the election did not stop us. We will not be deterred by temporary setbacks, because our spirit is unbreakable. “I call upon every one of you, my fellow Kogites to stay united, to stand strong, and to continue the fight. Our journey may be long and challenging, but together, we can overcome any obstacles that come our way. Let us not lose hope, let us not lose faith, and let us not lose sight of the ultimate goal. “Remember, my fellow Kogites, that history is filled with stories of triumph against all odds. We are the authors of our destiny, and we have the power to shape the future. Let our determination be our guiding light, and let our relentless pursuit of justice be the fuel that propels us forward. “In conclusion, I want to remind you all that we are not alone in this fight. The people who believe in us, who have placed their trust in us, are counting on us to fulfil our promise. Let us not disappoint them. Let us rise above this setback, and together, let us reclaim our stolen mandate”. Also read: BREAKING: Tribunal affirms Ododo as Kogi gov, dismisses Ajaka’s petition",

        "content": "Baldur’s Gate 3 players can’t believe others avoid Bernard, a Construct NPC who guards the Underdark’s Arcane Tower. Players who will meet Bernard on the top floor. The Construct guardian will only attack under certain circumstances, but, due to the difficulty of the fight, many players have decided to skip the encounter completely. Redditor counts as one such Baldur’s Gate 3 player, claiming Bernard’s is the only battle they avoided during their Honour Mode run. The user explained in part, “Just fought him in Tactician for the first time, and YIKES am I glad I skipped him in Honor; he just about took me apart.” While several people in the comments agreed that leaving Bernard alone on harder difficulties is a smart choice, many others questioned the need to fight him at all. It’s possible to encounter the Construct and walk away from him on a friendly note; , too. One popular comment under the post notes, “...you don’t even have to fight him when you meet him. Just read some of the books. He can even hug you.” Someone who’s played Baldur’s Gate 3 four times added, “Me just sitting here like ‘wait, people fight Bernard?'” To make nice with Bernard, players must find command phrases written on documents scattered around Arcane Tower. Answering each of his questions with the correct answer will turn him passive, thus avoiding a fight. However, those who do face off against Bernard will have to best him in regular combat. One person in the Reddit thread suggested planting Sussur Flowers near the smaller robots to shut them down. From there, it’s a matter of drawing Bernard to the building’s edge, so Wyll can shoot him with an that knocks him off the ledge.",

Attendees will work to uncover the secrets of the mighty bald eagle. From their colossal nests to their incredible fishing talents, get ready for an encounter with these awe-inspiring birds. Participants will learn more about these special raptors by playing a fun trivia game and then take a short walk to see the park's bald eagle nest up close. Attendees should meet at the Amphitheater behind the Visitor Center. Fantastic Frogs: Hop Into the Night. Why are frogs so fantastic? Come find out what the fuss is all about and learn what makes these amphibians so special.

        "description": "Dumisani Dlamini has shared his belief that his daughter, US singer Doja Cat will 'come home' to South Africa...",
        "content": "A clip of Dumisani Dlamini talking about his daughter Doja Cat has re-emerged amid her latest rant, in which she calls him a “deadbeat dad.” The US singer was born in 1995 to the South African actor and muso and his then-partner, Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. Dumisani – who also fathered a son, Doja’s brother Raman Dalithando – left the US to return home. Doja has yet to visit South Africa. It’s unclear if she has ever met Dumisani. DUMISANI DLAMINI ON DOJA CAT: ‘ONE DAY SHE’LL COME HOME’ On social media, Doja Cat and Dumisani Dlamini became trending topics because of her choice of words regarding her South African father. One tweep reposted a clip of Dumisani talking about his daughter in an old interview on Mzansi Magic. Speaking of his Grammy-winning child, he said: “She’s my daughter. It just blew up now as if there is something wrong. People are changing stories.” He added, “We don’t want to dwell [on the past]. One day, she will come home, and everyone will see her.” Dumisani insisted he was proud of Doja “even before she became a superstar”. Speaking to Tshisalive, Dumisani claimed that he planned to bring his US family back to South Africa – a move that never materialized. Dumisani has yet to address Doja Cat’s latest rant WHAT DID DOJA CAT SAY ABOUT HER DAD? On Monday, 27 May, Doja Cat launched a foul-mouth social media rant aimed at her father, Dumisani Dlamini. In it, she called him out for “abandoning” his family and being a “b*tch”. One follower – likely a South African – was not impressed with Doja’s words, commenting: “You are messing with the wrong one. Zulus don’t play...your ancestors will humble you”. Doja Cat clapped back: “Go give the deadbeat a kiss on the lips for me.” She added: “[Dumisani] gave me a lazy eye and dipped.” Under a post on Dumisani’s Instagram account, Doja Cat commented: “F**k you”. In a 2019 interview with Leah Henry and DJ Quicksilva, Doja opened up about not knowing her father. She said: “I have never [met him], and he’s on Instagram. And he comments on my pictures sometimes. He’s an incredible dancer and great actor, but yeah, I don’t know him very well”. ‘SHE’LL REGRET WHAT SHE’S DOING’ Meanwhile, several South Africans are calling out Doja Cat for disrespecting not only her father but also her African roots. @theHirohito : “Can we all agree that in African culture, swearing at your parents publicly is an equivalent to cursing yourself, like Doja Cat is doing there on IG? @Priddyzaddy: “She’s playing with fire this one.” @__ThapeloM : “She’ll regret what she’s doing.”",

The company said on its website Sunday that the Series B funding round will be used to take xAI’s first products to market and speed up research. xAI said it has made “significant strides” during the past year in developing the technology, which will continue in the coming months. Investors in the latest round include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity Management & Research, Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and Kingdom Holding. Musk wrote on the social media site X that before the investment, xAI had a valuation of $18 billion. The funding should help Musk’s company compete in a race to develop artificial intelligence against Microsoft and Open AI, which created Chat GPT. Musk announced formation of the company in July of last year and released its artificial intelligence chatbot called Grok in November. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources (MAFWR) has initiated a programme for rural women in the wilayat of Ibri, Dhahirah governorate, to help them attain self-sufficiency through poultry farming. An official from MAFWR referred to a recent workshop titled ‘Poultry Raising and Chick Production’, which had been designed to uplift and market the agricultural products of rural women in Ibri. The workshop provided participants with critical insights into hatching processes and their significance in poultry farming, under the guidance of Yasmine al Majarifi, an animal production specialist. Yasmine explained the intricacies of artificial hatching, including the use of various hatching machines and maintenance of optimal conditions for artificial hatching. Participants also discussed sanitary practices for handling eggs and shared experiences to enhance their understanding and skills in poultry management. Under the initiative, essential tools and equipment such as refrigerators, hatching devices and packaging machines were distributed to 32 beneficiaries in February this year, empowering them to effectively manage and expand their agricultural projects. The Directorate General of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources in North Batinah governorate signed an agreement on last week with Oman Flour Mills to support livestock breeders in the wilayat of Liwa. Abdullah bin Mohammed al Hadabi, Director General of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources in North Batinah, explained that this agreement comes within the framework of supporting livestock projects in the governorate, focusing on breeders from ‘productive’ families in order to enhance the success of their projects. The agreement paves the way for a livestock products exhibition with 12 stalls dedicated to food safety and quality, veterinary clinics and laboratories, rural women’s products and feed company products.",

Addressing election rallies in Patkura and Kakatpur, the senior BJP leader asked, “One ‘T’ means teamwork. Is there any teamwork in Odisha? The elected MLAs, MPs and ministers don’t have any power to exercise. Here only a team exists...that is in between Pandian and his wife and only one T, which stands for Tamil Nadu.” Neither the State Cabinet nor any officer has the power in Odisha. Only two persons (Pandian and his wife) have all the powers, Himanta alleged. He blamed the BJD government for the rising unemployment in Odisha. “Today, the youth of Odisha are migrating to other States due to unemployment. On the other hand, one lakh government posts are lying vacant in the State and the Odia youth are not being employed in local industries”, he said.",

They announced Saturday night that Martin was identified as a suspect in the case and taken into custody. The county’s jail website didn’t list an attorney for Martin as of Sunday. The wildfire was reported around 2 p.m. Saturday in the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge, which was established in 1941 to protect 30 miles (48 kilometers) of mostly wetland habitat along the Lower Colorado River. Authorities said the blaze was 20% contained after burning nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) of vegetation along the Arizona side of the Colorado River in Yuma County. Multiple agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and federal Bureau of Land Management, responded to the scene to assist firefighting crews Saturday. The Associated Press",

        "description": "Conner defeated Beechwood 2-0 in the 9th Region baseball tournament, with Aaron Wichmann pitching a complete game, three-hit shutout, and Brady Bushman hitting a home run in the top of the sixth inning.The post 9th Region baseball tournament quarterfinals roundup: Conner ends Beechwood’s run appeared first on LINK nky.",
        "content": "The 9th Region baseball tournament got underway on Monday with all four quarterfinal games played at Thomas More Stadium in Florence. The four winners move on to Wednesday’s semifinals at Thomas More Stadium, with those games set to be played at 5 and 7:30 p.m. Here’s how Monday’s action went down: Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) CONNER 2, BEECHWOOD 0 The Cougars put an end to Beechwood’s four-year reign on the region, denying the Tigers a chance at a fifth straight region title. Conner rode Aaron Wichmann to victory, the senior hurler pitching a complete game, three-hit shutout as he struck out eight and walked four in 99 pitches. Wichmann got 10 outs via a fly ball and kept the Tigers hitters off-balance for the majority as Beechwood had runners in scoring position only twice all game. “My breaking stuff I got over, they threw their hands at it and I get outs,” Wichmann said. “Just being efficient early in the count. The fastball was working pretty well and blew it by them and got ahead early in the counts.” Brady Bushman’s home run in the top of the sixth inning broke the scoreless tie, taking a 1-0 pitch just over the right center field wall. Bushman had struck out in his prior two at-bats, the home run the first of his varsity career. “I was sitting fastball the whole time,” Bushman said. “The prior at-bat I watched a fastball go right down the middle and I was mad after that. So after that one fastball I was sitting on the whole time, I decided to turn on it and it went pretty far and felt good off the bat.” Wichmann helped his own cause in the same inning, his sacrifice fly to left scoring Rex Richter as the Cougars manufactured the insurance run with Richter drawing a walk, stealing second, advancing to third on a groundout and scoring on Wichmann’s fly ball to left. “You could feel the tension as the innings went on,” Cougars coach Mike Hart said. “It was like who was going to flinch first. Aaron has been our guy and he loves that role. I like to call him our bulldog and he loves that role of getting the ball, putting the team on our shoulders and let’s go.” Conner had struggled leading up to this one, losing 15 of their last 18, but eight of those losses came by three runs or less. “We’ve prepared for this. The schedule we played, all the close games we’ve played and we’ve played some really good teams down the stretch,” Hart said. “We may not have come out on top in those games, but it made us better and built some confidence in knowing we could play some of the top teams in the state. It was time for us to breakthrough on one and it was a great time to do it.” Chase Flaherty was just as good on the bump in defeat for the Tigers, pitching a complete-game two-hitter as he struck out nine and walked four on 103 pitches. “Chase had a great year for us. This was his first loss of the season. He didn’t deserve to lose, you give up two hits and kid just hit a good shot,” Tigers coach Kevin Gray said. “When you don’t score and get any opportunities to bunt guys over that’s what happens.” The Tigers just couldn’t get much going offensively as they loaded the bases in the bottom of the second and thought they had a runner at third in the bottom of the fifth, but Carson Welch was called out at second for apparently leaving early on a fly ball to left and tagging up. “Only had one runner get to third,” Gray said. “You have to tip your cap, he kept us off balance. We prepared for him for four days and sometimes when they pitch that well, it’s hard to get guys on.” You’d have to go back to 2017 the last time the Tigers lost in the first round of the region tournament. The future is still bright in Fort Mitchell as they graduate six seniors, but return eight of the 10 players that started in Monday’s contest. “We got a good core coming back and they’re ready to get back to work tomorrow,” Gray said. “We haven’t had this feeling in a while. I thought it was incredible when Highlands did it (won four straight from 2015-18). Winning this region one year is hard, but to do it four years in a row is incredible. It’s a feeling we don’t like, but it’s baseball and that’s the way it is.” Conner will face the Dixie Heights-Newport Central Catholic winner on Wednesday at 5 p.m. DIXIE HEIGHTS VS NEWPORT CENTRAL CATHOLIC, 1 P.M.

        "content": "Earlier, the Federal Reserve stood poised to cut the benchmark interest rate, which boded well for reliable dividend stocks . Essentially, Uncle Sam’s high yields wouldn’t compete with the passive income stemming from private enterprises. However, the latest reading from the pulse of the labor market shows that fewer Americans are filing for unemployment benefits . Per Reuters , this dynamic points to sustained strength in the underlying economy. If so, more money is chasing after fewer goods, which is inflationary. That’s not a great time to lower borrowing costs. Still, let’s also keep in mind that there are geopolitical flashpoints going on. Not only that, they are almost certain to worsen. With that in mind, a flight to safety into government bonds may occur. Since bond prices and yields share an inverse relationship, yields could decline, making enterprise-sourced passive income attractive. Plus, there are other relevant undercurrents that can make dividend payers attractive. On that note, below are reliable dividend stocks to consider. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Based in North Chicago, Illinois, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT ) ranks among the biggest medical device enterprises in the world. Per the public profile , Abbott discovers, develops, manufactures and sells healthcare products worldwide. It provides a vast portfolio of therapeutics addressing a range of conditions, from irritable bowel syndrome to hypothyroidism. It also engages in critical services, such as hormone replacement therapy. Thanks to its tremendous relevance, Abbott represents one of the most reliable dividend stocks. Right now, the company offers a forward yield of 2.12% , which is a bit above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. However, the payout ratio is reasonable at 42.78%, translating to confidence in yield sustainability. Further, it enjoys 53 years of consecutive payout increases, making Abbott a dividend king. In the trailing 12 months ( TTM ), Abbott posted net income of $5.61 billion on revenue of $40.33 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate earnings per share of $4.28 on sales of $368.56 billion. That’s disappointing. However, the bottom line could expand to $4.75 per share on sales of $41.36 billion in fiscal 2025. Kroger (KR) A grocery store giant, Kroger (NYSE: KR ) makes for a boring case for reliable dividend stocks. However, boring works very well during periods of potential economic uncertainty. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based enterprise benefits from permanent relevance. No matter what happens in the market, people have to eat. Kroger could also benefit from the trade-down effect. Because accruing enough calories is of critical importance, people will not sacrifice their grocery budget (because they can’t). Call it cynicism if you want but the reality is that KR stock should benefit, even under (or perhaps especially because of) difficult circumstances. Therefore, the company’s forward dividend yield of 2.19% is passive income you can trust. Adding to the reliability factor, the payout ratio sits at 25.57%. Also, Kroger enjoys 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s a status that management will want to keep going. Covering experts anticipate a slow cycle this fiscal year. However, the next year could see EPS of $4.55 on sales of $151.36 billion. These aren’t exciting stats but they should keep the lights on. Home Depot (HD) Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) falls under the home improvement retail sector (obviously). Per its public profile , the company sells various building materials, products and materials for the lawn and garden. Fundamentally, Home Depot serves as a one-stop shop for various things that can go wrong under homeownership. I mention that because the Covid-19 crisis sparked a sharp erosion of the benchmark interest rate. In turn, that dynamic led to a surge in real estate demand. Now, people have a bunch of homes, having made the transition from being renters/tenants. That comes with the stark realization that the homeowner – not anyone else – is responsible for when pipes break or some other crisis materializes. HD isn’t a sexy idea for reliable dividend stocks but it makes the case for being trustworthy. Right now, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 2.77% . That’s above the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, Home Depot commands 15 years of consecutive payout increases. For the next two years, experts see slow-and-steady growth in the top and bottom lines. It’s standard stuff but HD should keep you out of trouble. Comcast (CMCSA) Hailing from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) falls under the telecom services category. It’s a massive media and technology firm with a global presence. On the telecom side, Comcast offers broadband and wireless connectivity services. As for entertainment, it competes with other powerhouse brands. What might make it compelling is the Theme Parks segment. While the revenge travel phenomenon is no longer as acute, the sentiment has gave way to a concept known as travel prioritization . Stated differently, consumers – especially from younger cohorts – prioritize experiential expenditures. That makes sense as the SARS-CoV-2 virus disrupted everyone’s lives. Subsequently, the crisis forcibly demonstrated what’s truly important in life. So, it’s possible that Comcast’s Universal-branded parks could see increased demand. During the TTM period, Comcast posted net income of $15.41 billion on sales of $121.94 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe EPS could rise to $4.22 on revenue of $123.92 billion. If so, that would translate to bottom-line growth of 6% and top-line expansion of 1.9%. It’s not groundbreaking stuff. However, Comcast also offers a forward yield of 3.22% with a modest payout ratio of 31.3%. With that, it ranks among the reliable dividend stocks to consider. Sempra (SRE) Headquartered in San Diego, California, Sempra (NYSE: SRE ) is one of the powerhouses in the diversified utilities space. The energy infrastructure company operates through three segments: Sempra California, Sempra Texas Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Fundamentally, what makes me a consistent believer in SRE is that it owns a large chunk of the viable Southern California economy. As you know, the Golden State is the economic engine of the nation. Further, Southern California is especially prime because of its ports and proximity to Mexico. Yes, people may be moving out of California for various reasons, usually tied to the cost of living. However, San Diego itself – Sempra’s key market – is expanding . With that reality, SRE represents one of the reliable dividend stocks. Currently, Sempra offers a forward yield of 3.27% . Moreover, it commands 21 years of consecutive payout increases. For fiscal 2024, analysts see a decline in sales of 3.6% to $16.12 billion. However, in fiscal 2025, revenue could rise to $16.91 billion, backed by a blue-sky target of $19.09 billion. Medtronic (MDT) Based in Dublin, Ireland, Medtronic (NYSE: MDT ) falls under the medical devices category. According to its public profile , Medtronic develops, manufactures and sells device-based medical therapies to healthcare systems, physicians, clinicians and patients worldwide. It offers a range of critical services, from cardiovascular to neuroscience. Medtronic is also a big player in the diabetes care segment. For passive income, the company offers a robust forward yield of 3.4% . That’s noticeably above the underlying healthcare sector. Also, the payout ratio comes in at 48%, which is very reasonable, especially considering the yield. But the biggest takeaway (in my opinion) is the 47 years of consecutive payout increases. Management will want to keep this trend going. In the TTM period, Medtronic posted net income of $4.2 billion on sales of $32.32 billion. Presently, the company’s quarterly revenue growth rate (year-over-year) comes in at 4.7%. For the current fiscal year, EPS may dip 1.63% to $5.44. However, revenue could rise 3.6% to $33.54 billion. Given the underlying relevance, MDT ranks as a top player among reliable dividend stocks. Kinder Morgan (KMI) Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) operates in the oil and gas midstream sector. Billed as an energy infrastructure company, Kinder Morgan operates through its various pipelines and terminals. On the surface, this enterprise model may seem somewhat anachronistic given the push for clean and renewable energy infrastructure. However, hydrocarbons may impose a reality check. We’re already seeing it with the demand fallout with electric vehicles . While making the transition to electric may work for some folks, it doesn’t work for everyone – at least not yet. Therefore, hydrocarbons will likely remain relevant for a very long time to come. And that’s great news for Kinder Morgan, making KMI one of the reliable dividend stocks to consider. For passive income, the company offers a forward yield of 6.03% . That’s well above the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%, which is plenty high. However, the one drawback is the hot payout ratio of 92.25%. Stil, the relevance of the business should make KMI trustworthy. Finally, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $20.42 average price target, implying 7% upside potential.

It is especially tasty to fill the fruit with granola – this combination will give you energy for the whole day or even become a dessert for guests. The idea of making baked peaches with granola was published on the Instagram page of food blogger Inna Levenets ( inna_levenets ). Ingredients: Method of preparation: 1. Cut off the top part of the peaches – the lid. Carefully cut out the \"cup\" with a knife, take out the seeds and pulp, and leave about half a centimeter of the wall. 2. Cut the peach flesh into cubes, throw it into a saucepan with a thick bottom, and add butter and sugar with cinnamon. And keep it on low heat until the peaches are soft. 3. Divide the peaches from the saucepan among the three \"cups\" and put the granola on top of them. 4. Put the \"cups\" in the oven for 10-12 minutes at 180 degrees. It is very convenient to bake peaches in a muffin tin. 5. Serve the finished peaches with yogurt, ice cream, and caramel topping.",

Aaron Agbaya Herrera, SMS Richie Ledesma Yuayan, SSg Henry Mascariña Mago, Cpl.Rainier Reyes Zaballa, Cpl. Allan Daluz Abdon, Cpl. Wilson Peñaverde Bantilan, Cpl. Rene John Martinez Bartolata and SSg. Junar Cabuyao Cabalsa.In her complaint, Rianzales recounted that around 3.15 a.m. on Friday, she was awakened by loud banging on her door as unidentified armed men wearing dark clothes and masks kicked at her door until it gave in.The armed men then barged into her unlocked bedroom, identified themselves as policemen and pointed their guns at her.The operatives, apparently, were looking for Jonathan, the live-in partner of Rianzales.When asked where Jonathan is, Rianzales said he is not home but at work in Laguna.The policemen searched the rest of the house and left when they could not find Jonathan.Rianzales, who was with her two grandchildren inside the house at that time, said she counted five men who entered her house and later learned there were three more posted outside.After around 30 minutes, Rianzales sought the help of Armando Paderon who accompanied her to the police station to report the incident.While she was giving the investigator her statement, Rianzales was informed that a police drug operation was scheduled in her barangay by intelligence personnel on the same day.When the operatives were presented to her, she recognized the armed men who harassed her by the build of their bodies and other bodily marks.Upon learning of the men's identity, Rianzales immediately filed complaints against them.The eight police intelligence personnel are now detained at the Lucena PNP temporary lockup facility while cases were filed against them on Friday. They were also inquested on the same day.Lucena police chief LtCol. Reynaldo Reyes was also relieved of his post on the same day and was replaced by LtCol. William Angway as officer in charge.",

Erik ten Hag's side qualified for the competition by winning the FA Cup on Saturday. 1 Ineos are confident Manchester United and Nice will both be allowed to play in the Europa League Credit: Alamy But Nice, who are owned by Ineos, also booked their place in the Europa League by finishing fifth in Ligue Un. However Ineos, who own a 27.5 per cent stake in United , are confident both clubs will be allowed to feature following talks with Uefa. Ineos issued a statement which read: “We are aware of the position of the two clubs and we are in direct dialogue with UEFA. \"We are convinced that we have a solution for next season in Europe.\" There were fears the Red Devils could be bumped down to the Europa Conference League as Nice finished higher in their respective league, with United coming eighth in the Premier League. But United appear to have reached an agreement with Uefa as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's stake is less than the 30 per cent threshold for multi-club ownership rules to apply. However Ineos' stake reportedly includes a plan to invest a further £245m for infrastructure works which would take their ownership to more than 30 per cent. Passing this threshold would put Ineos in violation of ownership rules and force one of the teams to be relegated to the Conference League.

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

He has been identified as Christopher Brown of White River district in St. Mary. Reports indicate that around 9:20 pm, Brown was eating a plate of food while sitting on his verandah near the St. Mary Farmer’s Market when a motor vehicle arrived in the community.

Yuma County Sheriff’s officials said 47-year-old Jason Bradley Martin remains jailed on suspicion of arson, criminal damage and other charges. They announced Saturday night that Martin was identified as a suspect in the case and taken into custody. The county’s jail website didn’t list an attorney for Martin as of Sunday. The wildfire was reported around 2 p.m. Saturday in the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge, which was established in 1941 to protect 30 miles (48 kilometers) of mostly wetland habitat along the Lower Colorado River. Authorities said the blaze was 20% contained after burning nearly 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) of vegetation along the Arizona side of the Colorado River in Yuma County. Multiple agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and federal Bureau of Land Management, responded to the scene to assist firefighting crews Saturday.",

For now, the price is getting ready for a swing toward or above $4,000, but its true strength is yet to be shown. Ethereum has been seen in an uptrend that recently broke through $3,900. Currently, ETH is trading around $3,898, showing a gain of 1.92%, and the upsurge is supported well by swift trading volumes. The technical indicators are aligning to suggest further upward movement. The 50-day EMA stands near $3,225, while the 100-day EMA lies close to $3,175. Both moving averages have provided strong support and confirmed the current trend.

This will most probably see buyers join in and push the price even higher or, in other words, liquidate some substantial amount of short orders. As for the liquidation heatmap: at the time, there was a huge cumulative long liquidation leverage all the way down to $3,200, meaning there were $3 billion worth of longs open — theoretically meaning there might be a massive sell-off in the case of liquidation.

        "content": "Regina has been home to many Canadian aviation firsts including the first licensed pilot, aircraft and airfield. Now, the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan is seeking information about another possible aviation first – a 1929 marriage in an aircraft. Archivists going through photos at the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan have found one of a wedding party standing next to an aircraft at the Regina airport in 1929. Written across the bottom is a caption that reads, “First wedding performed in the air in Canada.” Leanne Tremblay, an outreach coordinator for the archives, said the team was able to gather some information on the photo. “We know who was married, we know who the pilot was, the reverend and even the bridesmaid but we did ask the public when we posted it on our social media platforms if they knew even more information,” she told CTV News.

The bride and groom standing in the photo were Howard Robinson of Regina and Muriel James of Chaplin, Sask. “They kind of set off and flew above the legislative buildings in Wascana Park and that the actual wedding and the official kind of “I Do’s” took place above the RCMP Depot,” Tremblay explained. Regina is already known for many firsts in Canadian aviation including the first licensed airfield, pilot and aircraft. Now the first airplane wedding be added to the list. “Written on the photo here it says the first in Canada but I wouldn’t be surprised if someone wanted to contest that,” Tremblay added. “It would be hard to confirm.” The Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan would like to know for sure and is seeking more information about the couple and whether this in fact was the first marriage in the sky over Canada.",

Provincial police say the missing children are Évelyne Gourgues, who is three years old, and Charles Gourgues, two. Investigators say they were abducted by Keven Gourgues in Saint-Vallier, Que., which is located in the province's central Chaudière-Appalaches region about 40 kilometres east of the city of Lévis. Police say Keven Gourgues has abducted two children and have launched an Amber Alert. (Submitted by Sûreté du Québec) The Amber Alert does not specify the suspect's relation to the two children.

        "description": "The village, home to a host of famous names, has surprisingly seen house prices fall over the last year",
        "content": "Moving out of London has been very attractive to people for several years now as living in the capital gets more and more expensive. There are many lovely commuter villages around but one 33 minutes from a major London station has just been named one of the best places to live in 2024 . Property experts from across the country spoke to the Mail about Britain's 30 most desirable villages and unsurprisingly Virginia Water , famous for its stunning lake, made the list. The commuter village has around 6,000 residents but sadly is not for everyone as it is a pricey place to live. According to Rightmove , properties in Virginia Water went for an average price of £1,196,178 over the last year. They even say that the majority of sales were detached properties that sold for an average of £2,046,955. Flats sold for an average of £443,828, with semi-detached properties fetching £581,429. Overall, sold prices in Virginia Water over the last year were 46 per cent down on the previous year and 30 per cent down on the 2021 peak of £1,705,693. READ MORE: The London boroughs people are avoiding in 2024 as they look for a new home including 'posh' and 'trendy' area The village in northern Surrey is home to Virginia Water Lake in Windsor Great Park, a Grade I listed Royal Park. The lake has a lovely forest surrounding its banks with a waterfall in it too called 'The Cascade'. The lake was built in 1752 and took almost 40 years to finish. It has even been featured in some films and was used for lakeside scenes in the Harry Potter movies. There are a few other spots around Windsor Great Park that are worth visiting. It has The Copper Horse, an Obelisk memorial to the Duke of Cumberland, the Savill Garden and the Long Walk which is a tree-lined 2.64-mile path to Windsor Castle. The village has a number of high-profile alumni who lived in the area. The list includes Sir Bruce Forsyth, Sir Cliff Richard, Sir Elton John, and Sarah Ferguson all have - or still do - live in Virginia Water. Another notable place in the village is Wentworth Golf Club, where the BMW PGA Championship is held. It's so expensive to join with the debenture membership structure now estimated at £200,000, adding to the pricey lore of Virginia Water It is quite easy to get to London from Virginia Water with regular direct trains on South Western Railway services that can get you to Clapham Junction in 33 minutes, which can easily get you to Victoria in no time, or direct trains to Waterloo in 41 minutes. The demand for homes in villages such as Virginia Water shows no sign of easing. House prices in areas which are mainly rural have increased at a faster rate than those in urban locations over the five years to the end of 2023. Property values in areas classed as predominantly rural have risen by 22 per cent over the past five years, compared with a 17 per cent increase in urban areas, Nationwide Building Society said. Andrew Harvey, Nationwide’s senior economist, said: “Our latest analysis suggests that average house price growth in local authorities classified as predominately rural has continued to outpace those of other areas. Between December 2018 and December 2023, average prices in predominately rural areas increased by 22 per cent, compared with 17 per cent in predominately urban areas. “Local authorities classified as ‘urban with significant rural’ saw price growth of 19 per cent over the same period.” He added: “Average house prices across both urban and rural areas declined a little overall during 2023, which reflects the rise in borrowing costs, which have added to affordability pressures.” Want more from MyLondon?

        "description": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has criticised a “siloed” approach to disability services and problems in Ireland as he encouraged local authorities to help solve the housing crisis.",
        "content": "At the launch of his party’s local and European manifesto in Dublin, Mr Harris said that he was “sick and tired of the national pass the parcel” in relation to disability services in Ireland. He said Fine Gael would promote a universal design approach for travel and playgrounds and invest in sensory spaces in libraries. “Parents don’t care, children don’t care about it, I don’t care about who does the job – we just need to get it done,” he said. He also said that housing was “the defining societal issue” in Ireland and went beyond a crisis to an “inter-generational anxiety”. He called for a review of the bulk purchase of houses by institutional investors. “I’m pleased with a number of the measures the housing minister and the finance minister have brought in, I think they’ve been good, I think they’ve been effective, but I don’t think we can close our ears in relation to this.” He also said local authorities would be “held to account” for their housing delivery, and said it was “about time every part of the public service puts their shoulder to the wheel”. Asked about the comments afterwards, Mr Harris said: “I don’t say this to be critical, but there isn’t a consistency in relation to the delivery of housing across the country. “And I don’t say that to be critical, the reason I make that point is because sometimes there can be blockages. So this is not about local government and national government having a spat here.” He said he wanted to know if there were “blockages” or resourcing issues behind why some local authorities take longer than others to “turn a vacant property into a home for a family”. He added: “I don’t want to be blaming anybody, nor them blaming us, but I want every arm of this state to work together because what I can tell you, seven weeks as Taoiseach, I am concerned genuinely about the siloed approach that is taken to problems in this country. “I have huge respect for our public servants, I described them as the best in the world today at the National Economic Dialogue, that is my view. But I do sometimes think there can be ‘that’s a matter for somebody else’, ‘that’s a matter for that agency’. The public are sick and tired of that. “I have a very low threshold in terms of tolerance for that. I want to fix housing once and for all and I want everyone to play their part in that.”",

I’m a fit guy of 36 and I work out at a boxing gym. My mate is 51 and he is a boxing coach. He’s been a friend of mine for ten years and I have great respect for him. He lost his driving licence recently due to having some sort of epileptic fit. We were all there for him and supported him. His wife is 40 and she’s been finding it difficult to get around as they live in a village with little public transport and she hadn’t ever learned to drive. Now they need her to learn, so they can use their car again. My friend asked me if I could take her out to practise driving at weekends and I was happy to oblige. Get in touch with the Dear Deidre team Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors. Fill out and submit our easy-to-use and confidential form and the Dear Deidre team will get back to you. You can also send a private message on the DearDeidreOfficial Facebook page or email us at: deardeidre@the-sun.co.uk We’d been out for a couple of lessons when she hit a rabbit in the road one evening. She was so shaken up I got her to pull over. My reassuring hug suddenly turned into a passionate kiss. We were both pretty hot under the collar and so when she suggested we go to a quieter area, and then pulled into a layby, I couldn’t help myself. We had sex in the back seat — it wasn’t the longest session I’ve had but it was the most intense. Afterwards she told me my mate hadn’t had sex with her for weeks because he’s been worried any excitement would bring on another seizure. We’ve had sex three times since, during her weekly lessons. I feel really bad but can’t help myself. MORE FROM DEAR DEIDRE DEIDRE'S STORIES Connor's controlling girlfriend finds out he's at the park DEAR DEIDRE My mummy's boy husband is a love rat & has been cheating since she passed away DEIDRE SAYS: This arrangement doesn’t sit well with you, or you wouldn’t have written in. I’m afraid you’re paying lip service to “respecting” your friend. While he’s been worrying about his health, you’ve been betraying him. You may not have been the instigator but you’ve enjoyed every moment. Encourage this woman to help your friend and get clear support from his doctor. Tell her that you aren’t comfortable taking advantage of a friend’s wife and do the decent thing and end it. If you don’t, you stand to lose this friend altogether and potentially other friends along the way. My support pack called Your Lover Not Free explains the pitfalls about these sorts of relationships. Dear Deidre: Cheating and can you get over it",

        "content": "Former senator representing Abia South Senatorial district in the ninth National Assembly, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has called for renewed reading culture and discipline of children to avoid the consequences of lack of knowledge and indiscipline. Senator Abaribe made this appeal in Abuja during the launch of five books written by Dr. Titilayo Kayode-Alabi in commemoration with this year’s Children’s Day celebration. He said; “I don’t think it is just for the child , it is also our responsibility to make sure that books of this nature get to the child and the child reads. “What is happening is that parents do not have time for their children, parents tend to have the teacher take responsibility for the child, not knowing that every parent has a responsibly to the child, we are encouraging every parent to do what is going on here today, give the children what will excite them, what will shape their thinking. “It is us, parents, that the children emulate , if you do something bad and think the children don’t know, they know , if you set the right footstep the child will take the footstep. “If the child is going wrong and you correct him, the child will know that doing right or wrong. And parents should not pamper their children , you must correct the child properly. “There is even a phrase in the Bible that say should not spare the rod for the child, because if you do so, you are going to reap the consequences later, the country will reap the consequences of a bad upbringing of a child, so what Dr Titi has done here is very wonderful, five books for children leading to moral regeneration within our children is wonderful, so we congratulate her.” Dr Titilayo Kayode-Alabi said she wrote the five books ‘Father’s Tiny Little Brother ‘, ‘Skunny’s Perfect Holiday ‘, We Do Not Like The New Ugly Ducks! Do we?’ ‘Aduke The Pregnant Girl ‘, ‘Somtochukwu And Dawn, The Medi-Fairy’ because she loves to read and as well push African heritage and culture to children for moral regeneration. “As a child, I loved to read a lot, I saw a lot written by the Westerners and it gave me that impression of Western culture compared to the African, growing I saw content created on witchcraft to even LGBQ and I thought that it is high time we began to create our content, to show our children our own story, our own culture, our heritage. “As a medical doctor, I see a lot of children and I noticed that when you tell them what they need to know, they are able to make something in their head, in their decision, in their choices that impact the outcome of their health, I said I work in Nyanya hospital, I have limited contact with children, why not broaden my reach? If I started to write and tell medical stories in a way that empowers them to make decisions concerning health. “I reach more children with my books, besides just writing and inviting people and the media to promote, the other is, I’m contact hoping these books can get ministry of education so that they can bring these into curriculum so that children more in number will read them.”",

The artist and designer joined forces with Watford Borough Council in 2020 to re-imagine the chapel at Vicarage Road Cemetery into a creative space where artists can originate and exhibit their work. That will continue but Amma, who moved to Watford from East London approaching 15 years ago, has been seeking a more central location in the town to reach more people. After speaking to the shopping centre management, a proposal was accepted and she has taken on a lease for the Gallery area on Level One, next to Palace car park. Amma Gyan in the House of Amma in the Gallery \"It's always been the Gallery but it's never been fully occupied as such,\" she said. \"I think the centre manager's very experience-driven and wanted to make the most of it. Art and all things creative is one of the ways you can do that because it's different and it changes. \"I think it was fortunate that I'd had the chapel so I had a bit of a track record of doing something similar that had been received well.\" Amma has taken the rooms at...

        "content": "It's probably no secret that the former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, has a warm relationship with his wife Olena, who has been married to him for over 20 years. Many Ukrainians are touched by the romantic nature of the \"iron man\", and a new selfie with his beloved is proof of this. In the latest photo, which has more than 43 thousand likes on Facebook , the couple looks happy. The retired general's subscribers pelted him with compliments in the comments. Therefore, OBOZ.UA decided to recall other photos of the Zaluzhnyis family, which show that true love is timeless. As the former commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine previously wrote, his wife is the closest person to him. So, on her birthday, Zaluzhnyi wrote a post where he talked about his crazy love, which has already withstood more than 20 years of marriage. \"I can't imagine how much patience, courage, and wisdom it takes to be there for me. Even when I didn't believe in myself, you believed in me and supported me. All I have and all I have achieved is you. Thank you for the air, for the heartbeat, and for the dreams that come true. Happy birthday, my love,\" he wrote. Not much is known about the \"iron general's\" chosen one. Before the full-scale war of the Russian Federation, she worked as a financier in a bank, but there is no information on whether she kept her job. Olena and her husband used to go on hiking trips around Ukraine. The couple is raising two children: Khrystyna and Arina. The older one is a soldier in the Kyiv garrison, and the younger one plans to become a doctor and is studying in Odesa at a medical institute. Only verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber . Do not fall for fakes!",

        "description": "IPL 2024: Everything that this season taught us – from a new style of batting to the ramifications with new rules.",
        "content": "What will be the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season remembered for? Recency bias might suggest the closely-contested matches it produced, or the underdog stories. Beyond the prima facie observations, however, the tournament was all about debunking narratives, as it taught us some consequential lessons, which could shape how the format, the tournament, and also the Indian cricket team , will transition from here onwards. Here are what we learned from IPL 2024: ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD 1. Adios Anchors, Make Way for the New Template IPL 2024: The likes of Jake Fraser-McGurk have established a new template for T20 batting. (Photo: BCCI) Two decades since its inception, the shortest format of the game has gone through a metamorphosis. The ideal T20 template – a phrase used in every debate across the Indian cricketing circles since the 2022 T20 World Cup – has been entrenched, and it has no provision for the now-anachronistic terms like ‘anchor,’ ‘holding the fort’ and ‘calculative cricket.’ The new format is all about being uninhibited with the bat, unceasingly attacking the bowlers. To contextualise – in the first 16 editions of the tournament, where 1032 matches were played, we witnessed only a couple of 250+ scores. In this edition, that barrier has been traversed an astonishing eight times in 74 matches. . @delhicapitals ' Flying Powerplay ð¤© Fraser-McGurk increases the temperature with some explosive stroke play ð¥ Watch the match LIVE on @JioCinema and @StarSportsIndia ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #DCvMI pic.twitter.com/e2VdyReaPu — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 27, 2024 0 A total of 1260 sixes were hit, which outclassed the previous best figure of 1124 by a mile. 42 of those sixes were struck in the match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings, which happens to be the highest-ever figure in any T20 match. Notably, Punjab chased down a target of 262 runs in that match, which was the highest successful chase in this format. The match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad saw 549 runs being scored, which is the highest aggregate in a T20 match. That, however, is not all, for the pre-IPL highest aggregate (517) was surpassed on two other occasions – Kolkata Knight Riders vs Punjab Kings, and Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Mumbai Indians. Hyderabad’s score of 287/3 was also the highest ever by a team in any franchise league across the globe.

Albeit, it cannot be denied that the rule has had a role to play in the monstrosity we witnessed this year. Orange Cap winner Virat Kohli, who recorded his best-ever strike rate this year, admitted having an additional batter led to the transformation in his approach, but is not a proponent of the rule. I say it how it is. Entertainment is on one side, but never in my life have I seen a situation where bowlers think they will concede a four or a six every ball. Not every team has a Jasprit Bumrah, or a Rashid Khan, or a mystery bowler. So what will you do? I am telling you, one extra batter is the reason why I am playing with a 200-plus strike rate in the powerplay. I know there is a batsman coming in at number 8 as well. Virat Kohli Virat Kohli on impact player and the downfall of bowling in IPL pic.twitter.com/GPHCBsI3VS — Agnik (@lordkohli18) May 20, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD This is one facet of the criticism of the rule. The other, and perhaps, more consequential facet, is that it has completely stagnated the development of potential all-rounders for the Indian cricket team. Consider Shivam Dube’s example as a case study. He already has 8 T20I wickets and 46 T20 wickets to his name, but since the impact player rule was introduced, has only bowled a solitary over. Among the reasons why KKR found it justifiable to retain Venkatesh Iyer ahead of Shubman Gill prior to the 2022 mega auction was the former’s all-round skills, with Iyer picking up three wickets in IPL 2021. He also made it to the Indian team and picked up five wickets. Since the rule was implemented, however, he has bowled only one over like Dube, with the teams no longer requiring jacks of all trades. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Speaking on this, Indian captain Rohit Sharma told on the Club Prairie Podcast: I am not a big fan of impact substitute rule. It is going to hold all-rounders back. Eventually, cricket is played by 11 players, not 12 players. You are taking out so much from the game to make it entertaining for people around. If you look just from the cricketing aspect of it I feel guys like Shivam Dube and Washington Sundar aren't getting to bowl, which for us is not a good thing. Rohit Sharma ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Crores of Rupees Down the Drain? You Better Think Again IPL 2024: Eyebrows were raised when KKR signed Mitchell Starc for Rs 24.75 crore, but in the end, it was all worth it. (Photo: BCCI) The IPL 2024 auction saw more eyebrows being raised than paddles, with a few preposterous price tags floating around. Pat Cummins was the first cricketer who broke the record for the highest-ever bid, as Sunrisers Hyderabad spent Rs 20.50 for his services. Cummins might have the honour of being called the World Cup-winning captain for eternity, albeit the honour of being IPL’s most expensive cricketer lasted only a few minutes. The abdication took place when Kolkata Knight Riders spent Rs 24.75 crores on Cummins’ Australian teammate, Mitchell Starc. The general consensus on 19 December 2024 was that the Sunrisers and the Knight Riders have all but lost their rationale, and have committed to almighty blunders. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Six months down the line, those two teams competed in the final. With his 18 wickets, and his excellent leadership, Cummins led the Hyderabad resurgence, taking the last-placed team of IPL 2023 to second in the standings. Starc, meanwhile, had a difficult start to his life in purple and gold. Yet, considering the way he bowled in the second half of the competition – ending up with 17 wickets, and delivering arguably the ball of the tournament in the final – it seemed that he had taken co-owner Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Haar kar jeetne waalon ko Baazigar kehte hain’ a bit too seriously.

That, with teams deploying analysts and strategists like Nathan Leamon and Gaurav Sundaraman, it is likely that they know what they are doing. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Pace-Bowling All-Rounder – Found. Power-Hitting Finisher – Found. IPL 2024: Nitish Reddy could be the pace-bowling all-rounder India are looking for. (Photo: BCCI) An uncontested prior to IPL 2024 was that India lacked youngsters for two specific roles – a pace-bowling all-rounder, and a power-hitting finisher. Let’s consider the former first. The ‘Who after Hardik Pandya?’ question has been doing rounds in the Indian cricketing circuit for a while now, with answers being only names without any corroboration. But this edition saw the emergence of a certain Nitish Reddy – the 21-year-old all-rounder from Andhra, who won the Emerging Player of the Season award. Not only did he score 303 runs at a strike rate of 142.92, but Reddy also scalped three wickets in the limited bowling opportunities he was provided with.

The presumed lack of a power-hitting Indian finisher sparked bidding wars whenever Shahrukh Khan came to auction, for he was among the rare cricketers to fit the bill. That list has had new additions, with arguably the most prominent among those being Ashutosh Sharma. The Punjab Kings batter scored 189 runs at a strike rate of 167.25, including a 28-ball 61 against Mumbai. Another player on this list, albeit comparatively older, is Ramandeep Singh. The Kolkata Knight Riders batter scored 125 runs at a strike rate of 201.61, including an unbeaten 6-ball 25 against Lucknow Super Giants.

It seemed that the majority of those players will represent the nation in the years to come, albeit, only Shubman Gill has managed to carve his identity.

This year, however, Abhishek was among the standout performers, scoring 484 runs at a strike rate of 204.22 – the highest among players with 350+ runs. Parag’s case is slightly different, for despite making his IPL debut way back in 2019, he had never really established himself. Having scored 600 runs in the first five seasons, he has quietened the sceptics with a 573-run season, at an average of 52.09. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Questions on Umpiring Standards IPL 2024: The umpiring standard this season has raised questions. (Photo: BCCI) Considering this tournament is called the Indian Premier League, it is only right that over 80% of the umpires are Indians – 17 among 21. However, the standard on display this season has sparked questions. There were plenty of controversial decisions across the 74 matches, despite having the assistance of technology. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), alongside the players and coaches, will be hoping for a better show from the umpires next season.

        "content": "The midfielder was not part of David Moyes’ plans for the 2023/24 season and it was decided that the 25-year-old would gain more experience in England’s second division. Downes helped the Saints achieve promotion to the Premier League and was impressive in the play-off final against Leeds on Sunday. Downes featured in 37 games for Southampton this season, scoring two goals and providing a further three assists; however, it was the Englishman’s overall performances that have impressed Saints fans. Many supporters would have been hoping to keep the midfielder at St Mary’s Stadium for their return to the Premier League, but West Ham may have dropped some hints that he will be returning to London. Southampton are believed to have a in Downes’ loan deal, but the Hammers may well keep the 25-year-old. West Ham hint at Flynn Downes’ return According to , West Ham have dropped hints that Downes will be returning to the Premier League club for the 2024/25 campaign. In an article on the after Southampton’s play-off victory on Sunday, the East London outfit made a point of clearly stating it was the end of the 25-year-old’s time with the Saints. On four separate occasions, West Ham referenced the fact the game represented the end of the player’s loan deal. It is uncertain if Downes will have a big role to play under Julen Lopetegui next season but the midfielder could be a solid squad player throughout the campaign.",

The deceased were identified as Virendra Singh, 26, from Khar Danda and Atul Kharose, 45, a Kanjurmarg resident. In both cases, the police have arrested the offending drivers; one of them was later released on bail.

I think a lot of young players are good enough, but maybe don’t get the chance, so I’ve got a real passion for that as well.” Rooney, who acknowledged his journey to Plymouth via spells at Derby, DC United and Birmingham had its challenges, is excited about the latest phase of his career, which will see him link up once again with the club’s director of football Neil Dewsnip.

        "description": "Brandi Rhodes, a former WWE professional wrestler, was finally diagnosed with endometriosis years after doctors first dismissed her symptoms.",
        "content": "About three years ago, Brandi Rhodes, a yoga and Pilates instructor, and former WWE professional wrestler, was pregnant with her daughter when she felt what she calls an \"internal pain.\" \"It felt like something inside, whether it was an ovary or my uterus, just felt really irritated and aggravated,\" Rhodes, 40, tells TODAY.com. Her doctor at the time told her that it was simply something that some women feel and it would go away after she gave birth. But that didn't happen. \"The biggest shock was postpartum, when this was supposed to be going away, it definitely was not going away,\" Rhodes says. Her doctor then suggested , and while the specialists Rhodes saw over the next three years were skilled and knowledgeable, the therapy only helped a little bit. She started to experience other symptoms as well, like irregular menstrual cycles, heavy periods and severe bloating. \"One day I'd wake up in the morning and I felt normal and fine and (could see) my abs,\" she says, \"and then another day I would wake up and I would look three months pregnant.\" \"Then I found myself back at the doctor again,\" Rhodes recalls, \"and that doctor really waved it off. She didn't really show concern. She really didn't have a lot of questions.\" She was then referred to a nutritionist followed by a gastroenterologist, who said she needed a colonoscopy because her . Rhodes, a fitness instructor and professional athlete who eats a nutritious diet, works out frequently and did not have GI symptoms, did not agree. \"That was the point at which I gave up. I just said, you know what, maybe this ,\" Rhodes says. Mentally, the experience and the continued symptoms . At the time, Rhodes was building up her yoga and Pilates studio, but she felt \"defeated,\" she says. \"That will make you not really want to go out there and conquer the world and help people with their fitness because you're feeling bad yourself.\" It wasn't until fellow professional wrestler shared in February — she had 11 precancerous ovarian tumors — that Rhodes felt like trying to push for answers again. \"Seeing that really lit a fire under me,\" Rhodes says, and it made her realize she needed to keep taking her own symptoms seriously. She made an appointment with another doctor who set her up with an ultrasound and performed a basic pelvic exam. After just the pelvic exam, the doctor said it \"felt like endometriosis,\" Rhodes says. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue that normally grows inside the uterus begins growing outside of it, typically on the nearby reproductive organs, such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes. While a patient's symptoms and family history can help make a diagnosis, the only way to know for sure is to undergo laparoscopic surgery to find the endometrial tissue. Learning that she may have a condition that could have been caught with such a simple exam left Rhodes feeling both angry and relieved. \"It's been three years. What took so long?\" she says. She recalls telling her husband, , \"I'm so mad. I'm so worked up because I knew something was wrong. And the way that I felt so dismissed in so many different ways... This is so wrong.\" The doctor set Rhodes up with a specialist who confirmed the diagnosis and gave her the option of surgery. The specialist offered to give her time to decide, but she recalls saying, \"I've had three years to think about it. I want to have surgery.\" This week, Rhodes underwent The operation also revealed that she had stage four endometriosis, indicating a particularly severe case of the condition. Now, Rhodes is recovering from surgery with the support of her husband and her mom and the flexibility of her studio staff. And she wants others out there to trust themselves — and to advocate for themselves — when they know something is off. That's one reason why she shared her story in an alongside a photo take in the hospital. \"Feel empowered by your own feelings,\" she says. \"It can feel really discouraging, and you can start to second guess yourself and feel like maybe this is (your) fault. But it's not. You just haven't met the right professional yet.\"",

In the post-game press conference, Dr. Ogum lauded Mukwala’s performance, particularly highlighting his resilience and execution following Kotoko’s 2-1 loss to Berekum Chelsea in the previous match. \"And I think Steve [Mukwala] made it so beautiful. As I said before the game, I engaged him and I think he has lived up to the task. It’s good for us. I’m even short of words,\" a smiling Ogum remarked. The victory has propelled Kotoko to ninth place in the Ghana Premier League standings, providing a much-needed boost as they aim to climb higher up the table. Kotoko will next face Great Olympics, hoping to build on their recent success and continue their ascent in the league standings. Mukwala’s brace not only secured the win but also showcased his importance to the team, highlighting his ability to deliver in crucial moments. As Kotoko prepare for their upcoming matches, Mukwala's form will be vital in their quest to finish the season strongly.",

        "content": "Nigerian banks appear poised for another round of losses as investors continue to weigh their options regarding the impending bank recapitalization plans. The NGX Banking Index fell sharply at the end of last week, shedding a whopping 7.35%, one of the worst weekly performances this year. Aside from Stanbic IBTC, all the major banking stocks posted losses, with UBA, FBN Holdings, and ETI shedding 12%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. UBA and Zenith Bank closed the week at a year-low of N19.2 and N30, respectively. A worried investor opined, “The Central Bank recapitalization policy has decimated bank stocks. How can they raise N3 trillion at these valuations? Investors are spooked, and I doubt the capital raise will be successful.” Month-to-date, banking stocks are down 5.29%, 28.77% for the quarter, and 18.26% year-to-date. This is a stark contrast to the end of the first quarter of the year when banking stocks were up 14.76%. Banks like Access Holdings are trading below their earnings per share, delivering a price-to-earnings multiple of 0.837x. UBA, with a price-to-earnings multiple of 0.96x, is also trading below its earnings per share. Zenith Bank, which is trading at its year low, has a borderline 1x multiple to its earnings. READ ALSO: UBA leads as banks generate N425bn from e-transactions in 2023 The sell-offs are all the more remarkable when you consider the massive profits being declared by Nigerian banks and the record amount of dividends being paid. However, it appears investors are more concerned about the spate of rights issues planned by commercial banks as they struggle to meet their banking recapitalization targets. Most banks have announced plans for rights issues, which many investors view as a major first step toward achieving their recapitalization goals. Investors with knowledge of the situation opine that the strategy of raising capital via rights issues may be the major reason why the share prices are depressed. Rights issues are typically capital raises that only allow existing shareholders to exercise their rights by purchasing the shares of the company. This suggests that a lower share price might be favourable to insiders, especially those with majority control, even though it could lead to the creation of more shares. READ ALSO: CBN directs banks to suspend charges on deposits For example, for Access Corporation to raise N300 billion via a rights issue, it would have to sell 18 billion shares at the current share price of N16.4 versus just 10 billion shares if it sold at its year high of N30 per share. However, this means investors will pay nearly twice the current share price of N16.24. Most rights issues are also priced at a discount to their current share price, even as existing regulations do not require the trading of the stock to be suspended. This suggests the rights issue price could initially be lower than the current share price. Another reason given by some analysts is the amount of dividends declared by most banks, which have been in record figures. For example, Zenith Bank declared about N100.4 billion in dividends in 2023 compared to N125.5 billion declared this year already. GTCO also declared N94 billion this year versus N91 billion a year earlier. UBA also declared N95 billion in dividends this year versus N37.6 billion reported a year earlier. Fidelity Bank, which plans to raise about N370 billion, also declared dividends of N27.2 billion this year versus N22.4 billion in 2023. This perhaps explains why bank share prices have plummeted in recent weeks and could fall further as the rights issue dates are confirmed and selling prices revealed. READ ALSO: U.S. bankrolling creation of deadlier, more contagious bird flu strains Most analysts also suggest some of the dividend payouts may be reinvested in the company by the beneficiaries in the form of subscribing to their rights issues. Just last week, the chairman of UBA, Tony Elumelu, promised to invest his entire dividend in the rights issue. Most bank majority shareholders are expected to do the same. While this benefits the market, especially retail investors, the adjustments of share price following dividend payments also add to the pressure on their share price as they achieve lower lows. One other concern some investors have is that most bank stocks are not just experiencing a price decimation, but they are also doing this at a higher volume of trade, which suggests even lower prices. For example, FBNH traded 20.4 million shares on Friday at a lower price close. Zenith Bank, UBA, and ETI also experienced a similar trend. For instance, ETI recorded a volume of 554.9 million shares on Friday at a closing price of N21.65, compared to the previous day’s volume of just 347,214 shares at N24.05. This suggests there are likely more sellers in the market than buyers.",

        "content": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives , Abbas Tajudeen, and the Minister of Blue Economy, Gboyega Oyetola, have expressed support for the repeal and enactment of the Shippers’ Council and Economic Regulatory Bill. Messrs Tajudeen and Oyetola backed the bill on Monday at the public hearing organised by the House Committees on Shipping Services, Ports and Harbours, Maritime Safety, Education, and Administration. The repeal and enactment bill seeks to address the loopholes in the existing law which governs the maritime sector. According to its synopsis, the bill seeks to create a robust economic regulatory framework that prevents unfair practices, promotes fair pricing, and encourages competition. It also seeks to protect the interests of both service providers and users by ensuring transparency and accountability in the imposition of tariffs and charges, as well as automate and digitalise cargo-related processes to align with international best practices. Mr Tajudeen, represented by a member of the House, Sada Soli (APC, Katsina), said the bill would create an enabling environment for investors to invest in the maritime sector with their investments guaranteed. The speaker said the mandate of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council has evolved significantly from its original role as a protector of shippers’ interests, noting that “it has now become the economic regulator of the entire Nigerian port system, a responsibility that extends beyond the Nigerian Ports Authority.” PREMIUM TIMES delivers fact-based journalism for Nigerians, by Nigerians — and our community of supporters, the readers who donate, make our work possible.

Mr Tajudeen said the bill is critical to ensure the Nigerian Shippers’ Council performs in its expanded role. “To effectively fulfil its expanded mandate as the Port Economic Regulator, it is imperative, therefore, that the necessary legislative bill is passed. This bill will formally empower the Council, providing it with the authority and tools required to oversee and manage the economic activities within Nigerian ports, ensuring efficiency, fairness, and competitiveness across the sector,” he said. On his part, Mr Oyetola, while canvassing the need to establish the regulatory agency, said the bill would improve the nation’s economy. The minister, represented by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Oloruntola Olufemi, said it would be a welcome development if the bill became an Act. The Chairperson of the Shipping Line Association of Nigeria, Boma Alabi, however, raised concerns about some specific parts of the bill and called for the intervention of the lawmakers. She said the association had already raised some of the clauses with the committee. She said the association is ready to back any measure that will improve efficiency, lower cost, and reduce the bottleneck in the sector, but some of the clauses leave room for abuse. “We must be more efficient, and we welcome this regulatory agency that will be created to make things more efficient. “We have expressed our concern internally and externally, and this committee, which has been involved in this process, must work on some areas of concern.

        "description": "The Dolphins' star receiver had some playful jabs to dish out to Wes Welker over the weekend.",
        "content": "Back in January, the marched into Arrowhead in the Wild Card round of the playoffs after blowing a massive lead in the AFC East. The team had lost ten straight games when kickoff occurred in sub-40 degree temperatures before that game. Unfortunately, their streak continued as the handled them with ease, 26-7, in one of the . Despite leading the team with five receptions and 62 receiving yards, as well as scoring the team's lone touchdown in the loss, star receiver was for his lackluster performance (relative to his regular season success). Wide receivers coach Wes Welker has been working closely with Hill this offseason, and it's clear the rapport between them has grown. When prompted by a Twitter post, Hill joked that Welker's reputation had exceeded his actual production while in the NFL. Hill's post is all in good fun, as earlier this offseason that Welker deserved more offensive coordinator and head coaching interview. If Welker's tutelage can help arguably the league's best wide receiver get even better, opportunities for those gigs will come knocking soon. Welker: Hill Has \"Separated Himself\" From WR Pack Hill is , and it's a scary thought to imagine that he could improve even further. Yet, he and Welker appear hellbent on making that happen. In an of the Palm Beach Post, Welker had lofty praise for Hill, calling him a complete receiver, and even going so far as to compare him to Hall of Fame receiver (and Welker's former teammate) Randy Moss: \"Randy Moss was the best deep ball receiver in the game. Tyreek Hill runs the whole route tree. Name a route he can't run. How he approaches every day and every game is very impressive. That's where he separates himself.\" Hill's marks of 7.4 receptions and 112.4 yards per game were both near the top of the league last year (the latter stat led the NFL), and he's somehow become even more dominant since the fateful trade that sent him from Kansas City to Miami. Outside of maybe , it's hard to make the case for any receiver currently in the league over Hill. He's wholly dominant as a vertical target, and he's proven to be more than adept at filling the traditional possession x-receiver role in recent years. After not eclipsing more than 87 catches in any of his first five seasons in the league, he's gone over 110 receptions in each of the last three. Over the last two seasons, Hill has finished top-ten in MVP voting and top-five in Offensive Player of the Year voting. He is the first wideout to accomplish that feat since Jerry Rice in 1994 and 1995. Welker, Hill and the Dolphins must now attempt to regroup despite this offseason. Due to salary cap issues, some of the franchise's biggest faces and personalities, such as and , were forced out of South Beach. The good news is that all six players who earned for the Dolphins last year - , Raheem Mostert, , Alec Ingold, Terron Armstead, and Jalen Ramsey - are returning for the 2024 season. The team also just on receiver Jaylen Waddle and edge rusher Jaelan Phillips, which should keep the core of the team in place for a little while longer. There's still time for the team to earn its first playoff victory since 2000, especially as long as McDaniel is calling the plays for the league's most prolific offense (NFL-leading 401.3 yards per game in 2023). If Hill somehow continues to improve while working with Welker, then the Dolphins may be truly unguardable come next season.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4. The match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout. Nadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat. His three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",
