        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Both the CPM and the state government have found themselves entangled in the controversy over the new liquor policy. The party is of the view that relaxations in the liquor policy are necessary for the development of the tourism sector in the state and to attract more investment in industrial and IT parks. However, the controversy erupted even before the government took a decision on the liquor policy. In this situation, how can the government announce relaxations in the liquor policy? If the government announces relaxations, it will be interpreted as the confirmation of taking bribes from the bar owners. The party and the government are finding it hard to make a decision on the matter. Neither the CPM nor the LDF has held a discussion on the bar owners' bar owners' demands to do away with the dry day system and extend the operating hours of bars. The controversy broke out when a voice message sent by a leader of the bar owners' association asking each bar owner to pay Rs 2.50 lakhs in exchange for the relaxations from the government came out. The voice message was sent by Animon, a state leader of the Federation of Kerala Bar Association. It is alleged that there is a massive bribery deal behind this. The opposition is planning to launch widespread protests against the government even though CPM state secretary MV Govindan and Excise Minister MB Rajesh are claiming that the government has not even started a preliminary discussion on the liquor policy. Opposition targeting Chief Minister The opposition, which demanded the resignation of Excise Minister MB Rajesh, turned against Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas after the details of the meeting called by the Tourism Director came out. It is asking if the Tourism Director would call a meeting without the knowledge of the Tourism Minister. By portraying Minister Riyas as the main mastermind in the bar bribery controversy, the opposition is targeting Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The opposition is also trying to take advantage of the resentment that a section of the CPM has towards Riyas.",

        "content": "OAKLAND — Firefighters stood watch on Monday over the smoldering remains of a long-time lumber yard in Oakland that was scorched by a four-alarm fire this weekend, as an investigation into the blaze begins. The fire consumed Economy Lumber at 750 High Street in Oakland. The Oakland Fire Department said the blaze was first reported around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday. By 11 p.m., the same night, firefighters had contained the fire, Oakland fire spokesperson Michael Hunt said. “Crews are still on scene at Economy Lumber,” Hunt said Monday. “We’ll probably be on scene most of the day.” The wrecked complex is the site of one of four lumber yards that Economy Lumber operates in the Bay Area. Oakland fire investigators were attempting to determine the cause of the fire. The Oakland Fire Department also began working with the property owner and a heavy equipment operator to pull apart the building so crews could reach any remaining hot spots, Hunt said. About 75 firefighters responded to the site of the fire Sunday. No injuries were reported as a result of the blaze. Economy Lumber has been in business since 1935. The company was born as a small lumber business and eventually expanded to four Bay Area locations. It wasn’t immediately known when 750 High Street lumber yard began operating.",

        "content": "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, on Sunday, announced that it would work with Schlumberger Global to develop frontier oil basins in Nigeria. Schlumberger, globally known as SLB Global, is a major player in the oil and gas industry, while Nigeria’s frontier basins are regions with potential for oil and gas reserves that have not been extensively explored yet. The Chief Executive, NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, hosted a delegation from the global oil firm led by its President, Olivier Le Peuch, where both parties discussed developing Nigeria’s frontier basins, according to a statement issued in Abuja by the upstream regulatory commission. “Areas of mutual interest discussed include the development of Nigeria’s frontier basins and the integration of innovative technologies to enhance exploration and production efficiencies,” NUPRC stated, The frontier basins hold promise for increasing Nigeria’s hydrocarbon production and they include the Anambra, Benue Trough (Lower, Middle, Upper), Chad (South-Eastern sector), Dahomey, Bida (Mid-Niger), Sokoto, and Deep/Ultra-deep offshore. The significance of the basins is that they are new sources of oil and gas revenue for Nigeria, with the potential for natural gas reserves for domestic use and export. NUPRC is responsible for overseeing frontier basin exploration through regulations, and the basins are seen as a way to ensure Nigeria’s long-term energy security and economic growth. The statement stated that the meeting between NUPRC and Schlumberger underscored the commission’s commitment to fostering strategic partnerships that would enhance Nigeria’s oil production and operational efficiency. It said the purpose of the visit was to explore specific areas of collaboration and partnership between both organisations. During the meeting, Komolafe said the NUPRC adopts a participatory and collaborative approach to facilitate ease of doing business in the oil sector. He highlighted several of the commission’s feats since its inception in 2021 under the Petroleum Industry Act, adding that key achievements include the establishment of 17 regulations aimed at improving industry standards and operational efficiency. “Additionally, the re-engineering of the Nigeria National Data Repository has been a significant milestone, promoting the monetisation of oil blocks and aligning regulations with global energy transition initiatives and carbon footprint reduction goals,” the commission stated. It said Komolafe also mentioned the ongoing licensing rounds as a testament to the commission’s proactive approach in regulating the sector. “One notable achievement expounded upon was the NUPRC’s commitment to eliminating gas flaring and commercialising flared gas under the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme. “This initiative has designated 49 flare sites for commercialisation, demonstrating the commission’s dedication to environmental sustainability and resource optimisation,” the agency stated. On his part, Le Peuch expressed satisfaction with the commission’s regulatory framework and indicated SLB Global’s readiness to collaborate. He reiterated the importance of such partnerships in unlocking Nigeria’s onshore and offshore oil potential, particularly through leveraging advanced technology. “At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that a contact team would be established to further investigate and identify more opportunities for collaboration. The team will focus on expanding the scope of mutual interests and ensuring that both organisations can effectively work together to achieve their shared objectives,” NUPRC stated.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 in what could be his last match at Roland Garros. It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has lost a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The 14-time champion, known as the 'King of Clay', was roared on by family, friends and rivals at the scene of his greatest triumphs. Having returned to the tournament he skipped in 2023 and refused to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) 14 titles 112 victories 4 defeats 19 career Roland Garros appearances 96.5% wins 14 finals, 0 defeats 7 sets lost in final, 42 won Three 30+ win streaks 31 (2005-09), 33 (2017-21), 39 (2010-15) Nadal was persuaded afterwards by tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to say a few words to the crowd. \"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent - but if it is I enjoyed it,\" he said. \"The feelings that I have are difficult to describe, it's so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. How Nadal went down to defeat against Zverev... Murray remains proud of French Open legacy despite defeat French Open contenders and who will win at Roland Garros? Everything you need to know ahead of Roland Garros \"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries and I went through a process with the dream of being back at Roland Garros. \"The first round was not the dream one but I was competitive and had my chances. It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun. \"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics. \"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here. I really hope to see you again - but I don't know.\" Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal, the 22-time Grand Slam champion who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, has previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon) A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's No 1 and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Also in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Manchester City midfielder Rodri, no stranger to titles himself, was another famous face in the crowd. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier. Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two break points before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tie-break. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. His celebrations were low key as Nadal sent a forehand wide on match point, before Chatrier rose, possibly for one last time, to salute their hero. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, came into the French Open unseeded for the first time and saw his career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament fall to 112-4. His three other losses came against Soderling in 2010 and twice against Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. \"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. Today is not my moment. It's Rafa's moment.\" Italian world No 2 Jannik Sinner looked fully recovered from his injury problems as he saw off American Christopher Eubanks 6-3 6-3 6-4. Sinner, the Australian Open champion, withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed Rome with a hip injury, but was back on form at Roland Garros as Eubanks exited at the first hurdle for the second successive year. \"The hip is good, I'm glad that my team and myself, we were working very hard to be on court as soon as possible,\" Sinner said. \"For sure, the general shape is not at 100 per cent yet, so we try to build every day.\" The Italian broke twice in the opening set to lead 4-1 before Eubanks broke back but Sinner saw out the set with another break, and needed just one break in each of the next two sets to take his place in the second round. A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) \"Honestly, I'm just happy to be back on court, I was injured, so I'm very happy to be back here,\" Sinner said. \"It's a very special tournament for me, it was the first time in a quarter-final of a grand slam, so I have some great memories.\" Djokovic, who returned to the top of the rankings in September, now needs to at least reach the final to have any chance of staying there. The 37-year-old Serb, who said he has \"low expectations and high hopes\" of defending his title in Paris, faces French wild card Pierre-Hugues Herbert in his first-round match on Tuesday.

        "content": "Boxing legend Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare en route to Los Angeles, from Miami, prompting medical emergencies according to his representatives. It was reported that he became dizzy, prompting flight attendants to ask passengers if a doctor was on board to assist. Paramedics met the plane upon landing in Los Angeles and treated Tyson after a two-hour delay caused by Miami heat. His representative however said after the incident that the 57-year-old was now in good condition. “Thankfully, Mr. Tyson is doing great,”. The incident comes after initial reports surfaced on Monday morning alleging Tyson “had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded.” Passengers on the flight claimed cabin crew requested a doctor 30 minutes before landing and the message appeared on passenger screens. An eyewitness described the scene: “He was in first class, but we were an exit row. They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, ‘He’s a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he’s OK.’ I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words ‘Mike Tyson’ and she nodded her head yes.” READ ALSO: Boxing legend Mike Tyson to face Jake Paul in exhibition fight The plane landed at LAX and experienced another delay of 25 minutes while paramedics treated Tyson. Tyson admitted to using marijuana daily and has reportedly stopped using the drug in preparation for the fight with Paul. He has also revealed he has temporarily given up sex as part of his training regimen. “He only stopped as a means of following all of the rules,” Tyson’s publicist recently told USA Today Sports. “But he is still a strong advocate for the medicinal benefits of cannabis for his well-being and others like him.” The fight between Tyson and Paul is set for AT&T Stadium in Dallas on July 20. The legendary boxer will be 58 on that night. “I don’t see too many people critical about it. Look at this,” Tyson said at a press conference earlier this month. “Who? Name me somebody. You? Who?” The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation has sanctioned the fight as a professional bout. Although it will be contested over eight two-minute rounds instead of the standard ten or twelve three-minute. The fight will also use heavier gloves (14 ounces instead of 10) to reduce the power of punches. Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2005. His most recent fight was an exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr. in California in November 2020. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "description": "According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, governance is “the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented).

        "content": "According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, governance is “the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented). Governance can be used in several contexts such as corporate governance, international governance, national governance and local governance.” In the opinion of UNESCAP, “Good governance has eight major characteristics. It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law. It assures that corruption is minimised, the views of minorities are taken into account and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making. It is also responsive to the present and future needs of society.” In Nigeria, the governance structure is such that there are 11,082 elective political offices comprised of the seat of the president, 36 state governors, 109 senators, 360 members of the House of Representatives, 993 state Houses of Assembly members, 768 local government chairpersons, six area council chairmen and 8,809 councillors representing each of the political wards in the country. This calculation deliberately left out the positions of vice president, deputy governors and vice chairmen of local government and area councils because they are not stand-alone positions. As a notable Nigerian politician jokingly said, they are ‘spare tyres.’ Note also that there are three tiers and three arms of government in Nigeria. The three tiers are the federal, state and local government; while the three arms are the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. These tiers and arms draw their funding largely from the federal purse as laid down by law. While the arms of government receive their funding annually through the federal budget, the states and local governments draw their funding monthly through the Federation Account Allocation Committee. The three arms of government are governed by the principles of separation of powers as well as checks and balances. It is very simplistic and naïve to blame the President for bad governance and incompetence without taking into cognisance that he is not the sole administrator of the country. It is true that Nigeria has an executive president deemed to be among the most powerful individuals in the world, however, he is merely a superintendent. To succeed, he needs the collaboration and support of his lieutenants. His aides whether they are ministers or heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies must cooperate with him in order to succeed in delivering the dividends of democracy. The public servants must play their roles nobly as the engine room of the government’s bureaucracy. While it is true that the president can hire and fire, he must use his presidential powers with utmost discretion in order to avoid sabotage. A president must have eyes for details, be alive to his responsibilities and have an independent way of getting information about the public mood without excessively relying on his advisers many of whom will only tell him what he wants to hear and not what he needs to hear. For there to be good governance, the local government chairpersons and the governors must be conscientious and selfless in the performance of their duties. Personal aggrandisement should not be the sole purpose of being in government. Nigeria suffers from underdevelopment today because our political leaders across the board see their offices as avenues for corrupt enrichment and opportunities to feather their own nests. This is not in sync with the principle of good governance. If we use the eight characteristics of good governance as espoused by UNESCAP, namely – participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive, how are Nigerian political leaders going to fare? Do our leaders believe in the rule of law or the rule of thumb? How much allegiance do our leaders hold to the constitution of the country? There is a provision for the federal character principle in sections 14 (3) and (4) of the 1999 Constitution. Unfortunately, this principle meant to cement national cohesion and national loyalty is observed in the breach. Appointments into civil service and even leadership of MDAs often do not follow the federal character principle. How transparent and accountable are our political leaders? The budgeting process in many states is shrouded in secrecy. Unlike the federal budget that is online, only members of the state Houses of Assembly get to see the budget of many states. In Rivers State, the N800bn budget of the government for this year was presented to a four-member Assembly who returned it to Governor Siminalayi Fubara the following day for his signature. What a mockery of due process! Most local governments do not even have annual budgets; the local council, which is supposed to be the legislative arm, hardly meets. In fact, not a few people believe that local government is virtually non-existent in Nigeria as their roles have been taken over by the state government. Do we have participatory and inclusive governance in Nigeria? If we do, why are the vulnerable groups viz. – women, youths and persons with disability, underrepresented in the governance system of the country? The National Gender Policy of Nigeria stated 35 per cent slot for women in appointive positions but none of the tiers of government have paid due attention to that. Not even President Bola Tinubu has up to 20 per cent of women in his 48-member cabinet. There are only nine women in his cabinet with one of them, Dr. Beta Edu, suspended since the beginning of the year. There are about 11 under-50-year-olds in Tinubu’s cabinet of 48 members. As for PWDs, they don’t even have any seat at the table of the president. He only appointed a Senior Special Assistant. Not a single member of his cabinet is a PWD. This same nonchalance to the marginalised groups is replicated across the three tiers and three arms of government. How then can you claim you’re running a participatory and inclusive government? Ensuring good governance is not the responsibility of only the people holding political offices. Citizens too have a role to play. We should stop placing a heavy financial burden on political office holders. You cannot have your cake and eat it. You can’t be going to politicians for ‘chop’ money and asking them for stomach infrastructure and expect them not to steal to meet your insatiable demands. The reason many lawmakers don’t like to go to their constituency offices is due to heavy financial demands on them by their constituents who want them to send them on holy pilgrimage, help them pay school fees, bankroll the funeral of their dead parents and pay their hospital bills, among others. We’re not talking of a few individuals here but hundreds of people. Failure to meet this need gets the legislature into the black book of the constituents who will promise to punish him or her at the next election. Citizens should also pay their taxes and levies, stop vandalising government or public utilities and generally be law-abiding. It is all these collaborative efforts that will lead to good governance which has become a buzzword.",

        "description": "Bill Walton, who helped UCLA win national titles during John Wooden's career and later won two NBA titles, has died following a cancer battle.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, a UCLA basketball legend who became an NBA star and an outspoken advocate for the virtues of the Pac-12 conference as a broadcaster, died Monday at the age of 71 following a prolonged cancer battle. The NBA announced Walton’s death, launching a series of tributes to the gregarious La Mesa, Calif., native who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame and National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton grew up listening to UCLA basketball radio broadcasts and quickly committed to joining the Bruins despite numerous other scholarship offers. His laid-back approach to life clashed at times with Wooden, but Walton called the legendary UCLA coach his lifelong mentor and friend. Freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity squad during Walton’s college career. He was the Bruins’ starting center for three seasons (1972-74), playing on UCLA’s only varsity teams to record back-to-back 30-0 seasons in 1972 and 1973. He led UCLA to back-to-back NCAA titles as a sophomore and junior (1972 and 1973). “On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men’s basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton’s passing,” Bruins coach Mick Cronin said in a statement. “... It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball. Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Following his NBA career, Walton became a star broadcaster known for his high-energy commentary and frequent tributes to the Grateful Dead. He was an unabashed cheerleader for his alma mater and the Pac-12 conference, which he tirelessly referred to as the “Conference of Champions.” He lamented UCLA and USC leading teams defecting from the Pac-12 in search of greater financial stability. The Pac-12 hosted its final event, the conference baseball tournament championship game, during the weekend. Walton was surrounded by his family when he died. He is survived by his wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and extended family. Check back soon for updates on this developing news story.",

        "description": "Brisbane legend Jason Akermanis has urged the Lions' No.1 draft pick Cam Rayner to deliver on his potential and finally become a star of the AFL.",
        "content": "Brisbane legend Jason Akermanis has challenged 2017 No.1 draft pick Cam Rayner to finally deliver on his potential as the Lions claw to salvage their season. After a promising three weeks, the Lions came crashing back to earth on Sunday with a 25-point defeat to bogey team Hawthorn - their fifth-straight loss against the Hawks. It has left the Lions reeling in 12th with a 4-6-1 record heading into the bye after making last year's grand final. Rayner had just seven possessions against Hawthorn - only touching the ball more than sub Harry Sharp and tall Brandon Ryan, who was making his Lions debut. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. That quiet performance came just six weeks after Rayner produced arguably the best game of his career in a match-winning midfield turn in an upset of Melbourne at the MCG. Since being heralded for what shaped as a breakout game, the 24-year-old has again slipped back into inconsistency. \"Cam Rayner, he's an incredible player, but he hasn't really produced now he's in his seventh season,\" Akermanis told AAP. \"He's really due to play way better footy. \"More in the midfield, 20 plus possessions and a couple of shots on goal (a game) and he's just not even doing any of that - win, lose or draw. \"You watch a guy like (West Coast's No.1 draft pick) Harley Reid in his first year play incredibly well at home. \"For Cam there's not really a reason, unless he's injured and we don't know about it.\" Akermanis played tagging roles in defence and in the midfield before he became a Brownlow medallist and a genuine superstar of the AFL in 2001 when the Lions won the first of three-straight premierships. The Australian Football Hall of Famer suggested the Lions try something similar with Rayner to boost his output. \"Unless you're a natural ball-winner, which he he doesn't really seem to be a guy that accumulates and gets in the right spots, like other players who play midfield all the time,\" Akermanis said. \"He's not getting anywhere near the ball so let's put him in a spot, whether he tags straight out in the midfield and learns where to run and how to run on good players who can take him near the ball.\" Despite the Lions staring at missing the finals for the first time since 2018, Akermanis insists the future is bright for Brisbane and they could use the second half of the season as a springboard into 2025. The Lions have been hit hard by injury with five players - Will Ashcroft, Keidean Coleman, Tom Doedee, Lincoln McCarthy and Darcy Gardiner - sidelined with long-term knee issues. \"The younger guys are getting a taste, where they've just been denied for the last number of years,\" said Akermanis, adding there was \"so much to like\" amongst the Lions' group of less experienced players. \"If I was Chris (Fagan) I would keep working on the six, seven role players you need, to keep them hungry. \"Get them playing a brand that is slightly different to what it is now - even though when they play it well, it works - but the tweaks that they need.\"",

        "description": "Tom Dearden has learnt to be comfortable in his own shoes as he prepares to walk in Cameron Munster's for Queensland in the State of Origin series.",
        "content": "Tom Dearden knows Cameron Munster's are big shoes to fill but the Queensland five-eighth isn't trying to do that in his State of Origin return. With Munster (groin) scratched for the series, the North Queensland playmaker will return to the arena in Sydney on June 5 and look to bed down his spot alongside skipper Daly Cherry-Evans. \"They're definitely big shoes to fill,\" Maroons No.6 Dearden said. \"We know how important he's been for Queensland and I think the most important thing with me preparing for this week is just making sure that I stick to playing my strengths. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"I don't have to be Cameron Munster or anyone else. I just have to go out there and get my job done.\" The 23-year-old filled in for the Storm whiz on late notice in the final game two years ago, clicking instantly with Cherry-Evans in a 22-12 win. He had left first club Brisbane a year earlier, yearning for a fresh start after a torrid top-flight introduction ended with him dropped to the Queensland Cup and going 13 and then 14 games without an NRL win. Dearden's record was 5-29 with Brisbane and North Queensland in his first three NRL seasons and is 35-23 since 2022. \"It certainly was a tough start to my career, but I've moved on from that period now and I'm really settled up at the Cowboys,\" he said. \"I feel really comfortable and confident with where my game's going. \"I was probably second guessing myself at the start of my career. \"Now that I've found a spot where I'm comfortable and really enjoying my footy, I think when you're enjoying your footy you're playing good footy.\" Dearden has taken over the Cowboys' captaincy alongside fellow Maroons star Reuben Cotter, who expects the playmaker to flourish. \"He's just such a competitor and you know what you're going to get from him,\" Cotter said of Dearden. \"He's had this opportunity before and he rose to it.\" Dearden said his captaincy role had helped him find his voice, but that leading by example remained the preferred method in Townsville. Slater has seen enough, confident Dearden can steer the Queensland ship after picking him ahead of Brisbane livewire Ezra Mam, who is in the extended squad. \"The one thing that Queensland did have when Cameron Munster went down was quality players that could fill in that position,\" Slater said. \"Ezra Mam is a part of the 20-man squad, and just like J'maine Hopgood last year, when you're a part of the squad it means that you're playing for the standard this footy team has created. \"This team's created a really high standard. But I just feel that Tommy Dearden has really earned this opportunity. \"He's been playing great all year, he's got great habits in his game and he's done a great job for Queensland in the past.\"",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — Two-time NBA champion Bill Walton has died of cancer, the league confirmed Monday. Walton was 71. In a statement, the NBA offered condolences to his family, friends and fans. Adam Silver, the NBA's commissioner, praised Walton's \"infectious enthusiasm and love for the game.\" \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams,\" Silver said in the statement. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.\" The following has been released by the NBA. pic.twitter.com/fdlty5X3F5 Walton was a familiar face to basketball fans for more than half a century. In college, he played for the UCLA Bruins, helping the team win the NCAA championship in 1972 and 1973. He was awarded three consecutive national college player of the year awards, and led the Bruins on an 88-game winning streak. His professional career began in 1974, when he was selected as the first-round draft pick by the Portland Trail Blazers. Over the next 14 years, Walton would show his prowess as a center, winning numerous awards including being named the NBA's most valuable player in 1978. In 1977 and 1986, he went on with the Trail Blazers and Boston Celtics, respectively, to win the NBA championship. His original jersey, No. 32, was retired by the Trail Blazers when he left the team in 1979. After being injured in the 1986-87 season, Walton retired as a player after playing only ten games that season. When he retired, Walton continued to dedicate his life to the sport. He overcame a lifelong stutter and began his second career as a sportscaster, providing both studio analysis and color commentary for several networks and teams. Walton is survived by his wife Lori and the four sons he had with his first wife, Susie: Adam, Nathan, Luke and Chris. Luke Walton also became an NBA player, winning both the 2009 and 2010 NBA Finals with the Lakers. The younger Walton's success made them the first father-son pair to have both won multiple NBA championships.",

        "content": "Jeopardy! fans stunned by rule shake-up that allows four-day winner Grant DeYoung to compete in Tournament of Champions DeYoung enjoyed a winning streak last week on the beloved game show Host Ken Jennings hinted that he would return for Tournament of Champions However, fan argued that contestants needed to have at least five wins streak By Nola Ojomu For Dailymail.Com Published: 13:22 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:37 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 10 shares 1 View comments Jeopardy! viewers were left puzzled by an apparent shake-up in the show's rules after it was hinted that four-day winner Grant DeYoung would likely be taking part in the next Tournament of Champions. DeYoung, who works as a grocery store clerk, thrilled viewers with a four-day winning streak earlier this month - which officially came to an end on May 21 after he racked up a $81,203 haul. Host Ken Jennings then told DeYoung that 'with your four wins I think that it is very likely that we will be seeing you in the Tournament of Champions.' This raised several eyebrows of fans who believed that the Arizona native couldn't take part due to the fact he had failed to reach the usual requirement of five consecutive wins. Viewers soon took to social media to question how DeYoung would be allowed to take part despite not meeting the necessary number of wins. Jeopardy! viewers were left puzzled by a shake-up in the show's rules for eligibility that would allow contestant Grant DeYoung (pictured) to take part in the Tournament of Champions It was hinted by host Ken Jennings (pictured) that the four-day winner would likely be taking part in the next Tournament of Champions Read More Jeopardy! contestant leaves host Ken Jennings STUNNED with shock on-air confession about the moment he learned he had landed a spot on the hit game show When one fan commented on Instagram, 'Why will he be back? I thought 5 wins for toc (Tournament of Champions)?' To which another replied: 'All 4 game champions were eventually qualified at TOC in the last 3 editions.' They then added: 'With a shorter eligibility window and the expansion of TOC field in the last 2 editions. I think Grant might get in the 32nd TOC. 'Since 2021 TOC where all 4 game champions competed, some of them made it to the semifinals like: Veronica, Ryan B, Ryan H, Maureen, John & David.' Another fan stated that they hoped DeYoung would get the chance to compete as they wrote: 'I hope so. They brought back Yogesh and I think he only won a couple of games.' The last tournament in March saw Yogesh Raut, Ben Chan, and Troy Meyer battle it out in the finals, with Raut being crowed the winner. It wasn't the only rule that DeYoung has ended up revealing to viewers during his run on the show, as many fans were also shocked by the fact that contestants could use chairs. Throughout the rounds he participated in, eagle-eyed viewers spotted that DeYoung was seated in a chair , which is a rarity on the show, with most competitors opting to stand behind their podiums. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jeopardy! (@jeopardy) Fans believed that the Arizona native couldn't take part due to the fact he had failed to reach the usual requirement of five consecutive wins - but that has not been the case recently Another fan explained that 'they brought back Yogesh and I think he only won a couple of games' highlighting a recent change in the rules In a podcast Inside Jeopardy!, producer Sarah Whitcomb explained why Grant was seated rather than standing - revealing all contestants have the option. 'Fans have been noticing that Grant is sitting in a chair during his games. This is something that we always offer to contestants,' she shared. She added: 'We don't ask why. It's not our business. If you want a chair, we'll give it to you... So there you have it!' DeYoung was sitting on a black swivel chair that was adjusted up to the same standing height as the others, allowing him to see out over the podium. In the Jeopardy! subreddit from last week, a curious viewer asked why the contestant was in a chair. 'They give it if you ask - I have some back arthritis that makes standing still for that long very difficult,' DeYoung explained in a comment in the discussion thread. 'I wouldn't expect everyone who sits for Jeopardy! to disclose their reason for needing one but I don't mind saying mine.' While he appeared on the show, DeYoung also revealed he was hit by a car after learning he had made it onto the hit ABC show - but he was so excited he didn't even notice. It wasn't the only rule that DeYoung has ended up revealing to viewers during his run on the show Many fans were shocked by the fact that contestants could use chairs, and DeYoung explained that he suffered from 'back arthritis that makes standing still for that long very difficult' The grocery clerk, who hails from Prescott, Arizona, revealed that he was involved in a road traffic accident at the exact moment he received a text message confirming the news. 'I got off work and got in the car and pulled my phone out and it was sinking in,' he recalled on Wednesday night's show. 'I'm on the verge of tears there staring down at it, and I got hit and ran....' A stunned Ken asked: 'A car hit you while you were getting the text?' 'I had people coming up to me after [saying]: \"Are you aware you just got your car hit?\" and I was like \"no\" holding my phone and staring at the message.' Ken then asked whether he was doing okay. 'The car needs some work but I'm certainly fine, thank you,' Grant said. Earlier in May it was announced that a Jeopardy! spinoff was coming to Amazon Prime and it would give the web-obsessed a chance to test their knowledge. Pop Culture Jeopardy! marks the first time that the brainy series, which was created by Sony Pictures Television's game show division, will hit a streaming service. It will mimic the set up of the original game show - but the question segment will focus on music, films, TV shows, sports, and more.

        "content": "Texas city at war with nearby small town that's been dumping sewage into popular tourist lake for seven years Raw sewage from Plano, affluent suburb, spilled into Dallas' White Rock Lake Since 2017, Plano poop has spilled into waterway 30 times READ MORE: Trump says he wants to move to Texas during Dallas visit By Maryann Martinez, Texas Bureau Chief For Dailymail.Com Published: 13:37 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:54 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 6 View comments Over one million gallons of human waste has been dumped in Dallas' White Rock Lake over the last seven years by a neighboring small town using it as a sewage landfill. The untreated raw sewage came from Plano, a rich suburb north of Dallas, and it turns out, this wasn't the first time. Plano's sewage has ended up in the Texas lake 30 times in the last seven years, according to environmental records obtained by D Magazine . With such a disgusting track record, the City of Dallas is considering suing Plano, best known as home to posh soccer moms with $1,000 baby strollers and major corporate headquarters (Toyota Motor North America, JC Penney and Frito Lay [PepsiCo] to name a few.) 'Same sh**, different day,' Paula Blackmon, the Dallas council representative for White Rock Lake told the magazine. White Rock Lake, where over one millions gallons of untreated sewage have been dumped over the last seven years, is popular with Dallas crowds in the summer 'They [Plano] are aware that we [Dallas] are not happy and that they need to stop. I did call Plano myself and talked to [Director of Policy and Government Relations] Andrew Fortune. They need to get their stuff working. 'B****ing and yelling from the highest mountain isn’t going to solve the problem. They need to fix their infrastructure.' The Dallas official added there were other conversations that happened in executive session regarding the matter, but she couldn't speak about them publicly. The latest spill happened March 14 when a valve at a Plano waste water facility failed, according to Dallas Morning News . It flooded the station and overflowed into a creek that empties in White Rock Lake- some 30 miles south. For 38 hours, brown water gushed into the lake, with an estimated 500 gallons of sewage per minute flowing in. A waste water treatment plant in Plano has repeatedly been the source of sewage leaks into a lake downstream in Dallas White Rock Lake is a popular outdoor venue in East Dallas, surrounded by multi-million dollar homes When the water was tested on March 21, high levels of E. coli were still detected, although it wasn't clear how bad the contamination was. Water sports and other recreational activities were suspended until a clean-up effort or chlorine tablets and clean waster were added to the lake to return the water to safe levels. It's unclear whether the City of Plano has been fined for this or any of its previous sewer spills. In November 2021 more than 320,000 gallons of sewage spilled into the creek after a storm damaged a sewage line. In June 2018, recreational activities at White Rock Lake were also suspended after 1 million gallons of feces water escaped into the lake-- blamed on a broken pipe in Plano. In that case, the contractor breaking the pipe was fine $7,500, according to the local paper. For its part, the City of Plano claims it is replacing old sewer pipes and making improvements to facilities. After sewage leaks into White Rock Lake, outdoor recreational activities have been suspended until water levels are safe E.Coli Texas Share or comment on this article: Texas city at war with nearby small town that's been dumping sewage into popular tourist lake for seven years e-mail Add comment",

        "content": "Time is running out to find survivors of a huge landslide that buried many hundreds of people in a remote Papua New Guinea village as Australia prepares a $2.5 million aid package to assist. PNG's National Disaster Centre said more than 2000 people had been buried alive by Friday's landslide in remote Enga province. Australia will send technical experts and $2.5 million in initial aid to PNG as the death toll continues to rise following the catastrophic landslide. Under the Australian aid package experts will provide incident management assistance, support geo-hazard assessments and help early recovery efforts, with the Australian Defence Force also assisting. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"As a close neighbour and friend, we will be doing all we can to provide support,\" Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said in a statement late on Monday. Treacherous terrain in the region and difficulty getting in aid has hampered rescue efforts, raising fears few survivors will be found. Australia is ready to consider additional support beyond Monday's announcement, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. \"(This) package will assist the urgent needs of those affected by this devastating landslide,\" she said. The head of the International Organisation for Migration in PNG Serhan Aktoprak said the conditions on the ground were hampering rescue and aid efforts. Rocks were still falling from the mountain, soil was cracking and water was flowing under the debris. \"We're just hoping that in the remaining short window of time that we have, we can at least contribute to the relief efforts in saving some more lives,\" Mr Aktoprak said. \"But unfortunately, (time) is not on our side.\" Mr Marles said Australia would continue to work with PNG officials as to how best to deliver aid. A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the reported loss of hundreds of lives. \"He extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and expresses his solidarity with the people and government of Papua New Guinea,\" the spokesperson said. \"The United Nations and its partners are supporting the government's response efforts.",

        "description": "Opportunities to break the cycle of violence against women and children will be considered by a new panel of experts from a range of relevant fields.",
        "content": "A rapid-fire probe into gendered-violence prevention has been launched following a sharp rise in the number of women killed this year. A team of experts on gender-based violence, social policy, diversity and inclusion, men's mental health and the justice system has been assembled to offer practical advice to the federal government. The first part of the research will be completed by the end of June. A number of high-profile cases involving women who were killed by men they knew has sparked public outcry and put the government under pressure to do more. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth said one life lost to intimate partner homicide was one too many. \"In order to reach our shared goal of ending violence against women and children in one generation we must have a considered focus on perpetrator intervention and prevention activities,\" she said in a statement. Labor has promised to end violence against women and children in one generation. The newly-assembled panel will consider all opportunities to intervene and prevent incidents, including \"stronger accountability and consequences for people who choose to use violence\". Shifting attitudes and accelerating that process will also be investigated. Australia's Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner Micaela Cronin, Commonwealth Office for Women executive director Padma Raman and Department of Social Services secretary Ray Griggs will co-convene the panel. Leigh Gassner, assistant commissioner at Victoria Police, will also be on the panel, as will journalist and coercive control educator Jess Hill, along with other experts from relevant fields. In Australia, one-in-five women and one-in-16 men have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. Women were most likely to experience harm at the hands of an intimate partner. National cabinet held an emergency meeting earlier in May on domestic violence prevention. Following the meeting, the government pledged more than $900 million to make permanent a program to provide one-off $5000 payments to women fleeing violence. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14",

        "description": "The mother of a schoolgirl whose body was found inside a barrel with gunshot wounds will testify for a second day in the murder trial of her former partner.",
        "content": "Kallista Mutten could face claims that she shot her own daughter Charlise as she continues giving evidence in the murder trial of her former partner. Justin Stein's trial continues in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday with Ms Mutten returning for a second day of testimony. Stein, 33, has pleaded not guilty to murdering nine-year-old Charlise, claiming he witnessed Ms Mutten shoot her own daughter. Charlise's body was found by police in a barrel by the Blue Mountains' Colo River on January 18, 2022 with gunshot wounds to her face and back. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Following a full day of evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten will now face cross-examination by Stein's lawyer, Carolyn Davenport SC. The court heard last week that following his arrest, Stein told a corrections officer he was traumatised after seeing Ms Mutten shoot the girl. \"I heard a shot and then I heard her screaming out for me. Then I ran back and she shot her again,\" Stein said, according to the officer. Ms Davenport told the jury during her opening address that it would become apparent Ms Mutten, not Stein, had motive to kill the girl. At the time of her death, Charlise had been visiting her mother and Stein over the Christmas holidays from Tweed Heads, where she lived full-time with her grandparents. During the visit, the group spent their time between a Mount Wilson property owned by Stein's mother, and a caravan at the Riviera Ski Park about a 90-minute drive away. The trial heard earlier from neighbours of the Mount Wilson property who said they heard conversations regarding Charlise's parental custody which hinted at plans not to send her back to Queensland. One neighbour had previously attended a dinner with his wife and mother-in-law where Stein, his mother, Charlise and her mother were also present. \"(Stein) said that if anything happened and the child didn't go back to Queensland that he would end up in prison again,\" the neighbour said. During her evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten told the trial she saw her daughter for the last time on January 11, when the nine-year-old travelled alone to spend the night with Stein at Mount Wilson while she remained at the caravan park. She said the following day Stein told her he left Charlise in the care of an auctioneer who was working at the Blue Mountains property where they were staying. Stein claimed Charlise had been vomiting and was too unwell to travel, and that she was in good hands because the woman was a mother of three and \"practically a nurse\", the court was told. Stein later said he believed the woman was not who she said she was and that Charlise may have taken by former associates from his criminal past. \"I said, 'we should go to police',\" Ms Mutten told the court through tears. \"He said, 'no, because if you ring the police they will kill her'.\" On January 13, while phone data tracked Stein allegedly travelling to three boat ramps across Sydney and eventually the exact location where Charlise's body was found, Ms Mutten believed he was \"going to war\" to find her daughter, the court heard. \"Justin said he's gonna go to war and go to places that he might think that she might be and go look for her and get her,\" Ms Mutten said. Later, she said, \"Justin had called me and said that he 'badly hurt' the man that was in the house (where) he thought Charlise was ... and stabbed him\". When he returned in the early hours of the next day, Ms Mutten says Stein told her, \"It's not them, you can call the police in the morning\". Ms Mutten called police to report her daughter missing shortly after 8am the next morning.",

        "content": "Prey Veng Football Club, a Cambodian Premier League (CPL) member, officially announced on Monday that it has decided to dissolve the club and will no longer participate in football tournaments due to financial issues. There have been better days than this for Cambodian football fans and for football development in Cambodia with the unfortunate news that Prey Veng is withdrawing from CPL competition. The reason that the club is ending its run is an all too common story in Cambodia: the club does not possess enough financial resources to continue operations, leaving it with no choice except to dissolve. “The club has chosen to discontinue participation in football events since we recognise that our financial resources are far insufficient to meet our requirements. With this, we also ask to remove our membership from the Football Federation of Cambodia (FFC) and dissolve the club from now on,” the club said in an official statement. Prey Veng fans expressed their sadness at the news, and they are urging sponsors and others with substantial assets to help out the club to that it may re-enter the league. Satoshi Saito, previous CEO of the CPL, said during a meeting with journalists in September last year that the Cambodian football league is experiencing issues, and pointed out that the CPL is not as competitive as leagues in neighbouring countries like Thailand and Vietnam. This makes it more difficult to attract serious investment, he said. He suggested that several improvements must be made to the league to make it more interesting to football fans. One of them is to strengthen the league’s level of competition, its infrastructure, and promotion to a larger audience. By doing so, CPL teams can attract more spectators to the stadium, thereby encouraging sponsors to invest in football during a time when the league is receiving more attention than ever. Prey Veng is one of two clubs promoted from Cambodian League 2 (CL2) to the CPL for the 2023-2024 season. This season, Prey Veng finished eighth out of the ten league clubs. Puth Thyda, president of the Boeung Ket Football Club, another CPL member, revealed in an interview with reporters in March of this year, that her club is among those experiencing financial difficulties. She admitted that she considered dissolving the club due to the difficulty of finding sponsors to fund the team. “We love football and want to continue operating our club, but it is difficult to obtain sponsors to finance the team. There are few investors interested in financing Cambodian football clubs. It’s hard,” she said. Local media has reported that Prey Veng FC players will try to further their football careers with other local clubs.",

        "description": "As Americans commemorate the sacrifices of wars past, Ukrainians are serving, donating, volunteering and dying now.",
        "content": "It looks like a video shot with a phone from an apartment window. The camera pans a line of cars stopped on the roadway below, and it takes a minute to understand what we’re looking at. Then a cortege comes into view : about 50 people walking slowly behind a coffin draped with the Ukrainian flag. When the shot widens, we see that traffic traveling in the other direction on the eight-lane road has come to a halt, and people have gotten out of their cars. A few are standing solemnly as the funeral passes; most are kneeling on the asphalt, heads bowed in respect. By the time I see the social media post, “The funeral of a fallen defender in Kyiv today,” nearly a thousand viewers have reacted with comments or emojis. Among the most common: Heroyam slava — glory to the heroes. Memorial Day in the U.S. was set aside to honor those who fell in the Civil War. Now Americans play “Taps” and put flowers on graves of those who died in many wars, all in the past. Here in Ukraine, people can only dream of the day when the flag-draped funerals have ended and battles are distant memories commemorated by a nation at peace. More than two years after the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukrainians are tired. The war hasn’t been going well. Many of Ukraine’s friends abroad, particularly in the U.S., appear to be losing interest. According to a March 2024 survey, more than two-thirds of Ukrainians have a close friend or relative who is serving or has served at the front, and with the death toll reaching into the tens of thousands, all too many have lost someone. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the ardor and enthusiasm of 2022 have faded. The most conspicuous sign: In contrast to the first days of the war, when thousands rushed to recruitment centers and waited, often more than 12 hours, for a gun and a uniform, today the army is struggling to enlist fresh fighters , and the troops are suffering for it. It’s one of Russia’s main advantages on the battlefield. Still, even now, exhausted and disheartened as many are, Ukrainians have not lost their respect for sacrifice and honor. On the contrary, it seems to come up one way or another in almost every conversation. Some of my friends, civilians who have not served, argue that we’re all sacrificing just by remaining in the country. Nearly 6.4 million Ukrainians, some 16% of the population, remain abroad, after all, and those still here pay some price every day. “I could be in graduate school in Europe,” said one young man, a civil servant who doesn’t want to be named. “Instead, I’m sitting in the dark, with no running water and no way to heat food, waiting for the next air alert — a siren warning that a ballistic missile is heading my way.” Others dispute that civilian life requires heroism. “The only people sacrificing are those who are risking — and giving — their lives,” economic researcher Alvina Seliutina, 33, insists. “I can’t compare myself to them.” Still, there’s no mistaking her sense of duty. “It’s my country, it’s my family. You don’t abandon your family just because times are tough.” In fact, a recent poll suggests, 83% of Ukrainians are still donating regularly or volunteering, mostly to help the armed forces. Every business seems to have a fund; every social media channel solicits daily. Even students find ways to give. One tries to spare a few hryvnia every time he’s asked. “I don’t want to be the kind of person who ever ignores a fundraising request,” he tells me. Others give on a schedule. One volunteers at a clinic every third weekend; another shells out several thousand dollars every other month to pay for a drone for a friend at the front. Soldiers have mixed views, some more bitter than others, about the growing reluctance to enlist. Valery Shyrokov, 47, an infantryman and mortar gunner who volunteered in 2022 and served, among other places, in the bloody battle for Bakhmut, uses the word “disappointed,” but his manner suggests something far stronger. “I no longer speak to friends who haven’t served,” he tells me. “I can’t stand to be around them.” Yevhen Shramkov, 46, recently wounded in the fighting near Chasiv Yar, is more baffled than angry. “I’m not in the habit of judging other people,” he explains on a Zoom call from the hospital where he is recovering. “But I don’t understand those sitting it out. It’s like passing someone in the street who’s injured or endangered. Who doesn’t stop to help?” He expects to spend another month in the hospital and then head back to the front to join his unit. Both those who are serving and those who aren’t think that if the war were going better, more men would be enlisting. “If we had enough ammunition, if we felt the West were standing by us, things would be different,” one friend explained. “No one wants to be a meat shield for Europe. No one wants to die if we can’t win.” Maybe, maybe not. But the mood is nothing like in the U.S. in the Vietnam era or Europe at the end World War I. Elite units that promise skilled commanders and adequate training have no trouble recruiting. The legendary Azov Battalion is said to attract more applicants than it can accept. And it isn’t hard to sense the guilt, conscious or unconscious, that eats at most of my male friends who aren’t serving. “We know what the fight’s about,” my friend the civil servant reminded me. “Whatever sacrifice they’re making, however big or small, everybody understands why. Our lives are at stake and our existence as free Ukrainians.” Tamar Jacoby is the Kyiv-based director of the Progressive Policy Institute’s New Ukraine Project.",

        "description": "A new study has found that the common over-the-counter painkiller paracetamol does not cause in ADHD in children, a fear that has led many pregnant mums-to-be to worry needlessly, writes Dr Miriam Stoppard",
        "content": "When a woman is pregnant , she instinctively wants to protect her unborn baby from any harm and often refuses to take even the most ­commonly used over-the-counter drugs, such as paracetamol. Well, now pregnant mums can rest easy and take that painkiller. A study has given paracetamol a virtually clean bill of health . This new work is doubly important as it scotches the rumours that paracetamol causes autism and ADHD in the unborn babies of mothers who take it. Mums-to-be should now be freed of those anxieties, as should doctors. The study by Drexel University in ­Philadelphia, US, is the largest ever ­undertaken on paracetamol use, and was done in collaboration with the Karolinska Institute in ­Stockholm, Sweden. Together, they carried out the most robust risk analysis on giving birth to children with autism, ADHD or ­intellectual disability. Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress The strength of the study lies in the fact comparisons were made between siblings, where one baby had been exposed to paracetamol in the womb because the mum took it, and the other had not. The study encompassed data from 186,000 children whose mothers were prescribed paracetamol during pregnancy. “By comparing siblings, we can control for important family factors,” says Brian Lee, an associate professor at Drexel University and co-author of the study. During its follow-up, which spanned up to 26 years, the researchers saw a slight increase in the prevalence of autism, ADHD and intellectual disability in the entire population. So this study is important as it ­distinguished between trends in the general population and trends in the specific group of mums-to-be who take paracetamol. But when siblings exposed and unexposed to paracetamol in utero were compared, the researchers found no differences. This is very good news. “We did not see any increased risk of ADHD, autism or ­intellectual disability in the children that could be attributed to paracetamol use during pregnancy”, says Renee Gardner, associate professor of ­epidemiology and researcher at the Department of Global Public Health at Karolinska Institute, and co-author of the study. “We hope that our findings can ­reassure parents-to-be who are faced with the choice of whether or not to use paracetamol during pregnancy. “However, you should always listen to your doctor’s assessment of whether or not the medication is safe in each individual case,” she adds. I feel sure this is reassuring news for mums-to-be, midwives, health visitors and doctors. Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather'",

The aptly-named The Haven is one of just a handful of homes on a secluded headland, hidden out of sight and only accessible by foot. The five-bedroom property is on Hawks Point, on the edge of Carbis Bay in Cornwall and boasts an incredible uninterrupted sea view . It looks down on Porthkidney Sands, one of Cornwall's prettiest and most unspoilt beaches, just a five-minute walk away down a coastal path. The current owners knocked down the original old structure and built the existing property in 2011. An idyllic coastal home in Cornwall has gone on the market for £2.5million The five-bedroom property is on Hawks Point, on the edge of Carbis Bay in Cornwall It looks down on Porthkidney Sands, one of Cornwall's prettiest and most unspoilt beaches The property comes with breathtaking views, close access to nearby beaches and a sea-facing terrace complete with a hot tub The bedrooms look out onto the picturesque coast of Carbis Bay, Cornwall They used it as a family holiday home and also made a good income renting it out but have decided to sell. The property has 2,296 sq ft of accommodation with a reception hall, open plan kitchen/dining/sitting room, bedroom, bathroom and utility room on the ground floor and four more bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms, on the first floor. There is a sea-facing terrace off the main living space and a hot tub to enjoy the views from. Off two of the bedrooms is a decked balcony which agents Lillicrap Chilcott says has some of the finest coastal views in Cornwall. The breathtaking views span the entirety of St Ives Ba, stretching to Hayle Estuary and along the coast to Godrevy and its famous lighthouse. Porthkidney Sands is a beautiful and unspoilt tidal beach, popular with surfers and dog walkers but remains fairly quiet even in the height of summer due to its relative inaccessibility - there are no near car parks and its sole access is from the coastal footpath. Carbis Bay is a popular area on the outskirts of St Ives and the beach there, renowned for water sports, was the site of the 2021 G7 Summit. Porthkidney Sands is a relatively quiet and unspoilt cove in Cornwall, remaining tranquil even in the height of summer thanks to low accessibility The spacious and airy home has an open plan kitchen, dining room and living space The 'magical property' sits almost within touching distance of the water and has an other-worldly feel Aptly named The Haven, the home is one of just a handful situated on the secluded headland Mark Bracey, from Lillicrap Chilcott, said: 'This house is in a magical setting with truly world class panoramic views. 'It sits out on a promontory above Porthkidney Sands beach and there are about half a dozen properties that can only be accessed on foot. 'That access might mean it is not likely to be someone's first home, but as a holiday home it is ideal. It feels like you are really in a different world. 'It is like no other house I have been to. You hear nothing but birdsong and the waves crashing below. 'Porthkidney is one of the most unspoilt beaches in Cornwall and one of the most beautiful, and it does not get too busy even in summer due to its remote position away from roads. 'The Carbis Bay branch line that takes you into St Ives is a short walk away. If you want the hustle and bustle it's just a short distance away but you can step out of that into this blissful enclave for peace and tranquillity. 'The view and the outlook are second to none. You have a private path that joins up to the coastal path and it's just a couple hundred steps and you're down on the beach within a few minutes.'

He was 71. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

The Israeli attack followed Hamas’s first rocket attack on Tel Aviv in months. As per Hamas health authorities, 35 people and two senior Hamas commanders were killed in Israel’s airstrikes injuring many more. Meanwhile, the Israel Defence Forces said the intelligence-based targeted strike had killed Yassin Rabia, the Hamas commander of the West Bank and Khaled Najjar, another senior member of the unit. In 2001 and 2002, Rabia committed several deadly attacks killing Israeli soldiers while Najjar was involved in commanding shooting attacks and other terror activities in the West Bank. He carried out several attacks during 2001 and 2003 killing Israeli citizens and soldiers. Najjar was also involved in funding Hamas terror activities, said the IDF.",

        "content": "There was a heavy presence of security personnel, including policemen, soldiers, and officials of the Department of State Services, among others, on Saturday at the Gidan Sarki Nasarawa, which is home to the dethroned Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, Sunday PRIMANEWS can confirm. One of our correspondents, who monitored the development, also sighted some soldiers at the residence of the current Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi II; the Kano State Government House and some strategic places within the metropolis as part of efforts to beef up security following the tussle for power in the emirate. Following a new law repealing four emirates earlier created by a former governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, Governor Abba Yusuf of Kano installed Sanusi as the 16th Emir of the state. Sanusi had in 2020 been dethroned by Ganduje over allegations of corruption and other allegations. He was replaced by Bayero, who was enthroned as the 15th Emir of Kano. Ganduje also appointed Emirs for each of the five Emirates, but the controversial splitting of the ancient Kano Emirate into five domains resulted in widespread criticism across the state. Following his dethronement in 2020, Sanusi found himself at the centre of a contentious power struggle but his eventual reinstatement came alive on Friday, May 24, 2024, when the House of Assembly repealed the law signed by the former governor on December 5, 2019. The new law abrogated the establishment of the five new emirates in the state and reverted to the former status of a single Emir in Kano, thereby removing all the current Emirs except for the central Emir of Kano. Governor Yusuf, upon signing the law, gave all the Emirs affected by the law 48 hours to vacate their palaces and hand them over to the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. The governor subsequently announced the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi, whom Ganduje had deposed in 2020 as Emir of Kano. Yusuf said, “By the powers conferred on me by the Kano Emirate Council Law of 1984 and 2024, and supported by the recommendation of the kingmakers, I have the singular pleasure of confirming the reappointment of Muhammadu Sanusi II as the Emir of Kano and the head of the Kano Emirate Council.” Meanwhile, after receiving his reappointment letter on Friday, Sanusi led the Jumat prayers at the Government House, Kano, and returned to the palace early Saturday. A viral video sighted by one of our correspondents showed the moment he was driven back to the palace in a convoy. He was accompanied by the governor, his deputy, Aminu Abdussalam, and other government officials. However, his reinstatement heightened tension within the state as the deposed Emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, whose whereabouts were unknown after the governor deposed him on Thursday, also returned to Kano on Saturday. After his dethronment, a deployment of soldiers arrived at his mini-palace on Thursday. It was reported that other dethroned Emirs – Alhaji Nasir Ado Bayero (Bichi), Alhaji Kabiru Muhammad Inuwa (Rano), Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar II (Karaye), and Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim Abdulkadir (Gaya), complied with the directive. Meanwhile, Bayero’s aircraft landed at the Aminu Kano International Airport on Saturday at 4:30 am, where he was immediately greeted by supporters. He then urged residents to maintain law and order, pledged to obey the position of the law, and called on appropriate authority to deliver justice in the matter, saying justice would prevail. He said, “I call on the people to remain law-abiding while awaiting the outcome of the legal process in this tussle. We call on the authorities to do justice in this matter. Kano is a very influential state in Nigeria. Whatever affects Kano affects Nigeria. “May peace reign in Kano. We pray for Allah to bless Kano with responsible and just leaders. Justice is the way to go on every issue. There will be justice. Nobody is above the law. We will accept whatever the law says. I appreciate all the people who have shown concern. As I said, justice will take its course. We will keep on praying for peace in Kano State. May Allah the Almighty protect us.” ‘Arrest Bayero’ But, in a statement on Saturday by the Director-General, Media and Publicity, Government House, Kano, Sanusi Tofa, the governor ordered the immediate arrest of the deposed monarch for allegedly creating tension in the state. The statement partly read, “As the Chief Security Officer of the state, His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Kano State, Alhaji Abba Kabir Yusuf, has directed the Commissioner of Police to arrest the deposed Emir with immediate effect for disturbing public peace and attempting to destroy the relative peace the state enjoys.” Kano CP speaks Although no official statement has been given regarding the reason for the heavy presence of security operatives, an impeccable security source told one of our correspondents that the men were deployed by the Inspector General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, to the three places to enhance security. According to the source, the deployment of security personnel to all the places was necessary to prevent aggrieved supporters of the two monarchs from attacking one another other. One of our correspondents monitoring the situation gathered that despite the ongoing debacle, the ancient city remained calm as residents continued to go about with their normal and lawful businesses. Meanwhile, the governor and other top officials were still with Emir Sanusi at the main palace while the deposed Emir remained in the Nasarawa palace. Closed-door meeting Earlier in the day, Governor Yusuf and Sanusi had a closed-door meeting with top security chiefs in the state. The top security chiefs who also had similar meetings with the deposed monarch included the Commissioner of Police, the Director of the DSS, the Army Brigade Commander, and the NSCDC commander at the mini palace in the Nasarawa area of the state. When contacted to give insight on the agenda of the meeting, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Abdullahi Haruna, declined to speak. He, however, said the deployment of security agents was a normal security deployment. “The deployment of the security personnel is all over the state and it’s meant to enhance security given the current happenings,” Haruna said. ‘No breakdown on law, order’ Meanwhile, security agencies in the state had promised to prevent a breakdown of law and order as the safety and security of all the residents in the state remain sacrosanct. The Commissioner of Police, Usaini Gumel, in a joint security press conference at the command’s headquarters in Bompai Kano, on Saturday, said security agencies would enforce the court order restraining the state government from dissolving five newly created emirates in the state. Gumel said, “We are calling on members of the public to know that the police in the state are working together with the military and other security agencies and are at full capacity for providing adequate security to everyone as we are committed to carrying out our statutory duties as provided by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Atiku sues for peace Meanwhile, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has said the action of the Federal Government in deploying soldiers in Kano in the tussle over the throne of the ancient city is an “upset to the peace and security of the state, and a breach of the constitution”. He said the Kano State House of Assembly passed the amended Kano State Emirate Council (Repeal) Bill (2024) in consonance with the provision of Section 4 of the Constitution 1999 (as Amended). “Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf’s signature on the bill repealed the 2019 version which balkanised the ancient Kano Emirate into five. The foregoing circumstances happened within the confines of the law and in compliance with the powers conferred on the Governor as provided by Section 5(2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended; and also in consultation with the Kingmakers of Kano, reappointed Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (also known as Muhammadu Sanusi II) as the 16th Emir of Kano State and accordingly handed him a letter of appointment,” he said. Speaking in a statement by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, on Saturday, Atiku said the former Emir could not have made his way into the Nasarawa Palace without the support of the Federal Government, alleging that he did so with the support of the army and other security agencies in his company. “We wish to state unequivocally that if for any reason, law and order breaks down in Kano State, particularly Kano Municipal, the Federal Government should be held responsible for the act of providing security cover to the former Emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, to come back to Kano is an invitation to anarchy,” he wrote. NNPP fingers Ganduje Meanwhile, the New Nigeria People’s Party, on Saturday, accused supporters of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, who is a former governor of Kano State, of attempting to cause chaos in Kano to pave the way for a state of emergency. But Ganduje’s aide and the ruling APC described the immediate dissolution of the state’s four emirates and Thursday’s reinstatement of the 16th Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido, as a “vendetta mission”. The development comes in the wake of two demonstrations on Friday where protesters marched to the Aso Rock Villa and the National Assembly over Sanusi’s reinstatement. Speaking on the issue, the National Publicity Secretary of the NNPP, Ladipo Johnson, said the action of the NSA and the recent weird behaviour of the police showed that they were truly deploying federal might. He said, “It is not a surprise to us anymore as the police commissioner in Kano is beginning to say it is that court order he is following. That was why they used soldiers to take Ado Bayero to wherever they took him to. These people are the ones we believe want to cause a crisis in Kano.” Efforts to get the National Publicity of the APC, Felix Morka, to comment on the matter were unsuccessful. As of the time of filing this report, he had yet to respond to text messages sent to his line for clarification nor did he answer his phone calls when Sunday PRIMANEWS tried to reach him for a comment. Ganduje’s aide alleges coup But Ganduje’s Senior Special Assistant on Public Enlightenment, Chief Oliver Okpala, described the “palace coup” in Kano as a desperate move by the Kwankwasiyya movement and the governor to desecrate his principal’s legacies in the state. “Everybody knows that the government is a continuum. When Ganduje was in power, we all know he did his best and the people of Kano State can testify to that. He left some legacies that are yet to be matched by anybody. “What Ganduje has done in Kano cannot be destroyed overnight by political malice from any quarter. This is because what he left in Kano are monumental legacies,” he said. The APC National Director of Publicity, Bala Ibrahim, also shared Okpala’s sentiments. Ibrahim said he found it surprising that it was the same NNPP government that used to cry that is now ‘approbating and reprobating’ on the issue of Kano emirate. “When it suits them, they obey the court. When it doesn’t, they will disobey. They are forgetting the fact that they are products of a court order. No problem. This is the beauty of democracy though,” he said. When prodded to explain why Aminu Bayero is refusing to let go of the throne after Sanusi’s reinstatement, the APC publicity director believed his action was justified because he has not been officially dethroned. Ibrahim also knocked Governor Yusuf for rushing to issue the former Central Bank of Nigeria governor a reinstatement letter instead of borrowing a leaf from Ganduje’s diplomacy. The APC spokesman also faulted the Kano government over his claim that the judge issued the ex parte order from the United States. Ibrahim said argued that a court order can be secured from a serving judge even outside the courtroom. Don’t resort to self-help The Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, Kano State chapter, Sagir Gezawa, has begged all parties involved in the matter not to resort to self-help. Gezawa emphasised the constitutional duty of state assemblies to legislate and the governor’s prerogative to assent to such laws. According to the NBA, the implementation of law falls under the state’s apparatus and enforcement by a competent court of law once it is assented to by the governor. He also said that it is within the purview of courts to interpret such law to be in tandem with other existing laws or the Constitution. Gezawa urged NBA members to approach courts with competent jurisdiction responsibly. “Anyone found disobeying a court order must be proved to have been notified of its existence through the issuance of Form 48 and subsequently Form 49, as per the Sheriff and Civil Processes Act and various state laws,” Gezawa said. ‘Let peace reign’ The forum of Islamic clergy in Kano, Ulama, has urged President Bola Tinubu to intervene and prevent any actions that may lead to a disruption of law and order in the state. In a statement signed by 18 members of the Ulama, the clergies expressed their concerns regarding the ongoing dispute over the monarchy. The Ulama said, “Kano State is one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria despite its political complexity. The recent happenings in the Emirate if not carefully handled could escalate and degenerate into chaos. “President Bola Ahmed Tinubu must take all necessary steps to maintain peace in the State. Mr President as the leader of the nation should not allow the contest for a royal stool to degenerate into violence. We are calling on Mr President to allow the people of Kano State to resolve these issues amicably without the use of any force and loss of lives. They also maintained that the state government needed the cooperation and support of the Federal Government. Additional reports by Solomon Odeniyi and Daniel Ayantoye",

Acknowledging that his grief was not the same as that of families who lost loved ones during the course of their military service, Joe Biden told those in the audience that he understood \"how hard it can be to reopen that black hole in the middle of your chest\" whenever they remember them. \"As it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, still sharp, still clear,\" he said Monday. Beau Biden, a former Delaware state attorney general who reached the rank of major in the Judge Advocate General's Corps before he died from brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46, was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for his yearlong service in Iraq . Joe Biden has repeated that his son's cancer was caused by his exposure to toxic burn pits while he was abroad. Biden also indirectly alluded to former President Donald Trump with a statement of the importance of democracy and respecting those who serve or have served. \"We gather at this sacred place for this solemn moment to remember, to honor, the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives to this nation,\" he said. \"Each one bound by a common commitment, not to a place, not to a person, not to a president, but to an idea unlike any idea in human history: the idea of the United States.\" Earlier Monday, Biden hosted a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leadership, veterans, and Gold Star family members before taking part in the wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with Vice President Kamala Harris , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin , and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Q. Brown, Jr . \"Thanks to our fallen, the bedrock of our liberty remains unshaken,\" Brown said during the event at the nearby Memorial Amphitheater. \"It's up to us to further the cause for which our fallen died and uphold the freedoms for which they fought.\" \"In the end, America's greatest strategic asset will always be our people,\" Austin said. \"So let us always remember our fallen heroes and let us always strive to defend the democracy, [for] which they fought and die.

        "content": "Business in Cameroon | Fitch Ratings maintained Cameroon’s long-term foreign currency rating at “B” in its recent assessment published on May 17, 2024. This decision reflects a diversified regional economy and robust GDP growth. However, Fitch has downgraded the outlook from stable to negative. The agency said the state debt of Cameroon, including guarantees, arrears, and debts of the National Refining Company (Sonara), is expected to decrease to 39.2% of GDP by 2025, down from 43.2% of GDP at the end of 2023. This performance, significantly below the median expected “B” rating of 52.3%, is attributed to robust nominal GDP growth and low fiscal deficits. Despite these positive aspects, Fitch highlighted ongoing debt management issues. Cameroon temporarily accumulated a moderate amount of external arrears to the European Investment Bank (EIB) in August and September 2023, before settling all external arrears in a matter of days. This is a further non-compliance with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) target of no external arrears after 0.1% of GDP in 2022 and 0.2% of GDP in the first half of 2023, according to the agency. Persistent weaknesses in public finance management are also underscored by Fitch, with poor cash management and underestimated expenditures, notably fuel subsidies and unplanned security expenses, leading to off-budget expenditures and the accumulation of previous arrears. Although the stock of domestic arrears decreased to 0.6% in 2023 from 0.7% of GDP in 2022, it increased to 1.6% by the end of March 2024. Furthermore, Fitch noted that the government’s debt deficit narrowed to 0.6% in 2023 based on commitments, down from 1.1% of GDP in 2022, due to higher revenues, lower capital expenditure execution, and the deferral of fuel subsidies (0.4% of GDP) to 2024. On a cash basis, Fitch estimated that the deficit decreased to 0.4% of GDP in 2023 from 1.2% in 2022, with net arrears amounting to 0.2% of GDP. The agency forecasted that Cameroon’s financing needs will rise to 5.2% of GDP in 2024 and 4.6% in 2025, up from 4.3% in 2023, due to higher cash deficits. External debt amortization will average 1.9% of GDP in 2024 and 2025, including an annual Eurobond payment of 0.1% of GDP. IMF programs will provide access to financing and support reform efforts. Fitch also forecasts that the current account deficit will average 3.9% of GDP in 2024, compared to an estimated 4.0% in 2023. In political terms, the uncertainty surrounding the next presidential elections scheduled for 2025 contributes to the negative outlook. President Paul Biya, re-elected in 2018 for a seventh term, could run again, increasing political risk in an already tense political climate, according to the rating agency. Despite these challenges, Cameroon is showing resilient economic growth, with GDP growth forecasts of 3.9% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025, driven by non-oil sectors such as agriculture, forestry, transport and energy infrastructure. By maintaining Cameroon’s “B” rating with a negative outlook, Fitch Ratings acknowledged both the country’s strengths and challenges. This decision comes amid varied positions taken by other rating agencies. In a recent analysis, Moody’s decided to maintain a harsh rating (Caa) for Cameroon, despite projections of debt stability until 2027. On the other hand, Standard & Poor’s recently upgraded Cameroon’s rating from CCC+ (high risk) to B- (highly speculative) with stable outlooks.",

        "content": "NEW YORK -- Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton was surrounded by his family, according to the statement. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. Walton originally joined ESPN in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009.. \"But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" --- Information from the NBA, ESPN and the Associated Press",

Insights into all the reactions that have since come to light, regarding Prince Harry’s absence from the upcoming wedding have been shared by a pal. This pal in question spoke to The Times and was quoted saying, “‘It’s incredibly sad it has come to this. Hugh is one of the very few close friends of William and Harry who has maintained strong bonds... with both.” In reference to this admission Ms Rebecca English also stepped forward with her own take to the matter. She dished over everything in one of her pieces for The Daily Mai land wrote, “It’s like a game of Twister, a tangled web of turbulent toffs that has sadly been pulled apart.” “I imagine William, though outwardly beaming, will actually feel a great deal of sadness that such a happy day cannot be shared. Catherine will not be by his side, as she continues her recovery from surgery.”",

According to Page Six , the fight broke out last Friday around 5 a.m when Travis and Alexander’s friend Tyga were both in the DJ booth at the same time. Richie pulled out the mic and gave a shout out to Tyga and Alexander saying, “We got T-Raww and A.E in the house.” This didn’t sit well with Travis who returned to the stage, allegedly pushing Alexander which prompted him to drag Travis as well. Recently, the couple was seen putting on a united front while strolling around Monaco after arriving via helicopter from St Tropez. Cher and Alexander were also seen entering the celeb favorite hotspot Club 55. Their appearance also comes after the legendary singer said that she’s working on new music with her beau. Cher told a reporter at the 2024 Cannes Festival, “He and I are gonna start a new album. We haven't started yet; he's going to produce it.”",

        "content": "Social media is amassed with funny and viral videos showing how cats react to cucumbers after seeing them suddenly near them while eating. A number of clips show that the owner of cats subtly places a cucumber when their pet is eating. After suddenly seeing a cucumber near them, cats jump and go far away, making it funny for the onlookers. An expert in animal behaviour Jill Goldman told while speaking with the National Geographic Channel that the cucumbers were triggering the cats' natural startle reflexes, reported Independent . She said while explaining cats' terrifying reaction: \"With a startle response, a cat will often try to get out of there as quickly as possible and then reassess from a distance.\" Pam Johnson-Bennett, who is the author of Think Like a Cat was also quoted by the publication that placing cucumbers near where cats eat may confuse the cats further because they often associate those areas with safety and security. Goldman added that it was also possible cats may associate the cucumber with snakes, which can be deadly predators. \"If you cause stress to an animal that's probably not a good thing,\" Goldman stated.",

        "content": "Cambodia’s national junior team won fourteen medals, including four silver and ten bronze, at the Badminton Asia SEA Regional Junior Championship 2024, which took place last Wednesday through Sunday in Laos. The Cambodia Badminton Federation sent four male and four female players along with two coaches to the tournament. Lieutenant General Cheam Sophea, the secretary general of the Cambodia Badminton Federation, told reporters that the Cambodia U17 team won two silver and four bronze medals, and the U15 team won one silver and five bronze medals. He added that in the Mix Team Event, which comprised both U15 and U17 teams, Cambodia earned one silver and one bronze medal. The SEA Regional Junior Championship 2024 saw five countries compete in the U15 and U17 categories: Laos, Timor-Leste, Myanmar, Brunei and Cambodia. Prime Minister Hun Manet expressed his admiration to the Cambodian national team following their triumph. However, the federation was disappointed, since it failed to achieve its goal to win two gold medals in the competition. Despite this, it believes the event was a great step forward for young Cambodian players eager to gain sporting experience. “Our athletes are inexperienced and young, and it was their first time competing on the international stage. So, we believe that it is an incredible chance for them to learn and improve themselves to become better in the future,” the secretary-general said. This was the Cambodian badminton team’s second appearance in the SEA Junior Championship tournament. The national team made their international debut in Cambodia last year, capturing one gold, six silver and seven bronze medals to finish second in the standings. The medal haul in Laos shows yet more progress for the development of badminton in Cambodia. The country made history at the SEA Games, winning its first gold medal ever in mixed-team badminton. The federation has said that it intends to promote the sport to a bigger national audience while at the same time fostering more young talent to join the national squad in preparation for major future competitions. The federation announced it will bid to host the Badminton Asia SEA Regional Junior Championship again next year. Through the tournament, the federation hopes to raise the profile of badminton – especially among prospective young athletes. With increasing numbers of people playing, badminton is becoming popular in the Kingdom, both as a hobby and professionally.",

        "content": "Reacting sharply to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s accusations that the BJP is stealing the reservations of backward class, Dalits and tribals, Uttar Pradesh BJP President Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary said SP and INDI alliance leaders are always promoting religion-based reservations. Hitting out at SP and INDI alliance, Chaudhary said, “The leaders of Samajwadi Party and INDI alliance always talked about Muslim quota and they are promoting religion-based reservations wherever they form the government.” “When the election results come on June 4, you will not find Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi here. They will go to Bangkok or Thailand for vacation,” he further said. Speaking on the performance of the BJP in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, Chaudhary said, “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP is moving towards winning all the seats in Uttar Pradesh... BJP is winning all 80 seats. We will move ahead with the resolution of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India a developed nation.” Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP of stealing the reservations of backward class, Dalits, and tribes, adding that after June 4, politics of “negativity” will be over. “They (BJP) stole the reservation of backward class, Dalits and tribes...The ‘P’ in PDA means Purvanchal, progressive; NDA is negative...They do negative politics....The time of doing negative politics is over...They are against social justice, reservation, caste census, the happiness of farmers....They not only want to take the nation backward but also put the people of the country in poverty,” Akhilesh Yadav told reporters. Uttar Pradesh is voting in all seven phases of the Lok Sabha polls, the last phase of which is scheduled on June 1. The Congress is fighting the polls in partnership with the Samajwadi Party in the state and have a seat-sharing agreement with each other. As per the seat agreement between the Samajwadi Party and Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Congress is contesting on 17 seats and the Samajwadi Party has the remaining 63 seats in the electorally crucial state. In the 2019 general elections, the BJP emerged triumphant, securing 62 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, supplemented by two seats clinched by its ally Apna Dal (S). Mayawati’s BSP managed to secure 10 seats, while Akhilesh Yadav’s SP garnered five. Conversely, the Congress party secured only one seat. The election for 543 Lok Sabha seats will be held in seven phases starting April 19. The counting of the votes will be held on June 4",

        "content": "A filthy criminal threw faeces into the faces of two prison officers during a \"dirty protest\" in his jail cell. Michael Fitzimmons had smeared excrement across the walls and ceiling before blocking the sink and turning on the taps, flooding his cell with watery waste, which started to seep out onto the wing at HMP Northumberland , in March last year. When two prison officers, a man and a woman, spoke to Fitzimmons through an observation hatch in his cell door he threw bowls of the dirty water into their faces, with the male officer being hit in the eye. The court heard both were left \"stinking\" and in fear they may have been contaminated with disease that they could spread to their families. READ MORE: Road rage driver who bragged of 'street justice' convicted of manslaughter Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter Fitzimmons, 30, of no fixed address, refused to co-operate with the court process. He entered no pleas, refused to give instructions to legal representatives or attend for trial. He was convicted of two charges of administering poison or noxious substance and one of criminal damage after a trial that was held in his absence. At his sentence hearing, which he also refused to attend, Judge Robert Adams sentenced him to two-and-a-half years behind bars. The court heard he was serving a 29-month sentence for false imprisonment when he staged the \"protest\" and would have been released from that in December last year. Judge Adams said: \"He was in his cell and decided to stage a dirty protest. He smeared faeces over walls and ceiling and blocked the sink. The sink overflowed and the water mixed with faeces.\" The judge said the water covered the cell floor before it started to spread to other cells and prison staff were alerted. When two officers arrived at Fitzimmons' cell door they spoke to him through the hatch and put towels down to try and stem the flow of water. Fitzimmons told them he was worried he would lose his \"canteen\" rights, where inmates can buy items they need but he was told that was not the case. The court heard they had never had any issues with him before but during the conversation he used a bowl to scoop out contaminated water from the blocked sink and threw it at their faces. One of the officers said in a statement: \"This has got to be the worst kind of assault. It's disgusting and I should not have to put up with it.\" The court heard a maintenance crew was called out to deal with the damage caused. The court heard Fitzsimmons refuses to leave his cell on the segregation unit and sits in it all with no TV. He has refused a mental health assessment and Judge Adams said \"there are undoubtedly mental health issues\".",

        "content": "England captain Jos Buttler is set to miss their third T20I clash against Pakistan on Tuesday in Cardiff due to paternity leave. According to ESPNcricinfo, Buttler returned to his home in London after England went ahead in the series following their 23-run win against Pakistan in the second T20I on Saturday. Buttler and his wife are expecting a child very soon. On Monday he missed England’s afternoon training session in Cardiff ahead of the third T20I on Tuesday. He will likely miss the third T20I however, it is yet to be seen if he will be available for the final clash of the series at The Oval on Thursday. Buttler had previously indicated that he would be present during the birth of his child which has raised concerns over his availability in the group stage matches of the T20 World Cup. England’s T20 World Cup defence will begin against Scotland on June 4 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. They will then play group matches against Australia, Oman, and Namibia in Barbados and Antigua. England’s vice-captain, Moeen Ali last week gave his take on the significance of a possible leadership change. “Obviously if it happens, then it’s a great honour – as it always is. I’ll be fine. Nothing will change too much: it’s just taking over from what he’s doing and then when he comes back, he takes over,” Moeen said. “Hopefully, the baby comes at the right time where he doesn’t miss too many games. For me, it’s just whatever will happen, will happen. [Deputising] is not really difficult, to be honest with you, because we speak often, me and Jos. We talk about other things, the team, and all that. We’re on the same page anyway,” he added. Buttler was at his best during the second T20I against Pakistan with his 84-run blitz off 54 deliveries. His knock laid the foundation of England’s triumph in the second T20I. (ANI)",

        "content": "The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Monday, turned down the bail application filed by the detained President of the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Bello Bodejo. The Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore leader was arrested by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) for unlawfully establishing an ethnic militia group, Kungiya Zaman Lafiya to promote terrorism, has been in the custody of the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Abuja. He was arraigned in March on a three-count charge filed by the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), in which he was accused of violating the Terrorism (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022. He denied all the charges. Bodejo had, through his counsel, Dr. Ahmed Raji (SAN) pleaded with Justice Inyang Ekwo to admit his client to bail on various grounds ranging from ill health to fundamental rights. He asked the court for, “an order admitting the defendant to bail on liberal terms pending the hearing and determination of the charges preferred against him.” The senior lawyer predicated the bail request on the ground that Bodejo “suffers from grave ill-health and that the offences are bailable. Citing Section 36 of the Nigerian constitution, Raji said his client is presumed innocent until proven guilty adding that the charge against Bodejo did not disclose any crime against him. Contrary to government assertions, Raji informed the court that launching of the group by his client was done in a public place with Police Commissioner and personnel of other security agencies as well as Nasarawa State government officials in attendance. Ruling on the bail application brought before the court by the Miyetti Allah’s leader, Justice Ekwo agreed with the submissions of counsel to the Federal Government, Y.A Imana that, the charges against the defendant borders on threat to national security. Imana had, while objecting to the bail application for the detained Miyetti Allah, urged the court to refuse him bail on the ground that the charges preferred against the defendant borders on threat to national security. Meanwhile, the court, after ruling on the bail application of the Defendant, fixed May 29 for his trial. At the last adjourned date, the case was fixed for ruling and commencement of trial of Bodejo but his absence in court stalled the trial from going ahead. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "content": "IMD has announced that this year the southwest monsoon is likely to set in over Kerala on May 31. New Delhi: India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted above-average monsoon rains in the country this year in its Updated Long Range Forecast Outlook on Monday, confirming its April forecast of a good monsoon. “Quantitatively, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of 4 per cent. Thus above normal rainfall is most likely over the country as a whole during the monsoon season from June to September 2024,” IMD said. IMD has based the forecast of the good monsoon on the fact that the strong El Nino conditions which tend to disrupt the monsoon have weakened rapidly into weak El Nino conditions and are currently transitioning into ENSO-neutral conditions. The latest climate model forecasts indicate ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to establish during the beginning of the monsoon season and La Nina conditions, which result in good rains, are likely to develop during the later part of the monsoon season. IMD has announced that this year the southwest monsoon is likely to set in over Kerala on May 31. A good monsoon augurs well for the country’s agricultural sector which was hit by erratic weather last year. The monsoon plays a key role in the Indian economy as close to 50 per cent of the country's farmland does not have any other source of irrigation. The monsoon rains are also crucial for recharging the country’s reservoirs and aquifers from which the water can be used later in the year to irrigate crops. India has emerged as a key exporter of foodgrains but had to resort to curbing overseas shipments of sugar, rice, wheat and onions in order to increase domestic supplies and keep prices in check due to the erratic monsoon last year which hit farm production. The IMD defines average or normal rainfall as between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the June-Sept season.",

        "content": "The Lagos State Commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Rural Development, Bolaji Kayode Robert, has said that the state government directly interfaces with local government councils in its efforts to bring development to the grassroots. Robert, who made the disclosure on Monday in Alausa, Ikeja, while rolling out the achievements of his Ministry under Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration in the last one year, added that the ministry has continued to engage critical stakeholders in the state for grassroots development. This, according to Robert, “has yielded developments at the grassroots, and has culminated in the on-going rural-urban renewal projects, which have aided in reducing rural-urban migration.” “One of these efforts is the two-day capacity building workshop the ministry recently organised for 376 councillors across the councils, being part of the state government’s roles in improving the law-making capacity of councillors across the 57 councils”, he added. Robert said that the Lagos State government has reassured Lagos residents of its commitment to grassroots development in line with its Security and Governance pillar of the T.H.E.M.E.S. Development Plus Agenda. To this end, he noted that the state government assured that people at the grassroots would continue to be at the centre of its development policy, to ensure that the dividends of democracy are taken to the door-steps of the common man. He stated that Governor Sanwo-Olu intends to actualise the dream of Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy and delivering the reality of a greater Lagos. The commissioner noted that the state government has committed huge resources to paying insurance benefits to families of deceased local government and SUBEB staff, adding that Three Hundred and Ninety-One Million, Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Thousand, Six Hundred and Thirty-Six Naira and Five Kobo (N391,226,636.05) has been disbursed to One Hundred and Sixty-Four (164) beneficiaries of the deceased Staff in the last one year. Robert affirmed that his ministry remains undaunted, focused and unrelenting in its drive towards bringing the dividends of democracy to the doorsteps of the residents of the state and fully actualising the T.H.E.M.E.S. Plus Agenda of this administration. He also hinted that the ministry has continued to monitor and inspect projects and markets across the 57 councils to ensure proper hygiene, cleanliness, waste management and structural safety of facilities in the markets, which, he added, has led to safety and cleanliness in public markets. While noting that the involvement of traditional institutions in governance has continued to enhance peaceful co-existence among people of diverse backgrounds in the state, the commissioner stated that the approval and reconstitution of 84 members into the State Council of Obas and Chiefs by the Governor Sanwo-Olu administration has helped to promote a sense of belonging, equity and unity in the state. He further disclosed that the present administration has so far installed 50 traditional rulers without any rancor or dispute, attesting to people’s support and belief in the leadership quality of governor. In the same vein, Special Adviser to the Governor on Rural Development, Dr. Nurudeen Yekinni Agbaje, while responding to questions at the press briefing, disclosed that the ministry, through the Office of Rural Development, has in the last one year committed to strategic and critical infrastructural development in the rural communities, which includes ongoing road constructions in rural communities, consisting of a 400-metre road in Ijake Community, Oto-Awori LCDA; a 510-metre road at Ganiyu-Oduntan in Ikorodu with four other road constructions in Iganke Community, Agbowa LCDA; Ayubu-Bashorun Road in Ijede; Erelu-Amikanle Road in Alimosho and Onishon Street in Ibeju-Lekki. “Also, in our ongoing efforts in ensuring the provision of community-based projects, we have provided 500KVA transformers to communities such as Yologbo Estate 1, Igbe Alagbe Community in Ikorodu, and eight (8) other communities across the State, which includes Odan-Ilogbo-Eremi PH1 in Olorunda; LASU Campus, Ojo; Oral Estate CDA, Mojoda, Eredo in Epe; Owu CDA in Ibeju-Lekki; Gengenla CDA, Agunfoye in Ikorodu; Ama St, Ijede; Agbede Omolaye in Ikorodu and Liberty Estate CDA in Igbogbo-Baiyeku”, he noted. Dr Agbaje added that the projects and achievements chronicled by the ministry are noticeable in communities across the state because of Mr Governor’s unalloyed commitment to a greater Lagos project as envisioned in the T.H.E.M.E.S. Plus development agenda. While assuring that most of these projects would cut-across the state, Nurudeen also urged Lagos residents to take possession of the rural projects executed by the governor and guard them from vandalisation or destruction, considering that the projects are part of the efforts of the state government in improving the lives of people in Lagos. Present at the Annual Press Briefing is the Chairman, House Committee on Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Rural Development; Sanni Okanlawon; The Commissioner for Information & Strategy; Gbenga Omotosho; the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Rural Development; Kikelomo Bolarinwa, alongside her counterpart, Ministry of Information & Strategy; Olumide Shogunle and directors from the Ministry.",

        "content": "Scientists have predicted that by 2040, almost 50 percent of the world's electric power will be used in computing. What's more, this projection was made before the sudden explosion of generative AI. The amount of computing resources used to train the largest AI models has been doubling roughly every 6 months for more than the past decade. At this rate, by 2030 training a single artificial-intelligence model would take one hundred times as much computing resources as the combined annual resources of the current top ten supercomputers. Simply put, computing will require colossal amounts of power, soon exceeding what our planet can provide.One way to manage the unsustainable energy requirements of the computing sector is to fundamentally change the way we compute. Superconductors could let us do just that.Superconductors offer the possibility of drastically lowering energy consumption because they do not dissipate energy when passing current. True, superconductors work only at cryogenic temperatures, requiring some cooling overhead. But in exchange, they offer virtually zero-resistance interconnects, digital logic built on ultrashort pulses that require minimal energy, and the capacity for incredible computing density due to easy 3D chip stacking.Are the advantages enough to overcome the cost of cryogenic cooling? Our work suggests they most certainly are. As the scale of computing resources gets larger, the marginal cost of the cooling overhead gets smaller. Our research shows that starting at around 1016 floating-point operations per second (tens of petaflops) the superconducting computer handily becomes more power efficient than its classical cousin. This is exactly the scale of typical high-performance computers today, so the time for a superconducting supercomputer is now.At Imec, we have spent the past two years developing superconducting processing units that can be manufactured using standard CMOS tools. A processor based on this work would be one hundred times as energy efficient as themost efficient chips today, and it would lead to a computer that fits a data-center's worth of computing resources into a system the size of a shoebox.The Physics of Energy-Efficient ComputationSuperconductivity—that superpower that allows certain materials to transmit electricity without resistance at low enough temperatures—was discovered back in 1911, and the idea of using it for computing has been aroundsince the mid-1950s. But despite the promise of lower power usage and higher compute density, the technology couldn't compete with the astounding advance of CMOS scaling under Moore's Law. Research has continued through the decades, with a superconducting CPU demonstrated by a group at Yokohama National University as recently as 2020. However, as an aid to computing, superconductivity has stayed largely confined to the laboratory.To bring this technology out of the lab and toward a scalable design that stands a chance of being competitive in the real world, we had to change our approach here at Imec. Instead of inventing a system from the bottom up—that is, starting with what works in a physics lab and hoping it is useful—we designed it from the top down—starting with the necessary functionality, and working directly with CMOS engineers and a full-stack development team to ensure manufacturability. The team worked not only on a fabrication process, but also software architectures, logic gates, and standard-cell libraries of logic and memory elements to build a complete technology.The foundational ideas behind energy-efficient computation, however, have been developed as farback as 1991. In conventional processors, much of the power consumed and heat dissipated comes from moving information among logic units, or between logic and memory elements rather than from actual operations. Interconnects made of superconducting material, however, do not dissipate any energy. The wires have zero electrical resistance, and therefore, little energy is required to move bits within the processor. This property of having extremely low energy losses holds true even at very high communication frequencies, where losses would skyrocket ordinary interconnects.Further energy savings come from the way logic is done inside the superconducting computer. Instead of the transistor, the basic element in superconducting logic is the Josephson-junction.A Josephson junction is a sandwich—a thin slice of insulating material squeezed between two superconductors. Connect the two superconductors, and you have yourself a Josephson-junction loop.Under normal conditions, the insulating \"meat\" in the sandwich is so thin that it does not deter a supercurrent—the whole sandwich just acts as a superconductor. However, if you ramp up the current past a threshold known as a critical current, the superconducting \"bread slices\" around the insulator get briefly knocked out of their superconducting state. In this transition period, the junction emits a tiny voltage pulse, lasting just a picosecond and dissipating just 2 x 10-20 joules, a hundred-billionth of what it takes to write a single bit of information into conventional flash memory.A single flux quantum develops in a Josephson-junction loop via a three-step process. First, a current just above the critical value is passed through the junction. The junction then emits a single-flux-quantum voltage pulse. The voltage pulse passes through the inductor, creating a persistent current in the loop. A Josephson junction is indicated by an x on circuit diagrams. Chris PhilpotThe key is that, due to a phenomenon calledmagnetic flux quantization in the superconducting loop, this pulse is always exactly the same. It is known as a \"single flux quantum\" (SFQ) of magnetic flux, and it is fixed to have a value of 2.07 millivolt-picoseconds. Put an inductor inside the Josephson-junction loop, and the voltage pulse drives a current. Since the loop is superconducting, this current will continue going around the loop indefinitely, without using any further energy.Logical operations inside the superconducting computer are made by manipulating these tiny, quantized voltage pulses. A Josephson-junction loop with an SFQ's worth of persistent current acts as a logical 1, while a current-free loop is a logical 0.To store information, the Josephson-junction-based version of SRAM in CPU cache, also uses single flux quanta. To store one bit, two Josephson-junction loops need to be placed next to each other. An SFQ with a persistent current in the left-hand loop is a memory element storing a logical 0, whereas no current in the left but a current in the right loop is a logical 1.Designing a superconductor-based data center required full-stack innovation. Imec's board design contains three main elements: the input and output, leading data to the room temperature world, the conventional DRAM, stacked high and cooled to 77 kelvins, and the superconducting processing units, also stacked, and cooled to 4 K. Inside the superconducting processing unit, basic logic and memory elements are laid out to perform computations. A magnification of the chip shows the basic building blocks: For logic, a Josephson-junction loop without a persistent current indicates a logical 0, while a loop with one single flux quantum's worth of current represents a logical 1. For memory, two Josephson junction loops are connected together. An SFQ's worth of persistent current in the left loop is a memory 0, and a current in the right loop is a memory 1. Chris PhilpotProgress Through Full-Stack DevelopmentTo go from a lab curiosity to a chip prototype ready for fabrication, we had to innovate the full stack of hardware. This came in three main layers: engineering the basic materials used, circuit development, and architectural design. The three layers had to go together—a new set of materials requires new circuit designs, and new circuit designs require novel architectures to incorporate them. Codevelopment across all three stages, with a strict adherence to CMOS manufacturing capabilities, was the key to success.At the materials level, we had to step away from the previous lab-favorite superconducting material: niobium. While niobium is easy to model and behaves very well under predictable lab conditions, it is very difficult to scale down. Niobium is sensitive to both process temperature and its surrounding materials, so it is not compatible with standard CMOS processing. Therefore, we switched to the related compound niobium titanium nitride for our basic superconducting material. Niobium titanium nitride can withstand temperatures used in CMOS fabrication without losing its superconducting capabilities, and it reacts much less with its surrounding layers, making it a much more practical choice.The basic building block of superconducting logic and memory is the Josephson junction. At Imec, these junctions have been manufactured using a new set of materials, allowing the team to scale down the technology without losing functionality. Here, a tunneling electron microscope image shows a Josephson junction made with alpha-silicon insulator sandwiched between niobium titanium nitride superconductors, achieving a critical dimension of 210 nanometers. ImecAdditionally, we employed a new material for the meat layer of the Josephson-junction sandwich—amorphous, or alpha, silicon. Conventional Josephson-junction materials, most notably aluminum oxide, didn't scale down well. Aluminum was used because it \"wets\" the niobium, smoothing the surface, and the oxide was grown in a well-controlled manner. However, to get to the ultrahigh densities that we are targeting, we would have to make the oxide too thin to be practically manufacturable. Alpha silicon, in contrast, allowed us to use a much thicker barrier for the same critical current.We also had to devise a new way to power the Josephson junctions that would scale down to the size of a chip. Previously, lab-based superconducting computers used transformers to deliver current to their circuit elements. However, having a bulky transformer near each circuit element is unworkable. Instead, we designed a way to deliver power to all the elements on the chip at once by creating a resonant circuit, with specialized capacitors interspersed throughout the chip.At the circuit level, we had to redesign the entire logic and memory structure to take advantage of the new materials' capabilities. We designed anovel logic architecture that we call pulse-conserving logic. The key requirement for pulse-conserving logic is that the elements have as many inputs as outputs and that the total number of single flux quanta is conserved. The logic is performed by routing the SFQs through a combination of Josephson-junction loops and inductors to the appropriate outputs, resulting in logical ORs and ANDs. To complement the logic architecture, we also redesigned a compatible Josephson-junction-based SRAM.Lastly, we had to make architectural innovations to take full advantage of the novel materials and circuit designs. Among these was cooling conventional silicon DRAM down to 77 kelvins and designing a glass bridge between the 77-K section and the main superconducting section. The bridge houses thin wires that allow communication without thermal mixing. We also came up with a way of stacking chips on top of each other and are developing vertical superconducting interconnects to link between circuit boards.A Data Center the Size of a ShoeboxThe result is a superconductor-based chip design that's optimized for AI processing. A zoom in on one of its boards reveals many similarities with a typical 3D CMOS system-on-chip. The board is populated by computational chips: We call it a superconductor processing unit (SPU), with embedded superconducting SRAM, DRAM memory stacks, and switches, all interconnected on silicon interposer or on glass-bridge advanced packaging technologies.But there are also some striking differences. First, most of the chip is to be submerged in liquid helium for cooling to a mere 4 K. This includes the SPUs and SRAM, which depend on superconducting logic rather than CMOS, and are housed on an interposer board. Next, there is a glass bridge to a warmer area, a balmy 77 K that hosts the DRAM. The DRAM technology is not superconducting, but conventional silicon cooled down from room temperature, making it more efficient. From there, bespoke connectors lead data to and from the room-temperature world.Davide ComaiMoore's law relies on fitting progressively more computing resources into the same space. As scaling down transistors gets more and more difficult, the semiconductor industry is turning toward3D stacking of chips to keep up the density gains. In classical CMOS-based technology, it is very challenging to stack computational chips on top of each other because of the large amount of power, and therefore heat, that is dissipated within the chips. In superconducting technology, the little power that is dissipated is easily removed by the liquid helium. Logic chips can be directly stacked using advanced 3D integration technologies resulting in shorter and faster connections between the chips, and a smaller footprint.It is also straightforward to stack multiple boards of 3D superconducting chips on top of each other, leaving only a small space between them. We modeled a stack of 100 such boards, all operating within the same cooling environment and contained in a 20- by 20- by 12-centimeter volume, roughly the size of a shoebox. We calculated that this stack can perform 20 exaflops (inBF16 number format), 20 times the capacity of the largest supercomputer today. What's more, the system promises to consume only 500 kilowatts of total power. This translates to energy efficiency one hundred times as high as the most efficient supercomputer today.So far, we've scaled down Josephson junctions and interconnect dimensions over three succeeding generations. Going forward, Imec's road map includes tackling 3D superconducting chip-integration and cooling technologies. For the first generation, the road map envisions the stacking of about 100 boards to obtain the target performance of 20 exaflops. Gradually, more and more logic chips will be stacked, and the number of boards will be reduced. This will further increase performance while reducing complexity and cost.The Superconducting VisionWe don't envision that superconducting digital technology will replace conventional CMOS computing, but we do expect it to complement CMOS for specific applications and fuel innovations in new ones. For one, this technology would integrate seamlessly with quantum computers that are also built upon superconducting technology. Perhaps more significantly, we believe it will support the growth in AI and machine learning processing and help provide cloud-based training of big AI models in a much more sustainable way than is currently possible.In addition, with this technology we can engineer data centers with much smaller footprints. Drastically smaller data centers can be placed close to their target applications, rather than being in some far-off football-stadium-size facility.Such transformative server technology is a dream for scientists. It opens doors to online training of AI models on real data that are part of an actively changing environment. Take potential robotic farms as an example. Today, training these would be a challenging task, where the required processing capabilities are available only in far-away, power-hungry data centers. With compact, nearby data centers, the data could be processed at once, allowing an AI to learn from current conditions on the farmSimilarly, these miniature data centers can be interspersed in energy grids, learning right away at each node and distributing electricity more efficiently throughout the world. Imagine smart cities, mobile health care systems, manufacturing, farming, and more, all benefiting from instant feedback from adjacent AI learners, optimizing and improving decision making in real time.",

        "content": "Scientists have predicted that by 2040, almost 50 percent of the world's electric power will be used in computing. What's more, this projection was made before the sudden explosion of generative AI. The amount of computing resources used to train the largest AI models has been doubling roughly every 6 months for more than the past decade. At this rate, by 2030 training a single artificial-intelligence model would take one hundred times as much computing resources as the combined annual resources of the current top ten supercomputers. Simply put, computing will require colossal amounts of power, soon exceeding what our planet can provide.One way to manage the unsustainable energy requirements of the computing sector is to fundamentally change the way we compute. Superconductors could let us do just that.Superconductors offer the possibility of drastically lowering energy consumption because they do not dissipate energy when passing current. True, superconductors work only at cryogenic temperatures, requiring some cooling overhead. But in exchange, they offer virtually zero-resistance interconnects, digital logic built on ultrashort pulses that require minimal energy, and the capacity for incredible computing density due to easy 3D chip stacking.Are the advantages enough to overcome the cost of cryogenic cooling? Our work suggests they most certainly are. As the scale of computing resources gets larger, the marginal cost of the cooling overhead gets smaller. Our research shows that starting at around 1016 floating-point operations per second (tens of petaflops) the superconducting computer handily becomes more power efficient than its classical cousin. This is exactly the scale of typical high-performance computers today, so the time for a superconducting supercomputer is now.At Imec, we have spent the past two years developing superconducting processing units that can be manufactured using standard CMOS tools. A processor based on this work would be one hundred times as energy efficient as themost efficient chips today, and it would lead to a computer that fits a data-center's worth of computing resources into a system the size of a shoebox.The Physics of Energy-Efficient ComputationSuperconductivity—that superpower that allows certain materials to transmit electricity without resistance at low enough temperatures—was discovered back in 1911, and the idea of using it for computing has been aroundsince the mid-1950s. But despite the promise of lower power usage and higher compute density, the technology couldn't compete with the astounding advance of CMOS scaling under Moore's Law. Research has continued through the decades, with a superconducting CPU demonstrated by a group at Yokohama National University as recently as 2020. However, as an aid to computing, superconductivity has stayed largely confined to the laboratory.To bring this technology out of the lab and toward a scalable design that stands a chance of being competitive in the real world, we had to change our approach here at Imec. Instead of inventing a system from the bottom up—that is, starting with what works in a physics lab and hoping it is useful—we designed it from the top down—starting with the necessary functionality, and working directly with CMOS engineers and a full-stack development team to ensure manufacturability. The team worked not only on a fabrication process, but also software architectures, logic gates, and standard-cell libraries of logic and memory elements to build a complete technology.The foundational ideas behind energy-efficient computation, however, have been developed as farback as 1991. In conventional processors, much of the power consumed and heat dissipated comes from moving information among logic units, or between logic and memory elements rather than from actual operations. Interconnects made of superconducting material, however, do not dissipate any energy. The wires have zero electrical resistance, and therefore, little energy is required to move bits within the processor. This property of having extremely low energy losses holds true even at very high communication frequencies, where losses would skyrocket ordinary interconnects.Further energy savings come from the way logic is done inside the superconducting computer. Instead of the transistor, the basic element in superconducting logic is the Josephson-junction.A Josephson junction is a sandwich—a thin slice of insulating material squeezed between two superconductors. Connect the two superconductors, and you have yourself a Josephson-junction loop.Under normal conditions, the insulating \"meat\" in the sandwich is so thin that it does not deter a supercurrent—the whole sandwich just acts as a superconductor. However, if you ramp up the current past a threshold known as a critical current, the superconducting \"bread slices\" around the insulator get briefly knocked out of their superconducting state. In this transition period, the junction emits a tiny voltage pulse, lasting just a picosecond and dissipating just 2 x 10-20 joules, a hundred-billionth of what it takes to write a single bit of information into conventional flash memory.A single flux quantum develops in a Josephson-junction loop via a three-step process. First, a current just above the critical value is passed through the junction. The junction then emits a single-flux-quantum voltage pulse. The voltage pulse passes through the inductor, creating a persistent current in the loop. A Josephson junction is indicated by an x on circuit diagrams. Chris PhilpotThe key is that, due to a phenomenon calledmagnetic flux quantization in the superconducting loop, this pulse is always exactly the same. It is known as a \"single flux quantum\" (SFQ) of magnetic flux, and it is fixed to have a value of 2.07 millivolt-picoseconds. Put an inductor inside the Josephson-junction loop, and the voltage pulse drives a current. Since the loop is superconducting, this current will continue going around the loop indefinitely, without using any further energy.Logical operations inside the superconducting computer are made by manipulating these tiny, quantized voltage pulses. A Josephson-junction loop with an SFQ's worth of persistent current acts as a logical 1, while a current-free loop is a logical 0.To store information, the Josephson-junction-based version of SRAM in CPU cache, also uses single flux quanta. To store one bit, two Josephson-junction loops need to be placed next to each other. An SFQ with a persistent current in the left-hand loop is a memory element storing a logical 0, whereas no current in the left but a current in the right loop is a logical 1.Designing a superconductor-based data center required full-stack innovation. Imec's board design contains three main elements: the input and output, leading data to the room temperature world, the conventional DRAM, stacked high and cooled to 77 kelvins, and the superconducting processing units, also stacked, and cooled to 4 K. Inside the superconducting processing unit, basic logic and memory elements are laid out to perform computations. A magnification of the chip shows the basic building blocks: For logic, a Josephson-junction loop without a persistent current indicates a logical 0, while a loop with one single flux quantum's worth of current represents a logical 1. For memory, two Josephson junction loops are connected together. An SFQ's worth of persistent current in the left loop is a memory 0, and a current in the right loop is a memory 1. Chris PhilpotProgress Through Full-Stack DevelopmentTo go from a lab curiosity to a chip prototype ready for fabrication, we had to innovate the full stack of hardware. This came in three main layers: engineering the basic materials used, circuit development, and architectural design. The three layers had to go together—a new set of materials requires new circuit designs, and new circuit designs require novel architectures to incorporate them. Codevelopment across all three stages, with a strict adherence to CMOS manufacturing capabilities, was the key to success.At the materials level, we had to step away from the previous lab-favorite superconducting material: niobium. While niobium is easy to model and behaves very well under predictable lab conditions, it is very difficult to scale down. Niobium is sensitive to both process temperature and its surrounding materials, so it is not compatible with standard CMOS processing. Therefore, we switched to the related compound niobium titanium nitride for our basic superconducting material. Niobium titanium nitride can withstand temperatures used in CMOS fabrication without losing its superconducting capabilities, and it reacts much less with its surrounding layers, making it a much more practical choice.The basic building block of superconducting logic and memory is the Josephson junction. At Imec, these junctions have been manufactured using a new set of materials, allowing the team to scale down the technology without losing functionality. Here, a tunneling electron microscope image shows a Josephson junction made with alpha-silicon insulator sandwiched between niobium titanium nitride superconductors, achieving a critical dimension of 210 nanometers. ImecAdditionally, we employed a new material for the meat layer of the Josephson-junction sandwich—amorphous, or alpha, silicon. Conventional Josephson-junction materials, most notably aluminum oxide, didn't scale down well. Aluminum was used because it \"wets\" the niobium, smoothing the surface, and the oxide was grown in a well-controlled manner. However, to get to the ultrahigh densities that we are targeting, we would have to make the oxide too thin to be practically manufacturable. Alpha silicon, in contrast, allowed us to use a much thicker barrier for the same critical current.We also had to devise a new way to power the Josephson junctions that would scale down to the size of a chip. Previously, lab-based superconducting computers used transformers to deliver current to their circuit elements. However, having a bulky transformer near each circuit element is unworkable. Instead, we designed a way to deliver power to all the elements on the chip at once by creating a resonant circuit, with specialized capacitors interspersed throughout the chip.At the circuit level, we had to redesign the entire logic and memory structure to take advantage of the new materials' capabilities. We designed anovel logic architecture that we call pulse-conserving logic. The key requirement for pulse-conserving logic is that the elements have as many inputs as outputs and that the total number of single flux quanta is conserved. The logic is performed by routing the SFQs through a combination of Josephson-junction loops and inductors to the appropriate outputs, resulting in logical ORs and ANDs. To complement the logic architecture, we also redesigned a compatible Josephson-junction-based SRAM.Lastly, we had to make architectural innovations to take full advantage of the novel materials and circuit designs. Among these was cooling conventional silicon DRAM down to 77 kelvins and designing a glass bridge between the 77-K section and the main superconducting section. The bridge houses thin wires that allow communication without thermal mixing. We also came up with a way of stacking chips on top of each other and are developing vertical superconducting interconnects to link between circuit boards.A Data Center the Size of a ShoeboxThe result is a superconductor-based chip design that's optimized for AI processing. A zoom in on one of its boards reveals many similarities with a typical 3D CMOS system-on-chip. The board is populated by computational chips: We call it a superconductor processing unit (SPU), with embedded superconducting SRAM, DRAM memory stacks, and switches, all interconnected on silicon interposer or on glass-bridge advanced packaging technologies.But there are also some striking differences. First, most of the chip is to be submerged in liquid helium for cooling to a mere 4 K. This includes the SPUs and SRAM, which depend on superconducting logic rather than CMOS, and are housed on an interposer board. Next, there is a glass bridge to a warmer area, a balmy 77 K that hosts the DRAM. The DRAM technology is not superconducting, but conventional silicon cooled down from room temperature, making it more efficient. From there, bespoke connectors lead data to and from the room-temperature world.Davide ComaiMoore's law relies on fitting progressively more computing resources into the same space. As scaling down transistors gets more and more difficult, the semiconductor industry is turning toward3D stacking of chips to keep up the density gains. In classical CMOS-based technology, it is very challenging to stack computational chips on top of each other because of the large amount of power, and therefore heat, that is dissipated within the chips. In superconducting technology, the little power that is dissipated is easily removed by the liquid helium. Logic chips can be directly stacked using advanced 3D integration technologies resulting in shorter and faster connections between the chips, and a smaller footprint.It is also straightforward to stack multiple boards of 3D superconducting chips on top of each other, leaving only a small space between them. We modeled a stack of 100 such boards, all operating within the same cooling environment and contained in a 20- by 20- by 12-centimeter volume, roughly the size of a shoebox. We calculated that this stack can perform 20 exaflops (inBF16 number format), 20 times the capacity of the largest supercomputer today. What's more, the system promises to consume only 500 kilowatts of total power. This translates to energy efficiency one hundred times as high as the most efficient supercomputer today.So far, we've scaled down Josephson junctions and interconnect dimensions over three succeeding generations. Going forward, Imec's road map includes tackling 3D superconducting chip-integration and cooling technologies. For the first generation, the road map envisions the stacking of about 100 boards to obtain the target performance of 20 exaflops. Gradually, more and more logic chips will be stacked, and the number of boards will be reduced. This will further increase performance while reducing complexity and cost.The Superconducting VisionWe don't envision that superconducting digital technology will replace conventional CMOS computing, but we do expect it to complement CMOS for specific applications and fuel innovations in new ones. For one, this technology would integrate seamlessly with quantum computers that are also built upon superconducting technology. Perhaps more significantly, we believe it will support the growth in AI and machine learning processing and help provide cloud-based training of big AI models in a much more sustainable way than is currently possible.In addition, with this technology we can engineer data centers with much smaller footprints. Drastically smaller data centers can be placed close to their target applications, rather than being in some far-off football-stadium-size facility.Such transformative server technology is a dream for scientists. It opens doors to online training of AI models on real data that are part of an actively changing environment. Take potential robotic farms as an example. Today, training these would be a challenging task, where the required processing capabilities are available only in far-away, power-hungry data centers. With compact, nearby data centers, the data could be processed at once, allowing an AI to learn from current conditions on the farmSimilarly, these miniature data centers can be interspersed in energy grids, learning right away at each node and distributing electricity more efficiently throughout the world. Imagine smart cities, mobile health care systems, manufacturing, farming, and more, all benefiting from instant feedback from adjacent AI learners, optimizing and improving decision making in real time.",

Known for its peacefulness and remote location, Covehithe beach in Suffolk has been named as one of the best beaches in the UK by the The Sunday Times. However, the under-the-radar beach may not be around for much longer as it suffers from the highest rate of erosion in the country of any beach. Between the 1830s and 2001, the cliff-face has lost over 500 metres and according to the area's Shoreline Management Plan, Clovehithe's cliffs erode around 4.5 metres a year.

        "content": "Best pals who went for gastric sleeve surgery abroad have spoken of their heartbreak after one was left fighting for her life. Chloe Quick, 23, was inspired when her best friend Leah Mattson, 26, underwent a gastric sleeve and signed up for the procedure herself. But Chloe found herself in ICU with just a 50% chance of survival and Leah frantically began fundraising to fly her friend back to the UK. Chloe is now recovering at home in Hereford with Leah's help. The two women, who work together, live on the same street, and who went through pregnancy together, are now thankful to be losing weight together too. They are speaking out to highlight both sides of weight loss surgery. Leah says: \"I really encouraged Chloe to have the surgery because it had been a success for me. She saw it as a new start, a second chance. \"My own surgery saved my life, but it nearly killed my best friend. I am just so relieved she is back home, and we can begin looking to the future now. She's been through hell, but it has really cemented our friendship, and made us both grateful to be alive.\" Leah and Chloe met in 2020 through mutual friends. Early in 2021, both fell pregnant, and their babies were born just four weeks apart.

It was lovely to go through it all together.\" Chloe's son, Oliver, was born first in October 2021, followed by Leah's daughter, Esmae, four weeks later. Health care assistant Chloe says: \"After our children were born, we became very close. Leah is godmother to my son. We went to baby classes together and we helped each other out daily. Leah then moved onto my street, and I got a job at the same hospital as her. Though we weren't often working on the same ward, we could usually time our breaks together and have a catch up.\" The two women really bonded over their weight issues.

Locals claim the small, cobbled streets have been flooded with tourists intruding on their private properties vying for the perfect holiday snap.

During Nicki's concert at the Resorts World Arena in Birmingham, the 41-year-old singer shared her unlikely love for the former Princess of Wales who passed when the rapper was just 14 years old. Nicki channeled her alter-ego Martha Zolanski as she put on a fake British accent and asked the cheering crowd to give a moment of silence for Princess Diana who died 26 years ago. As she took to the stage in her ripped jeans and hot-pink silk gloves, Nicki shouted to the crowd: \"Wales - it always reminds me of a dear friend of mine, well she's not here anymore, but the Princess of Wales. Let's have a moment of silence for her.\" For all the...",

The South Pacific island's government has asked for help from the UN after Friday's landslide, which was initially estimated to have killed 670. Despite this, only five people have been recovered in the disaster's aftermath. A letter sent to the UN by acting director of the country's National Disaster Center, Luseta Laso Mana, on Sunday said the landslide \"buried more than 2,000 people alive\", causing \"major destruction\" in the village of Yambali in the Enga province. Figures on the number of casualties have fluctuated since Friday, however. The toll of 670 was based on calculations by the village and provincial officials, who said 150 homes had been flattened by the landslide - up from the previous estimate of 60.

Fort William in the Scottish Highlands received the title of 'worst spot' for a mini-break in Scotland and across the UK, according to new research. Scotland is known for making its way to the top of international rankings as one of the most beautiful destinations in the world. But Fort William, in the West Highlands, hasn't been so lucky with its recent reputation. The town has come up in the bottom ranks as being one of the poorest destinations for a holiday across the entire UK, according to Which?, which surveyed 3,967 people rating towns and cities around the UK they had stayed in for leisure. Fort William came last, tying with Torquay in England on the list of low-ranking 'small UK cities', scoring a mere 58%. Which? found there were several shortcomings in the town that may have contributed to its poor ranking. The judgement was rather harsh, with Fort William scoring just two stars out of five across four categories: food and drink, accommodation, shopping, and 'ease of getting around'.

The World Cup-bound star spinner Chahal, who featured for Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the recently concluded IPL 2024, enjoyed an impressive campaign in which he bagged 18 wickets. Meanwhile, pacer Avesh Khan will be with India as a reserve player. At the Mumbai airport, pacer Avesh was seen talking to another reserve player Rinku Singh on video call. Earlier on Sunday, the first batch of Indian players including skipper Rohit Sharma, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and number-one-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav left for the United States. At the Mumbai airport, besides skipper Rohit, Bumrah and Suryakumar, head coach Rahul Dravid, batting coach Vikram Rathour, batter Shubman Gill, all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube, pacers Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel were also captured at the airport.

        "content": "A secretly recorded album by hip hop greats Wu-Tang Clan dubbed the world's rarest has been loaned to a Tasmanian museum. Only one copy of the 128-minute double-album 'Once Upon A Time In Shaolin' exists on two CDs, which were pressed in 2014 after six years of clandestine recordings. The 31-track work, which is enclosed in a hand-carved nickel-silver box, was stored in a vault in Morocco before being auctioned. It has changed hands several times before being bought by digital art collective Pleasr in 2021 for $US4 million ($A6 million). Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) on Tuesday announced the album would be on display from June 15-24 as part of its 'Namedropping' exhibit. The gallery will also host ticketed free listening parties in which a curated 30-minute mix of the album will be played from a personalised Wu-Tang Clan PlayStation 1. A legal agreement means the album cannot be commercially exploited until 2103, although it can be played at listening parties. \"Every once in a while, an object on this planet possesses mystical properties that transcend its material circumstances,\" MONA director of curatorial affairs Jarrod Rawlins said. \"(It) is more than just an album, so when I was thinking about status, and what a transcendent 'Namedrop' could be, I knew I had to get it into this exhibition.\" Wu-Tang Clan formed in New York in 1992 and are considered one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time. The album's master tracks were deleted and it cannot be streamed or downloaded. MONA says it has only been heard by a handful of people around the world and it is the first loan to a museum since the original sale. In a statement, Pleasr said it was honoured to partner with MONA to support Wu-Tang Clan's vision. \"Ten years ago, the Wu-Tang Clan had a bold vision to make a single-copy album as a work of fine art,\" Pleasr said. \"To 'put it in an art gallery ... make music become a living piece like a Mona Lisa or a sceptre from Egypt.'. \"With this single work of art, the Wu-Tang Clan's intention was to redefine the meaning of music ownership and value in a world of digital streaming and commodification of music.\" The group has said the album \"encapsulates the Clan's legendary dark funk and avant-garde sound and is produced in the original Wu-Tang style of the '90s\". Tickets for the listening parties will be up for grabs at 10am on Thursday. The exhibition also features original handwritten lyrics to David Bowie's 'Starman', showing edits and spelling corrections.",

        "description": "Australia's biggest superannuation funds are bankrolling an expansion of coal, oil and gas rather than investing in clean energy companies, an index shows.",
        "content": "For every dollar invested in clean energy companies, superannuation funds have five dollars invested in the expansion of fossil fuels, an index has found. Australia's top 30 super funds have more than $39 billion invested in the global expansion of gas, coal and oil, according to a report released on Tuesday by shareholder organisation Market Forces. Retirement savings allocated across the Climate Wreckers Index - a group of 190 coal, oil and gas companies - have more than doubled in the two years to December 2023 in the largest or default investment options, based on the latest available disclosures. Simultaneously, the amount allocated to listed clean energy companies has declined by half a billion dollars to a mere $7.7 billion despite the funds' climate pledges. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Even as the market watchdog warns it is on the lookout for false green credentials, almost all of these super funds have signed up for net zero emissions by 2050 or acknowledge that climate change poses significant risks. Yet the index showed no major trend of these super funds actively selling down stakes in \"climate wrecker\" companies. Those most exposed to the expansion of fossil fuels were savers in UniSuper - Balanced, Commonwealth Super Corp - PSS Default, and MLC - MySuper Growth, according to the index. Market Forces called for the super funds to do better if they are to avoid scrutiny from regulators or face legal action for greenwashing. For the first time, researchers identified each fund's share of emissions from the fossil fuel expansion plans of index members and fingered three companies as the biggest polluters. Woodside Energy, gas giant Santos and Whitehaven Coal were found to be responsible for more than half (59 per cent) of index companies' projected emissions attributable to expansion plans. Woodside and Santos can no longer obtain project finance for new oil and gas field developments from Australia's big four banks, according to Market Forces. Now Australian super funds are being urged to clean up their members' retirement accounts. \"Thousands of members are furious that large funds including AustralianSuper, Australian Retirement Trust and HESTA are failing to rein in the climate-wrecking business plans of companies like Woodside,\" Market Forces spokesman Brett Morgan said. The combined emissions from these expansion projects, totalling more than 129 gigatonnes, would eat up about half of the remaining global carbon budget for keeping global warming to 1.5C, according to the research. Resources heavyweight BHP was called out as a \"significant problem\", with the five biggest funds collectively owning nearly eight per cent of it across their dozens of investment options. However, Vision Super's chief investment officer Michael Wyrsch said there could be favourable outcomes for climate risk if BHP was successful in its attempted takeover of South African mining behemoth Anglo American. BHP may close down some coal mines earlier than would be the case if Anglo American remained a stand-alone company, which would be good thing, he said.",

        "content": "The Independent National Electoral Commission on Monday, commenced the Continuous Voter Registration exercise in Edo State. The exercise is meant to capture would-be voters yet register ahead of the governorship election in Edo on September 21. He added that both the CVR and the PVC collection would be a 10-day exercise from May 27 to June 5, 2024, from 9 am to 3 pm daily including weekends. This is despite a call from the state acting chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Jarret Tenebe on Friday, to cancel the exercise due to the damage to its secretariat, materials and equipment meant for CVR. Reacting to the call, the Edo INEC’s head of Voters Education and Publicity, Timidi Wariowei, said it is unfair to lay such an allegation against the election umpire. Tenebe said the stakeholders meeting held on May 16 at the INEC office in Benin was meant to take care of issues relating, noting that it was wrong to lay such an accusation on the doorstep of the commission. The CVR exercise monitored in Oredo, Egor and Ikpoba-Okha local government showed that PVC collection was also ongoing side-by-side with the continuous voter registration exercise. Speaking at the Ikpoba-Okha registration area, the INEC National Commissioner in charge of Edo, Delta and Cross River, Rhoda Gumus, expressed satisfaction with the exercise while urging the registrants to be patient, adding that they will all be registered. Gumus said, “We have been to Oredo and we are here at the Ikpoba-Okha registration area which we are using as our state head office registration centre because of the flood disaster that happened at our head office on Friday. “We are in touch with other registration areas within and outside Benin and the exercise is going on smoothly. As you can see, we have registered some people and others are still waiting. The process just started today. It is impressive and commendable, ” she said. The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Anugbum Onuoha said that INEC was well prepared for the exercise, adding that the flood disaster that destroyed some of the commission’s equipment could not stop the exercise. Onuoha said, ” We thank God for the enablement to begin this exercise, having in mind the flood disaster that destroyed some of our equipment on Friday. Due to the flood disaster, we moved our head office registration area to the INEC office at Ikpoba-Okha local government. “We are here and witnessing a large turnout of people who are here as either new registrants or to transfer their registration or for PVC collection. INEC is prepared for this exercise and nothing will make us fail. People expected us to discontinue the exercise but we were prepared even before the flood disaster happened. “Yes, we had some initial network problems but it has been resolved and the exercise is going on smoothly and by the grace of God, the exercise will be successful.” The state acting chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Jarret Tenebe in a statement on Sunday, urged INEC to cancel the exercise due to the damage to its secretariat, materials and equipment meant for CVR. The APC had on Friday at a press conference in Benin alleged that the People’s Democratic Party and INEC were conniving to manipulate the CVR in favour of the PDP. The party also said that the CVR’s manipulation was the beginning of moves to rig the election in favour of the PDP.",

She is now expected to rake in more than 20 times the annual profit she started off achieving when the business first began ten years ago. The events manager turned entrepreneur's business began by accident after she developed a passion for Japanese matcha tea and became intrigued by its health benefits. She was left heartbroken after her mum was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2009 - but she took control of her anxiety and channelled it into finding wellness opportunities. Katherine was tasked with helping to run the £5 million charity appeal for Breakthrough Breast Cancer - and that led to a chance meeting with a professor. He was studying whether antioxidants and amino acids found in matcha tea could slow down the growth of cancer stem cells in those battling the potentially fatal disease. Of course, Katherine was instantly interested in having some samples shipped over from Japan to taste the feel-good effect herself. \"My mum and I tried drinking it and it made us feel great, it just gave us a mental and physical boost of energy,\" she revealed to The Sun. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) \"I started thinking I loved it so much I wanted to spread the word, and that's where I got the idea to start my own matcha tea business!\" In 2014, OMG Tea (Organic Matcha Green Tea) was born - and the public reaction gave her the \"confidence to keep pursuing it\".

Katherine was approached by Dragons' Den the following year to appear on the BBC show, but there was disappointment in store when she made her TV debut. She pitched her idea to the Dragons in the hope of securing an investment that would help her to grow the business, but to no avail. Peter Jones dropped the bombshell that he couldn't see the nation incorporating matcha tea drinking into mainstream culture - and he then uttered the words no business hopeful wants to hear: \"I'm out.\" Don't miss...

Using £20,000 of her own savings, she took the \"big risk\" of trying to grow her business alone - and it paid off. In 2023, she doubled her annual profits from £250,000 to £500,000 - and this year she thinks she's on track to make £1 million. Reflecting that the drink is now available at Starbucks, she explained: \"I wanted to basically bring matcha to the masses... I genuinely believe if everyone drank a cup of matcha every day, the world would be a better place. Now I'm on my way to making that happen!\" Related articles Dragons’ Den fans fume 'you've got to be kidding me' as goat business rejected CBB's Gary Goldsmith 'eyeing up another big TV show' which could be 'great move' Levi Roots slams CBB housemates for 'micro-bullying' Ekin-Su as he defends her CCTV captures moment Dragons' Den winner crashes £100k Ferrari in city centre BBC Dragons' Den viewers issue the same complaint about 'boring' bean pitch",

        "content": "The assurances were contained in a press statement signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Mainstream Media, Dan Nwomeh, on Monday in Enugu, marking the 2024 Children’s Day. According to the statement, “the governor is especially focused on protecting the rights of every child and making sure children of school age have access to high quality basic education, which will inspire them to express their creativity in science, technology, art, and music, and make their voices heard in the society. “Children are an essential part of our society. Without them, there will not be transition to a greater tomorrow. They mirror the outlook of our future, and the tomorrow we want to bequeath to them. We are, therefore, committed to ensuring that their rights, which are fundamental to my administration, are protected. “Our administration has made it a point of duty to commit to the education, welfare, safety and rights of our children. This is why we are committing over 33% of this fiscal year’s budgetary allocation to their education and wellbeing. The 260 smart green schools we are building across the 260 wards in the state are part of the assurances that we want to ensure that children in the state have a bright and productive future irrespective of status, religion, sex and background,” part of the statement read. On the theme of this year’s Children’s Day, “For every child, every right,” the governor explained that his administration was in the forefront of eliminating child labour, child trafficking, malnutrition, dislocation, or any other form of attacks, adding that no child in the state would experience a setback in their education due to their family background. “As a way of ensuring every child in Enugu State participates in the journey to shaping a better future, our administration has placed a high priority on basic and primary education. We are not only offering quality education, we are offering a free, world-class experiential system of learning that has departed from the traditional method of education. “We will keep listening and giving our children voices to be heard, and celebrate their talents and ingenuity,” the statement added.",

        "content": "Katie Price, 46, is slammed for 'disappointing' behaviour on stage as she encourages son Harvey, 22, to say the C-word repeatedly in front of thousands By Melody Fletcher For Mailonline Published: 18:15, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:32, 27 May 2024 e-mail 63 View comments Katie Price has been slammed for her 'disappointing' behaviour on stage at her show in London on Friday. The former glamour model, 46, made an appearance at The Clapham Grand with her sister Sophie, 34, for the latest stop on her podcast tour The Katie Price Show. However, the ex-Page 3 girl was slammed by her devoted fans who watched her encourage son Harvey, 22, to say the C-word repeatedly in front of thousands of people. It isn't the first time Harvey has dropped the C-word in front of a large audience, as in 2016 the then-then 13-year-old went viral or saying it during an interview about trolling on Loose Women . In exclusive new footage obtained by MailOnline, Katie is seen prompting Harvey to say the c-word by referring to a previous time he said it. Katie goes up to Harvey, who is blind, autistic, has septo-optic dysplasia and a learning disability, and asks: 'What was the naught word when you were on TV with Piers Morgan ? What did you say?' Katie Price has been slammed for her 'disappointing' behaviour on stage at her show in London on Friday The ex-Page 3 girl was slammed by her devoted fans who watched her encourage son Harvey, 22, to say the C-word repeatedly in front of thousands of people Harvey responds: 'Hi Piers Morgan you bl***y c***' Katie then put the microphone back to his mouth, with Harvey once again saying: 'Hello you c***' One audience member was 'shocked and disappointed' by Katie's behaviour on stage, telling MailOnline exclusively: 'I don't know what I was more shocked about, the fact that a mum was egging her son, regardless of his age, to use such a profanity on stage, or the fact that she said \"well done\" after he done it! 'As a mum myself I was so disturbed. Although the audience were laughing at the time, when we were all walking out, fans were expressing how disappointed they were that Harvey seemed to be used as a prop in the live show for a cheap laugh. 'Katie appears to be such a fantastic mum, so seeing something like this live is extremely disappointing.' Katie shares Harvey with former Premier League footballer Dwight Yorke, but claims he has only seen their son aroundseven times in his life . Katie's fans were already outraged on the night as she she turned up to the show an hour late. The TV personality's fans have dubbed her tardiness 'rude' and 'unprofessional'. After revealing their frustration, one audience member told The Sun : 'Some of us had travelled from quite a while away to see her and had long journeys back home. It isn't the first time Harvey has dropped the C-word in front of a large audience, as in 2016 the then-then 13-year-old went viral or saying it during an interview about trolling on Loose Women Katie's fans were already outraged on the night as she she turned up to the show an hour late 'We were all sitting there twiddling our thumbs, hoping she would come out on stage. The waiting seemed to go on forever. 'Why couldn't she have just started the show at the advertised time? It's honestly so unprofessional and rude. I don't think I'll ever see her live again.' Despite frustrating fans with her late arrival , Katie appeared in top spirits after the show as she left smiling with her son Harvey, 21. She was then spotted happily jumping into a car with her boyfriend JJ Slater. To see one of Katie's live podcast shows, fans had to fork out £29 per ticket. Although the entry fee was relatively cheap compared to her competitors, she could not fill the venue, which could seat up to 700 people. Fan pictures showed that the venue still had a lot of empty seats by the time the show started. In a desperate bid to put bottoms on seats, the mother-of-five offered her dedicated fans a discount and started to flog her tickets online for £10. But while it also appears that she will not fill her next 400-capacity venue in Birmingham, there is still hope for her in Bristol, Glasgow and Newcastle. Katie and Sophie launched the podcast in the summer in a bid to get the cash flowing again after being made bankrupt twice. During her show on Wednesday she left her fans stunned when she took to the stage to perform a song during her podcast show in Birmingham . She made sure it was indeed The Katie Price Show as she burst into a song for the audience. Katie, who shocked fans for 'having a really good voice', brushed off her recent financial woes as her first night of her podcast show kicked off. She slipped into a skimpy pink playsuit covered with her face on it and wore a dazzling silver crown with thigh-high latex pink boots. It comes after Katie revealed the 'real reason' behind her whopping tax bill since it was revealed she is being evicted from her Mucky Mansion She said she 'didn't even know' she was declared bankrupt a second time - despite failing to pay over £750,000 to HMRC Katie opened up on her financial woes on the Stripping Off With Matt Haycox and disclosed the truth behind her bankruptcy She had the whole audience dancing along during her performance, despite struggling to hit most of the right notes. While some fans were gobsmacked over surprisingly good performance, others were not in agreement. The majority of fans flooded Katie's Instagram comments with positive messages following her performance, writing: 'Your voice is really good!' Where another fans couldn't quite believe their eyes, penning: 'Total cringe!!!!' It comes after Katie revealed the 'real reason' behind her whopping tax bill since it was revealed she is being evicted from her Mucky Mansion. She said she 'didn't even know' she was declared bankrupt a second time - despite failing to pay over £750,000 to HMRC. Opened up on her financial woes on the Stripping Off podcast with Matt Haycox , Katie disclosed the truth behind her bankruptcy. Katie blamed 'lawyers and divorces' for the root cause of her bankruptcy, but insisted she 'will pay' what she owes 'when she has it'. She said: 'Yeah, you should always pay your tax, this and that. But obviously I went through a breakdown so then I didn't pay tax and that's sort of where the bankruptcy thing has come from. 'I will pay it but it just has to be when I've got it.' She added: 'I pay the mum and dad role, I've got bills to pay, I've got outgoings, I've got to live. 'I feel good, because I'm in control whereas before, other people controlled it.' Despite admitting she has been turning down work because she is getting too much, Katie told Matt she had no idea about her double bankruptcy. She said: 'Apparently I'm in another one, I didn't even know about that.' Katie has been open about her financial struggles and revealed on Monday that she is having a 'yard sale' as she begins clearing out her Mucky Mansion amid her bankruptcy woes Katie has been open about her financial struggles and revealed on Monday that she is having a 'yard sale' as she begins clearing out her Mucky Mansion amid her bankruptcy woes . She was informed by lawyers earlier this month that she would have to move out of the property in in Dial Post, West Sussex, by May 29, after two eviction notices appeared outside her home. Katie's Mucky Mansion has caused the star problems for years and last October the she struggled to rent the house out due to it being 'mouldy' and 'haunted'. Earlier this month it was revealed Katie was due to be evicted from the property. The first eviction letter, dated April 24, revealed that 'the eviction will take place on May 29th, 2024, at 10am'. The eviction order from Horsham County Court, addressed to Katie and 'any other occupiers', instructs her 'to arrange to leave the property with [her] belongings before this time and date'. A spokesman for the star has denied that she will be kicked out at the end of the month. In a statement to The Sun on Sunday night, they said: 'Kate will not be evicted from her property on 29th May,' but would not confirm or deny if Katie was being evicted. The TV personality paid £1.35m for the property in Horsham, West Sussex in October 2014, which boasts some 12.25 acres of land, a swimming pool, tennis courts, stables and paddocks. But, the home subsequently fell into disrepair, leading to her 2022 Channel 4 show, Katie Price's Mucky Mansion, which saw Katie attempt to renovate the 19-room property . In 2022, her ex-fiancé Carl Woods had been using the garden as a vehicle forecourt for his used car sales business prior to the latest update on the home. Despite the legal notices, Katie insists she isn't being evicted as she told listeners on the latest episode of her The Katie Price Show podcast: 'My house isn't being repossessed. 'I'm not being evicted and I'm not moving into a caravan, although if I had to live in a caravan, you know what the travellers have, I would love that. 'I'll also have another announcement to make on the 28th, bring it on sunshine.' Katie recently claimed that she has been signed off from appearing in court for her mental health, after receiving backlash for missing her last bankruptcy hearing in April to go on holiday to Cyprus with Married At First Sight UK star JJ . She had been due to give evidence about her finances at the High Court, but at the start of the hearing, lawyers said that she had told them at the last minute she couldn't attend due to health issues. A judge described this excuse as 'scanty'. Katie then jetted off on holiday to Ayia Napa with her MAFS star boyfriend, facing public backlash after being spotted sunbathing together by the pool . Taking to her podcast, The Katie Price Show, Katie hit back and claimed she had been signed off from court because she was 'mentally not strong enough'. She was informed by lawyers earlier this month that she would have to move out of the property in in Dial Post, West Sussex, by May 29, after two eviction notices appeared outside her home Taking to Instagram on Monday, Katie shared a clip showing a huge pile of things in her living room that she was set to sell She said: 'Everyone is like 'oh she's missed bankruptcy and she's gone on holiday!' No, let me address it... 'The court knew that I wasn't going to my bankruptcy, because mentally - my consultant at The Priory - I've been signed off for any kind of activity for court. She went on: 'I am taking my bankruptcy so serious, like I do everything else. It's a very serious situation I'm in and it does look like 'oh she's just gone on holiday'... 'No, my head at the moment needs a break. I had four days in my diary where I was able to go away. When I say I'm not mentally able and stable to stand in court at the moment because I have a lot of things going on behind the scenes I'm dealing with... 'I'm mentally not strong enough at the moment to stand in court, be cross examined in front of the media and public.' The court heard that Katie's personal assistant had sent a statement from a consultant psychiatrist saying she had anxiety and depression , as well as other issues affecting her mental health. Barristers for the trustees of Katie's first bankruptcy asked the judge to order her attendance at a future hearing and said she should be 'on notice' that she could be arrested if she did not attend. Katie's Financial Woes 2019 - Katie was declared bankrupt with debts of £3.2m from her failed company Jordan Trading Ltd, that was set up to oversee her perfume and cosmetics line. She set up the company in 2003 but in 2017 an application was put in to wind up the company as she tried to sort out her finances. When she was declared bankrupt she vowed to pay back £12,000 a month to creditors of the firm through an individual voluntary arrangement. The bankruptcy meant Katie, once worth a reported £45million, faced losing her £2million 11-bedroom mansion . She took out a second mortgage on the property in 2015, but faced monthly payments of £12,300. 2022 - The former model had been due to attend the Royal Court of Justice to explain to a judge why she has failed to repay millions owed to creditors. However, the hearing was adjourned at the last minute with her solicitors giving no reason for Katie's no show before the court. March 2024 - She was again declared bankrupt over an unpaid tax bill of £761,994.05. The demand for payment was made by HMRC in October 2023. A court was told the bill 'derives from self-assessments' for 2020-2021 and 2021-22 and includes income VAT, tax, surcharges and interest. Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Sebastian Prentis told the hearing at London's Rolls Building: 'There has been no response from the debtor. The papers are in order. 'There is a substantial debt due from Ms Price to HMRC and therefore I will make a bankruptcy order.' May 2024 - Katie is evicted from her home after being served with a notice and given weeks to leave. She is told bailiffs will arrive at 10am on 29 May to ensure she and any other occupants have vacated the property.

Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. In a speech before Israel’s parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that “despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake. We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told Italy’s SKY TG24 news channel. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, in Abuja, has declared Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as duly elected Bayelsa State governor. A three-member panel of Justices, led by Adekunle Adeleye, upheld the victory of Diri in the November 11, 2023, gubernatorial election and dismissed as lacking in merit, the petition that was brought before it by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Timipre Sylva. In its unanimous decision, the tribunal held that the petitioners failed to adduce any credible evidence to substantiate any of the allegations they raised against the outcome of the election. Consequently, the tribunal struck out as incompetent, all the additional proof of evidence, as well as statements on oath of some of the witnesses that testified for the petitioners. According to the tribunal, the law expressly provided that an election petition must be filed not later than 21 days after the result of an election was declared. It held that such a petition must be accompanied by written statements of all the intended witnesses at the time it was filed. The tribunal held that the decision of Sylva and his party to file their additional proof of evidence and statement on oath of witnesses, long after they had filed the petition, was “tantamount to a surreptitious attempt to amend the case of the petitioners.” The tribunal further dismissed the allegation that the deputy governor, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, tendered a forged University Degree Certificate and NYSC Exemption Certificate, to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in aid of his qualification to contest the election. It held that the allegation was a pre-election matter that ought to be litigated before the Federal High Court, adding that the matter had become statute-barred since the petitioners failed to challenge the genuineness of the certificates, 14 days after it was submitted to INEC. The tribunal held that a court of competent jurisdiction previously determined the issue of Ewhrudjakpo’s educational qualification. Holding that the petitioners were unable to discharge the burden of proof that was placed on them by the law, the three justices unanimously dismissed the petition and declared Duoye Diri of the PDP, the duly elected governor of Bayelsa.",

        "content": "Dear Coleen I have a son who is 30 and he lives with me, along with his daughter. He has full custody and she doesn’t see her mum. I love my son, but he’s on the autistic spectrum, has severe ADHD and mental health issues, and is very hard work. From the age of 17 he’s tried to self-medicate with cocaine . He’s been clean for a year, but it’s damaged him. My issue is the way he treats me. He makes me cry a lot and knocks my self-confidence. I’ve had breast cancer , so I’m on medication for 10 years, which has forced me into menopause, and with that comes terrible sweats and moods. It’s also affected my weight and I’ve gone from size 12 to 16. My son calls me sweaty and fat, has no empathy and has even told me he hopes I get cancer again and die. I know he doesn’t mean it, but it hurts. I used to have loads of confidence. I was in the Army for eight years then a prison officer for 20 years. I was medically retired 10 years ago after two bad assaults left me with leg and back injuries. I got a little concierge job and four masked men armed with sledgehammers robbed the place, tied me up and locked me in the toilet. I seem to be a magnet for this kind of thing! Now I don’t work, I have my prison pension and just look after my granddaughter. My son doesn’t appreciate what I’ve been through or what I do for them both. I’ve thought of throwing him out, but I couldn’t do that to my granddaughter. I’m only 54 and want to do so much more. Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' Coleen says Well, if it wasn’t for your granddaughter, I’d be encouraging you to get away and live your life. But I do appreciate that’s not possible right now. Look, this isn’t a great environment for your granddaughter. It’s horrible and damaging for her to see her dad treat you like this, and you have to point this out to him. What kind of father and role model does he want to be? She needs to learn about healthy relationships and respect for other people. Try to talk to him about this when he’s not in one of his angry moods. And suggest he talks to his doctor to find out if there are any options in terms of medication or counselling. As for you, you’re clearly a woman who’s doing everything for everyone else and nothing for yourself. You’ve had a tough time and come through it all, and you deserve some peace. As difficult as it is, you must find a way to make time for yourself to show yourself some love and kindness. Could your mum or a friend help with childcare occasionally? The positive thing is, your son is clean and working, so it’s all about building on that. Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. Video above: Remembering those we've lost in 2024 He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. \"Bill Walton,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, \"was truly one of a kind.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\"",

        "content": "Basketball legend Bill Walton, who led the to two national titles before winning two championships during his NBA career, has died at the age of 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer. The NBA issued a statement saying Walton died Monday while surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.

That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year under iconic coach John Wooden. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life, Silver said in his statement. \"He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. \"As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life on the court, off the court and during his broadcasting career.

He also worked for CBS and NBC and was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" Silver said. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Celtics (1986).

        "content": "There's a joke among a group of rural nurses: staff shortages would be solved instantly if every hospital had a creche. or signup to continue reading It's a quip that's hit home for Victorian nurse and diabetes educator Leah-Ann Stephenson, who cannot return to work because there are no childcare spots for her 11-month-old son. \"Somebody needs to pick up that business model, especially for nurses, because the demographic is mostly women,\" Ms Stephenson told AAP. \"If they can't get their kids into childcare, they can't get back to work.\" Ms Stephenson was four months pregnant when she joined waiting lists at five centres in Swan Hill, but she has been told her son may not get a spot before he's two. Her employer has been understanding in offering casual shifts and extending her maternity leave by a year, she said. But being unable to return to work is an ongoing frustration. \"In this day and age when women are supposed to be able to do it all, it's certainly not easy.\" It's particularly difficult for families in country towns across Australia, which are often classified as \"childcare deserts\". The term refers to areas where there are three or more children for every childcare place, according to landmark research by Victoria University's Mitchell Institute. A group of more than 50 rural and regional organisations, including Royal Far West, the National Farmers' Federation and the Regional Australia Institute, will on Tuesday call for an urgent fix. The Access for Every Child Coalition, led by advocacy group The Parenthood, will gather at Parliament House in Canberra to push for federal policy changes to address early education inequity. The Parenthood's campaign director Maddy Butler said lack of childcare doesn't just affect families. \"This means local businesses and essential services can't find workers. This is killing towns,\" Ms Butler said. \"Think of a nurse in a rural town who can't go back to work for as many days as she wants, or at all, because there's no childcare available. \"This not only affects her family's income but also the healthcare services that are critical for the community.\" The group is asking for six urgent actions to address shortages, including subsidies for regional early education providers that are not tied to enrolment numbers. It is also calling for the federal government to manage the sector with its state, territory and local counterparts to achieve universal access, as well as incentivising rural childcare workers. While some of those strategies may take time to develop, the coalition is urging the government to provide short-term solutions such as funding for mobile early learning centres. Measures in the federal budget, including a commitment to raise wages for childcare workers, were welcome, but did not go far enough, Ms Butler said. \"It's high time to recognise the unique needs of these communities and act.\" Advertisement Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

        "content": "GATINEAU — The Competition Bureau has launched the consultation process for Canadians as it prepares to launch a market study of competition in domestic air passenger services in Canada. “The airline industry is important to Canadians and the Canadian economy. Since the Canadian population is spread out over vast distances, other modes of transportation may not be feasible replacements for air travel. More competition in the industry will mean lower prices, better services, and improved productivity,” said Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition. News of the bureau’s upcoming study first hit earlier this month. A statement from the Competition Bureau notes that recent events have raised questions about the state of competition in the industry ... The bureau says the market study will allow it to better understand what is driving these issues, and to make recommendations to all levels of government to improve competition in the airline industry. The study will examine how to make it easier for new businesses to compete and easier for consumers to make informed choices. For public feedback, interested parties can submit their comments by June 17 through a feedback form or by emailing airlinemarketstudy-etudemarcheaerien@cb-bc.gc.ca . Following the consultation, the bureau will publish its final terms of reference and officially launch the market study. The final terms of reference will include details on how to provide submissions to the market study.",

        "content": "Linda MacMullen has been battling with a rare autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis (MG) for over two decades. This chronic disorder causes weakness in the skeletal muscles, which are responsible for a wide range of body movements and breathing. Myasthenia gravis can affect various facial muscles, altering a person’s ability to smile, chew, swallow, and control their eye movements. One of the most common symptoms experienced by people diagnosed with the disorder is becoming exhausted and feeling weaker following brief periods of physical activity or after performing everyday tasks. “Symptoms can be very mild where it just affects your eyes or it could be very severe where you end up in the hospital on a ventilator,” explained MacMullen. However, perhaps the most debilitating symptom of MG, according to MacMullen, is one that is not visible. “When you get diagnosed, the biggest thing is that you feel so alone,” said MacMullen. “When I was diagnosed, I’d never heard of my myasthenia and I was a nurse. (My) biggest (goal now) is breaking this isolation (and helping others.)” Though this disease has no cure to date, the prospect of a new drug called Vyvgart, approved by Health Canada in late 2023, gives hope to MacMullen. “One of my friends in Ontario is getting that treatment right now so we’re all waiting to see how well it works with her,” she said. “Anything that can give people a better quality of life and allow them to do the things that give them pleasure (I’m all for it.)” In the meantime, as June approaches, marking Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Month, MacMullen invites residents of the Comox Valley and beyond to a walk she organizes annually. “(I’m doing this walk) mainly to raise awareness (and) funds,” said MacMullen. “The more awareness we create, the more people know about it. Right now, my whole focus is on improving (people’s) quality of life.” MacMullen explained that any donations can go a long way. “(With more funding we) would offer more support to patients and caregivers dealing with myasthenia gravis. It would also allow me to organize more events like online support groups where we have guest speakers and get more information about new upcoming treatments.” This year’s event will be held at Courtenay’s Woodcote Park and is scheduled for June 23, starting at 10 a.m. Hot dogs and water will be offered at the end of the walk. Donations are appreciated and can be made on-site. To learn more about myasthenia gravis, visit",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Gaza's Rafah was a \"tragic accident\" which his government was investigating. \"In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,\" Netanyahu told parliament. He added that \"we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions\" after Gaza's health ministry reported 45 dead as the strike late Sunday sparked a fire that tore through a tent city for displaced Gazans. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip also said that 249 people were wounded. Israel faced a wave of international condemnation on Monday over the Rafah strike, including from across the region as well from the European Union, France and the United Nations. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on \"precise intelligence information\" about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It also said \"the strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF (army) has encouraged civilians to evacuate\" since the ground operation began in Rafah. Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in his Knesset address while being heckled by relatives of hostages held in Gaza, and vowed to keep up the battle to destroy Hamas. \"There is no substitute for absolute victory\" in Gaza, he told the chamber. Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war in Gaza began. \"They pressured us then,\" said Netanyahu, before listing calls to refrain from military operations which Israel carried out anyway. \"Don't enter Gaza. We entered! Do not enter Shifa! We entered! Do not enter Khan Yunis! We entered! Do not enter Rafah! We entered!\" he said. \"I don't give up and I won't give up! I stand up to pressures from home and abroad.",

        "content": "The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) reported a smooth start to the casting of special votes on Monday, despite some glitches resulting in voting stations opening late in parts of the country. The first official day of voting inside the country was marred by isolated protests - in the Eastern Cape and parts of Gauteng - and there were reports of voting stations failing to open, but the IEC indicated that only 0.1% of those casting their votes experienced problems doing so. The IEC's deputy chief electoral commissioner, Masego Sheburi, said that, from 14:00 on Monday, around 201 794 people visited voting stations to cast special votes across the country. A total of 1 668 076 people had applied for special votes. Of these, 624 593 citizens will be visited by 62 000 officials over the next two days. \"Reports of difficulties were insignificant... about 0.1% reported challenges compared to those [stations] that opened and were run smoothly,\" he said. READ | Special votes day 1: Slow queues, a sense of obligation, and a lamp post Rickroll He said a record number of voters had applied for special votes this time around, with more than 1.6 million voters applying for special votes this year compared to the 774 000 who applied in 2019. \"The Electoral Commission is happy with the turnout and urges South Africans to continue to go out in their numbers to vote on 29 May 2024. \"Owing to the good preparations, the commission was able to open the majority of voting stations in the Eastern Cape, in the face of protests which had nothing to do with elections.\" He told journalists that 107 of the 435 voting stations meant to open remained closed due to \"external factors\". The IEC is pushing to ensure that all voting stations open on Tuesday. Some voting stations failed to open due to a lack of stationary - ballot papers and envelopes. Special votes are cast using a two-envelope system. The voter places their ballots into an envelope in the ballot box, which is then inserted into a second envelope, with the name and identity number of the individual, before being placed in the ballot box. This ensures that all votes cast are accounted for when they are counted. Special votes are counted along with the bulk votes, which are cast on 29 May. Special votes continue on Tuesday, ahead of the election day for the rest of the country on Wednesday, with polls opening at 07:00.",

        "content": "Citrusy soft drink is making another attempt to catch on in Japan . Within the Japanese beverage world, Mello Yello is sort of a cryptid. It’s a drink not a lot of people haven’t heard of, and even among those who have, even fewer have seen it for themselves. It first came to Japan in the 1980s, and while it’s been offered on and off since, it’s never stuck around for very long and has been completely absent from the Japanese market since 2021. But right now Japan has an opportunity to get acquainted with the citrusy soda, as convenience store chain Lawson has brought Mello Yello back to Japan . For its part, Lawson seems fully aware that Mello Yello doesn’t have the highest level of name-recognition within Japan, with its above announcement image reading “That Mello Yello drink has returned!? Not really sure what it is, but try it!” The accompanying press release recalls that when Mello Yello was first brought to Japan, its official slogan was “A taste that’s very difficult to describe in words,” and admits that many of the chain’s present-day customers may react to its return with something along the lines of “It first came out here in the 1980s? I wasn’t even born then, so I don’t know what this stuff is.” It is a bit of an uphill marketing battle, seeing as how even in its home country of the United States, Mello Yello is seen by many as an imitation of Mountain Dew, a drink itself which hasn’t really caught on in Japan ( the Sanrio Mountain Dew public bath notwithstanding ). Still, Mello Yello isn’t without its fans in Japan, finishing in first place in 2006 in a poll by Internet portal Goo Ranking for “discontinued soft drinks we want to drink again.” All the same, the brand managers apparently realize that Mello Yello piggybacking on some more famous brands will probably help its sales potential, and so it’s officially being called Coca-Cola Fanta Citrus Mello Yello . Coca-Cola Fanta Citrus Mello Yello, priced at 162 yen (US$1.05) is on sale now exclusively at Lawson stores. While the chain hasn’t explicitly said anything about it being a limited-time release, given the highly competitive nature of the soft drink scene in Japan, it’s probably best to go grab a few bottles sooner rather than later.

        "description": "The sensitive updates to this Victorian home have refreshed its look without compromising on heritage charm",
        "content": "The renovation of this family home in Brookline, MA, was all about finding the right balance. The 1905-built Victorian home already had plenty of period charm – all part of the original – but its new owners wanted to add in a few key user-friendly details that you'd be more likely to find in a newly built home. How to update a heritage property without sacrificing its character and meaningful details: that was the challenge for this renovation. To ensure they came up with the right solution the owners enlisted the help of . 'This project spoke to our design hearts with the encouragement to create a masterful blend and bring something fresh to the table,' says principal Vani Sayeed, who describes how she gave the historic home a new lease of life, all the while being mindful of its unique character. 'The goal was to first update the interior architecture by moving a few walls, restoring some of the original architectural details and adding important design elements to elevate and make all spaces not only functional but beautiful and inviting,' says designer Vani Sayeed. 'The client wanted an updated space that had the charm and architectural details of a bygone era but with all the bells and whistles and comforts of a modern home.' The renovation kept the basic layout of a classic Victorian home as the homeowner was drawn to more private areas to entertain, such as a formal dining room, separate kitchen and this cozy parlor . The Roman shades fabric is Sacho Clouds from TM Interiors, with a coffee table from Restoration Hardware, and wall sconces from Urban Electric. The artworks are from the owners' existing Collection, with some from Vani Sayeed. 'This project was a collaboration between client and designer based on a mutual love of classic New England architecture, the ethereal beauty of the California coastline and the grand Rocky Mountains of Colorado,' explains Vani Sayeed. 'With this in mind as the inspiration we aspired to create spaces that reflected the calming rejuvenating quality found in nature.' This comfortable space includes a custom rug from Vani Sayeed's Global Chic Collection, with the designer selecting the perfect for the living room. Vani Sayeed Studios is an award-winning multi-discipline design firm. Vani Sayeed is the firm’s principal; well known for her globally inspired and beautifully layered spaces. She was awarded Interior Designer of the Year 2023 by IFDA, New England. Her inspiration comes from a worldly well-travelled and creative perspective. She is informed by a diverse sensibility of design, art and architecture. The ethos of the studio is to honor classical traditions, while embracing novelty and innovation. While the furnishings and furniture are contemporary, the bones of the house clearly reference the property's Victorian origins. Details such as the striking bay windows and smart architectural moldings truly ground the home and ensure it keeps its character, even though it has been updated to make for a more comfortable family life. Tucked into an original alcove, this stylish enhances and makes good use of the Victorian architecture. 'The kitchen was completely gutted down to studs and redesigned to create a larger footprint, along with new windows, cabinets and state-of-the-art appliances,' says Vani. are light and bright with white cabinetry and a dark blue custom-built island providing a good contrast with the white units. The cabinets are from Signature, the countertops are white quartzite in a leather finish and the island is in the dramatic quartzite explosion blue leathered 2.5” mitered edge were at the heart of Vani's redesigned kitchen, with the trio of contemporary pendant lights above the counter becoming a new focal point. Coming up with the right for the redesigned kitchen took some thinking. Vani knew there should be a second element of contrast with the white cabinetry, besides the dark marble-topped island, and the custom stainless steel hood in a more traditional style proved to be the perfect choice, inspired by a Henry Moore sculpture, says Vani. 'These old houses are full of surprises,' says Vani, 'but the one thing that actually turned into a major plus is the breakfast nook in the kitchen. It was carved out of a found space during our demolition of the old kitchen. Instead of boarding it back up, we realigned some of the structure and utilized this valuable real estate by incorporating it into a spot for breakfast with hidden LED lighting.' Anyone looking for will surely be inspired by this treatment. 'We covered the niche in a cool blue crocodile pattern wall covering from Elitis, adding stainless steel open shelves and gorgeous oak details,' adds Vani. Although the owner was keen to embrace separate and formal , this space sits at the heart of the home, with enlarged doorways through to the kitchen and foyer. The central position adds to the impression that you are in an intimate, cozy space – the perfect setting for good mealtime conversations. 'We love this dining room with walls covered in Elitis Luminescent Isis. The gold hammered effect of the wall covering makes your skin glow!' says designer Vani. Furniture includes a custom-designed dining table with a steel base and mahogany top, flanked by chairs from Dowel Furniture. The jewel pieces are the host and hostess chairs by Jamie Stern in two different fabrics. The backs are a bold Schumacher Tabriz, the inside fabric is Perennials' Classy design. The area rug is the Summer Day Walk, from Vani Sayeed's Global Chic Collection, the chandelier is from Urban Electric. Making a big impact as you walk in the front door is the imposing but welcoming . 'The two-level foyer has beautiful architectural woodwork that has been restored to its original beauty. The lighting is Urban Electric, the fireplace has been updated with a gas insert and beautiful Fossil Black Quartzite surround,' says Vani. took shape around a dramatic wool runner from Merida Rugs, which provides a great foundation to the bold art on the wall. On the hallway's lower level, this corner creates an appealing display moment with a dark wood table and bench grounding a fine landscape painting and a collection of treasured ceramics. Having the luxury of space and quirky alcoves to create interesting displays like this is something that older character homes do well. The window treatments in this calm are made in Clodagh, a simple fabric from Perennials, the bed is Room & Board flanked on either side by wall sconces from Estiluz, with a beautiful nude painting from the owner's collection. The primary bathroom is spacious with a shower and separate soaking tub. include shower walls covered in a green marble mosaic and the floor is a 12“x24“ faux marble porcelain tile from Porcelanosa. The roll-top bath and dark wood vanity reference the home's original 19th-century style. bring a playful twist to the guest facilities. The quirky Buggie Atomic 29 wallcovering by Abnormals Anonymous lends a fun element to the walls, with custom-made copper plumbing adding the luxurious finishing touches. It's the thoughtful details in this historic home's redesign that so successfully bridge the gap between period charm and modern-day comforts. New items are designed to blend with original features, bringing a fresh perspective and new life to this old home. Interior design: Photography:",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Gaza's Rafah was a \"tragic accident\" which his government was investigating. \"In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,\" Netanyahu told parliament. He added that \"we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions\" after Gaza's health ministry reported 45 dead as the strike late Sunday sparked a fire that tore through a tent city for displaced Gazans. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip also said that 249 people were wounded. Israel faced a wave of international condemnation on Monday over the Rafah strike, including from across the region as well from the European Union, France and the United Nations. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on \"precise intelligence information\" about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It also said \"the strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF (army) has encouraged civilians to evacuate\" since the ground operation began in Rafah. Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in his Knesset address while being heckled by relatives of hostages held in Gaza, and vowed to keep up the battle to destroy Hamas. \"There is no substitute for absolute victory\" in Gaza, he told the chamber. Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war in Gaza began. \"They pressured us then,\" said Netanyahu, before listing calls to refrain from military operations which Israel carried out anyway. \"Don't enter Gaza. We entered! Do not enter Shifa! We entered! Do not enter Khan Yunis! We entered! Do not enter Rafah! We entered!\" he said. \"I don't give up and I won't give up! I stand up to pressures from home and abroad.\" The Gaza war broke out after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry. To remove this article -",

        "content": "RAFA NADAL was given a hero’s send-off in Paris as he waved goodbye to the French Open for possibly the final time. Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were present on Court Philippe-Chatrier to witness the abdication of the King of Clay. This was the hottest ticket in town as Nadal – winner of a record 14 French Opens since 2005 – bid farewell to the place where he is adored the most. Alex Zverev , the No 4 seed, was simply too strong and wily and ended up succeeding in straight sets 6-3 7-6 6-3 over more than three hours. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down on his shield like a true warrior and did not disgrace himself – he was just beaten by the better man on his special occasion. At times, we did see glimpses of the racquet-wielding matador at his best. But it was too infrequent to knock out the German, who prevailed two years after their last encounter in the semi-finals when he tore ankle ligaments in a horror fall. For what we assume is the last time on these grounds, Nadal shook hands with his opponent at the net and then the umpire before putting away his racquets and zipping up his bag. The noise was deafening when he arrived on court holding the hand of a ball kid under a closed roof due to the rain. And it was equally as ear-splitting when he departed, the climax to a record-breaking two-decade spell on Parisian clay. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Technically this is not his final appearance on this red surface as he wants to return for the Paris Olympics in late July and early August with the intention of playing at least men’s doubles with Alcaraz. However, Nadal is unlikely to play at Wimbledon because the quick transition of clay-grass-clay might ruin his chances of a third Olympic medal in the French capital. But he even teased he might return for the 2025 French Open, saying that he would not commit 100% to this being his swansong event. He said: \"I don’t know if it is the last time I am here in front of you, honestly. \"I’m not 100%. If it is the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole two weeks of preparation.\" There was no specially-arranged farewell presentation for the 22-time major winner on his request. Yet the sight of so many active stars, including his biggest rivals, in the stands was, in a way, its own tribute. The whole Nadal clan were in attendance, too, with a debut appearance for son Rafael Jr, who was born in October 2022. The travelling party also included grey-haired uncle Miguel, 57, whose penalty for Spain was saved by England goalkeeper David Seaman in the quarter-final shootout of Euro 96 at Wembley. Manchester City star Rodri, fresh from the FA Cup final defeat , had managed to nab a ticket to watch his fellow compatriot and joined in with the morale-boosting chants of Rafa. This was Nadal’s fourth defeat in 116 matches here and the first time he has exited from the first round as he sent a forehand wide and long. His Roland Garros record is one of the most astonishing ever witnessed in professional sport and it is unlikely his dominance will be replicated. There is already a statue of him in full flow next to the main arena and it will act as a reminder for future generations just how exceptional he was on this surface. Nadal continued: \"Today the feeling I have is difficult to describe in words. \"For me, it’s special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. \"I have been going through a tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be here at Roland Garros. \"The first round hasn’t been the ideal one. I have to say I needed something else, I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. \"It’s difficult to say what happens in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back here. I cannot say 100%. I am having fun, the body is feeling better than two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say, it’s enough. I cannot give anything else. I don’t feel it yet. \"I have goals in front of me. I hope to be back for the Olympics. That motivates me. I hope to be well prepared. \"It has been a very beautiful process, all the memories, every single year were different, but not less special. Unforgettable feelings.

Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down on his shield like a true warrior and did not disgrace himself – he was just beaten by the better man on his special occasion. At times, we did see glimpses of the racquet-wielding matador at his best. But it was too infrequent to knock out the German, who prevailed two years after their last encounter in the semi-finals when he tore ankle ligaments in a horror fall. For what we assume is the last time on these grounds, Nadal shook hands with his opponent at the net and then the umpire before putting away his racquets and zipping up his bag. The noise was deafening when he arrived on court holding the hand of a ball kid under a closed roof due to the rain. And it was equally as ear-splitting when he departed, the climax to a record-breaking two-decade spell on Parisian clay. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Technically this is not his final appearance on this red surface as he wants to return for the Paris Olympics in late July and early August with the intention of playing at least men’s doubles with Alcaraz. However, Nadal is unlikely to play at Wimbledon because the quick transition of clay-grass-clay might ruin his chances of a third Olympic medal in the French capital. But he even teased he might return for the 2025 French Open, saying that he would not commit 100% to this being his swansong event. He said: \"I don’t know if it is the last time I am here in front of you, honestly. \"I’m not 100%. If it is the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole two weeks of preparation.\" There was no specially-arranged farewell presentation for the 22-time major winner on his request. Yet the sight of so many active stars, including his biggest rivals, in the stands was, in a way, its own tribute. The whole Nadal clan were in attendance, too, with a debut appearance for son Rafael Jr, who was born in October 2022. The travelling party also included grey-haired uncle Miguel, 57, whose penalty for Spain was saved by England goalkeeper David Seaman in the quarter-final shootout of Euro 96 at Wembley. Manchester City star Rodri, fresh from the FA Cup final defeat , had managed to nab a ticket to watch his fellow compatriot and joined in with the morale-boosting chants of Rafa. This was Nadal’s fourth defeat in 116 matches here and the first time he has exited from the first round as he sent a forehand wide and long. His Roland Garros record is one of the most astonishing ever witnessed in professional sport and it is unlikely his dominance will be replicated. There is already a statue of him in full flow next to the main arena and it will act as a reminder for future generations just how exceptional he was on this surface. Nadal continued: \"Today the feeling I have is difficult to describe in words. \"For me, it’s special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. \"I have been going through a tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be here at Roland Garros. \"The first round hasn’t been the ideal one. I have to say I needed something else, I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. \"It’s difficult to say what happens in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back here. I cannot say 100%. I am having fun, the body is feeling better than two months ago. \"Maybe in two months I say, it’s enough. I cannot give anything else. I don’t feel it yet. \"I have goals in front of me. I hope to be back for the Olympics. That motivates me. I hope to be well prepared. \"It has been a very beautiful process, all the memories, every single year were different, but not less special. Unforgettable feelings. I hope to see you again but I don’t know.\"",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

David Zalubowski via Associated Press Bill Walton, an NBA Hall of Fame center who got his start at UCLA before winning NBA championships with the Portland Trail Blazers and the Boston Celtics, has died. Walton, 71, passed away after “a prolonged battle with cancer,” the NBA said in a statement Monday. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.” Advertisement “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver went on. “He was a regular presence at league events ― always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” “As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him,” Silver said. “My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.” This is a developing story.

        "description": "As we bid farewell to Ambassador Raveesh Kumar, the esteemed Indian representative in Finland, we reflect on his impactful tenure that began amidst the challenging backdrop of the global pandemic. Ambassador Kumar has been known for his active engagement during his time here, working to strengthen the bond between India and Finland. In this interview, we have the privilege of gaining insights from Ambassador Kumar as he shares his experiences, achievements, and perspectives garnered during his engaging four-year term in Finland.",
        "content": "You arrived in Finland just as the pandemic began. How was it to commence your mission during such challenging times? I arrived in Finland with my family in July 2020, in the middle of Covid pandemic. There were restrictions on movement, on meeting people. It felt like we were constantly navigating uncharted territory. Everything from remote work setups to health protocols kept changing, and it was a challenge to keep up. It was a test of adaptability and resilience like never before. I was fortunate to present my credentials to then President Niinistö and continued with our outreach initiatives. Even though it was a tough period, I think we all came out of it stronger in some way. It’s all behind us now, thankfully. You've been one of the most active ambassadors in Finland. Could you summarize your tenure here? Were you able to achieve your envisioned goals? As diplomats, we all are expected to do some groundwork before proceeding on our assignment. But then, implementation depends on the ground realities. And here, I was quite fortunate to be around when our relations are looking up and have acquired a certain momentum. The backdrop of the evolving geopolitical order played its part too. We have Finland as a member of NATO, part of Nordic-BALTIC framework and an influential voice in the EU. India is an important voice for the global south, the 5th largest and fastest growing economy and a country shaping the global narrative. We have a far larger global footprint and are members of several multilateral organisations like I2U2, BRICS, SCO, and recently launched India-Middle East-Europe initiative, Global Biofuel Alliance, ISA, etc. So, despite our own preoccupations, it goes to the credit of both countries that our relations have acquired substance and character. I had twin broad objectives in mind when I arrived here – present the new India with a rising geopolitical profile as a land of opportunities; and leverage the dynamism of the Indian community in Finland for strengthening our bilateral ties. The launch of DESI (Digitalisation, Education, Sustainability and Innovation) initiative, first-in person meeting between Prime Ministers, frequent Ministerial exchanges, opening of a new Finnish Consulate in Mumbai, record high trade figure of € 3 bn, growing investment by both sides, record participation at SLUSH and discussion on facilitating mobility are the highlights. We are working on creating a framework to cooperate in Quantum and in Sustainability. They all demonstrate the keen desire of both countries to engage in a concrete manner with each other in areas which are of interest and relevance to both countries as we celebrate 75 years of our diplomatic relations. On the Indian community, I am proud to represent a widely respected vibrant community. We managed to bring them together on a number of platforms like Friends of India and Finland (a platform representing 16 Indian community associations), India Business and Professionals Forum, connecting top Indian professionals and entrepreneurs and Finland India Network of Researchers and Academics. India Day, a festival celebrating friendship between both countries, is a proud product of the vibrant Indian community. You introduced the Open Doors initiative, allowing any Indian citizen to visit you twice a month without an appointment. How successful was this initiative, and what insights did you gain into the Indian community in Finland? The idea of Open House was to be accessible and transparent to the people. And to connect to the people who otherwise are outside the footprint of the Embassy. I managed to meet so many interesting people and learn from their own cumulative experiences in Finland. With the rapid growth of the Indian community in Finland, particularly in skilled IT sectors, how has this impacted the embassy's operations? Are there concerns about brain drain from India? The Indian community has emerged as a strong bridge connecting India and Finland. They are a well-placed and well-respected community in Finland. A community which contributes economically and socially to Finland. They are among the highest tax payers and well-integrated into the fabric of the Finnish society. We are leveraging their presence for a stronger bilateral connection between both countries. Were there any significant cultural adjustments or \"culture shocks\" you experienced during your four years in Finland? Well...’culture shock’ is too strong a word. Moving to Finland definitely involved some adjustments, especially related to weather, as with any international move. I found some aspects of Finnish culture different from what I was used to. I mean, where else can you enjoy sitting in a sauna at 90 degrees Celsius, and then jump into an ice-cold lake for fun? But once you absorb it with an open mind, it is not only a memorable experience, but also gives insights into the rich Finnish culture and tradition. As you prepare to lead the Indian mission in Prague and your successor takes over in Helsinki, what advice have you given regarding Finland, and what insights has your colleague offered about the Czech Republic? Well, I am in regular touch with my colleague and friend, Hemant, who is succeeding me as Ambassador and I take his place in Prague. We are discussing the upcoming agenda for both of us, as well as exchanging notes on the lighter side of things. On a lighter note, I am going to advise him to get a dog, to his your social circle in the neighbourhood! If you could provide feedback to the Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs and your counterparts here, what would it entail? I had an excellent working relationship with the Foreign Ministry and other Ministries in Finland. I was quite delighted that there was the same level of enthusiasm to expand our partnership. I would say that we need to work together to elevate the relationship into a different orbit. Could you discuss the impact of your tenure on fostering collaborations, promoting cultural exchange, facilitating trade and investment, and engaging with the Indian diaspora in Finland? It may not be appropriate for me to judge my own tenure. It is for others to assess. I can, however, say that I was fortunate to be in Finland when there is plenty of goodwill on both sides. I strived to play my part in encouraging collaborations, promoting cultural exchange and facilitating trade and investment. Additionally, engaging with the Indian diaspora in Finland has been a rewarding experience, as we have worked together to build a supportive and vibrant community that strengthens the ties between our countries. While there is always more work to be done, I am satisfied with the strides we have made so far. Could you share any memorable experiences or anecdotes from your time as ambassador in Finland? There are many that come to my mind. My recent meeting with President Stubb and former Prime Minister Sanna Marin. My trips to 14 towns outside Helsinki, Yoga at midnight at Oonasvara in Rovaniemi, being among the many thousands at Savonlinna Opera Festival and the sheer thrill and energy of Jyvaskyla car rally. I would also highlight the whole experience of organising India Day 2023 with a dedicated and selfless team of volunteers. The warmth and enthusiasm of the community, combined with the participation of our Finnish friends, truly highlighted the beautiful blend of our cultures. India Day 2024 on 18 August at Meripuisto celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations between India and Finland promises to be one big celebration. Alexis Kouros Helsinki Times",

        "content": "If we were glossing over it before now, the best time to sound the alarm was yesterday. Next best time? Today. As we celebrate our ‘future’ on this special ‘Children’s day’ in Nigeria, it’s important that we have conversations around their diet, health and wellness too. Today more than ever, there is an alarming increase in our children’s consumption of junk food like sugary drinks, sweets, and fast foods over nutritious, healthy and homemade meals. The dangerous impact of such shows in the rise of diet-related health conditions like childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart and kidney diseases, and even behavioral issues to mention a few. What’s even worse are future projections by the experts, with the already alarming figures expected to more than double in the next 10-20 years. In Nigeria alone, the rate of childhood obesity has more than doubled in recent decades. This surge is largely attributed to the increasing consumption of junk food, which is high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and empty calories. Such poor dietary habits affect not just their health for today, but also sets the unhealthy stage for chronic illnesses later in life. Furthermore, considering the many other peculiar challenges in Nigeria outside of our locus of control (insecurity, inflation, etc), wisdom submits that we take absolute control over the diet and health of our children. Indeed, such unhealthy foods are pervasive due to factors like convenience especially in light of the increasingly busy lifestyle of parents, and then the aggressive and appealing marketing of these foods; however sacrificing the future health of our children over convenience today is not exactly a win, is it? Children are really the future, and if the future will be healthy, then it is time to SAVE our children and intentionally raise Wellness Champions. This however requires the collective effort of parents, educators, health care providers, and policymakers to model, teach and promote healthier eating habits and lifestyle choices. Thankfully, it’s not all doom and gloom. When people know better, they actually do better, which is why in celebration of our National Children’s Day, the documentary “Save Our Children” by Eziaha Bolaji-Olojo, which highlights the importance of diet, nutrition and healthy living premieres. This Documentary aims at educating and sparking up conversations that lead to every stakeholder – adults and children alike – taking better action to raise and be ‘Wellness Champions’. Inside the Documentary, you will be hearing from leading professionals in the child health and wellness space, including Dr. Babayemi Osinaike, Senior Consultant Pediatrician at LUTH, Sharon Selby, Australia’s Leading Allergy Health Coach, Onyinye Ovbiagele, mum who reversed autism with a Nutrition protocol and Integrative Health Coach, Dumebi Ehigiator, Renowned Educator and School Owner, Eziaha Bolaji-Olojo, author of the book ‘Wellness Champions’, and more. Underscoring the importance of diet in preventing and reversing health issues while showcasing real-life success stories and expert advice on how to raise Wellness Champions, parents and caregivers are sure to be inspired to truly save our children’s health, not just from the hospitals, but from the kitchen. In conjunction with the documentary, we are excited to announce the launch of the book “Wellness Champions” on Saturday, June 29, 2024, at MUSON centre, Lagos, Nigeria. This book, a beautiful marriage of real life and fiction, provides relatable lessons, practical guidance and engaging activities to help children (and adults) embrace healthy eating habits and lifestyles. The health crisis affecting our children is not just a medical issue but a societal one, and by raising awareness and providing the necessary tools and knowledge, we can ensure that the future is healthy. The “Save Our Children” documentary and the “Wellness Champions” book are tools to help us achieve that and lead us joyfully into a healthier tomorrow.

        "content": "POCATELLO — A bear escaped from the Ross Park Zoo in Pocatello in 1969 after police said vandals apparently cut a hole in its cage. The was featured in our weekly column, which looks back on what life was like during certain time periods in east Idaho history. EastIdahoNews.com readers wanted to know what happened to the bear, and this is what we found out. The 250-pound female was about three years old when she escaped May 4, 1969, according to the Idaho State Journal. The bear, which had recently after coming out of hibernation, took off between midnight on Saturday and 2 a.m. Sunday. “Freeing the animals not only is dangerous to the public but is cruel to the animals, which are not accustomed to surviving in the wild,” city zookeeper DeMar Day told the Journal. The Journal reported over a week after the bear went missing, on , that it had been seen in the lava rock area above the Cheyenne Crossing of the Union Pacific Railroad. “The bear drinks out of a watering trough in a nearby pasture,” city parks assistant Leonard Carlson stated. “The animal will be captured and returned to the zoo as soon as the state fish and game department has the necessary equipment here.” At that time, Carlson announced on top of vandals cutting a hole in the bear’s cage, “continued vandalism” was happening at Ross Park. The city council offered a $50 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone tampering with the pens and releasing zoo animals. Carlson also said anyone caught in either upper or lower levels of the park after 11 p.m. would be arrested. “The arrests will be made by Safeguard Systems Inc., the private security firm hired by the city to patrol the park,” the Journal mentioned. “The city council recently engaged Safeguard Systems, operated by Anson Garrett ... Garrett is equipped with specially trained police dogs.” Almost three months after the article on the planned attempt to capture the bear was written, the the bear had not been captured after all and was found dead. The Journal said the bear died of starvation. “The carcass was only skin and bones when found recently in lava rock about two blocks south of the park,” Day stated. He had predicted the bear couldn’t survive outside the zoo because there wasn’t enough fish or wild berries in the vicinity to provide food for the animal. “She was last seen alive about two weeks (after her escape) in the same area where she died,” the article states. Day believed the bear had been dead about a month when the animal was found. To remove this article -",

        "description": "If you've heard about the \"pro touring\" and \"restomod\" car-building styles, you might be wondering how they're different. Let's take a look.",
        "content": "Classic cars have an aura all of their own, with lines like the 1969 Ford Mustang having a signature style that sets them apart from even their sportiest, edgiest modern-day descendants. But while owning a classic big-block muscle car may seem like a great idea on paper, the reality may not be quite so rosy. Sure, it'll go fast in a straight line, but if you're used to modern cars you may find other aspects of the authentic vintage experience — overly-soft suspensions and sub-par braking systems, to name a couple — hard to live with. That's where restomods and pro-touring restorations come into the picture. Both approaches aim to retain the old-school aesthetic appeal of a vintage car while bringing the driving experience up to the 21st century with modern upgrades and tweaks. They're not for purists who want that \"blast from the past\" feel of a vintage car, warts and all, but they're a great way to immerse yourself in the vibe of the '60s or '70s without all of the sacrifices of the original model. If you want a modern experience with classic looks, then a restomod or pro-touring car is the way to go. But what do these terms mean, exactly, and how do you differentiate and choose between the two? Let's dive in. The term \"restomod\" is a portmanteau of \"restoration\" and \"modified,\" which explains the whole concept of a restomod remarkably well. They prioritize the restoration aspect, keeping a car close — or identical — to factory spec aesthetically while modifying it to improve the overall driving experience. However, restomods generally don't go too extreme with the modifications, retaining many of the qualities of the original car while bringing it up to modern-day standards. How much work gets put into a restomod will vary depending on the original car and what the builder's goals are. However, most restomods tend to feature updated handling and safety features — modern brakes, power steering, updated suspension — and creature comforts like new interiors and infotainment systems. New powertrains are also quite common, especially the (in)famous LS swap — one of the most popular engine swaps for a classic car using General Motors' LS V8. Another common modification is new wheels and tires, with larger diameter and width almost always the order of the day. The end goal of a restomod is to make a classic car more livable on a daily basis, bringing the reliability and drivability up to standards one would expect from a new, showroom-fresh car. It's a step beyond a traditional restoration, but isn't quite as extreme as a pro-touring car and its track-centric focus. Take a look at Singer's 911 restomods, such as the Octagon Commission , which has a traditional exterior married with a luxuriously updated interior and tuned engine. Pro touring cars are a step beyond conventional restomods. While they start from the same principles of modernizing and updating a classic car, builders of pro-touring models — especially muscle cars — often have the express goal of outpacing a modern, high-performance counterpart in a straight line and around corners. As the \"pro\" in the name might suggest, pro-touring cars are generally competition-focused — they emphasize autocross and road circuit performance, albeit without entirely compromising on daily driver comforts. This can involve a lot more work than a restomod as it requires modifications to most, if not all, aspects of the car to bring it up to a whole new level. Pro-touring cars can have all-new suspension setups with much lower ride heights and stiffer springs for better handling, paired with bigger wheels and sticky, high-performance tires. Engine and transmission upgrades are also par for the course, with some builds going so far as to use an entirely new chassis to take all that extra power and improve handling. Pro-touring cars can also feature modified bodies with new aerodynamics to further tweak the car's handling behavior — such as improving downforce for road courses. The term \"pro touring\" dates back to the early 1990s and a modified 1969 Camaro that competed in the 1993 One Lap of America. The Camaro, known as \"Tri-Tip,\" rocked a 400-cubic-inch small-block engine, Corvette ZR1 brakes, new 17-inch wheels, and weight-reducing parts such as a fiberglass hood. It set the template for — and kicked off — the whole pro-touring movement. [Image by Michel Curi via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY 2.0 ] Both approaches focus on improving a classic car and go beyond simply restoring it to its old glory. In that regard, the two approaches are more similar than they are different. In fact, there is an argument to be made that \"restomod\" is a blanket term that covers pro touring as well. After all, both involve restoring a car before modifying it to suit whatever standards the owner wants — whether it's simply a classic car that can keep up with traffic and handle decently, or a track-focused monster capable of eating up Lamborghinis for lunch. Restomod and pro-touring builders also modify similar parts of a car, just to differing degrees. Modified suspensions? Check. Improved brakes and steering? Present on restomods and pro-touring cars. Even modified (or entirely new) engines and transmissions aren't solely the domain of pro-touring models, with restomods often opting for upgraded powertrains. Witness the Volvo P1800 Cyan GT Restomod and its 2-liter, 300-400 horsepower engine, which is a far cry from the 100 horsepower its stock 1.8-liter engine produces. If you boil the two terms down, they're more similar than they are different. But, as with so many things, it's the finer details that can help us separate the two. Pro-touring and restomod cars may have a similar basic philosophy, but the two differ greatly in their end results. Restomods are often more faithful to the base model — their mods are meant to modernize without losing the spirit of the original. For instance, Singer's Dynamics and Lightweighting Study 911 makes many changes to the original, with a stiffer body and various tweaks to the powertrain and transmission. Despite these tweaks, the restomod retains the original's handling characteristics. Notably, Top Gear tested the vehicle and found that the 911 had all the over- and understeer traits of the original, just in a more manageable form. It's still recognizably a Porsche 911 from the early 1990s generation , but with power and grip levels elevated closer to that of a modern performance car. Contrast that to a pro-touring build like Chris Smith's 1970 Camaro , which is an almost all-new car underneath the classic Chevrolet Camaro styling . Starting as an empty shell, Smith bolted on all-new front and rear suspension systems courtesy of Speedtech Performance, with Wilwood brakes all around. A 720-horsepower 427 LS7 engine sits underneath the hood, mated to a new sequential transmission. There's also a huge spoiler on the back, plus carbon fiber panels aplenty. The end result is a Camaro capable of navigating a small autocross circuit in a way that an original could only dream of. If you're in the market for a modernized classic, the decision between a restomod and pro-touring build primarily comes down to what you want out of your car. If you're interested in a daily driver and want your car to retain an old-school feel without the old-school headaches, then a more conservative restomod is likely the way to go. On the other hand, if you're after pure performance and competitive racing, a pro-touring build might just be what the doctor ordered. It's really just a matter of degrees, and how extreme of a car you want. Price comes into the picture, too, but the blurred line between pro-touring and restomods means it's hard to make a definitive statement about which of the two styles will be cheaper to build. Pro-touring cars can definitely cost a lot, and six-figure investments are not unheard-of — and probably quite common. But while restomods can be much cheaper, there are always exceptions. Some enthusiasts have put well over $100,000 into their restomods before selling them off for much less than what it cost them to build. That final point is perhaps a saving grace: If you're happy buying instead of building, you can often buy restomods and pro-tourer cars for surprisingly affordable prices — at least, compared to what the builders spent. We've seen pro-touring cars boasting $100,000 worth of parts selling for less than $80,000. That's really a steal, provided you can live with someone else's parts choices.",

        "content": "In today’s MetroTalk , readers are wondering if the upcoming general election will finally bring some change or if we’ll just see more of the same. One reader wants us to remember the challenges the Tories had to deal with during their 14 years in power. Meanwhile, is UK sovereignty really under threat or is that just a soundbite to get your vote , should those with physical jobs be allowed their pensions early and who else should be held responsible for horrendous treatment of the Post Office sub-postmasters and mistresses? Share your thoughts on these topics and more in the comments. A reader says some realities of the tory government post-2010 were beyond their control (Credits: Bloomberg via Getty Images) What a selective memory Barry ( MetroTalk, Fri ) has when he idealises how it was when the Tories took over in 2010. It’s funny how he says ‘there were no front pages about people in boats’, while simultaneously praising ‘seamless trade and travel throughout Europe’. Well, firstly, Brexit happened (by a national vote, not by the Tories) and the fact there was seamless travel across Europe also meant there was unlimited immigration (something he fails to mention). Also, Covid hadn’t happened yet (which certainly wasn’t the fault of the Tory government ), or would Barry prefer that the government had let tens of thousands of workers lose their jobs without implementing furlough? Then he would really have cause to complain. It’s easy to pick and choose, but there are some harsh realities in between. Paul, London Let us know what you think...

It’s time for change. However, I don’t believe whoever leads the country after the general election of July 4 will be any different because parliament is run by the ‘uni-party’ and that means the same as usual – more tax, more war, more control. Roger, Wolverhampton What is Mark ( MetroTalk, Fri ) blithering on about when he says Reform UK is the only party that will ‘be able to protect UK sovereignty’? In what way is UK sovereignty under threat? It’s a soundbite the nutters in Reform hope you’ll swallow without thinking, sweetie. Aidan, Dartford ‘More of the same’ or ‘worse’ is the choice we face. Taxes? High or higher. Red tape and regulation? High or higher. Immigration? Very high or even higher still, if that’s possible. Defence? Weak or even weaker. Law and order? Weak or even weaker. Energy bills? High or higher. Net-zero targets? Pointless or obsessive. Leadership? Little or none. Our children’s future? Bleak or even bleaker. This feels not so much like a general election, as a wake for our nation. Otto Inglis, Crossgates Yes, Paula Vennells needs to take the blame for the horrendous treatment of the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses while she was in charge of the Post Office. However, the criminal investigating officers who carried out the interviews are the real ones at fault. I speak as a recently retired detective and each of the people interviewed should have been given the disclosure that others had experienced problems with the Horizon computers and that multiple people were being investigated for the same thing. I hope these officers were also investigated by the Professional Standards Department. Gary, Essex I was born in 1962 and have worked all my working life. The government, whose members sit down most of the day, have moved the retirement age to 67. This is OK if you’re in good health and have an office or desk job. But when you’ve done a physical job for most of your working life and paid in full all national insurance and taxes etc, you should have the option to draw half of your pension at 65 and the rest when you get to 67. You never know what’s round the corner. Denis, via email In response to Alps ( MetroTalk, Thu ), I was also 100 per cent against it being made possible to use phones on the Tube. But after reading Alps’s letter about how not being glued to their devices allowed them to chat to strangers about pagan festivals, I’ve had a 100 per cent change of heart.

They benefit from the publicity, as does the event (more people attend). Plus, they often support the people putting their hard work into the show. It’s a win-win. Chas, London It’s high time an investigation was held into the fees charged by emergency locksmiths.

        "content": "Karan Kandhari ‘s “ Sister Midnight ” is a surreal Mumbai fable with an aggressive comedic rhythm. It’s composed by hitting the same few notes ad nauseam, but hitting them exceptionally well and for much longer than one might expect before it eventually runs out of steam. All the while, Kandhari takes a novel visual approach to the topic of arranged marriage, situating his woebegone couple — his protagonist in particular, a woman who feels trapped — in a realm of strange psychosis. It’s better than it has any right to be, but not nearly as good as it should be. Uma (Radhika Apte) is brash, acerbic and vulgar. Unable to cook or manage household expenses, she fulfills very few of the rigid expectations of a new Indian bride. When she arrives at her cramped new one-room apartment with her soft-spoken husband Gopal (Ashok Pathak) — an ostensible stranger — on their wedding night, the awkwardness between them is palpable. She wants to (or perhaps, believes it’s her duty to) sleep with him, but he can barely take his shirt off in front of her. It doesn’t take long for Kandhari to establish his snappy comedic vibe, with all the calculated framing, editing and choreography of a Wes Anderson action scene (the wake in “The Grand Budapest Hotel” comes to mind, with its litany of well-timed punches). However, first-time feature director Kandhari also marches to the beat of his own drum, constrained by neither tone nor genre expectation. His music choices range from Bengali folk to American punk and blues. While of Indian origin, Kandhari is London-based and draws from a variety of cultural influences, but his depiction of working class Mumbai never feels inauthentic, especially in the movie’s quieter, low-lit moments, whose shadowy visual contrast creates striking portraits of Uma that verge on expressionistic. While Gopal is at work, Uma tries to settle into a domestic routine, which involves everything from learning to chop vegetables to figuring out how to spend her free time in her crowded neighborhood, whose bustling noise prevents her from sleeping in. The happily married woman next door, Sheetal (played by Chhaya Kadam, who also stars in Cannes Grand Prix winner “All We Imagine As Light”) takes Uma under her wing and delivers even her most impassioned and welcoming lines with wry, impenetrable wit. It’s a role Kadam nails completely, finding variance even within comedic monotony, and she makes for an amusing contrast with Apte’s more fiery and unpredictable performance. Between Uma’s gossiping neighbors and the pressures of social expectation, her psyche begins to rip apart at the seams, until eventually she finds a particularly macabre outlet for her frustrations. When her anxieties begin to manifest in the world around her, Kandhari makes tremendously inventive use of stop-motion elements. They cause a kind of fissure in his world-building, revealing seamlessly blended images that don’t quite make logical sense or — like Uma herself — feel like they belong. However, the more sudden genre swerves “Sister Midnight” takes, the more Kandhari cedes control to an imagined version of his film that does not (and perhaps cannot) exist. His story holds Indian patriarchal norms to account and via its sensitive, anxious depiction of Gopal, makes him as much a victim of circumstance as Uma, if not more so. The exact subgenres from which “Sister Midnight” ultimately takes its cues are better left unspoiled, but several of its genre hallmarks harken back to films about the all-consuming nature of romance. However, the misfortunes that eventually befall Gopal, courtesy of Uma’s crumbling state of mind, lead to incongruous outcomes that feel too irreverently nasty. Kandhari has a clear and perverse vision, but he’s also incredibly successful (perhaps to a fault) at eliciting sympathy for his characters. The bleak, punk-feminist parable he tries to build, using phantasmagorical imagery, strays too far toward the realm of disturbing — both emotionally and viscerally — to fully connect and keep viewers on its wavelength. This dissonance also collides with (and perhaps contributes to) the movie’s clockwork rhythm becoming too mechanical to manage. Beyond a point, its visual comedy no longer remains unpredictable, and everything that initially works about its unique sensibilities becomes a burden, preventing “Sister Midnight” from undergoing the metamorphosis necessary to chase its initial surrealist high. The story soon gets away from Kandhari, leading to a film that enraptures and delights in its first hour but gets so locked in to a singular approach by its second that it’s practically consumed by its own style, rendering it unable to keep pace with the bold ideas at play.",

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "A 16-year-old Winston-Salem teenager drowned this weekend while visiting Jordan Lake in Chatham County. Bryan Guzman was visiting Jordan Lake with his 18-year-old brother and a friend to celebrate a friend’s birthday, according to the Chatham County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies said the incident occurred around 3:30 p.m. Sunday near the Ebenezer Picnic Area A at 542 Ebenezer Road, New Hill. Guzman’s 18-year-old brother called 911, saying that Guzman was in distress while swimming in a cove near the picnic area. Officials said the cove is not a designated swimming area. “We extend our deepest condolences to the Guzman family during this very difficult time,” said Sheriff Mike Roberson. “Our hearts go out to them as they mourn the loss of their son and brother.” People are also reading... In addition to the Chatham County Sheriff’s Office, first responders included North Chatham Fire Department, Jordan Lake State Parks, and FirstHealth EMS. The Chatham County Sheriff's Office’s Victim Services Unit is working with the Guzman family to provide support and resources, officials said. The sheriff’s office is urging all visitors to Jordan Lake and other lakes to keep safety in mind: - Wear a life jacket. - Swim only in designated areas. - Supervise children closely. - Be aware of water conditions and your surroundings. The sheriff’s office planned to continue to patrol the lake throughout the holiday weekend. jimison@wsjournal.com 336-727-7287 @Jon_JimisonWSJ Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter. {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.",

The 24-year-old impressed with the Serie A side last season and has been outlined as a potential target for a list of top European clubs. Italian outlet Tuttosport has claimed that the Reds have registered an interest in the Brazilian ahead of an important transfer window for the club. first window in charge of the club will play a big part in his success at with a number of positions requiring attention. Teun Koopmeiners, also at Atalanta, has been linked with a move to Liverpool having worked with Slot at AZ Alkmaar. However, and bringing the former Corinthians star to Anfield. A fee in the region of €50m (£42m) has been mooted with Manchester United, Newcastle and Tottenham all interested. The midfield of Slot's team is one of the problematic areas in the squad and more than one player could be signed. After losing a host of midfielders 12 months ago, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai proved to be good signings with Wataru Endo doing the job as the defensive anchor. However, reinforcements are expected to be made. Ederson is a strong midfielder who boasts terrific defensive numbers, ranking in the 72nd percentile for tackles and 85th percentile for interceptions. Should Liverpool bring the Brazilian to Merseyside, then Slot could find himself with a variety of options to choose from. Alongside Mac Allister and Szoboszlai, that trio is full of quality. With Stefan Bajcetic, Curtis Jones, Ryan Gravenberch and Harvey Elliot waiting in the wings, the signing of Ederson could be the perfect signing for Liverpool. Having the array of options to choose from off the bench or in cup competitions would help Slot's transition to English football no end.",

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. Donna Kennedy holds a photo of her cousin Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, who was buried with full military honors, May 20 in Lawson, Mo. The labs' work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just, I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten's funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. Photos of service members are seen on a wall in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. \"It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. A worker looks at objects in a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone's identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas.

        "content": "Former Germany and Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick is on the verge of officially becoming the new manager of FC Barcelona, replacing the outbound Xavi Hernandez. For a brief period of time, he was linked with possibly making a return to Bayern to replace Thomas Tuchel, as was Julian Nagelsmann, but Flick wanted to experience a new challenge in a different country for the next chapter of his life. Flick will have a full summer transfer window to help with his squad planning efforts at Barcelona before his first full season in charge of the club, and reports have suggested he is going to be looking towards the Bundesliga for some of his transfer targets. In a market he knows quite well given his time as Bayern’s manager, the German national team manager, and his long tenure as an assistant member of Joachim Löw’s Germany coaching staff. Naturally, there have been rumors that Flick would like to try to bring Bayern’s Joshua Kimmich to Barcelona, but information from Az’s Maximilian Koch (via @iMiaSanMia ) suggests that is not a hot topic at the moment for either club. With the European Championships right around the corner for Germany, that is Kimmich’s full focus at the moment. Photo by Stefan Matzke - sampics/Corbis via Getty Images Kimmich’s current contract at Bayern is set to expire in June 2025, so it is a crucial period for the player in terms of needing to get his future sorted out, whether that is with Bayern, or elsewhere. So far, there have not been concrete talks yet between the player and the club’s front office, though Max Eberl and Christoph Freund will certainly have to open discussions as soon as they can after the Euros have ended. Kimmich does not have an agent and currently represents himself, which should help the contract talk process go smoother as it is a more direct line of communication without the presence of an agent or representatives, but only time will how negotiations will go. He will more than likely have conversations with Vincent Kompany about the upcoming season and where he sees Kimmich in his Bayern side as a part of the contract talk process. The time they are a changin’ at Bayern Munich. Vincent Kompany looks like he is taking over in Bavaria, while the club’s former favorite son — Hansi Flick — is heading to FC Barcelona . Which one will make out better with their new club? We’ll find out, but in the meantime, there could also be some Bayern players who are on Flick’s transfer radar, too. basically, we’ve got a lot to talk about with all of that, plus some appreciation for Bayer Leverkusen’s incredible season. You can check all of that out on the Bavarians Podcast Works Show, which is available on Spotify or below: Related Hansi Flick’s four-step plan to raid the Bundesliga for FC Barcelona Report: Bayern Munich wants winger, stiker, holding midfielder — and maybe a left-back and a center-back, too",

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency forensic anthropologist Carrie Brown looks at objects in a lab at Offutt Air Force Base on May 20 in Bellevue, Neb. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,\" said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. \"They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown's work.

        "description": "Britain's Got Talent fans couldn't believe their eyes when another act were given a Golden Buzzer in the final episode of auditions, but it wasn't from any of the judges",
        "content": "fans were left scratching their heads as , despite there being none left. Japanese double dutch group Haribow took to the stage, ready to blend skipping with gymnastic and dance moves in a bid to win the show. The friends, who had been performing together for nine years, revealed they'd travelled over 20 hours for their audition. As their routine kicked off, the audience went wild, cheering and applauding their performance. The judges were equally impressed, and by the time the performance ended, the cheers were so loud that the judges' feedback was drowned out. The crowd began chanting for the judges to hit the Golden Buzzer, but confirmed they couldn't. They'd already exceeded their one-buzzer limit this series, having pressed it several times more than allowed. However, this time they held firm, even as Simon's son Eric and Amanda Holden's daughter Hollie were seen jumping around in the audience. Simon shared with the group how excited Eric was about them, clearly a fan. As the chants grew louder, Simon realised they wouldn't be able to avoid giving them the buzzer. But amid the rule-breaking excitement, it was . The pair dashed up to press the buzzer, sending the crowd and those on stage into a frenzy. While viewers at home acknowledged the act's talent, opinions were split on its Golden Buzzer worthiness, with some pointing out that the value of the buzzer is diminished when so many acts are chosen regardless of the rules. Some fans argued it negates the purpose of the buzzer's exclusivity. One viewer tweeted: \"What's the point in the golden buzzers when they're just giving them out to absolutely everyone? These guys are really good but when they're gone they're gone! !\" Another concurred: \"They don't need to golden buzzer everything. If they're that good they'll get picked to go through anyway.\" Meanwhile, a third spectator commented: \"They know there's no buzzers left, but they still won't stfu about pushing it. It devalues every other golden buzzer act,\" while a fourth remarked: \"What's the point of the golden buzzer, they would get through to the finals anyway.\" The previous day had seen from Simon after delivering an astonishing performance for judges Simon, , , and Amanda. The duo showcased their talent with a series of moves and lifts on a platform, even being suspended off the ground at one point. The performance was elevated by pyrotechnics, earning them applause from the judges. Amanda could hardly bear to watch as they spun high up with minimal support. As their audition concluded, the judges gave them a standing ovation, with the audience also cheering them on. The crowd loved it so much that they started chanting for the judges to hit the Golden Buzzer. However, some viewers were left scratching their heads over the rules, unsure if another buzzer should have been given considering how many had already been awarded.",

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Critical stakeholders in Uyo Senatorial District have taken the lead by unanimously endorsing Umo Eno for a second term in office as Governor of Akwa Ibom State come 2027. The political leaders, under the aegis of the Akwa Ibom North East Consultative Forum, the apex sociopolitical organisation in Uyo Senatorial District, revealed that the confidence vote in the Governor and endorsement for his mandatory seven more years, as the State Chief Executive, followed a thorough assessment of the governor’s performance in his first year in office. According to them, this period has been marked by significant achievements across various sectors, with notable progress in education, agriculture, road infrastructure, youth development, healthcare, security, and many other areas as enshrined in the ARISE Agenda. Leader of the Forum, who is also the Political Leader of Uyo Senatorial District, Senator Effiong Bob, while addressing the stakeholders and Newsmen, who converged on his Uyo abode on Monday, specifically eulogised Governor Umo Eno’s visionary leadership, his commitment to good governance, and his dedication to the welfare of Akwa Ibom people. He emphasised that the Governor has earned the support of all citizens and residents, and therefore, will be re-elected, just like his predecessors – Obong Victor Attah, Chief Godswill Akpabio, and Mr Udom Emmanuel – who all served eight unbroken years as Governors. “In the area of road infrastructure, numerous projects such as the newly inaugurated 3.3km Idua road, the intervention work at the collapsed area of Afia Nsit Road both in Eket, the just inaugurated 160m span Nto Ide Ikot Amba Bridge with 800m Approach road in Obot Akara, the newly commissioned Paul Ekpo Crescent, Emmanuel Ekon Avenue, Obot Emem Street, the commissioning of the reconstructed section of Atiku Abubakar road with walkways, drainage systems solar street lights, with flood control tunnel as well as the Afaha Ube Road, including the Akpan Andem Market in Uyo road, to mention but a few, are all eloquent testimonials to the Governor’s Midas touch in the area road infrastructure. “In the area of Youth and Manpower development, the governor through the Ibom Leadership and Entrepreneurial Development Centre, trained and doled out seed capital to over 800 youths and entrepreneurs as a strategic attempt to fanning the embers of enterprise development. In Healthcare delivery, the governor has already built, and equipped new model healthcare centres and reconstructed existing ones, inaugurated them and handed these facilities to our people for us. In Security management, which is one of the pillars of his ARISE agenda, our visionary leader and Governor, apart from donating utility vehicles to security agencies in the state, has provided the needed support for these agencies to help maintain peace and security in our state. The Governor has also envisioned and launched the IBOM COMMUNITY watch to bolster the job done by existing security agencies. “In Education, the reconstructed, remodelled and inaugurated Christ the King, and Ewet Primary Schools projects, the opening of the flagship Dakkada Skills Acquisition Centre and constitution of the school’s Governing Council, the training of Principals of Public Secondary Schools by UK Education officials, frequent grants to students, donation of school uniforms and sandals to students, among others are some of the very strategic investments Pastor Umo Eno has made in this sector that has earned him the applause and admiration of all Akwa Ibomites. “Today, the songs of mourning that were becoming permanent in the mouths of retirees in Akwa Ibom on account of the unsettled backlog of gratuities have been swiftly replaced with songs of thanksgiving and gratitude owing to the Governor’s swift intervention in clearing the backlog of these gratuities, the former member representing Nigeria in the ECOWAS parliament highlighted. However, based on these achievements and more, the stakeholders, in a motion moved by Hon. Paul Ekpo, member representing Etinan/Nsit Ubium/Nsit Ibom Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, and seconded by Rt. Hon. Kufre Abasi Edidem, Deputy Speaker of the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly, passed a unanimous vote of confidence in Governor Umo Eno. The stakeholders observed that Uyo Senatorial District has consistently demonstrated goodwill by supporting other senatorial districts in their rotational tenure as governor. Emphasising the spirit of reciprocity, they asserted that it was now the turn of Uyo Senatorial District to receive support from other districts, assuring that the remaining seven years of Pastor Eno will be a period of unprecedented prosperity for Akwa Ibomites, marked by sustained transformation and development. Meanwhile, the forum took the opportunity to applaud President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Senate President, Senator Godswill Akpabio, for their exemplary display of bipartisan cooperation and harmonious relationship with Governor Umo Eno, despite belonging to a different political party. The Stakeholders noted that this remarkable collaboration will undoubtedly yield significant development and progress for both Akwa Ibom State and Nigeria, as a whole, setting a shining example of unity and productive governance. The event was attended by a diverse range of prominent figures including Obong T.O. Akpan, Deputy Leader of the Akwa Ibom North East Consultative Forum; Obong (Dr) Ekaette Ebong Okon, Secretary General; Hon Lawrence Udosen, Deputy State Chairman of PDP and Rt Hon KufreAbasi Edidem, Deputy Speaker of AKHA. Others include Obong Paul Ekpo, Member representing Etinan Federal Constituency; Barr Ime Okon, representing Itu/Ibiono Ibom Federal Constituency, Chairman of SUBEB; Rt Hon Anietie Etuk, Hon Ibanga Brownson; Rt Hon Otobong Bob, Deputy Leader of the State House of Assembly; and other members of AKHA from the district. The list also included the Political Adviser of the Governor; Prince Godwin Ntukudeh, Administrative Secretary of the Forum; Chief P.J. Effiong, Chief of Staff to the Chairman of the forum; Isantim Kenneth Okon, wife of the former Governor; Mrs Funmi Idongesit Nkanga, former SSG; Obonganwan Grace Ekong, a renowned Estate Surveyor Obong James Iniama, Transition Chairmen from Uyo senatorial district; notable Board chairmen and SSAs from the district as well as critical stakeholders and elders of the party from the Uyo senatorial district, among others.",

        "description": "Fans of long-running ITV reality show Love Island have been less than impressed by the 'ageing' imagery of the 2024 contestants shared ahead of the series returning next week",
        "content": "An ageism row has erupted over the latest season of Love Island - as some of the contestants are not as old as they look. This summer will see the hit reality show return to ITV for an eleventh season - with 12 contestants already unmasked as the original Islanders of the year. Of the dozen, recruitment manager Munveer Jabbal is the eldest at 30-years-old, while 21-year-old surveyor Ciaran Davies is the youngest at just 21-years-old. As the initial cast have been revealed, fans have been able to swoon over the official images that ITV have released following the casting announcements. But many have been left rubbing their eyes in disbelief in seeing some of the ages running alongside the snaps of shirtless men and bikini-clad contestants. Taking to social media, an army of fans have hit out at the “bad photography” that has been share - with many saying they think the contestants look much older than they really are. And many have also scrolled through social media sites to find the profiles of many of the stars and say they think they look better in snaps they’ve taken themselves compared to the professional images taken by the ITV promotional team. Maya Jama is back to host Love Island for the summer ( Image: ITV) Love Island fans have slammed the show for making Ronnie Vint look older than his years ( Image: Instagram) Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Many have taken particular issue with the images of 27-year-old smile professional footballer Ronnie Vint who they think has been “done dirty” by the promo images. One unimpressed fan lashed out at his snaps online, writing disparagingly: “Someone's dad is missing! No really.” Another questioned: “Who takes the official love island photos? Why does everyone look completely different on them than on their profile?” And a further fan commented: “Why do they all look so old” But other fans think the professional images make the contestants look “normal” - and they have hit back at the complaints. One approving fan commented: “Everyone’s always asking for normal people, now we’re getting them and still hating smh”. Ronnie has opened up about his reasons for entering the Love Island villa as a 2024 contestant. Asked why he is single, he said: “I’ve had two serious relationships in the past but more recently have enjoyed being single and doing my own thing as I’ve been focussed on my football career. I’ve got to the age where I want to find the right person I can build a life with.” Opening up about the type of lady he wants to settle down with, he said: “I want someone that's family orientated, caring and career minded. Lookwise, I like blondes with nice boobs but am partial to a brunette too.” And it seems Ronnie has some insider knowledge of what being a Love Island contestant is like - as he is friends with 2017 contestant Olivia Attwood , who is married to footballer Bradley Dack. Ronnie explained: “Bradley Dack is my best friend and he and Olivia are a big part of my life. I call Olivia my big little sister, she always looks out for me.” Love Island starts at 9pm Monday 3rd June on ITV1, ITV2, ITVX & STV.

My [Off-Broadway’s ] family knows how to bring the community together!” Bleu, 35, captioned an Instagram video on Sunday, May 27. “Can’t believe it’s been almost 20 years since I’ve done this.” In the clip, the star is jumping rope on a New York City street as his 2007 song “Push It to the Limit” from the Disney Channel Original Movie plays in the background. Bleu starred alongside in the DCOM, which premiered in January 2007. (Bleu is currently starring as Seymour Krelborn in an Off-Broadway production of s.) The film followed the story of Izzy Daniels (Bleu) a teenage boxing prodigy who finds himself on a Double Dutch team coached by longtime friend Mary (Palmer). Throughout the movie, Izzy has to decide if he wants to be a Golden Gloves winner like his father or help his new friends win a regional Double Dutch championship. The film’s director, , told in January 2022 that both Bleu and Palmer, 30, did their own stunts on the film’s set. “What’s just so amazing with that group of actors is that they could do all of that jump roping,” Hoen recalled. “It’s amazingly hard, and all the tricks, they were completely into those and learning how to do them.” Palmer has also looked back at her time making the movie, revealing that she had her first kiss on camera with Bleu. “That was my first kiss in life,” Palmer, 30, said during an interview with in July 2020. “Even though that wasn’t my real first kiss, it was my actual first kiss ... I remember just feeling excited and it was cool because I had a cool person to kiss, Corbin is pretty good looking.” Palmer admitted she was “scared” as well. “The most fun part about this movie was that I was around my peers — people my own age,” she recalled.

        "description": "As there are no chairs or benches here, four of our family members were sitting on the floor outside the ICU last night. Moreover, hospital staff have switched off the fans during this summer, says Yedukondalu, a hospital visitor",
        "content": "More than the patients admitted in a hospital, their family members face a lot of troubles while taking care of them day and night. If it is a government hospital, then the problems are endless. The patients and their attendants are suffering due to lack of basic facilities such as drinking water and furniture at A.C. Subba Reddy Government General Hospital (GGH) in SPS Nellore. “As there are no chairs or benches here, four of our family members were sitting on the floor outside the intensive care unit (ICU) last night. Moreover, the hospital staff have switched off the fans during this summer,” said Yedukondalu, a visitor. Another caretaker, B. Eswar, complained that the reverse osmosis (RO) drinking water filter was not working and he was forced to drink water from an earthen pot in which some patients had dipped their fingers while trying to drink water using a glass. Similarly, there are many complaints from the attendants of patients that the sockets used for charging mobile phones were not functioning in almost every block of the hospital. They were unable to make important calls to reveal the health condition of their family members. The toilets and the surrounding areas look untidy. The hospital wards, where the doctors go for rounds, were maintained neatly, but not other places. The sanitation staff and kin of the patients were blaming each other for the unhygienic atmosphere in the premises. While the sanitation workers alleged that the people coming from rural areas were littering everywhere, the attendants of patients’ complained that the outdoor spaces were not cleaned regularly. Asifa, a relative of an expectant mother said, “To avoid the bad smell at the time of eating, we prefer having food outside the maternity block. The waiting halls were too horrible with the marks of tobacco spit left on the walls. Denying all these allegations, GGH Superintendent Dr. B.S. Naik told The Hindu that all facilities were available in the hospital. He informed that three RO water filters were donated by Nellore MP Vemireddy Prabhakar Reddy. “We have also repaired an existing water dispenser ahead of the summer. Apart from these, we have kept drinking water pots in the wards so that the patients and their caretakers do not face any problem during this season,” he informed. When asked about lack of furniture in the hospital, Dr. Naik said, “It is not good for both the patients and visitors to keep chairs near the ICU. It is highly infectious area. So, we avoid putting chairs or benches. Some people sit down despite warnings from the hospital staff.” Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Andhra Pradesh",

        "content": "A WALMART shopper ditched a full cart of items after encountering a sleepy self-checkout. With multiple kiosks closed, the customer walked away empty-handed and angry, taking to social media with their complaints. Gripes with self-checkout are all too common across retailers, with many coming from fed-up Walmart and Target shoppers as both retailers implemented policy changes over the past few months. Walmart instituted privileges for Walmart+ shoppers this past spring and customers are still reeling from the shake-up. The big box retailer began reserving certain self-checkout lanes for Walmart+ members, leading regular customers to complain, with some even spreading rumors that it costs to use self-checkout. On X , the website formerly known as Twitter, one shopper ranted about their recent experiences. \"@walmart anytime I go to one of your stores & lines are ridiculous because you only have a few registers open in favor of self-checkout/walmart+ checkout,\" they said in a post . \"I'm leaving behind a full cart full of goods,\" they continued. \"I'm not dealing with your register staffing nonsense. #selfcheckoutsucks Another user said they were \"shook by the difficulty to simply checkout\" and described the situation at his Walmart. \"No registers open and self checkout with 3 kiosks working with a massive line,\" he said. \"No touch pay either, swipe or chip only.\" He referred to it as \"bizarre\" for a company the size of Walmart. Another user replied to him saying they've \"given up on Walmart for good\" due to theft affecting their past purchases. \"If it wasn’t for their pricing, I wouldn’t go there and even that isn’t what it used to be,\" said another. As far as long lines and lack of kiosks go, several shoppers are frustrated with the disappearance and reappearance of new kiosks amid policy changes. \"This is SO stupid! So they put these things in to make people crazy and spark arguments about whether or not people like them. Then when we are all used to them and some of us love them....they make a big deal and take them out,\" one shopper wrote on Facebook . The U.S. Sun reached out to Walmart in a request for comment. Long lines aren't the only thing extending Walmart shoppers' trips. *If you click a link in this boxout, we may earn affiliate revenue Here's how to sign up to Walmart+ : Remember to cancel before the 30 days are up, or pay $12.95 per month (which you can cancel at any time) or $98 for the annual plan if you want to keep it. Read More Customers are saying they can't find anything they're looking for after the store recently made layout changes across the US. A new app called Hyper allows customers to enter their grocery list and then gives them directions around the store to locate the items. Walmart's app already offer maps to help customers find their way through stores, but with recent layout changes, some say they need more assistance. Last month, stores in St. Louis, Missouri, and Cleveland, Ohio announced they would be closing their self-checkout kiosks for good. Plus, here's how Target is following in Walmart's footsteps with rollbacks and big changes.",

        "content": "Asserting that Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) will win all 14 seats in the Lok Sabha polls, former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren’s wife Kalpana Soren on Monday compared Bharatiya Janata Party with Bririshers, “who were known for looting people.” She also vented her ire on BJP for calling them Vanvasi instead of Adivasi adding that they take pride in their jal, jungle and zameen, calling Adivasis as true revolutionaries, who fought against the Britishers when nobody thought to do so. “The people of Jharkhand have made up their minds to support the candidates of the INDIA bloc. I cannot say about the country, but in Jharkhand, we are winning all 14 seats...” she said. “We are fulfilling our political obligations with all honesty. Election campaigning is on in full swing... Dumka has been the stronghold of JMM and we are going to win here again,” she added. Kalpana formally made an entry into politics on March 4, this year. In the last few months, she has become a key face of the INDIA bloc in Jharkhand. She is contesting the bypoll from Gandey Assembly seat on a Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) ticket. Launching an attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party, she said, “BJP feels irritated to even utter the word Adivasi. They don’t even call us Adivasi. They call us Vanvasi. But we have been here since the beginning. We take pride in our jal, jungle and zameen. Our great ancestors were true revolutionaries. They fought against the Britishers even when nobody thought to do so. We have the same blood in our veins. BJP is another form of British to loot people.” Notably, the Santhal revolt (also known as the Hul revolt ) started on 30th June 1855, with the help of prominent leaders like Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand, and Bhairav, and also their two sisters Phulo and Jhano. The depressed and anguished Santhals engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Britishers and formed their own troops which included the farmers, villagers, and the women. In this quest, they were able to capture large parts of land including Rajmahal Hills, Bhagalpur district, and Birbhum. Regarding Kalpana Soren’s statement about comparing BJP with Britishers, Jharkhand BJP chief, Babulal Marandi said, “The Congress party with which they have formed an alliance, their founders were Britishers...Congress party is a remnant of the British...BJP which was earlier JanSangh, was founded by leaders of India on Indian soil.” Notably, in 2019, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 12 seats in Jharkhand, with the BJP alone winning 11. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Congress got one seat each",

Varanasi is the land of Kashi and whoever comes here is only at the orders of Baba Vishwanath. PM Modi is contesting elections from here... I have seen that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections witnessed greater enthusiasm than that of the 2014 polls. It is even greater in 2024, ” said the BJP leader while speaking to ANI reporter in Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi. “People from inside are enthusiastic. Only development has been given importance. The development done by PM Modi is being discussed...” said Giriraj Singh. Notably, Varanasi is the stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party and PM Modi. This will be the most anticipated contest in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. PM Modi won the constituency with a resounding majority in both the 2014 and 2019 general polls. Congress has pitted Ajay Rai against PM Modi. Rai is the Opposition INDIA bloc’s joint nominee against the Prime Minister. The UP Congress chief, Rai, was also fielded by the Congress against the PM in Varanasi in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but he finished third both times. This is the third time Ajay Rai will face Modi in a Lok Sabha contest. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, PM Modi won the seat with over 6,74,664 votes and commanded a vote share of 63.6 per cent.

        "description": "Per the rankings from Baseball America, he was the Nationals’ No. 1 prospect in three straight years from 2017 to 2019.",
        "content": "The Nationals announced today that outfielder Lane Thomas has been reinstated from the injured list with fellow outfielder Víctor Robles designated for assignment in a corresponding move. The club’s 40-man roster count drops to 38. Robles, now 27, was once the club’s top prospect and one of the top prospects in the entire league. Per the rankings from Baseball America , he was the Nationals’ No. 1 prospect in three straight years from 2017 to 2019. He was also on BA’s top 100 league-wide list from 2016 to 2019, getting as high as No. 5 overall going into 2018. The expectation at that time was that Robles had the capability of being an all-around contributor and a long-term part of the outfield in Washington. Things seemed to be in a good place in 2019, the year the Nats won the World Series. Robles hit 17 home runs and slashed .255/.326/.419. Despite the long balls, his 5.7 percent walk rate kept the on-base low and the wRC+ of 92 indicates he was actually a bit below average offensively overall. But thanks to above-average defense and stealing 28 bases, FanGraphs credited him as being worth 3.7 wins above replacement in his age-22 season. Given his youth, the Nats undoubtedly expected him to continue evolving as a hitter as he aged. Unfortunately, things moved in the opposite direction in the years to come. From 2020 to 2022, Robles got into 291 games with the Nats but hit just .216/.291/.306 in that time for a wRC+ of 66. The club’s fortunes also faded in that time and they entered a rebuilding phase. That theoretically left Robles with plenty of playing time to get back on track, but his health hasn’t really allowed him to do so. He only got into 36 games last year due to back spasms in the lumbar spine. He did perform well when on the field, hitting a solid .299/.385/.364, but hasn’t carried that over in 2024. He spent about a month on the injured list due to left hamstring strain and has produced a brutal line of .120/.281/.120 in the 14 games he has played. Robles was slated to reach free agency after the 2024 campaign and the Nationals were likely hoping for a nice run of play this season, at least allowing them to flip Robles for something at the deadline before he slipped away from them for nothing. Unfortunately, his performance hasn’t inspired much confidence and they are cutting him off the roster today. They will now have a week to trade him or pass him through waivers, though any interest is likely to be fairly modest after years of poor performance and injury absences. He’s making a salary of $2.65M this year, with still about two-thirds of that left to be paid out. Perhaps the Nats will try to eat some of that money to facilitate a deal but it’s also possible that Robles just ends up released. He has enough service time that he can reject an outright assignment in favor of free agency while keeping all that money intact. It’s undeniably been a disappointing few years and hardly what the club had in mind, given the prospect pedigree and the promising start to his career. But for Robles personally, it’s not too late for him to find a second act somewhere. He just turned 27 last week and could perhaps get back on track with a run of good health and the right opportunity.

        "content": "Three men arrested in connection with the game zone fire that claimed 28 lives have been sent to a 14-day police remand by a court in the Rajkot district on Monday. The court of additional judicial magistrate BP Thakar remanded three accused Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki, Nitin Jain and Rahul Rathod in police custody for two weeks, special public prosecutor Tushar Gokani said. [{f16f1bcf-e868-4fe6-bbde-7c594c7407bf:intradmin/ANI-20240527171602.jpg}] Speaking to the media on Monday, Special Public Prosecutor Tushar Gokani said, “Today the accused were brought before the honourable court and further police custody of 14 days was sought. Out of 6 accused named in the FIR, 3 accused persons were arrested, of which two are named in the FIR and one of them was not named.” “The main ground of remand was that they were not cooperating during the investigation. They (the accused) are giving ‘evasive replies’ to whatever questions are asked and whatever documents are asked. They are saying it was burnt in the incident. They are not cooperating in the investigation and that was the main ground — to seek their cooperation and elicit truth from them,” said the official. “We told the court that the main accused are on the run, and these accused persons make evasive replies and are not cooperating with the investigating agencies,” Gokani said. He said that accused Solanki tried to put up an act in his bid to express before the court that he was filled with remorse for whatever happened. “When he entered the court, he tried to project that he had remorse for the incident and everyone felt that he was crying. After five minutes, he was laughing and arguing with the court,” Gokani said. “This very accused seemed like he was crying as soon as he entered the court but in just a few minutes he started laughing and he said that ‘these kinds of things happen,’ which was taken in a serious note by the honourable court,” said Gokani. SPP Gokani further said that the police are investigating all the facets of the said documents, investigation on the matter is underway. Two partners in Raceway Enterprise, which operated the TRP game zone, Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki and Rahul Rathod, and the manager of the recreation centre, Nitin Jain, are now in police custody. The officials have been held responsible “for their gross negligence in allowing this game zone to operate without necessary approvals,” according to a government release. The FIR has been filed against six people, including TRP Game Zone owner Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki, manager Nitin Jain, and others at Rajkot Taluka Police Station. Earlier in the day, Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Rambhai Mokariya visited the families of Rajkot fire incident victims on Monday. Confirming the death toll, he said, “The official death toll stands at 28. It has not increased and any number other than that is just a rumour.” The Gujarat government ordered the suspension of seven officials, including two police inspectors and civic staff of Rajkot Municipal Corporation, for dereliction of duty in connection with the fire incident at a gaming zone in Rajkot. Following the incident, all the gaming zones in Vadodara were inspected and temporarily shut down",

        "content": "In a statement this Monday, 27 May, Gappah “unequivocally” retracted all the statements she made against Mahere, and publicly and “unreservedly” apologised. The allegations prompted Mahere to file a US$1 million defamation lawsuit against Gappah, and in March this year, the High Court suggested that the latter required psychological intervention. In the statement, Gappah she wanted to “bring a conclusive end to the legal action”. Reads the statement: In September 2018, following a public spat on Twitter, now X, I posted a number of statements about Advocate Fadzayi Mahere, namely that: Advocate Mahere considered my statements to be untruthful, defamatory and injurious to her. Consequently, she launched legal action against me for causing “irreparable harm” to her political career, her career as a civil society activist and her career as an advocate. In order to bring a conclusive end to the legal action, I hereby fully and unequivocally retract all the statements that I made about her, both on Twitter and in subsequent legal pleadings, and tender a full, public and unreserved apology to Advocate Mahere for any pain, hurt or distress that were caused by my statements. I wish Advocate Mahere continued success in her political career, her career as a civil society activist and her career as an advocate. As a demonstration of my good faith, sincerity and regret, I undertake to make a donation in Advocate Mahere’s name to the charity of her choice. It is my sincere hope that this full retraction and apology brings finality and closure to this matter.",

She spent four days behind bars after the raid on her son's Florida mansion last week. Janice, 61, is facing eight charges including conducting an organized scheme to defraud, grand theft and identity theft. She posted a $160,000 bond to secure her release from the Broward County jail, TMZ reported. Meanwhile, Sean is still at the San Bernardino County jail in California awaiting extradition to Florida after being arrested on the same warrant as his mother after his concert at Fort Irwin. Sean Kingston's mother Janice Turner has been released from jail on bail in the fraud case against the pair, seen here in 2012 Read More Rap star Sean Kingston is arrested on stage hours after his Florida mansion was raided and his mom detained in fraud case 'linked to $150,000 payment for gigantic 17FOOT television' Sean's extradition hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. After that he's expected to return to Florida where he will again be taken into custody. Janice was arrested on Thursday during the raid of the rapper's 14,000-square foot rented mansion in Southwest Ranches. Authorities seized a number of items from the property including including a giant LED TV screen with a price tag of $150,000. The case is tied to Kingston's purchase of the 17 foot by 9 foot TV in September 2023. Attorney Dennis Card filed a lawsuit against the rapper in relation to the purchase of the $150,000 entertainment set was present at the arrest of Turner. Card claims that Kingston acquired the TV on credit with a low down payment because he promised the seller, Ver Ver Entertainment, who sell the sets under the brand name Colossal TV, that Justin Bieber would do commercials for them. '[Justin Bieber] is 100 percent not involved in this,' Card said. 'He had the misfortune of doing some work in the past with Sean, and Sean drops his name like crazy.' Robert Rosenblatt, an attorney representing the rapper and his mother, said, 'we are aware of some of the allegations' being made against the two. She spent four days behind bars after the raid on her son's Florida mansion last week The case claims that Kingston acquired the TV on credit with a low down payment because he promised the seller, Ver Ver Entertainment, who sell the $150,000 TV sets under the brand name Colossal TV, that Justin Bieber would do commercials for them, seen here in 2010 Janice, 61, is facing eight charges including conducting an organized scheme to defraud, grand theft and identity theft, seen here in 2016 She posted a $160,000 bond to secure her release from the Broward County jail, TMZ reported, seen here in 2015 Meanwhile, Sean is still at the San Bernardino County jail in California awaiting extradition to Florida after being arrested on the same warrant as his mother after his concert at Fort Irwin, pictured in 2019 'We look forward to addressing these in court and are confident of a successful resolution for Shawn and his mother,' Rosenblatt said in an email. Florida Department of Corrections records show Kingston is currently on two years' probation for trafficking stolen property. Further information on that conviction could not be found. According to federal court records, his mother pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud for stealing over $160,000 and served nearly 1.5 years in prison. She was being held at the Broward jail Thursday night on $160,000 bond. The Jamaican-American rapper is best known for his 2007 No. 1 single 'Beautiful Girls' as well as another hit, 'Take You There' and his collaboration with Justin Bieber on the song 'Eenie Meenie.'

        "content": "Scientists solve mystery of why killer whales are attacking boats worldwide READ MORE: 'Scary moment' three killer whales ATTACK Ocean Race boat By Nikki Main Science Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 13:24 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:28 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 18 shares 3 View comments Killers whales have caused mayhem for boaters since 2020, ramming into the rudders of more than 600 ships and causing many to sink. Marine biologists have now revealed that their seemingly aggressive behavior may actually just be the actions of boredom among the highly intelligent animals. In a report released on Friday, biologists, government officials and other marine representatives said the boat rudders are a prime toy for orcas in open waters. Researchers believe the sudden fad of attacking boats started in around 2019 after a rapid increase in bluefin tuna - which is orca's main food source. This meant they spent less time hunting, leaving them with ample leisure time. In a report released on Friday, biologists, government officials and other marine representatives said the boat rudders are a prime toy for orcas in open waters. Although the reason why the attacks started haven't officially been confirmed, marine biologists believe it kicked off when one teenage whale played with the rudder in front of its peers, creating a trend. 'Maybe that individual touched a rudder and felt that it was something fun to play with,' Alex Zerbini, who chairs the scientific committee at the International Whaling Commission told The Washington Post . 'And, after playing, it began propagating the behavior among the group until it became as widespread as it is now.' Orcas have started similar trends in the past like wearing dead salmon as hats and playing games of chicken. The boat attacks were instigated by a group of 15 mostly juvenile and teen whales - between the ages of five and 18 - who approach the vessels slowly to supposedly nudge their noses gently against the rudders. Marine biologists reported that although adult females have been observed in the area at the time of the attack, 'they seem to be just sort of keeping an eye on their kids, who are doing the actual playing,' Naomi Rose, a senior scientist at the Animal Welfare Institute told The Post. Researchers believe the trend started when one teenage whale bumped a rudder with its nose in front of its peers. Pictured: A killer whale attacking Dieter Peschkes's yacht off the Iberian Peninsula in 2021 Orcas have started similar trends in the past like wearing dead salmon as hats and playing games of chicken. Pictured: a killer whale attacking Alan Bruce's yacht off the Iberian Peninsula in 2021 The report said that killer whales are known to play with other objects or animals in the sea but can go overboard, in some cases killing the object of their amusement. Pictured: Two killer whales attacking Dieter Peschkes's yacht off the Iberian Peninsula in 2021 Researchers believe their boredom stems from the abundance of food in the Iberian Peninsula - where the attacks have primarily occurred off the coast of Portugal, Spain and Morocco. In 2019, orcas faced food shortages as the population of their primary food source, bluefin tuna, diminished causing them to spend the majority of their time hunting and eating any food they could find. But after the bluefin tuna's population bounced back the following year, whales no longer needed to spend all their time hunting down food, leaving them with nothing to do. 'The sea is a very boring place for an animal,' Renaud de Stephanis, president of CIRCE (Conservation, Information and Research on Cetaceans), an organization dedicated to preserving marine life told USA Today . 'Imagine if you're a dog or some other mammal , you can interact with objects around you. But in the sea, there's not much for the orcas to interact with, so they play with the rudders,' she said. Read More Killer whales ramming boats in the Atlantic are 'learning dangerous behaviour from their elders', scientists claim - but insist that terrifying orca attacks are 'just games' The report said that killer whales are known to play with other objects or animals in the sea but can go overboard, in some cases killing the object of their amusement. '... In the southern resident killer whale population of Washington, USA, which feed on salmon, individuals will 'play' with harbor porpoises to the point of killing them, which may be a similar escalation of an initially less harmful interaction,' the report said, adding: 'So this behavior seems on that spectrum.' The researchers warned mariners against taking it upon themselves to launch flares and other devices to scare the whales, saying it could just make the game more fun for them. Instead, they suggest making the rudders less fun for the orcas to play with, or if possible, removing them altogether. The group is working on alternative methods to replace the rudders' smooth surfaces with bumpy or abrasive materials and devices that will make loud noises, like banging sounds, to deter the whales from approaching. In the report, marine biologists also advised boaters to travel around killer whale hotspots to mitigate an attack before it occurs with the caveat that whales are constantly migrating so predicting where they'll be isn't 100 percent successful. 'We don't want to see more boats being sunk and we don't want to see people in distress,' Zerbini told The Post. 'But we also don't want to see the animals being hurt. And we have to remember that this is their habitat and we're in the way.' Since the advice for vessels to flee from any possible whale interaction in May of last year, the number of attacks has declined by 70 percent. Why do orcas attack boats? A study in Marine Mammal Science last year concluded that the attacks on small boats follow the same pattern: orcas join in approaching from the stern, disabling the boat by hitting the rudder, and then lose interest. Experts believe orcas may be teaching others how to pursue and attack boats, having observed a string of 'coordinated' strikes in Europe. Some even think that one orca learned how to stop the boats, and then went on to teach others how to do it. The sociable, intelligent animals have been responsible for more than 500 interactions with vessels since 2020, with at least three sinking. It does not appear to be a very useful behaviour, and is not clearly helping their survival chances. In fact, Alfredo Lopez, an orca researcher at the Atlantic Orca Working Group, says the critically endangered whales 'run a great risk of getting hurt' in attacks. Dr Luke Rendell, who researches learning and behaviour among marine mammals at the University of St Andrews, agreed the behaviour does not seem to be an evolved adaptation. Instead, he pointed to 'short-lived fads', like carrying dead salmon on their heads - a sign of sociability, but not a desperate bid to survive. The answer to the boat attacks might lie with White Gladis , an orca with a personal vendetta against boats or people. Lopez said 'that traumatised orca is the one that started this behaviour of physical contact'. 'The orcas are doing this on purpose,' he told livescience.com . 'Of course, we don't know the origin or the motivation, but defensive behavior based on trauma, as the origin of all this, gains more strength for us every day.' Like humans, the orcas have 'sophisticated learning abilities' that allow them to digest the behaviour of others and replicate it themselves, a study in peer-reviewed journal Biological Conservation indicates.

        "content": "President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan discussed the ongoing humanitarian crisis and Israeli attacks on Gaza, Türkiye-Spain relations and other developments with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday, the Communications Directorate said. Erdoğan told Sanchez that Israel's massacres against Palestinians must be immediately halted and Tel Aviv needs to be forced to abide by international law. Israeli airstrikes targeted a camp for the displaced Palestinians in the Rafah safe zone, killing at least 45 civilians, mostly women and children, who burned to death. The president also said Türkiye welcomes Spain's decision to recognize Palestine's statehood. He said this step would contribute to the facilitation of peace and justice in the region, as well as efforts for a two-state solution. Last week, Sanchez said that Spain's council of ministers would recognize an independent Palestinian state on May 28. The announcement came around the same time that the Irish and Norwegian leaders announced they would do the same on the same date. In his speech, Sanchez said he has been talking to leaders and studying the situation in Palestine and understands one thing clearly: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \"Netanyahu does not have a peace project for Palestine.\" Sanchez said that the Israeli leader is refusing to listen to the international community as he continues to bomb civilian infrastructure and block desperately needed aid. Around 144 out of 193 member-states of the United Nations recognize Palestine as a state, including most of the global south, Russia, China and India. But only a handful of the 27 EU members have done so so far, mostly former Communist countries as well as Sweden and the Greek Cypriot administration. Britain, Australia and EU member Malta have indicated in recent months that they could soon follow suit. Recognition of a Palestinian state is still opposed for now by Israel's closest ally the United States, which has the power to veto it at the United Nations and did so last month. Washington says it favors Palestinian statehood eventually, but only as a result of negotiations with Israel, a position it shares with European powers including France and Germany. No negotiations over Palestinian statehood have taken place since the last round of talks collapsed a decade ago. Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 incursion by Hamas, which killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages. Israel's operations in the Palestinian enclave have killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel claimed recognizing Palestinian statehood now would effectively reward Hamas for its attacks. Spain and its allies have spent months lobbying European nations, including France, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia, to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state.",

        "description": "Michael Higgs is best known for playing the role of Andy Hunter in EastEnders from 1993 to 2005, but he has undergone a total transformation since leaving Albert Square",
        "content": "BBC EastEnders' Michael Higgs is almost unrecognisable two decades after he bid farewell to the soap. He first made his mark on Albert Square as Andy Hunter in 1993, initially working for The Firm and serving as the main muscle for boss Jack Dalton. However, when Jack was taken out by Dennis Rickman in 2003, Andy stepped up to fill the gap. He eventually claimed Walford as his own and took over The Firm. During his time on Albert Square, Andy had many clashes, including with Den Watts, Billy Mitchell and Minty Peterson. Andy also had romantic liaisons with the likes of Kat Slater and Sam Mitchell. After arranging a hitman to eliminate Paul Truman, Andy met his demise at the hands of fellow gangster Johnny Allen. Since exiting the show, he has led a completely different life, reports the Daily Star . The 61-year-old has had a highly successful career and appeared in Casualty twice, playing different characters in 2010 and 2016, and has had roles in New Tricks and Midsomer Murders, according to Birmingham Live. The actor looked completely different with a new silver fox look He also left a huge impact on the big screen, featuring in films such as Assassination Games, Prisoners of the Sun and The Marine 6: Close Quarters. Michael is also well known for his role in The Bill. Despite his remarkable career, Michael looks vastly different from his Walford days. More recent roles saw him transform into a scholarly-looking silver fox - a stark contrast from the dark-haired, suave young man who caused havoc in the long-running soap Eastenders . In real life, the actor is married to Doc Martin actress Caroline Catz. The 52 year old met her husband on the set of the ITV police drama The Bill where she played the character of Rosie Fox. The couple are parents to two children - Sonny Higgs, born in 2001, and Honour Higgs, born in 2006. Speaking to The Daily Mail, in the past the actress opened up about her personal life. She told the publication: \"Michael and I met when we worked together on The Bill in the late 90s, although we didn't marry until 2007 when we already had the children. Marriage to another actor means that there is no explanation needed for what you do. That's pretty refreshing\".

        "content": "The Oyo State Government has launched the Human Papilloma virus (HPV) Vaccine into the Extended Programme on Immunization (EPI) targeting girls between 9-14 years of age in the state. Speaking during a press conference in Ibadan, the Executive Secretary, Oyo State Primary Healthcare Board, Dr. Muideen Olatunji said the Board targets 7.71% of the population. Dr. Olatunji described cervical cancer as one of the most common forms of cancer that affects women, stressing that the disease must be tackled head-long. The Executive Secretary said the government has launched the programme at St. Paul Anglican Primary School, Yanbule, Bashorun, where over 300 pupils were vaccinated. He urged parents and guardians to avail their daughters between 9 and 14 years old, the opportunity to be vaccinated so as to prevent them from contracting cervical cancer. Dr. Olatunji encouraged every woman who is sexually exposed to ensure they undergo regular cervical cancer screening (pap smear), to prevent the disease. Olatunji, said the present administration in Oyo State was committed to providing quality health care delivery to the citizens of the state. He lauded the federal government and state government for introducing the HPV vaccine, saying the vaccine would save future generations of Nigerian girls and women from the danger of the disease. The ES reassured residents of the State that the vaccine is safe, free and will be available in all healthcare facilities across the state after five days. Appreciating the development partners for embarking on the exercise with the government, Dr. Olatunji said the campaign targets 639, 049 young girls between the age of 9-14 years. He said ”It is pertinent to reiterate that the vaccine is not designed to reduce the population of the state. This is a demonstration of our continued partnership and indeed, collective efforts to protect young girls and citizens of the state against the prevalence of cervical cancer disease”. He continued, “Cervical cancer is a serious, and second most fatal cancer that affects women especially females of productive age”. He added, “However, it’s important to note that Cervical cancer is a preventable disease, which can be controlled through routine human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine”. “We have trained and retrained those that will administer this vaccine, and there are supervisors who will regularly take measures of safety and there are measures put in place to checkmate the administration of these vaccines. We have a structure in place to reach every part of Oyo State. We want to make sure no one is left out in this vaccination, for this reason we must utilize the opportunity as critical stakeholders to significantly reduce the prevalence of this disease to protect the lives of our citizens, particularly young girls between the ages of 9 and 14”, he added. He stressed that, “Cervical cancer globally accounts for a huge number of deaths and is the fourth among the cancers that kill women in the world”. “HPV which causes cervical cancer is preventable, so what we are doing is cost-effective, and safe so that we don’t have to wait for treatment or management when cancer has set it. “Prevention is better than treatment and cure,” he said. Speaking of modalities, Dr. Olatunji said one dose of the vaccine will be administered on the left upper arm of recipients, adding that no serious reaction will follow this. He further said that the vaccine has a 90 percent guarantee of protecting girls from cervical cancer. In their goodwill messages, the representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and other development partners pledged their continued support to the immunization programme for the overall wellbeing of young girls and women in the state.",

        "description": "Police say the incident could be a fallout of a scuffle that took place at the bar.",
        "content": "A 30-year-old disc jockey (DJ) was shot dead at a bar in Jharkhand capital Ranchi late on May 26 at night by a man carrying what appeared to be a sophisticated rifle. The police on Monday arrested the accused, identified as Abhishek Singh, from Gaya in Bihar. The victim, Sandip Pramanik, a resident of West Bengal, worked at the bar. The CCTV footage of the incident shows a man, with his face covered, shooting at the chest of the DJ with a rifle from point blank range. Talking to The Hindu , Ranchi Senior Superintendent of Police Chandan Kumar Sinha said, “We have arrested the accused within 15 hours of the incident. The accused’s name is Abhishek Singh alias Vicky, a resident of Ranchi. We have also formed an SIT (Special Investigation Team) to investigate the case. The police are also interrogating three people in the case.” The SSP said that soon after the incident, the police started an investigation into it. During the course of the investigation, the police learnt that Singh had fled to Gaya following which they informed the Bihar police, who arrested him from the Alipur locality. The accused changed vehicles at several places while on the way to Bihar, and the vehicles were seized, he said. Mr. Sinha said the accused was in a drunk state when the crime was carried out. “In video footage, he is being seen alone. It needs to be found out whether he was alone or other persons were also involved in the crime,” the SSP said. Later, talking to mediapersons, the SSP said, “The incident occurred around midnight. When police reached the spot of the incident, there was no witness. It was a blind case for the police. Then, we set up seven teams. With the help of technical support and preliminary inquiries, the layer in the incident started opening.” He said that prima facie it was known that there was a scuffle between the bouncers and customers, including the accused, at the bar around 10.30 p.m. Around 1.18 a.m., the DJ was standing near a lift just outside the bar and waiting for a taxi, when the accused shot him, the SSP said. “There was no one excluding the DJ at that time. It appears that after the fight with bouncers, the accused, who was in an alcoholic state, came for revenge,” he said. Mr. Sinha said the rifle used in the crime had been recovered. “After searching the house of the accused, we recovered two arms licences issued from the State of Assam in his name. We are verifying if they are authentic. The accused did not deposit his arms, while we had repeatedly requested armholders to deposit their weapons in view of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) for the Lok Sabha polls,” he said. The accused is a businessman, who holds agencies of a cold drinks and a cigarette company. The bar management said the accused and his friends had an argument with the DJ and some other employees of the bar. In a statement, the Gaya police said, “Ranchi SSP asked for cooperation in arresting the accused of the Ranchi case. In the light of the request, Gaya Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ashish Bharti directed all the sub-divisional police officers and police station heads to conduct a special vehicle checking in the entire district and action was initiated to arrest the said accused by a special team.“ (WIth PTI inputs) Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Jharkhand / Ranchi / crime, law and justice / murder",

        "content": "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro told Erik ten Hag he wanted no part to play in the FA Cup final against Manchester City due to a minor injury problem. The Brazil international was ‘not 100 per cent’ heading into Saturday’s final at Wembley but was named among the substitutes that afternoon. However, there was a late change with Casemiro withdrawn from the squad completely before kick-off with Willy Kambwala taking his place on the bench. BBC Sport report the former Real Madrid star told ten Hag he felt a tight hamstring, requesting he not be involved even as a substitute. Casemiro has endured a difficult second season in Manchester, deployed in a centre-half for the final month of the campaign with the squad ravaged by injuries. His performances against Crystal Palace, Arsenal and Burnley were widely criticised with the returns of Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane allowing ten Hag to name a more familiar backline against City on Saturday. The two started at centre-half with Sofyan Amrabat retaining his place in midfield alongside Kobbie Mainoo, turning in his best performance of the season. Casemiro joined his teammates on the pitch at Wembley to celebrate with the trophy and is understood to have made a brief appearance at the post-game party before leaving on a private plane for a holiday with his family. Casemiro is among the United players who are expected to be moved on this summer. The 31-year-old, who joined from Real Madrid two years ago, is wanted by clubs in Saudi Arabia and could reunite with Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr. The midfielder notably came in for criticism from Jamie Carragher following the 4-0 defeat at Palace, suggesting he should ‘call it a day’ at the end of the season. But Casemiro insisted he has no plans on calling time on his career just yet. ‘I’m really well, I feel healthy, with energy and the same mentality I always had,’ he told Sky Sports. ‘I guess people end up talking about the age factor, but it’s been proven. Recently, our friend Thiago Silva, at the age of 39 coming here and showing that, yes, you can play. The previous Ballon d’Or winners were over 34. ‘At Man City, there’s Kevin De Bruyne. [Mohamed] Salah at Liverpool. I think age is not an issue, it is not a factor in this, but analysing one’s game and knowing about everything that is happening around the game. Gary Lineker questions if Man Utd star faked injury to get out of FA Cup final Prince George enjoys father-son day out with Prince William watching FA Cup final Chelsea make final decision on Kieran McKenna with only two options left Will Chelsea decline Europa Conference League place and who can they face? ‘These are people who analyse football well, who see what’s happening, who know what’s happening, analysing not the age. ‘But I’m well, I’m happy, living every day I get to play here. As I usually say, Manchester United gave me what I wanted. This joy of being able to enjoy the game, enjoy the Premier League. ‘So, I’m happy to be here at Manchester United and enjoying the game.’ MORE : Erik ten Hag aims dig at Manchester United with Arne Slot and Liverpool verdict MORE : Kieran McKenna set to snub Manchester United interest and sign new Ipswich deal MORE : Chelsea sent message by Leicester City star over ‘exceptional’ Enzo Maresca Manchester United news, exclusives and analysis",

        "description": "Thiruvananthapuram mourns the loss of Manu, a beloved Bengal tiger at the local zoo. His 17-year journey symbolizes the importance of conservation efforts. Despite facing health challenges, Manu's legacy inspires future generations to appreciate and protect wildlife. The zoo reaffirms its commitment to animal welfare and raising awareness about endangered species. Manu's passing marks the end of an era but underscores the interconnectedness of all living beings and our responsibility to safeguard their future.",
        "content": "In the early hours of a serene morning in Thiruvananthapuram, the city awoke to the somber news that Manu , the venerable Bengal tiger who had been a part of the local zoo 's family for 17 years, had passed away. The news spread quickly, touching the hearts of the community and wildlife enthusiasts alike. Manu's story is one that began on January 13, 2007, when he was born to his mother Karishma at the zoo. Over the years, he grew to become a majestic creature, admired by visitors and cared for by the dedicated staff. His presence was a constant, a familiar sight for those who frequented the zoo, and he was often the highlight of many a visitor's trip. However, in December 2023, it became apparent that Manu was facing health challenges. He was diagnosed with liver-related issues, and despite the best efforts of the veterinary team led by Dr. Nikesh Kiran, his condition began to deteriorate. In his final months, Manu was fed boneless mutton, soup, and milk, a diet designed to ease his discomfort and provide him with the necessary nutrients. As Manu aged, his resilience waned. The zoo staff made accommodations to ensure his comfort, moving him to a special cage equipped with infrared lighting to maintain warmth. Yet, even with this care, the tiger's health continued to decline, and he eventually succumbed to pneumonia, a complication arising from his underlying condition. The loss of Manu is felt deeply by the Thiruvananthapuram zoo community. He was a symbol of the wild's beauty and the delicate balance of nature's ecosystems. His passing marks the end of an era for the zoo and is a poignant moment to reflect on the importance of conservation efforts for these magnificent creatures. Tigers, in general, have an average lifespan of around 12 years in the wild, but in captivity, they can live longer due to the absence of threats and the availability of consistent care. Manu's 17-year journey is in due part to the care he received and the bond he shared with those who looked after him. The zoo's commitment to providing a safe haven for animals like Manu is unwavering. While the void left by his departure cannot be filled, the legacy of his life will continue to inspire and educate future generations about the wonders and vulnerabilities of wildlife. Manu's final rites were conducted with respect and in accordance with the regulations of the National Tiger Conservation Authority . As the zoo and its patrons mourn his loss, they also celebrate the life of a tiger that brought joy and awe to so many. In the wake of this event, the zoo reaffirms its dedication to the welfare of its inhabitants and to raising awareness about the plight of endangered species. The memory of Manu will live on, urging us to appreciate and protect the diverse array of life with which we share our planet. His story, while unique, is part of a larger narrative that highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings and the responsibility we hold to safeguard their future.",

        "description": "The Novato resident, a school board trustee for more than four decades, was 84.",
        "content": "Patricia Warren, a longtime trustee of both the Marin County Board of Education and the Novato Unified School District, died Tuesday. She was 84. Ms. Warren, an advocate for women’s rights and the namesake of an treatment center for women who were victims of domestic violence, died of complications from a massive stroke, according to her son Mark Warren, a Colorado resident. “She was an amazing woman who cared very deeply for her community,” he said. “She did everything she could to make positive changes for people’s lives.” Ms. Warren, a Novato resident, was born near Boston on Feb. 29, 1940, to Mitchell Anderson, a founding pilot of Northeast Airlines, and Mary Coggins. She received a bachelor’s degree in 1961 from Sweetbriar College in Virginia. After college, she married Robert Warren, her sweetheart since 10th grade at Arlington High School, in 1962. The couple were married for 62 years. Her husband is a retired civil engineer and was an engineering manager for the Golden Gate Bridge. On June 30, 2022, Ms. Warren retired from her seat on the county education board, where she had served for 35 years. Prior to that, she was a trustee at Novato Unified School District for nine years. “While we are saddened by her passing, we also take this time to acknowledge and celebrate her good work that changed countless lives for the better and that will be felt for generations to come,” John Carroll, Marin superintendent of schools, said in a letter to the education community. Noting Ms. Warren’s “remarkable 44-year commitment to education,” Carroll described her as a “fearless, passionate, and tireless advocate for those in our schools and community most in need of extra services and support.” “She believed that every child deserves the best possible education,” Carroll said. “She was especially supportive of the students in alternative education served through Marin’s Community School and other programs.” Ms. Warren’s career included roles as a staff member at Planned Parenthood and Marin Abused Women’s Services, and as the coordinator of the Marin Women’s Commission and co-founder of the Marin Women’s Hall of Fame. “From championing the rights of children in alternative and special education, to being an early advocate for policies ensuring equity in pay and hiring practices for women, there are many significant and lasting examples of Pat’s leadership and good work,” Carroll said. In the late 1970s, Ms. Warren was a staff member at Marin Abused Women’s Services and was also a Rape Crisis Center board member. It was later known as Community Violence Solutions. In 2003, the organization dedicated the Patricia Warren Center of Community Violence Solutions, recognizing her work on behalf of women, children and families. Ms. Warren “steadfastly stood against violence, sex discrimination and injustice,” the organization’s announcement said at the time. Mary Jane Burke, former Marin superintendent of schools, said Ms. Warren also supported education projects to help youths with substance abuse problems, special needs or alternative education and regional occupational programs. “Through budget cuts and budget windfalls, staff layoffs and staff hiring, program take-back and program development, Pat never lost sight of trying to do what was best for students and families while also meeting the needs of local districts,” Burke said when Ms. Warren stepped down from the county board of education. In addition to her husband and son, Ms. Warren is survived by another son, Michael Warren, a resident of the Lake Tahoe area. Memorial services are pending.",

        "content": "The deadline for applying for the post of Team India's head coach has ended on Monday. Following that, the Board of Control for Cricket in India and its top name, chose to be silent. After the Kolkata Knight Riders' IPL 2024 triumph, the name of Gautam Gambhir is getting more attention. With both parties not commenting anything on the matter, it seems that the Indian board doesn't have too many options available for the position. ADVERTISEMENT Currently, most of the Indian team players have travelled to New York for the T20 World Cup 2024 under the guidance of head coach Rahul Dravid. The only thing confirmed is that no foreign player has applied for the position after the board's secretary Jay Shah clarified that the Board is looking at someone who has risen through the ranks and knows the domestic structure. It could be safe to say that the board's primary target was who is currently the head of National Cricket Academy. But the veteran seems to be least interested in a full-time position which demands him to be available for 10 months a year. \"The deadline is fine, but the BCCI brass wouldn't mind taking some more time before reaching a decision. Right now, the team will be busy with World T20 for the better part of the month of June. After that seniors will be rested from tours of Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe where any of the NCA-based senior coaches can accompany the team. So what's the hurry,\" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Also, KKR principal owner Shah Rukh Khan shares a deep bond with Gautam Gambhir and it is not easy to leave an IPL team which has been a part of the identity of the former India opener. There's another aspect that needs to be looked into seriously what senior India players, currently in New York, feel about whether Gambhir can indeed be Rahul Dravid's replacement.",

Ashok Korsa (25) was apprehended on Monday from Bazarpara area under the Farsegarh police limits, an official said, reported PTI. Korsa, who carried a bounty of Rs 10,000, was involved in an IED blast attack on the vehicle of a police officer on May 15, he said.

The duo carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh each, he said. As per the PTI report, the two were involved in an attack on security personnel in the forest near Gundam village in February this year. Three Naxalites, including two women, were killed in an encounter with security personnel in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli district on Monday, authorities said. According to Superintendent of Police Neelotpal, intelligence sources indicate that members of the Naxalites' Perimili Dalam were plotting subversive actions in a forest near Katrangatta hamlet in Bhamragad taluka during their ongoing Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign (TCOC), reported PTI. According to the report, responding to the intelligence, two units of , the Gadchiroli police's specialised combat wing, were dispatched to conduct a search operation in the region.

Additionally, security authorities recovered an AK-47 weapon, a carbine, an INSAS rifle, Naxal literature, and other items from the site. The anti-Naxal operation is still ongoing in the area, as Naxalites normally increase their activity during the TCOC season from March to June, hoping to build their ranks and launch large attacks on security troops because of limited forest cover, the PTI report further stated.",

        "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah killed at least 45 people, according to local officials.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel’s close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian terrorists and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its , in which terrorists killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory .",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: NIA, as part of a multi-state crackdown on organised trafficking syndicates engaged in luring Indian youths with false promise of jobs in Cambodia, Laos, Golden Triangle SEZ and forcing them to work in cyber fraud centres there, arrested five persons on Monday after raiding 15 locations across 7 states and Union territories (UTs). Among the states/UTs where NIA carried out the searches in coordination with the local police and intelligence agencies, were Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab & Chandigarh. Eight fresh FIRs were registered and five accused — Manish Hingu of Vadodara, Pahlad singh of Gopalganj, Nabialam Ray of south west Delhi, Balwant Kataria of Gurugram and Sartaj Singh of Chandigarh — arrested. NIA investigations have revealed the accused to be involved in an organised trafficking syndicate engaged in luring and trafficking Indian youth to foreign countries on the false promises of legal employment. The youths were being forced to work in fake call centers at Laos, Golden Triangle SEZ, and Cambodia, among other places, as part of the racket, controlled and operated mainly by foreign nationals. They were coerced into undertaking illegal activities online, such as credit card fraud, investments in cryptocurrency using fake applications, honey trapping etc. Investigations have further revealed that the arrested accused were coordinating with traffickers operating from across the international border to facilitate illegal border-crossing of Indian youth from Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to Laos SEZ. They were working at the behest of foreign-based agents belonging to well organised syndicates that were active in several districts of Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujrat, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana etc . These syndicates were further connected to operatives based in other parts of India, as well as foreign countries like UAE, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos SEZ etc. NIA had taken over the relevant case from Mumbai police on May 13, 2024. It found that the human trafficking syndicate was not operating merely in Mumbai but had linkages with other facilitators and traffickers in various parts of the country and across the border. The searches on Saturday led to the seizure of several incriminating materials including documents, digital devices, handwritten registers, multiple passports, bogus overseas employment letters etc, said NIA.",

        "description": "What are the various policies and schemes introduced by the Indian government with respect to menstrual hygiene management? What did a study in a Maharashtra prison reveal about women prisoners and their access to water and sanitation facilities?",
        "content": "The story so far: India has witnessed a promising shift in the landscape of menstrual hygiene management over the years. The fifth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 2019-2020) revealed that about eight out of 10 young women aged 15-24 years are now using safe menstrual hygiene products. While urban areas and certain demographics have seen improved usage of menstrual hygiene products, the plight of one of the most marginalised populations — women in Indian prisons — remains overlooked. In a society where prisoners are deemed unworthy of fundamental rights, female prisoners face an even greater injustice. Society clings to an unrealistic standard of female purity, refusing to accept that women, too, can commit crimes. This bias has led to a systemic oversight and neglect of female prisoner’s basic needs, including menstrual hygiene. What is the status of menstrual hygiene in prisons? According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there are 23,772 women in Indian prisons. Of them, 77% are in the reproductive age group (18-50 years) and are likely to be regular menstruators. However, the availability of sanitary napkins has been inconsistent across different prisons in the country. The quality of sanitary napkins has also been unsatisfactory. Despite recommendations outlined in the 2016 Model Prison Manual, many States have not implemented provisions like supplying adequate water and washroom facilities for female prisoners. Overcrowding and poor socio-economic conditions further exacerbate the struggle of incarcerated women to secure basic necessities such as water, sanitary napkins, detergent, and soap during menstruation. A study conducted by one of the authors (Himani Gupta) in a prison in Maharashtra in June 2023 revealed that water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities failed to meet the demands of women imprisoned there. This presents significant challenges for women, who need more water to maintain personal hygiene during menstruation. The lack of continuous water supply also forced women to store water, taking up valuable space in the limited number of toilets available. About 50 women were forced to share just two toilets for all their daily activities, including excreting, changing napkins, and washing clothes and utensils. Women also reported feeling discouraged from using the filthy washrooms for frequent urination, which led to a greater incidence of urinary infections. The study also found that prison authorities depended on sanitary napkins donated by non-governmental organisations. Decisions about the type, quality, and quantity of menstrual absorbents were left to these organisations, often resulting in the supply of substandard products. Many women reported that the quantity of sanitary napkins provided was insufficient, and that the quality was poor (subpar absorption, causing discomfort, skin rashes, and infections).In one instance, the prison received a donation of ‘reusable’ sanitary napkins. Each woman was given only one pair to manage her entire menstrual cycle. With severely limited access to water and detergent, washing these reusable napkins after each use became impractical. What have been policy interventions? India has been making consistent efforts to improve access to menstrual hygiene products, especially among young women through the Menstrual Hygiene Scheme which includes the distribution of free or subsidised sanitary napkins. To make sanitary napkins more affordable for underprivileged women, the Suraksha Suvidha Napkins are also being sold at Jan Aushadhi Kendras for ₹1 per napkin. In 2023, India took an important stride forward by formulating the ‘National Menstrual Hygiene Policy’, to recognise menstruation as a natural process that demands more meaningful attention. At its heart lies a crucial principle: ensuring equity in the safe and dignified management of menstrual hygiene. The draft policy states: “Prioritise equity to enable all menstruating individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status and geographical location, to have equal opportunities to access and manage their menstruation in a safe and hygienic way. Address disparities and barriers that prevent certain groups from accessing required menstrual hygiene products, resources and information.” Remarkably, the policy identifies prisoners as a target population with a compromised access to menstrual hygiene facilities. This inclusion reflects a positive step forward. However, the policy falls short of providing a concrete action plan to enhance menstrual hygiene management in prisons. It also overlooks the Ministry of Home Affairs as a critical stakeholder that influences menstrual hygiene management in prisons. What needs to be done? The Indian government must ensure that basic standards of menstrual hygiene for women in captivity are met. The uneven implementation of the Model Prison Manual 2016 across States demands urgent attention as well. As a first step, the government must ensure every State adheres to the recommendations outlined in the manual. The experience of menstruation within prisons presents unique challenges that demand attention through a public health lens, particularly as part of the fight against ‘period poverty’. The next step is to encourage collaboration between public health authorities and prison administrators to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure access to adequate menstrual hygiene products and facilities while prioritising the health and dignity of women behind bars. Third, there is a dearth of empirical evidence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct research to understand the current state of menstrual hygiene within prison walls.

Activision, the company that makes the Call of Duty game franchise, Microsoft , which makes the Xbox video game console, as well as Facebook 's parent company Meta and gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, were named in the lawsuit filed in California on Friday. The lawyers accused the firms of promoting gun culture to 'insecure' boys, including Uvalde school shooter who killed more than 20 students and teachers with an AR-15 style assault rifle in 2022. While the exact monetary value of the damages sought has not yet been specified, the legal team is the same that won a $73 million settlement from Remington over its gun's role in the Sandy Hook massacre . Attorneys who won a $73 million settlement from Remington over its gun's role in the Sandy Hook massacre are now taking on video game-makers and social media: Activision, makers of the Call of Duty series, as well as Instagram's parent company Meta, are named in the new suit For its part, Activision released a statement expressing its 'deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence.' But, the game maker added, 'Academic and scientific research continues to show that there is no causal link between video games and gun violence.' Two teachers and 19 fourth grade children were killed in the city of Uvalde on May 24, 2022 when a teenage gunman went on a rampage with an AR-15 style assault rifle at Robb Elementary School in Texas, 80 miles west of San Antonio. It was the deadliest school shooting in America in the decade since the Sandy Hook school shooting — in which 20 children and six adults were killed by a similarly unstable young man with an assault rifle . The Uvalde shooter, who bought his weapon legally in Texas right after turning 18, posted a photo of his Daniel Defense DDM4V7 rifle to Instagram days before the massacre (above) Josh Koskoff, the lead attorney for the Uvalde victims families, argued that there was 'a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting,' Well before the gunman was old enough to purchase the Daniel Defense-made, AR-15-style assault rifle used in the mass killing, according to Koskoff, 'he was targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense.' The gunman, who bought the weapon legally in Texas right after turning 18 , posted a photo of his Daniel Defense DDM4V7 rifle to Instagram days before the massacre. 'This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it,' Koskoff said. In its statement responding to the suit, Activision acknowledged that the tragedy at Uvalde 'horrendous and heartbreaking in every way' but denied any culpability. 'Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts,' the company noted. Last year, researchers with Stanford University's Brainstorm Lab reviewed 82 medical journal articles that they said 'encompass all the reputed literature and scholarship' hunting for a causal relationship between video games and violence. Two teachers and 19 fourth graders were killed in the city of Uvalde on May 24, 2022 when a teenage gunman went on a rampage with an AR-15 style assault rifle at Robb Elementary School in Texas, 80 miles west of San Antonio. It was the deadliest school shooting in a decade 'Even when considering the range of actions [...] from a simple push all the way up to assault with deadly force,' Stanford psychiatrist Dr. David Dupee, the lab's director, said, 'such studies did not find a causal link.' However, a growing number of studies, including 2017 research in the journal Social Affective and Cognitive Neuroscience, has determined that frequent players of graphically violent video games were 'less empathetic' than other gamers . A related 2023 study has called for longer-term research, involving brain-scanning fMRI technology, to compare whether or not persistent exposure to violent video games has an impact on 'empathy for pain.' Neither Instagram's parent firm, Meta, nor Daniel Defense has responded to requests for comment about the lawsuit, according to newswire Agence France-Presse. Josh Koskoff, the lead attorney for the Uvalde victims families, argued that there was 'a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting' Despite Instagram's platform-wide ban on firearms advertising, the lawsuit argues that the Meta-owner app gave Daniel Defense ample opportunity to promote its weapons through 'organic' content via its own profile and social media influencers. 'Refuse to be a victim,' one of the gun-maker's Instagram posts declared, alongside a photo of a person pulling an assault-style rifle from the trunk of a car.

The suit described Activision's 'Call of Duty' game franchise as a 'cunning form of marketing [that] has helped cultivate a new, youthful consumer base for the AR-15 assault rifle.' The suit comes just days after Uvalde families reached a $2 million settlement with the city over what the US Department of Justice found were 'critical failures\" by local police in their response to the shooting during critical moments on May 24, 2022. After waiting more than an hour, officers eventually shot and killed the gunman, storming the classroom where he had hid in a closet waiting to ambush police. School shootings have become a regular occurrence in the United States, where roughly one third of adults own a firearm and regulations have grown permissive on the purchasing even powerful military-style assault rifles.

        "content": "You want down-home... Potter Valley, Saturday morning...folks lined up and down Main Street, young and old and in-between, with nary a head without a cowboy hat upon it. I made sure to wear my old Shady Grady. It’s Memorial Day Weekend and the Potter Valley Spring Festival and Rodeo — over 77 years and going strong — first held in 1946 and a major fundraiser for many of the local non-profits and churches in town, takes over the town. The parade, sponsored by the Potter Valley Youth and Community Center, led by the rodeo queen and her entourage, begins a bit after 11 a.m. This year’s theme, Blue Jeans and Country Dreams, was well represented on a few of the floats but none so uniquely as the group of young horsewomen from White Dog Ranch, parade winners, whose horses’ front legs were fully be-jeaned. The parade kept coming with Jim Eddy pulling a float of happy family campers, a small flotilla of back-packing goats, a festive C&S. Waste Solutions garbage truck, about eight fire trucks with their horns a-blaring, P.V. FFA, a Save Lake Pillsbury float, Kudos for Kids on a 1952 Chevy truck with less than 20,000 miles on it, the P.V. Bible Church, a bunch of raucous Dolly Parton look-a-likes, the Pauli Family 1948 power wagon float, and more, including 7-year-old Red Bluff Junior Roundup Little Miss whose favorite thing is branding cows. She looks to have been born in the saddle. Potter Valley Youth and Community Center began sponsoring the parade back in, oh, about 2008, and Sheri Burris, director and program coordinator with PVYCC and one of the key organizers of the parade, a 60-year P.V. resident, born and raised here, remembers her mother and her best friend dressing up as clowns back in the ’70s, pulling a wagon and throwing candy. “Nobody knew who they were.” I told her this was the most down-home parade I’d ever seen. “That just warms my heart,” she says. “We’re behind the scenes and don’t always know how it’s received. This is one community event that brings people together and also brings people from out of town who used to live here. It warms my heart that it’s still going strong after all these years.” Back towards Hoppers Corner and into the rodeo grounds, the ax throwing and wood cutting competitions are up next. Ian Blundell, West Coast amateur timber sports competitor, overseeing the ax throwing competition, explains that each contestant gets four throws, and the three best are counted, one-handed or two-handed. “In the middle, the bullseye, we have the beer can, so if you pop it, you get a free drink,” he says. The arena gets quiet for the Star-Spangled Banner and soon after final adjustments are being made to the log decks and chain saws are being fired up for the wood cutting competition. Bobby Johnson, who is competing on the Johnson’s Quality Tree Care team with his father Kurt and brother KC, takes the time to explain how it works. Six log decks have been set up with five or six, 8-foot-long tan oak logs. The goal is to cut the logs into 14-18-inch rounds, split them and stack them. They have to be split in a certain way: at the widest point they can be no bigger than 9 inches and no smaller than 3 1⁄2 inches. If they are bigger or smaller, those pieces are disqualified. The goal is to get as many pieces as possible; they don’t necessarily have to be big. It’s timed at 12 minutes. And there’s nice looking belt buckles for the winners. Each three-man team gets one chain saw and two splitting mauls; if you break a maul, you’re out of luck. I ask Bobby if it’s his dad’s last year. “It’s his last year if he wins.” Year 34 for Kurt Johnson, he’s won about 50 percent of them. He and his son KC won last year and in 2014, the three family men won the championship. “It keeps me young and my boys keep me young. It if weren’t for them, I wouldn’t do it anymore. It’s a long 12 minutes. I’ll do it one more time,” he says. But Bobby said it’s your last time if you win. “This is it for sure.” Joe Goeken competing with Derick and Dustin Trimble, The Trimble Brothers Construction, has been competing since1996 and he’s won a number of times, missing only during his years in Iraq and a year in Japan with the Marine Corps. “It’s the most intense 12 minutes you’ll ever have. It’s a butt kicker; no matter what kind of shape you’re in going into it, it’ll kick your butt every time... but you always come back for more.” As time for sign up is getting close, 21-year-old Kieran Keaney, from Petaluma, shows up for the ax throw, looks over and decides, as a complete neophyte to the competition but not to log splitting, he’s going to enter. However, he’s in shorts and needs two teammates and a pair of jeans to compete. Pretty soon, not thwarted by size of the competitors or the depth of their experience, he’s got it together and ready to go with a pair of jeans, two more team members and equipment loaned from the Johnson family — Team Chainsaw. Hog Wild Farms enters bringing the total to four teams, the countdown begins and its two sets of competition, two teams per session. It is indeed a very intense 12 minutes. Final score: Trimble Construction 227, Johnson Quality Tree Care 184, Hog Wild Farms, 134; and Team Chainsaw 103.",

        "description": "High Noon's vodka iced tea lineup includes Original, Lemon, Peach, and Raspberry. We cracked open a can of each to find out if they're as sweet as they sound.",
        "content": "As a tried and true drinker, I am not one for the seltzer world. However, when I was offered the chance to try High Noon's new Vodka Iced Tea line, I jumped at the opportunity. floats my boat, so I was ready to see if this top seltzer brand's hard tea was on par with my palate. High Noon's recently-launched four vodka iced tea flavors include Original, Lemon, Peach, and Raspberry. Each flavor is gluten free, only 90 calories, and 4.5% ABV. Made with real iced tea, real vodka, and no added sugar, I stood at attention, waiting for my package to arrive. I anticipated the flavor differences between your typical malt-based hard teas and this new twist with vodka, but I wasn't ready for what I found. Barbecues, beach days, concert tailgating -– this new addition to the High Noon family has all the makings for a great summer drink. Do these cans really have the \"spirit of summer in every sip?\" Let's find out. What does High Noon's Original Vodka Iced Tea taste like? It felt right to start this review with the OG — High Noon's Original Vodka Iced Tea. I have to say, I was blown away by the flavor! This option literally tasted like sweetened iced tea. There was a touch of alcohol in the aftertaste, but I couldn't tell it was vodka. For me, that's a huge win. However, I think my favorite part was the actual tea flavor. It really did taste like . With no sugar, I'm still trying to figure out how they made this hard drink so sweet. But the flavor wasn't cloying; just a touch of sugar to mellow out the black tea's bitter essence. These could be very dangerous on a hot summer's day. Needless to say, High Noon really pushed me to expand my tea-loving ways. The Original flavor was excellent, mimicking a with an alcoholic twist. I can't believe I'm saying this, but you might see me this summer with a High Noon in hand! What does High Noon's Lemon Vodka Iced Tea taste like? After trying the Original flavor, I had high hopes for High Noon's Lemon Vodka Iced Tea. I was anticipating a touch of acidity to an already stellar drink, but this one didn't really taste like lemon or iced tea at all. I could definitely pick out notes of lemon, but it reminded me more of the smell and taste of a flavored vodka. I had a few quick flashbacks to my younger years; think Bacardi. There wasn't a huge kick like you'd get with a shot of vodka, but it wasn't tea-tasting at all. There was no foundation of that signature black tea flavor like with the Original, leaving me a little confused when it came to this option. I guess if you like mixed drinks that lean lemon, you might like this one, but for me, this was a hard no. With no tea flavor and a vodka-leaning taste, I'll stick to what I know. What does High Noon's Peach Vodka Iced Tea taste like? After the lemon, I was a little nervous to try High Noon's Peach Vodka Iced Tea, but I have to say, this one surprised me. The peach scent was strong when I opened the can, and the taste followed suit, but it wasn't that artificial flavoring I was anticipating. No, this drink really tasted like it contained fresh peach juice. When it came to the tea base, I didn't really get the flavor until the aftertaste, where I got hints of black tea's bitter essence on the backend of the sip. There was a little alcohol flavor, as well, but it wasn't strong or overpowering. Overall, I'd call this one tea-adjacent. I didn't mind it, as it wasn't too sweet, but it didn't exactly taste like an iced tea. However, I'd still recommend it. The drink was crisp and refreshing — perfect for summer — but it wasn't for me. I want to taste the tea and feel like I'm on Grandma's porch on a 90-degree day. Peach was good, but it didn't impress. What does High Noon's Raspberry Vodka Iced Tea taste like? My last taste test in the lineup was the Raspberry Vodka Iced Tea flavor, and I have to say, I didn't love it. However, this one did taste like tea; you just have to appreciate and enjoy raspberry, which I've learned I don't. The main flavor in the profile was a strong and bold raspberry that leaned tart and a little artificial. But with that bold fruity flavor came black tea on the backend to help smooth out the acidic bite. If you like raspberry, you'll love this one, but I did get subtle hints of vodka, leaning more towards that over a true flavored iced tea. Was this one bad? Absolutely not, but it's definitely not for me. For those who love berry drinks, I do recommend High Noon's Raspberry Vodka Iced Tea, especially if you're a tea drinker — with or without alcohol. Our final thoughts on High Noon's vodka iced tea line High Noon's new vodka iced teas were a lot better than I expected. I love sugar and I dislike , so it's saying a lot that I found some real winners here. If I had to pick one, hands down, it's the Original. This is a solid tea drink and one I would reach for, especially since it has no sugar. This is a huge selling point for me — and for High Noon when you look at the other tea drinks on the market. It's the reason I have to be cautious when I reach for a hard tea option, but now, I don't have to worry one bit. Overall, I think this is a really great selection of hard iced teas –- all featuring their own unique flavor profiles. The brand truly created something for everyone in the tea world, and I definitely recommended giving them a try!",

        "content": "Mixed reactions have continued to trail the one year anniversary of President Bola Tinubu’s administration with knocks and praises by some Nigerians. Tinubu was inaugurated as the 16th President of Nigeria on May 29, 2023. Some residents of Okitipupa in Ondo State who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday, commended Tinubu for his efforts at fixing the nation’s economy, while others said that he had failed Nigerians because of their high expectations from him. While calling on Tinubu to search for competent hands, the respondents urged him to rejig his for optimal performance. Mrs Morenike Alaka, a former Chairman, Okitipupa Local Government, told NAN that Tinubu was not the genesis of the current economic woes being experienced by Nigerians, saying it was an inherited problem. Alaka noted that it was not possible to fix the current situation of the country without effecting some policies that would be unfavourable to Nigerians in the short-term but would be beneficial in the long-term. “We just need to cooperate and continue to pray for this government, and I can assure you that what we are facing right now are just measures which is hard now but we will enjoy in the long run,” she said. Mr Niyi Adesokan, Chairman, Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Okitipupa Local Government Chapter, also said that Tinubu was only trying to fix the economy, adding that most of the problems being experienced “are only teething problems which shall vade out very soon.” He added that the immediate past government destroyed so many things “especially on borrowing which is literally having negative effects on the country and her currency. “On the issue of the local government autonomy, Tinubu has shown commitment to putting this in place in every local government with a view to ensuring development at the grassroots. Once the autonomy is given, you will see vast development from the grassroots,” he said. However, Dr Dipo Akomolafe, a former Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at the Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology (OAUSTECH), Okitipupa, said “the first one year of Tinubu’s administration has been a challenging one to individuals and the nation at large”. According to him, Nigerians are finding it extremely difficult to feed and shelter, while people can no longer afford the means of transportation. Akomolafe, who noted that the education sector was also adversely affected, said the health and welfare of staff of tertiary institutions were stagnated through inadequate budgetary allocation which, according to him, is hampering them from performing their core roles of research. He said that “though the country is truly blessed with abundant mineral resources, our focus all along has been oil; a gift that has significantly contributed to the economy of Nigeria as a whole. “In order to achieve development, it is imperative that we diversify and institutionalise foundational economic frameworks to fully reap the blessings of oil itself and focus on other resources and agriculture.” Also, Mr Larry Ogunmusire, a People’s Democratic Party stalwart, who described Tinubu’s one year administration as very challenging, noted that his economic policies brought more pains to Nigerians. He added that power and the defence sectors were badly hit as many Nigerians have not been enjoying eight hours electricity in the last one year, while many can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed for fear of being kidnapped. According to him, the subsidy removal by Tinubu during his inaugural speech, affects the economy leading to untold hardship in the country. “I think he needs to change his economic policies and rejig his cabinet, and replace non performing ministers with people of track records and high profiles who can help drive the economy,” Ogunmusire said. Also Mr Temidayo Temola, Chairman, Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU), OAUSTECH Chapter, said that Tinubu’s government has not renewed the hope of Nigerians as encapsulated in his campaign manifesto. He said that in the last one year, the astronomical increase in prices of goods and services is not only frustrating but killing “as many of what the masses could afford are no longer affordable. “On the education sector, nothing has significantly improved as non payment of the withheld salaries of the university staff has remained a forlorn hope. “The president and his team have to sit right and find a lasting solution to the myriad of problems ranging from food, exchange rate, security, power and agriculture, among others, are resolved,” Temola said.

        "description": "One small step for man, one giant leap for bacon lovers everywhere. Here's how Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ended up eating bacon during the moon landing.",
        "content": "When Apollo 11 landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, it was a momentous occasion. Upwards of 650 million people around the world sat in stunned silence and anticipation as two American astronauts took their first steps on Earth's satellite planet. When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went back to the lunar module after their initial exploration, it wouldn't have surprised anyone if they feasted on dehydrated surf and turf, with glasses of floating champagne in celebration, but it wasn't beef or lobster on their plates, it was bacon. Any bacon lover would agree that the salty, crunchy, porky, fatty food is completely appropriate for celebratory occasions (or any occasion, really), but the pork product likely wasn't chosen to be part of the astronauts' meal plan because they requested it. Rather, it traveled well in space. Figuring out which foods could be transported into and consumed in low-gravity conditions was just one large piece of the space travel puzzle for NASA scientists to figure out before Apollo 11. Foods had to meet weight and volume limits, stay safe and edible without refrigeration, not be overly crumbly (fine crumbs could affect equipment), and offer enough calories and nutrition for the astronauts. Bacon checked all the boxes, as did peaches, strawberry cubes, and grape and orange drinks, which rounded out the meal Armstrong and Aldrin dined on after their moonwalk. Space food had already come a long way By the time of the Apollo missions, scientists and astronauts had already been testing edibles in space during the prior Mercury and Gemini missions. Fast-forward to the 1969 moon landing, and the food wasn't bad, by comparison. During the Project Mercury flights, much of the food astronauts ate came in paste form, in toothpaste-like tubes. In April 1961, Soviet pilot and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly to space, and he feasted on beef and liver paste in a tube. Yum. During the Gemini missions, cosmic culinary arts had improved, with an emphasis put on freeze-drying and dehydrating foods for space flights. The foods could be placed in packages in which water could be inserted for rehydration. During the Apollo years, the foods' packaging was similar to those during Gemini, but the variety was greater. Foods in the pilots' meal plans included cornflakes, scrambled eggs, hot dogs, spaghetti, tuna salad, and peanut butter. Coffee was also placed on the menu — and if you ask me, what could be better than coffee and bacon, with a view of planet Earth to go with it? Is bacon still on the microgravity menu? During Apollo 13, astronaut Jim Lovell reportedly told mission control, \"Happiness is bacon squares for breakfast.\" The appreciation for bacon is clearly out of this world, yet, someone, somewhere (likely a brainiac at NASA) decided bacon didn't need to be a food option for astronauts anymore. Although the food list has grown from fewer than 70 foods in the Apollo era to over 200 today, bacon is noticeably missing. The closest thing space travelers will find are sausage patties. Of course, one hardly becomes an astronaut for the food, and it's a good thing they don't have to squeeze meat paste from a tube anymore, but, seriously NASA, bacon can't take up that much room aboard, can it? Things are a bit different at the International Space Station, which has refrigeration and freezing capabilities. Here, visitors will find bacon and a large variety of meals, fresh fruits, desserts, dairy items, and snacks. Recommended",

        "content": "Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 general elections, has explained what will make him consider a merger between the LP and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2023 general elections. Obi spoke in an interview on Noire TV-Global Black TV during the weekend. He also reacted to the possibility of being supported as a southeast candidate in the 2027 presidential election by Atiku Abubakar, which he said he appreciated. Obi said: “I commend him. And I’m grateful for his statements. Especially where he said he will support me if it (the presidential ticket) goes to the South-East.” The former Anambra State governor, however, noted that his primary concern is not personal ambition or political maneuvering, but rather the well-being of Nigeria and its people. “I’m not desperate to be president. I’m desperate to see Nigeria work, especially for the poor people because we have a lot of potential”, Obi said. On the potential merger between the PDP and LP, Obi said he is open to the idea, provided that the goal is to better govern Nigeria and unlock its vast potential. “If the merger is to be able to govern Nigeria properly, unlock all those things that will make Nigeria a better place, I’m for it,” he said, adding that he has no interest in mergers or alliances solely to secure power or win elections. Read also: Justice Minister, Fagbemi wants State electoral commissions scrapped “If it’s just a merger for election or state capture, I’m not for it or part of it. I don’t want to be part of anything like that,” he said. According to him, unity and cooperation among individuals and parties is a welcome development, only if the objective is to build a better Nigeria. Peter Obi said: “It might be at the party level, it might be at the individual level. Might be at any level. But we must come together to be able to build a better Nigeria.” Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "BURGER King is bringing back its $5 value meal in a bid to rival McDonald's. However, customers have concerns over the portion sizes. Burger King is set to unveil a $5 ‘Your Way Meal’ as fast food competitors wage a price war. As first reported by Bloomberg , the meal will include the customer's choice of one of three sandwiches, fries, chicken nuggets, and a drink. For the sandwich, the options will be a Whopper Jr, a Chicken Jr, or a Bacon Cheeseburger. \"We are bringing back our $5 Your Way Meal as agreed upon with our franchisees back in April,” the company said in a statement to USA TODAY. The promotion is expected to last a few months when it hits menus. While it's not yet known when the Your Way Meal will make its debut, Burger King execs have said they want it to beat the arrival of the $5 value meal at McDonald's on June 25. The $5 McDonald's meal will include a McChicken or McDouble, four-piece chicken McNuggets, medium fries, and a drink However, the promotion will only last a few weeks. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said the chain is \"laser-focussed on affordability\" during a late April earnings call. It has suffered consumer backlash for the inflation of its menu prices over the last decade. Burger King has not made it clear what size the portions of fries, nuggets, and the drink will be in the $5 meal. This has led some customers to worry that the portions will be small. \"Let me guess -- a small fry and small drink,\" predicted one on Reddit . \"For only 25 cents less you can get a super small!\" joked another. One Burger King fan shared their hunger-busting solution. \"These are usually smaller portions but even then, if you're really hungry, for around $12 including taxes you can get two of these deals and get a total of eight items - not a bad deal at all. The U.S. Sun compared prices for a single cheeseburger at five different fast food chains in Chicago, Illinois: Other fast-food chains are also battling it out to offer the best value for diners. Wendy's has brought back its $3 breakfast combo . The chain is also giving away burgers for just one cent . Meanwhile, Buffalo Wild Wings has brought back its all-you-can-eat deal .",

        "content": "It was another impressive outing for 35-year-old left-hander Chris Sale . Sale (8-1), struck out eight while pitching seven innings of one-run ball. Sale has reformed his game that earned him seven consecutive All-Star selections from 2012-18 before injuries caught up to him. “Just doing what I need to do,” Sale said to The Canadian Press. “We all have our part on the team. Just posting every fifth day and trying to keep runs off the board. Take every start, you want to win. Had a couple of rough ones over the last couple of days. You want to end on a good note heading back home.” Ending on a good note, indeed. Sale has a 2.22 ERA in nine starts. He went into Sunday’s start at Pittsburgh on a six-game winning streak where he’s put up a 1.15 ERA with 50 strikeouts and only three walks in 39 innings. That success of late, according to JayHayKid, has Sale joining Fergie Jenkins (1971) as the only pitcher to ever go 7-0 with 50+ strikeouts and four or fewer walks over a seven-start span. Chris Sale joins Fergie Jenkins (1971) as the only pitchers ever to go 7-0 with 50+ K and 4 or fewer BB over a 7-start span. — nugget chef (@jayhaykid) May 27, 2024 Chris Sale Looks Like Himself Again Sale’s last healthy season goes back to 2017. He finished second in the American League Cy Young Award voting after going 17-8 with a 2.90 ERA and led the majors with 308 strikeouts and 214 1/3 innings in 32 starts. He might not able to replicate that season, but Sale has been one of the best surprising stories this season. “It’s even more so once you get to know the person, get to the competitor, get to know really what he’s all about,” Braves pitching coach Rick Kranitz said. “He threw the ball the other day and was unbelievably good. He came in and he’s saying, just between me and him, stuff like, ‘How ’bout those plays (Austin) Riley made?’ ‘How ’bout the catch that so-and-so made.’ You know what I mean? I said, ‘Well how ’bout the guy that struck out 10?’ “But it just shows, he’s very giving, he’s thoughtful to his teammates. He’s as good of a teammate, I think, as you will ever have.” First @Braves pitcher since 2003 to win seven consecutive starts.

But, they are happy that Sale and Max Fried are getting the job done. Fried, who has a 2.01 ERA, has opposing hitters batting .162 in his past eight starts . Behind those two is Reynaldo López , who has a 1.75 ERA with a 2-2 record. It’s no secret that the pitching is carrying much more of the load than last year. For someone like Sale, he’s been important in that effort both on and off the field. “It’s great, because he has a lot of wisdom,” Krantz said. “Which really helps everybody. Young guys, the older guys. You put that on how hard he’s worked due to injuries, so he can offer that to our guys. You know, he’s at a different level than a lot of pitchers in this game. He’s been through a lot, he’s won a World Series, All-Star Games, and he’s still very humble.” This article first appeared on Last Word On Sports and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "Eccleston Delph is a haven for divers and swimmers",
        "content": "Tucked away in the countryside less than an hour's drive from Liverpool is an attraction which harbours a dark secret. Over 20 metres beneath the surface of Eccleston Delph, Chorley lies a children's playground, armoured personnel carriers and an aeroplane. With several cars and a speedboat that once belonged to comedians Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, the abandoned quarry is a haven for divers to explore. It has even served as the backdrop for several dramatic TV scenes for shows including Hollyoaks and Coronation Street. In scenes filmed in 2014, Hollyoaks' shady detective Sonny Valentine - portrayed by Aaron Fontaine - was tied up in the boot of a car. As the show's McQueen family looked away, the car could be seen rolling into the quarry. But Eccleston Delph has had its own real-life crime drama unfolding beneath the surface. Back in 1979, the tranquil spot on Halfpenny Lane was buzzing with activity when the body of a handless corpse was discovered floating near an underwater platform, reports . As divers Jeff Ashcroft and Ian Reading approached the water's edge, they made the grim discovery that would connect the secluded location to an international crime ring. The state of the body and the nature of the injuries led police to conclude this was no 'ordinary' murder - and this was not a local man, sparking an international murder investigation into the gangland execution. These days, Eccleston Delph is a peaceful haven for wildlife and outdoor swimmers. The on-site dive shop offers a range of equipment for divers and swimmers, with facilities available for equipment hire and maintenance. Marked by buoys on the surface, Eccleston Delph is a popular spot for swimmers training for triathlon or endurance events. However, it's also a great place for those who prefer a leisurely breaststroke surrounded by nature. On Tuesday evenings, the air buzzes with the sound of engines and the scent of exhaust fumes as bikers gather from all around. The café, open seven days a week, serves a selection of homemade food and cakes.

        "description": "Former leader of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), Nelson Chamisa, has once again called on SADC to address Zimbabwe’s governance crisis, asserting that the country cannot plan for the 2028 polls while the 2023 election result is still contested.",
        "content": "Chamisa claims he has devised a way forward, sharing the roadmap with all key stakeholders, and plans to reveal this proposed roadmap in due course. “We have engaged different stakeholders within the SADC region, even at the Heads of State level. I have sent delegations to various capitals in the region and the continent to brief esteemed leaders about the election dispute in Zimbabwe, the political stalemate, and our proposed way forward,” Chamisa said at a press conference held on Monday in Harare. “We are acutely aware of the urgency of this matter. There can be no talk of 2028 or a viable and stable future for this country without resolving the August 2023 issues,” he added. Chamisa stated he would not consider political participation in 2028 until the 2023 issue was settled. “Let’s fix 2023 and not wait for 2028,” he said. Chamisa, who received over two million votes in the 2023 presidential election, said he was ready to seek a resolution as a national leader, avoiding partisan politics. “That mandate cannot be abdicated, abandoned, or squandered. On September 26, 2023, we wrote to our regional body, SADC, the guarantor of the values and principles of the aspirations of the ‘common agenda’ and ‘common will’ of the people of Southern Africa,” Chamisa said, adding that he wrote again to SADC on October 23, 2023. “SADC responded to our request and advised that they were giving the matter due consideration through relevant organs. We have noted the various meetings the leadership of SADC has held, including the latest Extraordinary Summit of the Organ Troika on March 23, 2024, in Lusaka, Zambia.” Chamisa said they had been patiently waiting for a response from SADC. “On April 29, however, since considerable time had elapsed, I wrote again to SADC. We delivered our follow-up to SADC and await a response to determine a clear path forward to resolve the governance crisis and leadership dispute in the country,” he said, noting that Zimbabwean citizens were “very clear and firm” that the elections were improperly conducted, indeterminate, and produced a manipulated outcome. “This position is supported and confirmed by SADC, the African Union, the European Union, the Commonwealth, COMESA, Carter Center, and all other intergovernmental organizations which deployed election observer missions to Zimbabwe,” Chamisa said. Chamisa noted that no other election in Zimbabwe’s history has invited such ‘universal’ condemnation as the August 2023 elections. “This matter must be resolved so that the country can have proper elections that produce a proper government from the citizens,” he said, calling on SADC and the AU to act, given their condemnation of the 2023 election process. “Condoning the current government is clearly untenable. We don’t expect them to ultimately endorse a sham and a fraud. It would be a contradiction in terms to determine a process as flawed and yet condone its outcome.” Chamisa asserted that writing to SADC was not a sign of desperation or a lack of ideas but a “deliberate effort and a desire to exhaust the available remedies and peaceful means to resolve national issues.” “It is our strict commitment to finding each other and amicably resolving our points of conflict, disjuncture, and disagreement. We have committed to a peaceful resolution of disputes and intend to exhaust all available peaceful remedies,” Chamisa said. “As you are all aware, millions of you agree with this approach. Zimbabwe is too beautiful and precious to be destroyed by flames of political disputes under our watch. I don’t want to be the author of the demise of this nation. Peace is fragile. Peace is sacrosanct. And the breakdown of peace knows no winner. The opposite of peace leaves us all losers. Our beautiful country can never progress on the back of disunity, division, and successive disputed national processes, including contested elections.” Chamisa said he had made numerous efforts to engage with other presidential contenders, including Zanu PF leader President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is aware of their point of dispute. “I can tell you it is a disputed election, which is the center, basis, and foundation of our problems,” Chamisa said, adding that this was a point he made to regional bodies, highlighting that Zimbabwe had a “de facto government, a parliament that was also not de jure, including the local authorities.” Chamisa claimed he was “doing everything necessary, to the extent of God’s will, to seek a lasting solution to the perennial challenges” affecting Zimbabwe. “Locally and nationally, I have engaged all the stakeholders, including the traditional leadership, business community, civil society at large, political parties, and members of the diplomatic corps,” he said. In particular, Chamisa mentioned seeking the mediatory role of church leadership to help resolve the disputed elections and contested national processes, albeit with limited progress.",
