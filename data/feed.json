ADVERTISEMENT Currently, most of the Indian team players have travelled to New York for the T20 World Cup 2024 under the guidance of head coach Rahul Dravid. The only thing confirmed is that no foreign player has applied for the position after the board's secretary Jay Shah clarified that the Board is looking at someone who has risen through the ranks and knows the domestic structure. It could be safe to say that the board's primary target was who is currently the head of National Cricket Academy. But the veteran seems to be least interested in a full-time position which demands him to be available for 10 months a year. \"The deadline is fine, but the BCCI brass wouldn't mind taking some more time before reaching a decision. Right now, the team will be busy with World T20 for the better part of the month of June. After that seniors will be rested from tours of Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe where any of the NCA-based senior coaches can accompany the team. So what's the hurry,\" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Also, KKR principal owner Shah Rukh Khan shares a deep bond with Gautam Gambhir and it is not easy to leave an IPL team which has been a part of the identity of the former India opener. There's another aspect that needs to be looked into seriously what senior India players, currently in New York, feel about whether Gambhir can indeed be Rahul Dravid's replacement.",

        "content": "were arrested from separate places in on Monday, reported PTI citing the police. The three carried a cumulative reward of Rs 2.1 lakh on them. Ashok Korsa (25) was apprehended on Monday from Bazarpara area under the Farsegarh police limits, an official said, reported PTI. Korsa, who carried a bounty of Rs 10,000, was involved in an IED blast attack on the vehicle of a police officer on May 15, he said. ADVERTISEMENT The other two, Iriya Kadti, alias Bandu, and , were nabbed on Sunday during an anti-Naxal operation from the Peddagelur area under the Tarrem police station limits, the official said. Bandu was the president of Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangthan (DAKMS), a front organisation of Maoists, while Lakhma was the head of the Chetna Natya Manch (CNM), the cultural wing of the banned outfit, he said. The duo carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh each, he said. As per the PTI report, the two were involved in an attack on security personnel in the forest near Gundam village in February this year. Three Naxalites, including two women, were killed in an encounter with security personnel in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli district on Monday, authorities said. According to Superintendent of Police Neelotpal, intelligence sources indicate that members of the Naxalites' Perimili Dalam were plotting subversive actions in a forest near Katrangatta hamlet in Bhamragad taluka during their ongoing Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign (TCOC), reported PTI. According to the report, responding to the intelligence, two units of , the Gadchiroli police's specialised combat wing, were dispatched to conduct a search operation in the region. During the search, the Naxalites fired indiscriminately on the teams. In response, the C-60 crew retaliated, sparking a furious exchange of gunfire. Following the cease-fire, the bodies of one male and two female Naxalites were found at the encounter site. Among them was Vasu, the Perimili Dalam's in-charge and leader, the report added. Additionally, security authorities recovered an AK-47 weapon, a carbine, an INSAS rifle, Naxal literature, and other items from the site. The anti-Naxal operation is still ongoing in the area, as Naxalites normally increase their activity during the TCOC season from March to June, hoping to build their ranks and launch large attacks on security troops because of limited forest cover, the PTI report further stated.",

        "description": "You want down-home...Potter Valley, Saturday morning...folks lined up and down Main Street, young and old and in-between, with nary a head without a cowboy hat upon it.",
        "content": "You want down-home... Potter Valley, Saturday morning...folks lined up and down Main Street, young and old and in-between, with nary a head without a cowboy hat upon it. I made sure to wear my old Shady Grady. It’s Memorial Day Weekend and the Potter Valley Spring Festival and Rodeo — over 77 years and going strong — first held in 1946 and a major fundraiser for many of the local non-profits and churches in town, takes over the town. The parade, sponsored by the Potter Valley Youth and Community Center, led by the rodeo queen and her entourage, begins a bit after 11 a.m. This year’s theme, Blue Jeans and Country Dreams, was well represented on a few of the floats but none so uniquely as the group of young horsewomen from White Dog Ranch, parade winners, whose horses’ front legs were fully be-jeaned. The parade kept coming with Jim Eddy pulling a float of happy family campers, a small flotilla of back-packing goats, a festive C&S. Waste Solutions garbage truck, about eight fire trucks with their horns a-blaring, P.V. FFA, a Save Lake Pillsbury float, Kudos for Kids on a 1952 Chevy truck with less than 20,000 miles on it, the P.V. Bible Church, a bunch of raucous Dolly Parton look-a-likes, the Pauli Family 1948 power wagon float, and more, including 7-year-old Red Bluff Junior Roundup Little Miss whose favorite thing is branding cows. She looks to have been born in the saddle. Potter Valley Youth and Community Center began sponsoring the parade back in, oh, about 2008, and Sheri Burris, director and program coordinator with PVYCC and one of the key organizers of the parade, a 60-year P.V. resident, born and raised here, remembers her mother and her best friend dressing up as clowns back in the ’70s, pulling a wagon and throwing candy. “Nobody knew who they were.” I told her this was the most down-home parade I’d ever seen. “That just warms my heart,” she says. “We’re behind the scenes and don’t always know how it’s received. This is one community event that brings people together and also brings people from out of town who used to live here. It warms my heart that it’s still going strong after all these years.” Back towards Hoppers Corner and into the rodeo grounds, the ax throwing and wood cutting competitions are up next. Ian Blundell, West Coast amateur timber sports competitor, overseeing the ax throwing competition, explains that each contestant gets four throws, and the three best are counted, one-handed or two-handed. “In the middle, the bullseye, we have the beer can, so if you pop it, you get a free drink,” he says. The arena gets quiet for the Star-Spangled Banner and soon after final adjustments are being made to the log decks and chain saws are being fired up for the wood cutting competition. Bobby Johnson, who is competing on the Johnson’s Quality Tree Care team with his father Kurt and brother KC, takes the time to explain how it works. Six log decks have been set up with five or six, 8-foot-long tan oak logs. The goal is to cut the logs into 14-18-inch rounds, split them and stack them. They have to be split in a certain way: at the widest point they can be no bigger than 9 inches and no smaller than 3 1⁄2 inches. If they are bigger or smaller, those pieces are disqualified. The goal is to get as many pieces as possible; they don’t necessarily have to be big. It’s timed at 12 minutes. And there’s nice looking belt buckles for the winners. Each three-man team gets one chain saw and two splitting mauls; if you break a maul, you’re out of luck. I ask Bobby if it’s his dad’s last year. “It’s his last year if he wins.” Year 34 for Kurt Johnson, he’s won about 50 percent of them. He and his son KC won last year and in 2014, the three family men won the championship. “It keeps me young and my boys keep me young. It if weren’t for them, I wouldn’t do it anymore. It’s a long 12 minutes. I’ll do it one more time,” he says. But Bobby said it’s your last time if you win. “This is it for sure.” Joe Goeken competing with Derick and Dustin Trimble, The Trimble Brothers Construction, has been competing since1996 and he’s won a number of times, missing only during his years in Iraq and a year in Japan with the Marine Corps. “It’s the most intense 12 minutes you’ll ever have. It’s a butt kicker; no matter what kind of shape you’re in going into it, it’ll kick your butt every time... but you always come back for more.” As time for sign up is getting close, 21-year-old Kieran Keaney, from Petaluma, shows up for the ax throw, looks over and decides, as a complete neophyte to the competition but not to log splitting, he’s going to enter. However, he’s in shorts and needs two teammates and a pair of jeans to compete. Pretty soon, not thwarted by size of the competitors or the depth of their experience, he’s got it together and ready to go with a pair of jeans, two more team members and equipment loaned from the Johnson family — Team Chainsaw. Hog Wild Farms enters bringing the total to four teams, the countdown begins and its two sets of competition, two teams per session. It is indeed a very intense 12 minutes. Final score: Trimble Construction 227, Johnson Quality Tree Care 184, Hog Wild Farms, 134; and Team Chainsaw 103.",

        "description": "One small step for man, one giant leap for bacon lovers everywhere. Here's how Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ended up eating bacon during the moon landing.",
        "content": "When Apollo 11 landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, it was a momentous occasion. Upwards of 650 million people around the world sat in stunned silence and anticipation as two American astronauts took their first steps on Earth's satellite planet. When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went back to the lunar module after their initial exploration, it wouldn't have surprised anyone if they feasted on dehydrated surf and turf, with glasses of floating champagne in celebration, but it wasn't beef or lobster on their plates, it was bacon. Any bacon lover would agree that the salty, crunchy, porky, fatty food is completely appropriate for celebratory occasions (or any occasion, really), but the pork product likely wasn't chosen to be part of the astronauts' meal plan because they requested it. Rather, it traveled well in space. Figuring out which foods could be transported into and consumed in low-gravity conditions was just one large piece of the space travel puzzle for NASA scientists to figure out before Apollo 11. Foods had to meet weight and volume limits, stay safe and edible without refrigeration, not be overly crumbly (fine crumbs could affect equipment), and offer enough calories and nutrition for the astronauts. Bacon checked all the boxes, as did peaches, strawberry cubes, and grape and orange drinks, which rounded out the meal Armstrong and Aldrin dined on after their moonwalk. Space food had already come a long way By the time of the Apollo missions, scientists and astronauts had already been testing edibles in space during the prior Mercury and Gemini missions. Fast-forward to the 1969 moon landing, and the food wasn't bad, by comparison. During the Project Mercury flights, much of the food astronauts ate came in paste form, in toothpaste-like tubes. In April 1961, Soviet pilot and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly to space, and he feasted on beef and liver paste in a tube. Yum. During the Gemini missions, cosmic culinary arts had improved, with an emphasis put on freeze-drying and dehydrating foods for space flights. The foods could be placed in packages in which water could be inserted for rehydration. During the Apollo years, the foods' packaging was similar to those during Gemini, but the variety was greater. Foods in the pilots' meal plans included cornflakes, scrambled eggs, hot dogs, spaghetti, tuna salad, and peanut butter. Coffee was also placed on the menu — and if you ask me, what could be better than coffee and bacon, with a view of planet Earth to go with it? Is bacon still on the microgravity menu? During Apollo 13, astronaut Jim Lovell reportedly told mission control, \"Happiness is bacon squares for breakfast.\" The appreciation for bacon is clearly out of this world, yet, someone, somewhere (likely a brainiac at NASA) decided bacon didn't need to be a food option for astronauts anymore. Although the food list has grown from fewer than 70 foods in the Apollo era to over 200 today, bacon is noticeably missing. The closest thing space travelers will find are sausage patties. Of course, one hardly becomes an astronaut for the food, and it's a good thing they don't have to squeeze meat paste from a tube anymore, but, seriously NASA, bacon can't take up that much room aboard, can it? Things are a bit different at the International Space Station, which has refrigeration and freezing capabilities. Here, visitors will find bacon and a large variety of meals, fresh fruits, desserts, dairy items, and snacks. Recommended",

        "content": "Colombo: Sri Lankan security forces suspect that a 46-year-old man acted as a handler of the four Sri Lankan nationals who were arrested at Ahmedabad airport in India last week for suspected links with the banned Islamic State (ISIS) outfit, a media report said on Monday. Sri Lanka Police revealed that the wanted suspect, identified as Osmand Gerrard – a resident of Dematagoda, often changes his appearances, and these are some of his appearances that detectives suspect he may be using now, Newsfirst news portal reported. Sri Lanka Police recently announced a cash award of Rs. 2 million for any credible information on the whereabouts of the wanted suspect. The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on May 19 arrested four Sri Lankans with links to the ISIS at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel airport in Ahmedabad. The ATS also seized three pistols and cartridges abandoned at a location in Ahmedabad based on geo-coordinates and seized a mobile phone from their possession. The four men had taken an Indigo flight out of Colombo to Chennai on May 19. Among the arrested individuals, Mohammed Nusrat is a businessman involved in importing telecommunication devices and electrical equipment from countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Dubai, the news portal said. Nusrat operated within Colombo, where he sold these imported goods. Mohammad Nafran, 27, who was also arrested, has been identified as the son of the first wife of Niyas Naufer aka ‘Potta Naufer’ the notorious underworld criminal who was sentenced to death for the killing of High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya. The other two Sri Lankans are 35-year-old Mohammad Faris from Maligawatte, Colombo and 43-year-old Mohammad Rashdeen from Colombo 13. Mohammad Faris had worked as a ‘Nattami’ or cart puller in Pettah, and was arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division on March 11, 2023, and November 1 of the same year. On May 21, his close associate Hameed Amir was arrested by the Terrorist Investigations Division. Mohammad Faris had left for Chennai, India on May 19. The other suspect is Mohammad Rashdeen, a three-wheeler driver. Security forces suspect that he is linked to trafficking crystal meth, or ICE. On September 16, 2022, Rashdeen was arrested by the Foreshore Police and was later released on bail. Last week, the Sri Lankan authorities launched a high-powered operation to investigate the four Sri Lankans arrested in Gujarat.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Biden honored America’s fallen troops Monday at Arlington National Cemetery — saying in a Memorial Day speech that Americans must be “keepers of their mission” while reminiscing about his own son’s death from brain cancer . “Today, we’re not just fortunate heirs of their legacy, we have a responsibility to be the keepers of their mission — that truest memorial to their lives: the actions we take every day to ensure that our democracy endures,” the 81-year-old president said after laying a wreath at the military cemetery. Biden, whose son Beau died in 2015 , said that he understood the grief of families in attendance for the annual event, and noted the expansion of veteran health treatment under the PACT Act, which he signed in 2022. “I know it hurts. The hurt is still real, still raw. This week marks nine years since I lost my son, Beau,” Biden said. “Our losses are not the same. He didn’t perish on the battlefield. He was a cancer victim from a consequence of being in the Army in Iraq for a year next to a burn pit — a major in the US National Army, National Guard, living and working by too many besides that toxic burn pit,” he continued. “And as it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, as it is with you — still sharp, still clear, but so is the pride I feel in his service, as if I can still hear him saying, ‘It’s my duty, Dad, it’s my duty,'” he went on. “Duty, that was the code of my son live by and the creed all of you live by — the creed that generations of service members have followed into battle. On the grounds around us lie fallen heroes from every major conflict in history, to defend our independence, to preserve our union, to defeat fascism, to build powerful alliances, forged in the fires of two world wars.” Morning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories Please provide a valid email address.

Biden, who is preparing for a trip to Normandy next month to commemorate the US military’s role in the invasion of Nazi-occupied France, noted that American troops “80 years ago next week took to the beaches of Normandy and liberated a continent and literally saved the world.” “Decade after decade, tour after tour, these warriors fought for our freedom and the freedom of others, because freedom has never been guaranteed,” he said. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many.” Biden added that “our democracy is more than just a system of a government. It’s the very soul of America. It’s how we’ve been able to constantly adapt through the centuries.”",

        "description": "Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA has announced.",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton was surrounded by his family, according to the statement. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. Walton originally joined ESPN in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009.. \"But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" --- Information from the NBA, ESPN and the Associated Press",

        "description": "As attacks kill yet more civilians in Rafah, students at their allies at UofT say they will not stop pressuring the university to divest from Israel.The post Ontario Federation of Labour rallies with students at UofT encampment appeared first on rabble.ca.",
        "content": "The leadership of the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) held an emergency rally on Monday morning, May 27 on the University of Toronto (UofT) campus. The rally was in solidarity with students and their supporters who for three weeks have set up camp on the university grounds to call for their school’s disclosure of, and divestment from, investments in Israel. UofT president Meric Gertler announced in a statement on Monday that lawyers for the university were seeking an injunction from Ontario Superior Court to have the encampment removed. This comes after the protesters were served with a trespass notice by the Toronto Police Service (TPS) late last week with a deadline to vacate the campus by Monday morning. “In addition to pursuing this legal avenue to return King’s College Circle to the University community, we continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment,” reads Gertler’s statement. “We held a long and productive meeting yesterday and are meeting again today. We remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement and bring the unauthorized encampment to an end.” Labour rallies in support of students In an open letter to Gertler, OFL President Laura Walton accused him and the university of failing to bargain in good faith with the students involved in this peaceful protest. Walton explained that OFL members have successfully bargained with university administrators in the past and that they should take the same approach with these students. “The same approach should apply here. Negotiations must continue in good faith , and without threats of police intervention. The recent successful conclusions to the encampments at Ontario Tech University and at McMaster University, for example, shows what’s possible,” the OFL letter reads. READ MORE: Students are making history. All of us should join them “Universities should be where we learn to debate and disagree with each other– without the fear of violence . For Canada’s largest university to decide unilaterally when the debate should end, and when police repression should begin, is a betrayal of the values we claim to uphold,” the letter goes on to read. Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Local 3902, which represents 11,000 educators and researchers at UofT likewise expressed their support for the students and condemned the university for making threats. “Your recent letter to U of T Occupy for Palestine and accompanying offer constitute a serious and deeply concerning escalation of the administration’s negotiating tactics. The CUPE 3902 Executive condemns the administration’s presentation of an offer to student organizers under the threat of forceful removal from their protest encampment,” reads a statement from CUPE 3902’s executive committee. CUPE 3902 executives added that they were prepared to take further action against the university in support of the students. Students holding firm to their demands Students involved in the encampment protest are remaining clear and consistent in their demands to UofT administration. A joint letter sent out on Friday, May 24 by the Association of Part-time Undergraduate Students (APUS), University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union (UTGSU), University of Toronto Mississauga Students’ Union (UTMSU) and Scarborough Campus Students’ Union (SCSU), and the University of Toronto Students’ Union reaffirmed their demands that UofT administration disclose and divest from all investments in support of Israeli apartheid. “Students have been clear with their demands. The University must divest from all direct and indirect financial investments that sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and its illegal settlement of Palestine including any manufacturing and sales of military weaponry in the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” the student unions’ letter reads. They are also calling on the university to cut all ties with Israeli academic institutions that support Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory. The unions also condemned Gertler’s threat of police force to silence them. “As a result of the recent announcements made by President Gertler to the students, we fear an escalation of the violence by the institution and police on students similar to other university campuses when their administration moved to dismantle encampments and student organizing and silencing student voices who continue to hold the university administration accountable,” the unions state. The unions also point out that UofT was one of the last Canadian academic institutions to divest itself from supporting apartheid South Africa in the 1980s. “We continue to express our support for the calls of students to the administration to take action and ensure that they divest from all forms of financial investments that sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and its illegal settlement of Palestine,” the unions’ letter goes on to read.

        "content": "With the 90th pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, the selected linebacker DeMarvion Overshown in the third round. His lengthy frame and years of leadership for the Texas Longhorns' defense made him one of the top prospects at the position, and there was expectation he could step into 's defense and contribute right away. Unfortunately, his campaign was cut short after tearing his ACL in the preseason. Now entering his second year, the Texas-native is looking to remain a fit on this defense despite . With an ongoing recovery process and a new system to work into, what can fans expect in the delayed debut from Overshown this season? The primary difference from Dan Quinn's defense is that . Measuring in at 220 pounds when he arrived at camp last season, Overshown's thin, lanky build wasn't the typical prototype for the system. But instead of twiddling his thumbs while in recovery, the 23-year-old has put in work to add weight and reshape his body. Overshown recently spoke about his offseason journey, : I've put about 12-13 pounds of lean mass on, and I'm gonna go into camp a little bigger and then drop down to where I wanna play at, which will be around 233 or 234 [pounds]. The Cowboys currently have nine linebackers on their roster. Eric Kendricks is the most familiar with Zimmer, thanks to their time together with the . Damone Clark also played over 73% of snaps last season for the team. Markquese Bell tallied over 60%, but may not be a scheme fit as a moneybacker more than a traditional linebacker. That leaves one open spot for the base-starting defense. While there are plenty of potential players who could earn the role, the headliners for the final spot are Overshown and Dallas' third-round pick in the , Marist Liufau, out of Notre Dame. Whether he operates in a starting or rotational role, Overshown's added weight, combined with his history of production throughout his collegiate career, points to him being an asset at the second level. Despite dealing with an injury in his first year, the former All-Big 12 star still has time to get going and make an impact in the league. Source:",

        "content": "The Chief Executive Officer of the Fundamental Right to Education Support (FRES) Foundation, Michael Kayode Ojo, has advocated for increased funding for the child’s education. He also called for better government intervention in the area of infrastructure development with a well-equipped library situated in a conducive learning environment. Ojo made the call at an event tagged Children’s Day Event and Award Celebration, held to reward excellence in education on Children’s Day, May 27, in Lagos on Monday. The event had over 100 pupils from ten private schools competing for prizes in indoor games, talk shows, talent hunts, and award presentations. In his remarks, Ojo said, “Today, we are celebrating the children. This is part of the activities with which we celebrate excellence in education among children. It is aimed at encouraging them. This is the third edition. “Prior to this, there was an essay competition where schools, both private and public, from the 57 local government areas in Lagos State participated in an essay competition and were rewarded accordingly. “We have identified poor parenting as one major factor militating against quality education for children. For us, we have been trying to engage parents on how they could intervene in their children’s education. “I want to encourage parents to put more effort into educating these children. Also, for the government, we are in partnership with LASUBEB. We have been engaging them. “I commend the Lagos State government on its giant stride in the education sector. I encourage other states to emulate Lagos State government but there is still more to be done to ensure that children are adequately educated. “We want the government to invest more in terms of infrastructure and funding for education because it is important for schools to have a well-equipped library and a conducive environment for learning. “Many of the private schools around do not have the capacity to do this. This is where the government comes in. They should make sure that education is put on a proper spectrum.” The programme facilitator, Pastor Babatunde Smith, said the event is an education centre award for the children. He said, “It is an investment for the education of the children. He urged parents to open an account to fund the education of the children.” The event co-sponsor, Miss Sarah Akerele of the Treasure Kids Foundation, said the event is also about rewarding parents for excellence in the discharge of parental roles and creating awareness of the educational needs of special children. She added, “The Treasure Kids Foundation is an organisation that is focused on the needs of special children. We are concerned about children with congenital disorders in society. “We do this by creating awareness, providing education, and advocating for the special needs of these children. We are here today to celebrate our children’s special day and to reward them for excellence in learning. Education is a challenge for special needs children due to their peculiar challenges, hence our decision to reward excellence in education. One major challenge is a lack of awareness and proper education for special needs children. Special education is nothing like conventional education. “It is not easy for special children to get an adequate education, and that is the gap we stand to bridge at Treasure Kids.” The highlight of the event is the presentation of cash gifts, certification of participation, and educational materials to participating schools, pupils in both the primary and secondary categories, as well as some deserving parents.

        "content": "The CEO of Blackstone, Steve Schwarzman, has said he will back Donald Trump's reelection bid, citing concerns over \"the dramatic rise of antisemitism\" and the \"direction\" of the country. In a statement to Axios, Schwarzman said: \"The dramatic rise of antisemitism has led me to focus on the consequences of upcoming elections with greater urgency.\" \"I share the concern of most Americans that our economic, immigration and foreign policies are taking the country in the wrong direction. For these reasons, I am planning to vote for change and support Donald Trump for President. In addition, I will be supporting Republican Senate candidates and other Republicans up and down the ticket,\" he added. Related stories The endorsement marks a reversal for Schwarzman, the billionaire cofounder of Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager. In November 2022 , the lifelong Republican said he would not support Trump in the 2024 presidential primary, calling instead for \"the Republican Party to turn to a new generation of leaders.\" Schwarzman's endorsement will, therefore, come as a particularly welcome boost for Trump, providing the former president with access to a powerful network of Republican donors. It would also appear to suggest Trump's strategy of accusing Biden of being weak on antisemitism — especially in the wake of pro-Palestinian college protests — has started to pay off. \"If Jewish people are going to vote for Joe Biden, they have to have their head examined,\" Trump said in a video posted to social media earlier this month. If reelected, Trump has said he would he would revoke student visas of \"anti-Semitic foreigners\" and that he would not welcome any Gaza refugees into the US. \"Under the Trump administration, we will revoke the student visas of radical anti-American and anti-Semitic foreigners at our colleges and universities and we will send them straight back home,\" he said at a campaign speech in Iowa last year.",

        "content": "In context: Supply chain attacks are usually conceived to target a specific company by infecting a single element involved in the manufacturing or distribution of a software product. Once the supply chain is compromised, all downstream users and customers of the affected company can be easily targeted as well. Justice AV Solutions (JAVS) provides software products to more than 10,000 courtrooms in the US and around the world. The 35-year-old company was recently affected by a dangerous supply chain attack, in which unknown cybercriminals were able to implant their own backdoor into a supposedly legitimate, official software download. As reported by Rapid7, the supply chain attack compromised the JAVS Viewer 8.3.7 program included in the JAVS Suite 8 product. JAVS Suite is a \"database-centered\" software designed to create, manage, and view digital recordings of \"critical meetings\" in courtrooms and business environments. JAVS describes it as a \"complete AV management\" suite running on Windows 10 or later PC operating systems. As part of the main JAVS Suite, JAVS Viewer allows employees to open and manage previously recorded logs and media files. Version 8.3.7 of JAVS Viewer was found to be infected with a backdoor and was seemingly hosted on JAVS' own servers, Rapid7 confirmed. This means that all customers using that specific version of the software should take serious mitigation measures to avoid unpleasant surprises in the future. The backdoor was digitally signed to avoid triggering initial security warnings, although the signing entity was \"Vanguard Tech Limited\" and not \"Justice AV Solutions Inc.\" as it should have been. Once installed, the compromised JAVS Viewer was designed to connect to remote command-and-control servers and wait for further orders. The malware would then steal sensitive data, including hostname and OS details, browser passwords, and more. The malicious executable (fffmpeg.exe) is known to be part of the GateDoor/Rustdoor malware family and has already been flagged by many security vendors and AV solutions. JAVS officially acknowledged the supply chain attack on its website, stating that the incident (tracked as CVE-2024-4978) was now resolved with a new release of the JAVS Viewer program. According to Rapid7 analysts, the JAVS backdoor incident could have lasting consequences, including compromised systems, stolen passwords, and unauthorized remote access. All users of JAVS Viewer 8.3.7 should completely re-image any endpoint system where the program is used, as simply uninstalling or updating the software alone isn't enough to eradicate the threat. Access credentials and passwords for system accounts and web browsers should be reset as well.",

        "content": "Let me state upfront that I don’t have the inside scoop on Joe Roberts’s whole deal. All I know is that the same man who wrote a syndicated Jewish Telegraphic Agency column in February about fearing he’d have to become a U.S. immigrant-turned-refugee from Canada—which I wrote my own column about in response—who now stands accused of having invented a Jewish identity for himself.

While they are deeply upsetting, they will not deter me. I am consulting legal counsel and will address them in due course. — Joe Roberts (@Joe_Roberts01) May 13, 2024 This leaves open, among so many other possibilities, that he is Jewish, but was less than forthright about biographical details. Also possible: everything he said was true and people on social media are trying to smear him. Also possible: he’s lied about it all and is going to pop up in the next town a purported lifelong Zoroastrian. Like I said, I don’t know! Now I will readily cop to being a curious so-and-so, who is on some level wondering what the story here turns out to be. I’m not that curious, however. Not enough to become an amateur let alone professional Joe Roberts-ologist. To me, the more interesting angle is the way squabbles over the boundaries of Jewish identity have emerged post-Oct. 7. As we discussed on a recent Bonjour Chai podcast episode, it’s not even straightforward whether there is such a thing as faking being Jewish. I mean there is, in the superficial The Mad Adventures of “Rabbi” Jacob sense, wherein you are a non-Jewish character in a 1970s French farce impersonating a rabbi due to plot twists too convoluted to get into. But there are enough definitions of Jewishness floating around that anyone who in good faith (so to speak) insists they are the thing, is the thing, at least in someone’s book. If you claim to be Indigenous and you’re not, you may get found out . Jewishness is in some sense more like being a member of a sexual minority. Someone might be lying about being bisexual, but what would it even mean to fact-check such a thing? If you’re not attempting to get married by an Orthodox rabbi or to move to Israel under the right of return, and you’re simply going around saying you’re Jewish, who’s to say otherwise? Of course, for all the internal Jewish communal discussions of gatekeeping , of which Jews feel how welcome in which environments, it can be helpful to zoom out and consider whether there is, in fact, a horde trying to get through the gates in question. Outliers aside ( George Santos , Julia Salazar ), there just plain doesn’t seem to be a tremendous interest. Or rather, there wasn’t, until we became the ultimate trending topic. If you’re Jewish, you might find yourself wishing—at least, I find myself wishing—things were just the tiniest bit less about us all the time. But if you’re not, maybe you want to be where the action is at? Maybe you wish the news cycle was all about you? I have no idea. The real question is, what is the political significance of questioning the Jewishness of a prolific pro-Israel poster? If it turns out that the accusations are true and there’s a big-on-X Zionist claiming to be Jewish under false pretenses, why would this be a source of delight for pro-Palestinian activists? After all, most Zionists aren’t Jewish. There are outright Christian Zionists, as well as non-Jews who don’t want Israel wiped off the map. Now some of it is that people are always thrilled to hear that someone with the wrong-in-their-view politics is a fraud. But I think it’s about more than that. Consider, for a moment, the place of Jews in post-Oct. 7 antizionism. There are individual Jews with antizionist beliefs, such people absolutely exist , but their numbers, for complicated reasons, seem greater than they actually are . One reason is that the Jews who want Israel gone tend to be found in places like media and academia and therefore have articles written about them, or write articles themselves. Another is that it is beneficial to pro-Palestinian activists to deflect charges of antisemitism by pointing to the presence of Jews in their movement. That is, if it is still considered important to deflect in this way; frankly it’s heartening if it even is. This is why every protest and rally scene has those big banners attesting to Jews’ opposition to the war, or to more than just the war, i.e. Israel itself. It’s not that no such Jews exist, or that they aren’t real Jews (as if I were interested in gatekeeping this!). It’s that there is an even larger group of people for whom it is useful to be like, look, we don’t hate Jews, we just hate Zionists! Thereby eliding such things as, that virtually all Jews are Zionists of one sort or another; that Zionist and Jew get used interchangeably; and that events where people mobilize against “Zionists” not infrequently include outbursts against Zionists of the non-euphemistic variety, a.k.a. Jews. This is why even in my not particularly Jewish bit of west Toronto, the signage is not just ubiquitously pro-Palestine but with an on-behalf-of-Jews motif. One of the groups listed as behind this window describes itself as “A home for white people working for justice.” I mean some white people are Jewish, and benefit-if-the-doubt the ones behind this display are, but if you’re advocating as white people , maybe pick a different sign, maybe? Although I guess Whites against those nefarious Zionists would have a different ring to it. The fact of the matter is that I have seen more stickers, pins, graffiti, etc., in recent months about how the Jews feel about Israel—negative, per the signage—than... how to put this? Than is plausible given how many Jews there are in these parts, period, let alone antizionist ones. So while you do get people questioning the Jewish authenticity or values or whatever of pro-Palestinian Jews, you also get people like yours truly, who simply doubt that a tiny minority within a tiny minority could possibly be the driving force behind Free Palestine, at the levels the signage and hashtags insist. What a boon, then, for that side to have a No wait, it’s the ZIONISTS who are the fake Jews! moment. After saying for however long (decades in some cases, or since learning about this topic a few months ago in many others) that actual Jewish values dictate opposing Israel in all ways, they see a chance to see-how-the-tables-have-turned suggest that there is some sort of epidemic of people pretending to be Jewish in order to...? all the foaming-at-the-mouth zionists who have taken to the soapbox (anthony koch, richard marceau, joe roberts, deborah lyons) were neither born jewish, nor raised w/ jewish values. why are these genocide enthusiasts speaking on behalf of us? why are they defining antisemitism? https://t.co/n93fuAaPuv — cornchip (@scorn_chip) May 23, 2024 But here is where I’m lost. Jews tend to like having allies. Particularly in times like these. And an ally is by definition not a member of the group in question, nor claiming to be. If there are pro-Israel Jews who took/take comfort in Roberts’s anti-antisemitism, Israel-defending timeline, of course they’d take it as a blow if it turns out he’s not quite who he says. But this isn’t because Jews demand that everyone who fights antisemitism be Jewish. Hardly! It’s that it’s never a good thing when someone on your side is outed as disreputable.

        "description": "She said her unconventional way of loading up the dishwasher means she doesn't have to keeping bending down to put the dishes inside",
        "content": "Stacey Solomon fans have been left stunned after the mum-of-five revealed another 'genius' trick that helps her get her chaotic house in order quickly. The reality TV star and host of Sort Your Life Out shared how she spent her Sunday evening cleaning up her home after having a lazy day and letting it go 'to ruin'. Surveying the mess at Pickle Cottage, which she shares with husband Joe Swash and the children, Stacey posted a video on Instagram and told her followers: \"I really did what I said I was gonna to do today and just did nothing.\" READ MORE: Gogglebox star Izzi Warner shares emotional solo trip with kids to Disneyland She added: \"I had a little nap and everything. The house has gone to ruin but it's okay - it's Sunday and I was tried. I am gonna give it a good clean now.\" Stacey then posted another video to her Story - a montage of her getting her house in order sound tracked to Daniel Bedingfield's 2001 hit Gotta Get Thru This. She could be seen washing dishes, loading up the dishwasher, wiping down her kitchen and mopping the floor as she tidied away the mess. But her fans were left distracted by one particular detail in the video - the unusual but 'genius' way she loaded up her dishwasher. Instead of bending down to put her dirty dishes inside the machine, Stacey lifted the trays out placing them on her kitchen island and then stacked them full of plates and bowls before returning them to the machine. The video showed Stacey stacking up the dishwasher trays while they were on top of her kitchen island (Image: Stacey Solomon / Instagram) Stacey was inundated with messages about the dishwasher hack and addressed her followers in another video explaining why she does it. She also posted photos of some of the messages she received, with one saying: \"I have literally never thought of taking the racks out of the dishwasher to load them up, genius\" and another commenting: \"Omg stacey why have I never thought to take the dishwasher trays to the mess.\" She told her followers: \"So many of you are messaging me the same thing. Do you know what right, as I get older, I get lazier and I try and find more and more ways of having to do less and make less effort. I just think why bend down.\" At that moment she was interrupted by husband Joe, who walked into the shot holding two fluffy ducklings - the latest additions to their already large family. As Joe smiled at the camera in the background, Stacey carried on with her explanation, saying: \"Why bend down to put things in the dishwasher when you can just whip the trays out and stack them on the side.\" Stacey explained why she took the trays out of her dishwasher in another video - but was interrupted by husband Joe (Image: Stacey Solomon / Instagram) Joe then told her he was taking 'the chicks' to bed and Stacey wound up her video so she could help him. The two ducklings were welcomed to their home last week and they've already proved to be popular with fans of the family. Stacey, 34, and Joe, 42, share three young children - Rex, four, Rose, two, and one-year-old Belle. Stacey also has a 15-year-old son named Zachary and a 12-year-old son named Leighton, who she shares with former partners, while Joe is also dad to his teenage son Harry. They also have two beloved pet dogs - Teddy and Peanut - who help keep the family's Essex home full and busy. And now it's even busier with the arrival of two new pets. Taking to Instagram, Stacey shared a video of them as they settled into their home. The video included clips of Rex and Rose enjoying cuddles with the new additions while the mum herself was also seen tending to the new duo. First sharing a message to her Instagram Story, she wrote: \"We've always felt so privileged to have our garden... And we've always said if the chance ever presented itself and it was right and we had what they needed, we'd love to make it home for little feathered friends [face holding back tears emoji]. So...\" She then pointed fans in the direction of her main Instagram post with the caption reading: \"Welcome To Pickle Cottage. Little Ones. We are so excited to love you & we hope you love living here & being a part of our crazy family. We have no idea what to call our new babies yet, so any suggestions welcome.\"",

PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Dunedin police were warned a rising tide of violence among the city’s teenagers could end in a death only an hour before a fatal stabbing at the bus hub.",
        "content": "Police are ensuring they are more visible at the Dunedin bus hub following the death of Enere Mclaren-Taana last Thursday. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH It comes as Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich yesterday announced the formation of a multi-agency working group dedicated to changing the culture at the central city hub. The father of a Dunedin teenager, whose son was assaulted at secondary school about a month ago, told the Otago Daily Times his wife called police at 2pm on Thursday last week to check on the status of the investigation into their son’s assault. The police responded by saying they had been too busy to investigate her son’s assault and she replied by saying \"someone is going to die if you guys don’t start taking this stuff seriously\". A little over an hour later Trinity Catholic College pupil Enere Mclaren-Taana, 16, was stabbed to death. The teenager’s father said police had now carried out an interview with the boy who they believe assaulted their son. \"But it took a death before they actually got around to doing anything. \"That’s what’s annoying me, they’re saying they got there within a minute, but they’ve had so many warnings.\" He said the teenager who assaulted their son led a crew of followers, who he called his \"soldiers\", who had been intimidating other teenagers around the city, including at the bus hub. They had complained about their son’s assault, including providing a voice recording of another teenager threatening to slit his throat, to police about a month ago and had got nowhere. Their son was scared to go back to school and has not been back to the bus hub since. \"He’s been wanting to carry a knife and I said ‘no, you can’t do that’.\" When he found out Enere had died, he felt terrible. \"It was almost like we were almost responsible for it. \"We were just trying to warn them because it was getting out of hand.\" The father said another parent who had stopped a fight in the bus hub and was trying to make a complaint had also been \"brushed aside\" by police in the past. \"I think they thought it’s just normal teenage stuff.\" The father felt security at the bus hub was ineffective and called for police presence between 3pm and 5pm on weekdays. A police spokesman said there would be more of a police presence from 3pm to 5pm at the bus hub. He said the safety of the community was not solely a police issue, and they worked closely with different agencies to ensure everyone in the community was safe. \"That important work continues.\" Trinity Catholic College year 12 pupil Enere Mclaren-Taana’s school ID photo from this year. PHOTO: SUPPLIED Logan Park High School principal Peter Hills said pupils, parents and the wider community had all expressed concern about the bus hub as a gathering point. \"There is a desire from all the groups I have mentioned for students to be picked up from schools and taken home rather than a central location, but we can’t control the funding or the bus schedule. \"I imagine that will be a subject of conversation for all schools, and the regional council and the city council, and all the people interested in it.\" In a statement yesterday, Mr Radich said he and representatives from the Dunedin City Council, Otago Regional Council and police met yesterday morning and agreed on a new group. \"While our focus as a city needs to remain on supporting Enere’s whānau as they prepare to farewell their loved one, we also need to do what we can to ensure this sort of tragedy isn’t repeated,\" Mr Radich said. The terms of reference were being drafted and would seek to ensure schools, bus users, and the wider community were all represented. The group would aim to develop short-, medium- and long-term options that could be implemented to improve the culture at the bus hub, and it would meet regularly. \"Last week’s terrible tragedy has sent shockwaves through our community, and we all need to come together to address the issues.\" Otago Regional Council chairwoman Gretchen Robertson said public safety at the hub was a priority for all parties. \"This new group is exactly what we need to be doing — working together to tackle the safety issues there.\" In the meantime there would be an increased security presence at the bus hub alongside a beefed-up police presence, and Bus Stop B would remain closed as a mark of respect. \"We are aware of issues at the hub and are working hard to support people with added security and presence.\" Police Otago Coastal Area Commander Inspector Marty Gray said police wanted to work with all parties to improve safety. \"We’re looking forward to having an active role in the group and helping ensure everyone can use the bus hub with confidence.\" Meanwhile, Ministry of Education Te Tai Runanga (south) leader Nancy Bell said it was in contact with 12 schools last week, as the impact of a traumatic event such as this could be far-reaching. The ministry’s traumatic incidents teams could work alongside schools to support them in managing the incident safely — which included understanding the emotional and psychological impacts and the effects on how people behaved. The ministry was providing some resources to Trinity Catholic College to increase pastoral support for pupils this week.",

Construction began in January, but was delayed by one of the wettest springs on record. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Mansfield and Ashfield Chad, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. The building’s skeleton has now been put up, and the council is hoping it will officially be opened by March 2025. Coun Keith Girling (Con), cabinet member for economic development and asset management, said he was pleased with the progress as he visited the site on May 24. He said: “It is going well. \"I am always trying to push things forward – perhaps unrealistically – but the end date is on schedule despite bad weather at the start of the year. “County Hall is a beautiful old building, but it’s costing us £1.7m a year to run, and that’s £1.7m that can be put into services. \"The running cost here will be a lot less. Advertisement Advertisement “All the decisions made will be made in the middle of the county, and social services will be delivered from here, with Mansfield, Ashfield and Hucknall just up the road.” Luke Melville, assistant site manager, said: “It’s been challenging when there’s a lot of water on the ground and heavy machinery moving about. “It should run smoother now work on the superstructure has started.” Plans for the wider 86-acre site at Top Wighay include nearly 800 homes, a primary school, a shopping centre and 21 acres for businesses and offices. Advertisement Advertisement The current County Hall costs £1.7m to maintain each year, in addition to £30m expected essential maintenance over the next 12 years and £28m to bring it up to modern environmental standards. Coun Girling said the public engagement over what to do with the building once the council had left produced ‘some really interesting decisions, from a women’s prison to rooms for the homeless to luxury hotels’. The council will now speak to interested developers on their visions for the site. The new council building is being designed, project and cost-managed by Arc Partnership, and delivered through their construction partner, Morgan Sindall Construction.",

        "content": "Paris: Sumit Nagal's late resistance was not enough as his French Open debut ended with a defeat against big-hitting Russian Karen Khachanov, who overpowered the Indian in straight sets, here on Monday. The top Indian singles player, ranked 95, struggled to match the power and range of his fancied rival, losing 2-6 0-6 6-7(5) in the opening round. Nagal had shocked world number 31 Alexander Bublik at the Australian Open but could not repeat his braveheart act on red clay. The rain before the match had made the court a bit slower and more suitable for longer rallies. It was a fiery start from the Indian but the Russian had the first break of the match when he broke Nagal in game three. Nagal, though, did well to come back from 0-40 to save three breakpoints. However, looking for a wide forehand, he made an unforced error to hand his rival the first break of the match. Rain interrupted the match and resumed after a 21 minute-break. The Russian came out firing on all cylinders as Nagal found it difficult to match the power of Khachanov. It was effortless hitting from the Russian, which Nagal failed to counter. Nagal had little time to react to the shots as the Russian made him run on both flanks. It was difficult to control or create points. He was up 30-0 in game seven but Khachanov reeled off four points in a row to get his second break of the opening set, which he served out in the next game with an inside-out forehand winner, albeit after saving a break chance. He needed solid start to the second set but Nagal dropped his serve in the very first game to go on backfoot. He had two break chances to level the set but Khachanov saved both and broke his rival again for a comfortable 3-0 cushion. Soon it became 5-0 and eventually Khachanov bageled Nagal. From thereon, it was a herculean task for the Indian to make a comeback. He fought his heart out in the third set, stretching it to a tie-breaker but the Russian's experience helped him end Nagal's fight. Rohan Bopanna and Yuki Bhambri will compete in the men's doubles along with their respective partners.",

        "description": "\"Just imagine what I’ve been through behind closed doors,\" Cartwright shared via social media one day after Taylor had a three-hour date with the OnlyFans creator.",
        "content": "Brittany Cartwright is hinting that deeper marital issues at home contributed to her split from estranged husband Jax Taylor — after the latter was seen stepping out with model Paige Woolen. Cartwright, 35, took to her Instagram Story on Sunday to share a Reel posted by @YouKnowNat , in which the influencer’s friend lambasts Taylor, 44, for the way he treats his spouse on their Bravo reality show “The Valley.” “Thank you, & just imagine what I’ve been through behind closed doors,” Cartwright wrote alongside the clip. The individual in the clip was particularly perturbed by Taylor railing into Cartwright for being sick during a cast trip to Big Bear, Calif., on last week’s episode of the unscripted series. The Jax’s Studio City owner blamed her nausea on excessive drinking — and implied that she had a longstanding problem with alcohol — though several of her castmates verified that she hadn’t imbibed prior to vomiting. “Like, this is his show that’s supposed to be about his bar and his community and his friends and he brought his family onto this show and this is what he’s doing to her? Like, he’s choosing to present her in that kind of light and to treat her like that,” the person said in the video. “This is what he’s doing to her in front of everybody.” Cartwright eventually snapped at Taylor, chastising him for verbally attacking her in front of the group, but the duo made up the next day.

Want more celebrity and pop culture news? The person in the @YouKnowNat Reel theorized that Taylor brought Cartwright onto the show knowing their relationship would soon end. “To put her on this show and treat her like this, he knew he was going to leave her, he knew it was over and he knew it would be good TV and that he wouldn’t get punished by the people around him, aka producers, at all,” she said. “If it’s good TV, it flies. What a terrible position for her to be in. Of course she’s not feeling good.” Meanwhile, the person in the clip surmised that Cartwright’s bouts of illness stem from the stress of her relationship with Taylor. “I think she’s sick all the time because she’s treated so terribly and she’s in a bad relationship and that she knows there’s nothing she can do to make it any better,” she said. Cartwright’s co-sign of the message comes as a romance seems to be brewing between the “Vanderpump Rules” OG and OnlyFans creator Woolen, 32. The pair were seen grabbing lunch at Granville Cafe in Los Angeles on Saturday, where they spent three hours together. For more Page Six reality TV updates... Cartwright and Taylor — who share 2-year-old son, Cruz — announced their separation in February after five years of marriage. The mom of one — who isn’t known to be dating anyone at the moment — revealed during an April appearance on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” that a “horrible fight” prompted her to call it quits with Taylor. “It was like a veil was lifted, and I noticed everything wrong,” she said. “They always say a woman can hit her breaking point, and it’s hard to come back from that.” One month prior, Cartwright exclusively told Page Six that Taylor’s lack of interest in sex didn’t help matters. “We’ve been together nine years, and people stop appreciating and take you for granted after some time — and that should never happen in a marriage,” she explained at the time. “The Valley” airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.",

        "content": "Vladimir Putin-led Russian government will remove the Taliban from a list of banned terrorist organisations, according to the state-run news agency . The development came three years after the Taliban returned to power in war-torn Afghanistan. Since 2003, the Taliban group has been designated as a terrorist outfit in Russia. “Kazakhstan has recently taken the decision, which we are also going to take, to remove them from the list of terrorist organisations,\" quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Monday. At the end of 2023, Kazakhstan had removed the Taliban from its list of banned organisations. Despite international sanctions on the Taliban, Russia has fostered its ties with the government run by the banned outfit in Afghanistan. Moscow had also held multiple rounds of talks and boosted trade with Kabul. But, Russia has not recognised Afghanistan’s Taliban government officially yet. The state news agency citing Zamir Kabulov - director of the Second Asia Department at the Russian foreign ministry, reported that Russia’s foreign and justice ministries have reported to President Putin on the issue of removing the ban on the Taliban. The latest move by Russia could further boost diplomacy between Moscow and Kabul. According to , Lavrov said Russia's decision was about recognising the realities on the ground. “They are the real power. We are not indifferent to Afghanistan. And above all, our allies in Central Asia are not indifferent,\" he added. Moscow has also invited Taliban representatives to its flagship Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, once seen as the cornerstone of Russia’s economic relations with the West, said state media. Russia’s economic event will be held on June 5-8. Kabulov also said that Afghan leaders were traditionally interested in buying oil products, as per . In 2021, after United States-led forces withdrew after 20 years of war, the Taliban had seized power in Afghanistan.

        "content": "The Federal Government has asked members of the National Assembly to subject the Nigerian National Anthem Bill to wider consultations before passing it. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, stated this in Abuja on Monday at a public hearing on the bill to revert to the old national anthem. Recall that the House of Representatives accelerated and passed the bill in a single sitting last Thursday, while the Senate passed the bill through first and second readings. Speaking at the hearing jointly organised by the Senate Committees on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters and Interior, Fagbemi said the lawmakers failed to get the opinions of other stakeholders before passing the bill. He said there was a need for a wider process where Nigerians and other arms and tiers of government would participate in the decision to revert to the old national anthem before it finally becomes law. Fagbemi specifically proposed consultations through zonal public hearings and resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. He said: “ Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem, whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians. I thank you all for granting me the audience to contribute my thoughts to this national cause.”",

        "content": "Bill Walton, a former NBA MVP and Hall of Famer who then became a legendary broadcaster, died from cancer Monday, according to multiple reports. He was 71 years old. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton starred at UCLA under John Wooden before being selected No. 1 overall in the 1974 NBA Draft, where he embarked on a career with the Trail Blazers, Clippers and Celtics across 10 seasons — with five seasons entirely lost to foot injuries mixed in. Walton had a long career as a broadcaster for CBS, NBC and ESPN. He initially joined ESPN in 2002 after 12 years at NBC to serve as their lead NBA analyst, and in 2012, he began calling games again with the network — this time as a college basketball analyst for Pac-12 broadcasts. Walton, who won one NBA title with Portland and another with Boston, became known for his unique style of broadcasting, with bizarre and hilarious moments scattered throughout the games that often had little to do with the action on the court. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,” Silver continued in his statement. “His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.”",

        "content": "LAHORE: Prime Minister’s Adviser on Public and Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has said that after Nawaz Sharif, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), will be unanimously agreed on Shehbaz Sharif’s name for the party’s presidency. Announcing the ruling PML-N’s intra-party elections, the former federal minister said that party supremo Nawaz Sharif would be seen proactively \"playing his role in national politics soon\". Sanaullah, addressing a press conference in Lahore on Monday, announced that the ruling party commenced the process of the intra-party elections by the PML-N’s constitution and an election commission was also established by a central working committee. The PML-N stalwart said that nomination papers were issued from 9am to 5pm today which would also be continued before 12pm by tomorrow (Tuesday). \"Scrutiny of the nomination papers will be performed at 1pm, whereas, candidates could withdraw their nominations by 2:30pm, tomorrow.\" He added: “Overall, 11 nominations have been issued so far. At 3pm tomorrow, final lists of the candidates will be issued and a general council’s session will be held afterwards.” He added that the party would organise the polls for electing its president at 4pm tomorrow. Sanaullah went on to say that Bashir Memon, Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, Ishaq Dar, Raja Muhammad Farooq, Hafiz Hafeez-ur-Rehman and Shah Ghulam Qadir have received their nomination papers today. He said that Shahid Khaqan Abbasi — a disgruntled PML-N leader who had applied to register a new political party last month — could also submit his nominations, however, the scrutiny committee will decide on his “eligibility” to contest the party’s intra-party polls. Regarding Nawaz, the PML-N senior leader said that the entire party agreed on the former premier’s name for the party’s presidency. \"However, the party would welcome if someone else wants to submit nominations for taking part in the upcoming polls.\" Sanaullah further said that Nawaz transformed the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz into a popular public party after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah that ruled the country four times. “In case no candidates, the party’s president would be elected unopposed, otherwise, polling will be held via a show of hands,” he added. The politico said that Nawaz was not angry with someone and was fully active in national politics. He added that all decisions of the federal and the Punjab governments would be taken after Nawaz's approval. He further said that lesser statements from the PML-N supremo would be ended, soon. The premier’s aide added that the ruling PML-N was considering recommendations to reshuffle the party positions. He said that Shehbaz Sharif would be the next leader after Nawaz on which the entire party was agreed upon for the presidency. He praised Shehbaz, the incumbent prime minister, for making maximum efforts to pull the country out of the economic crisis. To a question regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Sanaullah replied that he would continue to warn the nation against the former ruling party’s founder Imran Khan. He added that he was continuously warning the nation that the ousted premier would push the country into a big turmoil. The former security czar said that he was unaware of sources pushing the incarcerated PTI founder for making political blunders, however, “stupidity” could be committed by any individual. “I would pray for the PTI founder not to face the same consequences as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” he added.",

        "content": "KEY WEST, Fla. (WFLA) — A fleet of wacky “do it yourself” vessels set sail from Key West on Sunday, battling it out in an annual competition that raises money for local veterans. In the Schooner Wharf Minimal Regatta, competitors must fashion a boat and paddles out of just a single sheet of plywood, some two-by-fours and duct tape. The creatively-designed vessels can be surprisingly intricate, ranging from simple canoes to recreations of the Titanic and pirate ships. The teams are asked with staying afloat long enough to complete a short course without ending up in the water. “Costumes and themed entries are encouraged, and many boats end up being more scenic than seaworthy,” the competition’s website reads. “Entries in past regattas have included alligators, spaceships, guitars, wine bottles and replicas of schooners, shrimp boats, pirate vessels and paddle boats!” Sailors can win prizes in categories like “most creative design” and “fastest boat.” Organizers present the “sinker awards” to captains who go down with their ships. The $20 entry fee goes to support the local American Legion Post 28.",

        "content": "Satyendra Pathak DOHA: Held under the patronage of the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the 20th edition of Project Qatar was inaugurated by the Minister of Finance HE Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari in Doha on Monday. Organised by IFP Qatar with the support of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and in partnership with the Public Works Authority (Ashghal), the four-day international trade exhibition specialising in construction technology and building materials will continue till May 30 at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center. Featuring 130 Qatari firms and 120 international companies from 25 countries, the milestone edition of Qatar's largest and longest running construction exhibitions opened to a large crowd. The inauguration was graced by several distinguished guests and official delegations including Assistant Undersecretary for Industry and Business Development Affairs at the Ministry of Commerce & Industry Saleh bin Majid Al Khulaifi and a large number of prominent business leaders. Additionally, the ceremony garnered global attention with the presence of over 60 ambassadors from participating countries and heads of diplomatic missions in Qatar, along with dozens of international trade delegations who visited the event. In light of the impressive turnout at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center, IFP Qatar General Manager Haidar Mshaimesh expressed heartfelt gratitude for the trust bestowed upon the exhibition by esteemed leaders in Qatar and various global sectors and markets. Mshaimesh said, “The construction market in Qatar is on the brink of a transformative era with the aim to fulfil the Qatar National Vision 2030. This new chapter emphasises the development of industrial and social infrastructure projects, seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technologies and elements of smart cities into construction endeavours.” He said, “Over the past 19 years, Project Qatar has consistently kept pace with market trends and requirements, building a rich legacy and playing a pivotal role in this sector. As we embark on this new phase, Project Qatar will remain at the forefront, leading the way in facilitating commercial exchanges between Qatar and the global community. It will also continue to serve as a direct conduit for the sharing and exchange of products, services, and expertise. The presence of esteemed dignitaries at today's opening ceremony underscores the exhibition's value and prominence.” Mshaimesh said, “The 20th edition of Project Qatar marks a significant transformation in terms of sectoral diversity. Emerging sectors such as smart manufacturing, sustainable construction, and digital innovation account for a significant portion of the participation. As Qatar seeks to attract foreign investment and expertise to support its ambitious infrastructure ongoing and planned projects, the event focuses on strengthening partnerships between Qatari and international companies, attracting exhibitors and visitors from key markets worldwide, and facilitating cross-border collaborations and joint ventures.” Pointing out that the composition of exhibitors at Project Qatar has evolved over the years to reflect changes in the construction industry and broader economic trends, he said, “While the event has traditionally featured a wide range of sectors related to construction and building materials, there has been a notable shift towards incorporating new technologies, sustainable solutions, and smart manufacturing practices in recent years.” Mshaimesh said, “The 20th edition of Project Qatar has attracted a large number of exhibitors offering green building solutions, renewable energy technologies, energy-efficient products, and sustainable construction practices. As smart manufacturing gains momentum globally, exhibitors specializing in Industry 4.0 technologies, automation solutions, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and digital manufacturing processes are prominent in this year's line-up at Project Qatar.” Project Qatar is the largest and most prominent trade exhibition specializing in construction technology and building materials in Qatar. It plays a major role in promoting growth and innovation, serving as a dynamic platform to forge partnerships and collaborations between Qatari companies and their international counterparts. The event also facilitates networking, business matchmaking, and knowledge exchange within the construction industry. This is particularly important given the rapid growth of Qatar's construction sector.

        "description": "Former President Donald Trump blasted the anti-Israel protests erupting across US college campuses as a \"radical revolution\" and vowed to deport any foreign students involved if he were re-elected, he told donors in New York this month.",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump blasted the anti-Israel protests erupting across US college campuses as a “radical revolution” and vowed to deport any foreign students involved if he were re-elected, he told donors in New York this month. “One thing I do is [with] any student that protests — I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students,” Trump told the group during a May 14 roundtable, according to the Washington Post . “As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” the defiant 2024 hopeful added. During the meeting, at least one of the donors reportedly bemoaned the possibility that one of the student protesters could eventually rise to political power in the future. But Trump, 77, assured the donors he would fight to end the “radical revolution” on college campuses, declaring it “has to be stopped now,” the Washington Post reported. Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt blamed President Biden for empowering the protesters in a statement to The Post Monday. “Joe Biden has sided with radical leftist Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Talib and empowered antisemitic protestors destroying our college campuses and threatening to undermine our democracy,” Leavitt said. “President Trump will side with Jewish Americans and American citizens, period, and he will not tolerate terrorist sympathizers on our college campuses.” The 45th president has also publicly vowed to clamp down on anti-Israel protesters. Weeks after the bloody Oct. 7, 2023 surprise Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis, Trump pledged to deport the “resident aliens” who joined the “pro-jihadist protest.” “If you hate America, if you want to abolish Israel, if you sympathize with jihadists, then we don’t want you in our country, and you’re not going to be getting into our country,” Trump told the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas back in October. “I will cancel the student visas of Hamas sympathizers on college campuses and all resident aliens who join in pro-Jihadists protests,” he went on. “Come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you.” Throughout his first term, Trump courted close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem and helped broker the Abraham Accords. After departing the White House, however, the former president began souring on Netanyahu in the public eye. He has complained that Netanyahu “let us down” just before the US killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020. During a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine published last month , Trump opened up about his beef with Netanyahu and claimed that Israel pulled out of the operation to kill the top Iranian general. “That was going to be a joint [attack] and all of a sudden, we were told that Israel was not doing it,” he told Time. “And I was not happy about that. That was something I never forgot. And it showed me something.” President Biden, 81, has also clashed with Netanyahu over concerns that Israel isn’t sufficiently trying to minimize civilian casualties in its war with Hamas. Meanwhile, Trump has publicly expressed some misgivings about the manner in which Israel has conducted the war against Hamas, contending that the US ally is “absolutely losing the PR war.” “Every night, they’re releasing tapes of a building falling down. They shouldn’t be releasing tapes like that. They’re doing, that’s why they’re losing the PR war,” Trump vented to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last month. “They’ve got to finish what they started, and they’ve got to finish it fast, and we have to get on with life.” However, despite his reservations with Netanyahu, Trump reportedly told donors at the New York roundtable this month that he intends to back Israel if he returns to the presidency.",

        "description": "It's been 80 years since claims about the so-called \"Mad Gasser of Mattoon\" inspired small town residents to believe they were targets.",
        "content": "Dizziness. Chirping in the ears. Migraines. Memory loss. These are just a few of the symptoms of Havana Syndrome — the mysterious sudden-onset illness that is said to have affected more than 100 US diplomats, White House staffers, intelligence agents and their family members. Last Wednesday, the House homeland security subcommittee on counterterrorism, law enforcement and intelligence heard testimony from retired army officer Greg Edgreen, claiming that “America’s best men and women in national security are being targeted and neutralized.” This echoed a “60 Minutes” bombshell report that aired March 31, claiming Russian intelligence operatives could be behind the debilitating syndrome that first surfaced in Havana, the capital city of communist Cuba. Theories about the cause have included the use of electromagnetic or radio frequency energy , chemical attacks, ionizing radiation or acoustic signals. But multiple US intelligence agencies insist that the culprit is not a foreign adversary . Instead, the FBI’s Behavioral Unit, and others in the scientific community, believe Havana Syndrome’s victims were probably suffering from “mass psychogenic illness,” when people start feeling sick even though there is no physical or environmental reason for their illness. It’s similar to a “mass hysteria” that terrorized the residents of a small town in the American heartland during World War II — who believed they had been sickened by a madman who gassed or anesthetized them while they slept in their beds. Long lost to history, this year marks the 80th anniversary of the hysteria that struck dozens of working-class residents of Mattoon, Illinois, who claimed to have suffered from some of the same symptoms that have befallen Havana syndrome victims today. The Mattoon case became public for the first time on September 1, 1944, when a local newspaper reported an interview with Aline Kearney, a cabbie’s wife and mother of three-year-old Dorothy Ellen. She had gone to bed around 11 p.m. and noticed a “sickening, sweet odor” that “grew stronger and I began to feel a paralysis of my legs and lower body. “I grew frightened and screamed for Martha,” her sister-in-law, who “at once noticed the odor.” She summoned a neighbor who called the police, which was now down to just 10 officers because of the wartime draft. Upon arrival, officers were told a mysterious figure in all black had been spotted near the house, and that he had used an anesthetic — chloroform, ether, or a combination of both — to make Aline Kearney ill. Some 90 minutes later, her husband arrived home, spotted a tall figure at the window — a man, and possibly a woman, who would soon be dubbed ‘The Mad Gasser of Mattoon.” Mr. Kearney gave chase and the police were called once again, but the search was fruitless. By then, Mrs. Kearney’s paralysis was gone and she had recovered the use of her legs and arms. Virtually overnight, more Mattoon residents reported being gassed by the supposed fiend. In all, several dozen claimed to be victims by the time the scare ended weeks later. The story hit the big-time national media, including Time magazine and the Associated Press — with the latter reporting: “Mattoon gets jitters from gas attacks, comparing nervous Mattoon residents to Londoners under protracted aerial blitzing.” According to the September 18, 1944, issue of Time , “The Mad Anesthetist began his nocturnal visitations two weeks ago, mainly concentrating his fiendish attacks on women. One said a smell like gardenias ‘made her legs tingle.’ Another said a ‘fat man had squirted perfume into her bedroom.'” An account from Mrs. Carl Cordes got wide play, after she claimed to have found a damp pink cloth on her back porch. Cordes said she sniffed it out of curiosity, fell ill and told police she “felt as though a charge of electricity had gone through me.” Taken to the hospital, she had reportedly suffered temporary paralysis and, incredibly, burns. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. An investigator from the Illinois Criminal Investigation Laboratory was dispatched to Mattoon from the Windy City, 230 miles away, to probe the pink cloth, but the lab found no evidence of gas, or any chemicals on it. But the investigator, one Richard T. Piper, nonetheless announced that he thought the “anesthetist” was probably using a heavy, colorless liquid of some sort. Meanwhile, five Chicago chemists called the whole case a “hoax.” With Mattoon gripped by fear, the police and townsmen formed a virtual posse in search of the monster — like a scene out of Frankenstein, but using flashlights instead of torches. Vigilantes armed with shotguns patrolled the deserted streets at night, prompting Mattoon’s alarmed police commissioner to declare, “I wouldn’t walk through anybody’s backyard at night now for $10,000.” Police Chief C.E. Cole demanded that “roving bands of men and boys should disband. They’re in grave danger of being shot.” Locked and barred in their homes, frightened residents took loaded weapons to bed with them. At the same time, as Time noted, “Chicago newsmen swept joyfully down upon Mattoon and wired leering accounts of The Gas Fiend, The Thin Man of Mattoon, The Mad Phantom and The Screwball Chemist.” At one point during the first two weeks of that hellish September, 17 families on just a single Mattoon block claimed they had been gassed, causing nausea and weird feelings to their arms and legs. But near the end of the month, with little or no attacks reported, and with no suspect caught, there were serious suspicions that a gasser — and the gas — never existed. It was then that the Illinois state’s attorney, William Kidwell, shut down the case, declaring that the Mad Gasser was clearly a wave of mass hysteria that had consumed the town. Blame was also placed on journalists who had hyped the story from day one — when Mattoon’s Daily Journal-Gazette front-page headline about the Kearney case read, “Anesthetic Prowler on Loose.” The Illinois Times chalked it up to wartime madness, noting that “when so many men were off fighting and so many women left alone, the gassings have been explained away as a product of paranoia, panic and delirium.” As for today’s controversial cases, a report — “ Havana Syndrome: A Post Mortem ” — in the March issue of the International Journal of Social Psychiatry concluded that the six-year investigation by US officials was like going down a “rabbit hole” in the search for “exotic explanations.” “Instead of finding secret weapons and foreign conspiracies,” the report said, “they found only rabbits.”",

        "content": "Norwich City have agreed compensation close to £400,000 for Nordsjaelland head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup, according to reports. The Canaries are known to have offered Thorup the job, having decided on him over fellow candidates Will Still and Pascal Jansen late last week. The Dane is keen on the move, leaving only negotiations over details. Those negotiations have escalated since the conclusion of the Danish Superliga season at the weekend, with part of those being the compensation fee for Thorup. Those behind the scenes at Carrow Road were relaxed about the agreement of compensation, with other issues including contracts and potential backroom staff included in discussions over recent days. Now Danish outlet Tipsbladet have claimed that a deal has been struck with the Tigers for the transfer of their head coach, whose work permit was sorted during the interview process. Norwich sporting director Ben Knapper has long been a fan of Thorup, who has gained a good reputation across Europe for his development of young players and positive tactical style. Although due diligence included considering other coaches, Thorup was the frontrunner for some time. The 35-year-old declined to discuss reports of a move to England when asked after his last game at Nordsjaelland, telling Viaplay: \"Have I heard anything from [Norwich]? I want to say, as I have also said several times during this season, that when I am employed somewhere, I have so much respect for the place I am employed. \"Just look at this scenery that is behind me right now. I think it would be so disrespectful of me to go out and talk about other clubs or other situations. \"No matter if it was close or completely miles away - I'm never ever going to go into that because this club means so much that we shouldn't be standing here on the last day of the season talking about everything else.\"",

The Sky Blue Star suffered a 3-2 defeat against Kwara United on Sunday. The visitors conceded three times in the first half before scoring twice late in the game. Ogunmodede commended his players for their performances and vowed to keep pushing for the title. “We will not give up. We will keep fighting to the end. We knew it wouldn’t be easy, but we’ll learn from our mistakes and come back stronger,” he said after the game. “The only disappointment is that we were unable to get the maximum three points. We planned for the win, but unfortunately, we couldn’t get our desired results. “That is the only disappointment. I understand there is no excuse for failure; if not, I would have been talking about the abrupt break we had for a month, so you expect a team to come back and give it their best—it’s impossible. “But nevertheless, it was a good fight. Kwara United took advantage of their early goal; you know this is a team who had the luck of playing about two matches during the holidays, which tells of their match fitness, and the early goal gave them a lot of confidence. We were struggling; they took advantage again and scored their second goal before the whistle sounded for the second half. “We came in the second half and fought hard; we were unlucky and scored an own goal. We wanted to be champions, and we know what it means to be champions—as champions, you don’t give up. So we fought. We got two consolidating goals, but it wasn’t enough.” Related Topics: NPFL Ogunmodede Remo Stars Don't Miss Transfer: Balogun signs one-year contract with Rangers You may like NPFL: New Super Eagles invitee Ismail bags 13th assist Remo Stars’ Ismail celebrates maiden Super Eagles’ invitation Ogunmodede excited with Ismail’s Super Eagles invitation NPFL rejects Katsina United’s request for postponement of Shooting Stars clash 2026 WCQ: Remo Stars celebrate Ismail’s Super Eagles invitation NPFL urges clubs, referees to abide by regulations Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

        "content": "We are only two months from the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris , and the games may be about to lose one of its most lucrative partners . According to a report from Japan's Kyodo News , Toyota will end its sponsorship contract with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after this year's games in Paris. The report cited unidentified \"sources close to the matter.\" Toyota has declined to comment on the Kyoda article, according to media reports . Related stories Toyota's deal, announced in 2015, is believed to be the largest sponsorship agreement ever signed by the IOC. At the time, Japanese media reported that it would be worth $835 million. According to Kyodo's report, sources at Toyota were unhappy with how the IOC has used the money. The automaker believes the committee is not doing enough to support the athletes and promote the games. During the Tokyo Summer Olympics in 2021, the IOC was criticized for not doing enough to support the mental health of its competitors . Toyota sources told Kyodo that the company would like to continue sponsoring the Paralympic games. The IOC, however, requires its partners to support all its events. Toyota is one of just 15 \"TOP\" sponsors as part of The Olympic Partner program . TOP is the highest level of sponsorship for the games and is limited to one per industry. Other brands include Coca-Cola, Samsung, Intel, Corona Cero, and Procter & Gamble. Toyota pulled its commercials from the delayed 2021 Olympic games in Tokyo , and executives skipped the opening ceremonies in response to concerns about safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The world has amplified their brand by placing the duo in the conversation as being the best backcourt ever amid their playoff success. However, Irving deflected such praise once he caught wind of the hype. in their 116-107 win over the in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals on Sunday night, Irving was asked about the talk surrounding their names. The Duke product when assessing where he and the . \"I mean, it doesn't mean anything if we don't win a ring together, you know. And I say that very responsibly too, you know. Not saying that we aren't great now, but there are other backcourts that are more deserving right now for that recognition. I think, once we put a good run together, and we can look back on it, reflect on it, and that'll be our time. But right now, show a lot of respect to the guys that have come before us and have actually did it, and our time will come.\" -Kyrie Irving How Irving and Dončić Stack Up Against The Best Irving and Dončić may have their work cut out for them in order to enter rarified air with some of the best point guard-shooting guard pairings the league has ever seen. The most successful backcourts all have serious hardware and innumerable playoff triumphs ingrained in the minds of the basketball world. Luka Doncic & Kyrie Irving vs. Most Accomplished Backcourts in NBA History Bob Cousy & Sam Jones 6 5 1 34.1 PPG (1961-62) Jerry West & Gail Goodrich 7 1 4 51.7 PPG (1971-72) Walt Frazier & Earl Monroe 6 1 2 42.4 PPG (1974-75) Magic Johnson & Michael Cooper 11 5 0 34.4 PPG (1986-87) Isiah Thomas & Joe Dumars 9 2 4 41.1 PPG (1992-93) Tony Parker & Manu Ginobili 16 4 0 38.3 PPG (2007-08) Steph Curry & Klay Thompson 13 4 5 52.2 PPG (2015-16) Luka Dončić & Kyrie Irving 2 0 0 59.5 PPG (2023-24) Additionally, and reached No. 1 and No. 8 respectively on the all-time three-pointers made list in 2022-23 while won his third MVP and Cooper took home the Defensive Player of the Year award in 1987. Albeit, Dončić and Irving have been put in the conversation thanks to their potent scoring and current postseason success. They have a higher combined single-season scoring average than any of the aforementioned pairs. Their offensive firepower has also garnered comparisons to and as well as exaltation over Irving and Harden's pairing from 2020, which was also met with similar buzz at the time they joined forces on the All things considered, championships hold the most weight when esteeming players and teams. Irving has been to the NBA mountaintop once before with the in 2016, which has elevated his status over other elite guards without a ring. In the same breath, Irving has faced much scrutiny since leaving that championship Cavaliers team for not achieving the same success elsewhere and for being an alleged locker room cancer. Doncic has flirted with winning a league MVP for the last three seasons. A championship in 2024 would erase those misnomers and give them credence in the best backcourt ever debate.",

        "content": "Veteran Super Eagles and Rangers defender, Leon Aderemi Balogun, has signed a new deal that will see him stay at the club for another year, Soccernet.ng reports. The 35-year-old joined the Scottish record Champions for a second spell from Queens Park Rangers last summer, but the move didn’t pan out how he wanted it, as he could only play 18 games all season. After signing for the Gers on a year contract for a second stint, Balogun’s contract was set to expire at the end of this season. Soccernet.ng earlier reported that Rangers boss, Philippe Clement, was impressed with his performances towards the end of the season before the former Mainz 05 man picked up an injury that kept him out of the Scottish Cup final. The 46-time capped Super Eagles defender is also keen on extending his stay at Ibrox. According to The Scottish Sun , Philippe Clement has rewarded Balogun’s performances with a new deal that will see him continue at the club for another season. Rangers are set to bolster their central-defensive options over the coming weeks and it’s believed Levski Sofia stopper – Jose Cordoba, is top of their wishlist. While Rangers are in renewal talks with John Souttar, Connor Goldson, Ben Davies and Leon King, they will also be parting ways with John Lundstram, Borna Barisic, Ryan Jack and John McLaughlin who are all out of contract at the end of the season, and Balogun’s experience will help the club’s new signings to settle in nicely. Balogun last played for Nigeria in their 10-0 win over São Tomé and Príncipe, coming off the substitute’s bench with 19 minutes left to play.",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak insisted he took responsibility for the Conservatives’ election campaign after a leaked memo criticised MPs and ministers over a lack of effort. Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer, staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.”",

        "content": "Mr Wike stated this in Abuja on Monday, after he inspected the Southern Parkway Road and Abuja Rail Mass Transit, in preparation for commercial inauguration on May 29. According to Mr Wike, Mr Tinubu has done very well in FCT and the country in just one year, particularly in physical infrastructure and human capital development. “Mr President “Renewed Hope” agenda is no longer a story; it’s a reality. It is a promise made and a promise fulfilled. “I think Mr. President has done very very well in terms of reassuring Nigerians that he is committed to deliver the dividend of democracy. “From what we have seen on the ground, there is really hope for Nigerians. “So, we are very happy.” He added that in FCT, Tinubu has rekindled the hope of civil servants by instituting their career progression “and I am sure the civil servants are happy”. The minister noted that although there were some areas that needed to be looked into, one year was not enough for Tinubu to deliver 100 per cent expectations of Nigerians. On the inauguration of the projects, Mr Wike said: “We are good to go; just putting finishing touches. “We have been to the Southern Parkway, and we are 100 per cent ready. Here in the Metro Line, we are also ready. “We are happy that all our efforts have come to fruition. “The residents are very happy and by the end of the day, the train services will be available for Nigerians. “So, for us at FCTA, we are very very happy,” the minister said.

        "content": "The NHL fined New York Rangers captain Jacob Trouba $5,000 on Monday for elbowing Florida Panthers forward Evan Rodrigues. The incident occurred late in the second period in Game 3 on Sunday. Trouba received a two-minute minor for the elbow as well as a minor penalty for slashing during the same sequence. Rodrigues, who was struck in the side of the face, left the ice with help but eventually returned in the third period. Trouba, 30, contributed two assists on Sunday in Sunrise, Fla., as New York won 5-4 in overtime to seize a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals. Trouba has one goal and six assists in 13 games this postseason. The defenseman tallied 22 points (three goals, 19 assists) and 73 penalty minutes in 69 games during the regular season.

        "content": "The road to Omaha has officially begun with the 64-team field for NCAA Division I baseball championship being revealed. Tennessee is the No. 1 (50-11) overall seed after dominating for the entire year and winning the SEC regular-season title and conference tournament. The rest of the top four includes two other SEC schools -- Kentucky at No. 2, Texas A&M at No. 3 -- and North Carolina at No. 4. LSU will look to defend its title on the road in the Chapel Hill Regional with its first game against Wofford, and elsewhere, the Bryan-College Station Regional should bring the drama with the opportunity for Texas A&M to face in-state rival Texas. Notably, Florida State is back in the tournament after missing it for the first time since 1977 last year. The SEC and ACC are each hosting five regionals. The other host regional sites include two schools from the Big 12, two from the Pac-12 -- Arizona was crowned the last Pac-12 champion and is hosting -- and one from the AAC and one from the Big West. Oklahoma is hosting for the first time since 2010, and UC Santa Barbara is hosting for its first time on campus as the only other time the school hosted was in 2015 and did so at a neutral location.

        "content": "Former Mamelodi Sundowns player Lovers Mohlala has spoken about how frustrating it was to miss out on a move abroad, when the club rejected an offer from a Danish club. Soccer Laduma spoke to the retired player to talk about the years he spent with the Tshwane giants. I was there from 1997 until 2003 I think. My time at Sundowns was very nice and painful as well. The nicest part about being at Sundowns was that we were a team that was winning. Players dedicated their lives to represent the Sundowns badge. At some point, I was frustrated. Frustrated how? Remember FC Conpenhagen bought Sibusiso Zuma? I actually went for trials there. They were supposed to buy me. They offered $400 000 to Sundowns. But Sundowns wanted $700 000. The painful part is that what Motsepe is doing today, Sundowns did not do back then. We didn't get bonuses for the Champions League. They said we would share what we win, but we lost in the final and we did not get a cent. We had great players, the likes of Alex Bapela, John Tlale, Roger Feutmba and (Joel) Fire Maselela. We had a bunch of good players and there was unity. We were not celebrity. We were protected by king pins and taxi owners. Even in the township, the Sundowns players would not be hijacked so easily. I remember Albert Kometsi who used to play for Swallows was hijacked. Then we called around and we told him that he would find his car at the police station, but he would not find the tyres and the radio. We were protected and we were not paying a protection fee. We had the nicest time at Sundowns, but there was no money. I'll tell you one thing...the highest that I earned at Sundowns was R12 000. We were playing with players who really wanted to win. The painful part is that you retire in football, but you can't even enter the yard at Sundowns. That's the sad part. When you play, there is no pension. We are the only ones who pay tax and not get a pension fund. That's the sad part of football. My first game was against Chiefs and we beat them 4-1. I was on the bench and Bra Stan said 'boy, what''s your nickname?' Then he said 'today, your name is Horse'. I created two goals that day. That's where I started. I knew when I got there, I had already made a mark for myself. When I got there, it was a matter of showing my skill. It was frustration. They did not want to sell me to Copenhagen. When Copenhagen bought Zuma, Sundowns refused to sell me. They gave me the offer in my hand. They called Sundowns and they even offered me a salary. That's when I got frustrated.",

        "content": "Getting a medical staffing company prepared to compete for $43 billion worth of work will be a \"bit of a crystal ball exercise,\" says Bill Rivard. Rivard is CEO and founder of Matrix Providers, which specializes in recruiting and placing health care professionals across the nation's military bases. Denver-based Matrix on Thursday joined 10 other companies selected to fill a $43 billion contract to recruit thousands of health care workers for the national network of Army, Navy, and Air Force bases over the next 15 years. It's the federal government's largest health care staffing contract yet, enlarged in part to respond to the national health care staffing shortage, said Rivard, an optometrist who spent 21 years on active duty with the Army and seven with the reserves. The constraints of the national staffing shortfall, coupled with the fact that health care jobs serving the military look a bit different, means that Rivard has his work cut out for him. > Read the full story at the Denver Business Journal.

        "content": "A BBC star was kicked off a flight after asking passengers not to eat peanuts because of her daughter’s peanut allergies, with the act leaving the pilot infuriated. British weather presenter Georgie Palmer together with her husband Nick Sollom and their two kids Rosie and Annie were asked to get off a SunExpress flight from London Gatwick to Dalaman in Turkey on Tuesday. The popular TV personality shared a lengthy Instagram post slamming the Turkish-German airline for not only kicking her family off the flight, but for refusing to make a standard announcement asking passengers not to eat peanuts. The 49-year-old explained that she instead had to ask passengers not to eat peanuts, adding that they were happy to do. But the flight’s captain allegedly demanded the family leave before he took off. “I thanked the beautiful souls on our plane for helping us,” she said in the Instagram post, according to The Sun. “Many of them hugged, cheered and held our hands as we were forced to disembark. “The SunExpress captain and cabin crew refused to make the standard announcement on behalf of our daughter. “We gently asked the passengers at the front of the plane to share our request. “Row by row, all the passengers turned back to kindly ask the row behind to please not eat nuts on the flight. “It was calm, earnest and with an overwhelming sense of solidarity and empathy.” Georgie added: “There’s no beef with simple asks like these. People get it! “We were hoofed off the plane after the angry little captain shouted at us from the cockpit.” She said they were discriminated against for “simply having an allergy”. According to The Sun, the family booked into an airport hotel and took an easyJet flight to Dalaman the next day – costing them an extra $6,385. Georgie told the Daily Mail : “The captain decided because of my daughter’s allergy he didn’t want to fly with her on board. “When he found out I had spoken to the other passengers he was screaming at me from the cockpit. “He was so angry, the next thing I knew we were told to get off the plane. “How we were treated was disgusting – nobody working on that plane showed one ounce of compassion.” A SunExpress spokesman said: “We take the safety of our passengers very seriously. “Shortly after boarding our flight, the passenger raised a concern about one of his family group having a serious peanut allergy. “They requested an announcement to other passengers. We refrain from making these kinds of announcements. “Like many other airlines, we cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment on our flights. “Nor can we prevent other passengers from bringing food items containing allergens on board. “Due to the insistent behaviour of the passenger to others on board, the captain decided it would be safest if the family did not travel. “When this was explained to the passenger, he behaved aggressively towards our crew members and tried to gain access to the cockpit. “To ensure the safety of our crew and our passengers on board, we cannot tolerate aggressive and unruly behaviour on our flights. “Our website states that passengers must notify us 48 hours in advance of any special care required due to a medical condition. “No such notification was received from the passengers in this instance.” The spokesman added: “However, we are fully aware that this was an upsetting situation for the family. “We are taking the incident as an opportunity to conduct a review of the information provided during our booking process. “This will ensure more effective solutions for passengers with allergies.” According to The Sun, Sollom denies acting aggressively. Many have taken to social media to weigh in on the debacle, with plenty of users siding with the pilot. “The pilot is a national treasure,” one person wrote. “As they should have been,” a second wrote, referring to the family getting kicked off. “Would have booted them off as well,” another agreed. A fourth wrote: “I think this story would be found under Self Entitlement in the dictionary.” – with The Sun",

        "content": "The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry has ordered the shuttering of two B.C. based technology companies, one of which makes drones with military applications. In a brief statement posted Friday (May 24), Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said two companies must be dissolved, following a national security review. The companies in question are Bluvec Technologies Inc. and Pegauni Technology Inc. “The government’s decisions are based on facts and evidence and on the advice ofCanada’s security and intelligence community, and other governmentpartners,” Champagne said in the news release. “While Canada continues to welcome foreign direct investment, we will act decisively when investments threaten our national security.” Bluvec, based in Burnaby, makes a drone detection system, which has potential military applications. As reported by Glacier Media last year, Bluvec was successfully sued by another Burnaby drone detection company , Skycope Technologies for stealing proprietary source code. The founders of both Bluevec and Skycope were friends who originally worked for the same cybersecurity company in China, according B.C. Supreme Court documents. The principals of Bluvec identified in the lawsuit are Junfeng Jia (aka Jack Jia), Leyuan Pan (aka Michael Pan), Kunyu Zhang (aka Eric Zhang) and Qianqi Zhuang (aka Tim Zhuang). Also listed as defendants in the case were Xiaoqian Wu (aka Karl Wu) and Jiawei Li. The principal of Skyscope Technologies is Zhenhua (Eric) Liu, according to the court ruling. The court case notes that both Bluvec and Skyscope developed technology that “enables users to detect and block or ‘jam’ unwanted drones.” Bluvec and two of its principals – Junfeng Jia and Leyuan Pan – were ordered to pay Skycope Technologies $800,000 for breaching employment agreements with Skycope. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Bluvec said Jack Jia was unavailable. [email protected] twitter.com/nbennett_biv",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" From left, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Major Gen. Trevor Bradenkamp, listen to the playing of Taps during an Armed Forces Full Honors Wreath Ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. President Joe Biden delivers the Memorial Day Address at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. The ceremony at Pier 86 on Manhattan's West Side honors the members of the armed forces who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country. CBS N... “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members. Heart-pounding thrill rides, tasty treats, unique attractions — who doesn't love a trip to an amusement park? In fact, our universal (pun intended) love for amusement parks stretches back much further than you might expect: all the way to 1583. That's when the world's oldest amusement park, Bakken, opened in Denmark. People around the world still flock to amusement parks in the millions today. But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, many of the most popular parks in North America temporarily closed their gates or, at the very least, saw significant drops in attendance. Some parks started to recuperate in 2021 as social distancing restrictions eased, but most stayed relatively empty until 2022. When 2022 did roll around, though, certain parks saw 40-50% spikes in attendance compared to the year prior, while one park's attendance soared by more than 500%. The industry is now firmly back in business, and many amusement parks have implemented new rides, shows, and other exciting experiences to entice visitors to return. To showcase the parks that saw the biggest increases in annual visitors between 2021 and 2022, Stacker looked at data from the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM . Read on to find out which 13 North American amusement parks have grown the most in popularity in recent years. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 20% - 2022 attendance: 10.8 million Though COVID-19 restrictions in Florida were among the most relaxed in the country, Universal Studios Florida still underwent a major dip in visitors during the pandemic. The park welcomed slightly less than 4.1 million attendees in 2020, compared to the 10.9 million visitors who entered Universal in 2019. But attendance jumped back up in 2022, further bolstered by the 2021 opening of the Jurassic World VelociCoaster elsewhere in the park and a stunt show called the Bourne Stuntacular, which started in 2020. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 21% - 2022 attendance: 11.0 million According to the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM, Universal's Islands of Adventure accounted for the lion's share of attendance at Universal Orlando Resort in 2022. In fact, visitor numbers at this park alone outstripped three separate Disney World parks: Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios. You can find the aforementioned Jurassic World VelociCoaster here, as well as Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, a popular ride that opened in 2019. - Location: San Diego - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 3.5 million Attendance at SeaWorld San Diego in 2022 neared pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 3.7 million in 2019. That could be thanks to the opening of a buzzy new ride, the Emperor Dive Coaster. The tallest and fastest dive coaster in California, the Emperor boasts a breathtaking, 14-story vertical drop. A Mardi Gras event also kicked off for the first time in 2022. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Disney's Animal Kingdom still has a ways to go to reach pre-pandemic attendance (nearly 14 million visitors came to the park in 2019), but the return of several popular tours, like the Up Close with Rhinos experience and the Wild Africa Trek, helped boost visitors in 2022. Several key, holiday-themed shows also reappeared, including the Merry Menagerie, a wildlife-themed puppet show and the park's annual Earth Day celebration. - Location: Tampa, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 26% - 2022 attendance: 4.1 million 2022 brought both new events and returning favorites to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. Celebrations like Cinco de Mayo and Viva La Música took place for the first time, while Mardi Gras, the Food & Wine Festival, and the Real Music concert series returned to the park that year. Busch Gardens also drew crowds to a new ride in March 2022: Iron Gwazi, the tallest hybrid roller coaster in North America. Notably, Busch Gardens' parent company, SeaWorld, reported increased revenue in 2022 compared to 2019, indicating that while there might be fewer visitors, those visitors are happy to spend more money on their experiences. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 27% - 2022 attendance: 10.9 million Between 2021 and 2022, Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World didn't have many new attractions to offer visitors. But that didn't stop over a million more attendees from streaming into the park in 2022, as pandemic restrictions continued to lift and Disney celebrated its 50th anniversary. Disney theme parks did roll out the Genie+ line-skipping service starting in 2021, which could have helped increase attendance at Hollywood Studios and other Walt Disney World attractions. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 29% - 2022 attendance: 10.0 million Several hugely popular events made their regularly scheduled returns to Epcot at Walt Disney World in 2022, including the Festival of the Arts, which features the Disney on Broadway Concert series. In the summer, Epcot also launched The Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind, a ride that ranks as one of the world's longest enclosed coasters. Last but not least, the fast-casual restaurant Connections Café and Eatery serving up Starbucks favorites opened its doors for the first time in 2022, a major plus for visitors needing a caffeine boost. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 35% - 2022 attendance: 17.1 million There's good news and bad news for Magic Kingdom fans. This was the most-visited theme park in the world in 2022, but these visitor stats don't even come close to pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 21 million in 2019. The park also experienced significant construction delays on one of its most anticipated rides, Tron Lightcycle/Run, which was originally slated to open in 2022 but was pushed to 2023. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 46% - 2022 attendance: 4.5 million Just like its West Coast location, SeaWorld Orlando welcomed visitors to a brand-new roller coaster in 2022. The Ice Breaker features four different launches (forward and reverse, in case you were wondering) and the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida, clocking in at 93 feet tall. Aside from the Ice Breaker, several key attractions, like the Kraken, were updated and given facelifts. The Electric Ocean summertime event also returned to dazzle audiences with two new shows: stunt show Adrenaline and luminescent percussion concert Electroblast. - Location: Universal City, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 53% - 2022 attendance: 8.4 million Universal Studios Hollywood made some major moves in 2022, namely opening a new film set, Jupiter's Claim, the Western-themed attraction at the center of the horror film \"Nope.\" Guests can explore Jupiter's Claim and other sets aboard the studio tour, which takes visitors behind the scenes of famous Universal releases. The park's ultra-popular Christmas event, The Awesomest Celebration of the Season, also made a triumphant comeback that year. Festivities took place throughout the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and over in Whoville, where Universal's trademark Grinchmas came to town. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 81% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Considering all Disneyland Resort parks were closed for nearly four months in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions, and Disneyland offered discounted tickets for Southern California residents in 2022, it's no surprise visitor numbers spiked in the latter year. Several long-missed celebrations, including the Lunar New Year and the Food & Wine Festival, also returned to Disney California Adventure Park. Plus, the character of Raya from the 2021 animated film \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" made her debut here in 2022. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 97% - 2022 attendance: 16.9 million Attendance at Disneyland Park at Disneyland Resort nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022, likely due to the resort's post-pandemic reopening and those aforementioned discounted tickets. But also in 2022, the park's beloved nighttime shows (known as \"spectaculars\") finally kicked off again after the long hiatus. Displays like the Main Street Electrical Parade and Disneyland Forever illuminated the park after dark once more, heralding an eagerly anticipated return to normalcy for visitors. - Location: Maple, Ontario - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 524% - 2022 attendance: 3.8 million The largest theme park in Canada, Canada's Wonderland had a bumpy year in 2022, with one attraction catching fire and others trapping riders during a storm , but millions still entered the park in 2022, a dramatic increase from the prior year. Canada's Wonderland was especially busy in 2022—new events like the Taste of the Caribbean took place, and the water park attraction Mountain Bay Cliffs opened this year, as did the Lazy Bear Lodge restaurant.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" From left, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Major Gen. Trevor Bradenkamp, listen to the playing of Taps during an Armed Forces Full Honors Wreath Ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. President Joe Biden delivers the Memorial Day Address at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. The ceremony at Pier 86 on Manhattan's West Side honors the members of the armed forces who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country. CBS N... “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 20% - 2022 attendance: 10.8 million Though COVID-19 restrictions in Florida were among the most relaxed in the country, Universal Studios Florida still underwent a major dip in visitors during the pandemic.

        "content": "PHOTO: GETTY IMAGES That’s what 3500 West Coasters said after a major broadband outage was caused by hungry rodents chewing through fibre cables. The internet went down on Sunday night for customers between Greymouth and Westport, just after cellphone alarms nationwide sounded for the annual Civil Defence emergency test. The coincidence prompted many to wonder if the system was overloaded, whereas in fact the problem was traced to rats. Chorus said its team found the fibre cables had been damaged by rodents. The first outage occurred on Saturday night, and a temporary fix was applied. However, because the rodents were still in the ducts, repeat outages occurred over the weekend. \"We have now re-routed all services into the alternative temporary cable, which sits outside of the affected duct,\" a spokeswoman said. Service was restored progressively throughout the weekend, up until just after midnight on Sunday. Chorus said it was working to put protections in place and prevent future incidents, with a new rodent-resistant duct for the fibre cables. \"We do try to minimise the impact of rodents by using rodent resistant ducting where possible and properly sealing duct lines, but unfortunately the critters do get through sometimes. This is particularly the case at this time of year as they're nesting.\" The spokeswoman said the blackout was unrelated to the emergency cellphone test just after 6pm yesterday. — Greymouth Star",

        "description": "The intersection of Gladstone and Gordon Rds in Mosgiel. A Mosgiel mother has described the \"sickening\" moment her daughter was a hair’s breadth from being struck at a notorious intersection in the township.",
        "content": "The intersection of Gladstone and Gordon Rds in Mosgiel. It comes amid calls for something to be done about the intersection of Gladstone and Gordon Rds after a crash there last week. A Mosgiel mother, who asked not to be named, said on May 18 her daughter was almost mowed down by a vehicle after the traffic lights malfunctioned and the driver’s view was obscured by heavy traffic. She said it was \"sickening\" to witness her primary school-aged daughter almost being hit by a car. Her daughter was crossing Haggart-Alexander Dr while a green signal for pedestrians was on, when a driver made a fast right-hand turn to make the gap in traffic. The driver’s red arrow had stopped flashing before the green signal for pedestrians had turned red and the driver’s view was obscured by vehicle congestion on the road. \"The vehicle went right into her pathway while it was travelling really fast — my daughter was very, very lucky it didn’t take her out. \"There is way too many children and way too many vehicles all looking to make it through the intersection.\" The mother said the intersection was already \"quite poorly laid out\", and the recent traffic diversion through Mosgiel while work was carried out on State Highway1 had exacerbated the issue. The layout meant visibility was compromised at the main crossing point where children gathered, and cars turning could not see the children gathered behind vehicles stopped in the pedestrian crossing zone. \"There are a lot of children walking to school between 8am and 9am, this obviously coincides with peak traffic times.\" Mosgiel-Taieri Community Board chairman Andrew Simms said solving the bigger transport issues facing Mosgiel was a \"can that should no longer be kicked down the road\". The inadequacy of the roading network in Mosgiel had been highlighted as a priority in 2013 as part of the Integrated Transport Strategy for Dunedin by the Dunedin City Council. All other priorities had been addressed, except for Mosgiel, Mr Simms said. \"Since 2013, the population of Mosgiel has grown by 30% and heavy transport movements on Gordon Rd had increased by over 300%. \"What the Mosgiel community needs is decisive action. We do not need another study, more hand-wringing and further excuses — we need funding and diggers.\" An NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi spokeswoman said the intersection had a complicated layout that demanded drivers’ attention at all times and their patience. \"We are actively managing the intersection of Gladstone Rd and SH87 to minimise journey times.\" NZTA was planning work to improve safety outcomes for drivers going in an out of Mosgiel. \"The intersection optimisation from an NZTA perspective would meet economic growth and productivity, as well as safety improvement aims. \"Given there are local roads intersecting and a KiwiRail track crossing this piece of highway, any future work would involve NZTA, DCC and KiwiRail.\" The spokeswoman said funding would need to be confirmed in September.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" From left, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Major Gen. Trevor Bradenkamp, listen to the playing of Taps during an Armed Forces Full Honors Wreath Ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. President Joe Biden delivers the Memorial Day Address at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday in Arlington, Va. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. The ceremony at Pier 86 on Manhattan's West Side honors the members of the armed forces who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country. CBS N... “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members. Heart-pounding thrill rides, tasty treats, unique attractions — who doesn't love a trip to an amusement park? In fact, our universal (pun intended) love for amusement parks stretches back much further than you might expect: all the way to 1583. That's when the world's oldest amusement park, Bakken, opened in Denmark. People around the world still flock to amusement parks in the millions today. But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, many of the most popular parks in North America temporarily closed their gates or, at the very least, saw significant drops in attendance. Some parks started to recuperate in 2021 as social distancing restrictions eased, but most stayed relatively empty until 2022. When 2022 did roll around, though, certain parks saw 40-50% spikes in attendance compared to the year prior, while one park's attendance soared by more than 500%. The industry is now firmly back in business, and many amusement parks have implemented new rides, shows, and other exciting experiences to entice visitors to return. To showcase the parks that saw the biggest increases in annual visitors between 2021 and 2022, Stacker looked at data from the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM . Read on to find out which 13 North American amusement parks have grown the most in popularity in recent years. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 20% - 2022 attendance: 10.8 million Though COVID-19 restrictions in Florida were among the most relaxed in the country, Universal Studios Florida still underwent a major dip in visitors during the pandemic. The park welcomed slightly less than 4.1 million attendees in 2020, compared to the 10.9 million visitors who entered Universal in 2019. But attendance jumped back up in 2022, further bolstered by the 2021 opening of the Jurassic World VelociCoaster elsewhere in the park and a stunt show called the Bourne Stuntacular, which started in 2020. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 21% - 2022 attendance: 11.0 million According to the Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM, Universal's Islands of Adventure accounted for the lion's share of attendance at Universal Orlando Resort in 2022. In fact, visitor numbers at this park alone outstripped three separate Disney World parks: Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios. You can find the aforementioned Jurassic World VelociCoaster here, as well as Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, a popular ride that opened in 2019. - Location: San Diego - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 3.5 million Attendance at SeaWorld San Diego in 2022 neared pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 3.7 million in 2019. That could be thanks to the opening of a buzzy new ride, the Emperor Dive Coaster. The tallest and fastest dive coaster in California, the Emperor boasts a breathtaking, 14-story vertical drop. A Mardi Gras event also kicked off for the first time in 2022. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 25% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Disney's Animal Kingdom still has a ways to go to reach pre-pandemic attendance (nearly 14 million visitors came to the park in 2019), but the return of several popular tours, like the Up Close with Rhinos experience and the Wild Africa Trek, helped boost visitors in 2022. Several key, holiday-themed shows also reappeared, including the Merry Menagerie, a wildlife-themed puppet show and the park's annual Earth Day celebration. - Location: Tampa, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 26% - 2022 attendance: 4.1 million 2022 brought both new events and returning favorites to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. Celebrations like Cinco de Mayo and Viva La Música took place for the first time, while Mardi Gras, the Food & Wine Festival, and the Real Music concert series returned to the park that year. Busch Gardens also drew crowds to a new ride in March 2022: Iron Gwazi, the tallest hybrid roller coaster in North America. Notably, Busch Gardens' parent company, SeaWorld, reported increased revenue in 2022 compared to 2019, indicating that while there might be fewer visitors, those visitors are happy to spend more money on their experiences. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 27% - 2022 attendance: 10.9 million Between 2021 and 2022, Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World didn't have many new attractions to offer visitors. But that didn't stop over a million more attendees from streaming into the park in 2022, as pandemic restrictions continued to lift and Disney celebrated its 50th anniversary. Disney theme parks did roll out the Genie+ line-skipping service starting in 2021, which could have helped increase attendance at Hollywood Studios and other Walt Disney World attractions. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 29% - 2022 attendance: 10.0 million Several hugely popular events made their regularly scheduled returns to Epcot at Walt Disney World in 2022, including the Festival of the Arts, which features the Disney on Broadway Concert series. In the summer, Epcot also launched The Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind, a ride that ranks as one of the world's longest enclosed coasters. Last but not least, the fast-casual restaurant Connections Café and Eatery serving up Starbucks favorites opened its doors for the first time in 2022, a major plus for visitors needing a caffeine boost. - Location: Lake Buena Vista, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 35% - 2022 attendance: 17.1 million There's good news and bad news for Magic Kingdom fans. This was the most-visited theme park in the world in 2022, but these visitor stats don't even come close to pre-pandemic numbers, which reached 21 million in 2019. The park also experienced significant construction delays on one of its most anticipated rides, Tron Lightcycle/Run, which was originally slated to open in 2022 but was pushed to 2023. - Location: Orlando, Florida - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 46% - 2022 attendance: 4.5 million Just like its West Coast location, SeaWorld Orlando welcomed visitors to a brand-new roller coaster in 2022. The Ice Breaker features four different launches (forward and reverse, in case you were wondering) and the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida, clocking in at 93 feet tall. Aside from the Ice Breaker, several key attractions, like the Kraken, were updated and given facelifts. The Electric Ocean summertime event also returned to dazzle audiences with two new shows: stunt show Adrenaline and luminescent percussion concert Electroblast. - Location: Universal City, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 53% - 2022 attendance: 8.4 million Universal Studios Hollywood made some major moves in 2022, namely opening a new film set, Jupiter's Claim, the Western-themed attraction at the center of the horror film \"Nope.\" Guests can explore Jupiter's Claim and other sets aboard the studio tour, which takes visitors behind the scenes of famous Universal releases. The park's ultra-popular Christmas event, The Awesomest Celebration of the Season, also made a triumphant comeback that year. Festivities took place throughout the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and over in Whoville, where Universal's trademark Grinchmas came to town. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 81% - 2022 attendance: 9.0 million Considering all Disneyland Resort parks were closed for nearly four months in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions, and Disneyland offered discounted tickets for Southern California residents in 2022, it's no surprise visitor numbers spiked in the latter year. Several long-missed celebrations, including the Lunar New Year and the Food & Wine Festival, also returned to Disney California Adventure Park. Plus, the character of Raya from the 2021 animated film \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" made her debut here in 2022. - Location: Anaheim, California - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 97% - 2022 attendance: 16.9 million Attendance at Disneyland Park at Disneyland Resort nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022, likely due to the resort's post-pandemic reopening and those aforementioned discounted tickets. But also in 2022, the park's beloved nighttime shows (known as \"spectaculars\") finally kicked off again after the long hiatus. Displays like the Main Street Electrical Parade and Disneyland Forever illuminated the park after dark once more, heralding an eagerly anticipated return to normalcy for visitors. - Location: Maple, Ontario - Attendance growth, 2021-2022: 524% - 2022 attendance: 3.8 million The largest theme park in Canada, Canada's Wonderland had a bumpy year in 2022, with one attraction catching fire and others trapping riders during a storm , but millions still entered the park in 2022, a dramatic increase from the prior year. Canada's Wonderland was especially busy in 2022—new events like the Taste of the Caribbean took place, and the water park attraction Mountain Bay Cliffs opened this year, as did the Lazy Bear Lodge restaurant.

        "description": "Nairn County have confirmed season ticket prices will remain unchanged for next season, but under-16s will get free entry at Station Park.",
        "content": "Preparations for the 2024/25 Highland League season have continued in earnest at Nairn County. The Wee County have unveiled their new home shirt for the upcoming season, featuring thin black stripes and the club’s new badge, as well as sponsors Murray Travel. It will be available for purchase from the Town Barbers on Nairn’s High Street at the beginning of June. Fixtures for the next Highland League campaign have also been released, with Ross Tokely’s men given a tricky start after the summer. On the opening day of the season on Saturday, July 27, Nairn will travel to defending champions Buckie Thistle – although that match is subject to change depending on the Jags’ League Cup group stage fixture list. Should there be a clash, Nairn’s first league game will take place on Wednesday, July 31 at Victoria Park. The weekend after it does not get any easier, with 2023/24 runners up Brechin City due to make the journey to Station Park. Nairn’s first scheduled midweek fixture of next season will be a derby away at Clachnacuddin on Wednesday, August 7, which is then set to be followed by a trip to another side who will hope to be in title contention, Banks O’Dee. The first round of the Highland League Cup has also been slotted into the calendar, due to take place on Saturday, November 9. With the fixture list being released, excitement will naturally begin to build about the return of football at Station Park, and season tickets are on sale at the same prices as last season. Under-16s, though, will get free entry for all league matches in the 2024/25 campaign. More good news in the meantime as goalkeeper Dylan Maclean has signed a new contract to remain at the club. Maclean’s new deal will see him remain with Nairn until the summer of 2026. The 28-year-old shot stopper has already spent eight seasons as the Wee County’s number one, having made his debut from the bench at home against Brora Rangers on September 9, 2015. He made his first start in the same fixture on the opening day of the following season, and has since gone on to make 186 appearances for the club, keeping 40 clean sheets. Maclean is a three-time supporters’ player of the year, and won his first piece of silverware in the North of Scotland Cup last season – having played a key role in the semi final win over Caley Thistle, saving the decisive penalty in the shoot-out. Manager Ross Tokely was pleased to have tied down the shot-stopper, saying: \"Dylan has been a regular part of the team for a number of years now and played in all but two of our games last season. \"Having played in front of him for the past season-and-a-half, I know how dependable Dylan is. He is capable of making some great saves throughout the season and is clearly a popular player with the supporters. \"I am delighted with the goalkeepers we have at the club and it is a clean slate when we come back after our summer break, so Dylan and the others will have the chance in training to show they can start the season as the club's number one.\"",

Under this plan, they will redevelop 1318 railway stations in the country. The British built most of these stations. The list of stations for redevelopment includes big ones like New Delhi, Delhi Cantonment, Anand Vihar, Gurugram, and Faridabad. In 2022, the Ministry of Railways shared a photo of the proposed redevelopment of the New Delhi Railway Station on social media. The planned proposal calls for a 40-story twin tower, multi-level parking, and pick-up and drop areas at the station, per a Hindustan Times report.

The government's clarification guarantees that the renovation project won't interfere with the New Delhi Railway Station's normal operations.

        "description": "The News Mill",
        "content": "Delhi’s Karkardooma court on Tuesday is likely to pronounce an order on the bail plea of Umar Khalid in the larger conspiracy of Delhi riots case of 2020. He has been in custody since September 2020 in a case under UAPA. Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid has sought regular bail on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons. Special Judge Sameer Bajpai reserved the order on May 13 after hearing the counsel at length. Delhi police’s Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) opposed the plea calling it frivolous and baseless. He also filed written submissions. Umar Khalid’s Counsel had argued that no terror case was made out against him and his name was repeated in the charge sheet of Delhi police. Repeating his name doesn’t make a lie, a truth. There was a vicious media trial taken against him. He had also filed his written submissions. It is alleged by the Delhi police that Umar Khalid had pre-planned protests in 2020 at 23 sites that culminated in riots. After withdrawing his bail plea from the Supreme Court in February, Khalid moved to trial court seeking bail on the grounds of a change in circumstances and parity with other account-used persons. Senior advocate Tridip Pais questioned the submissions of Delhi police and asked, “Is sharing messages a criminal or terror act?” He also responded to submissions earlier made by the Special public prosecutor (SPP) who had said that Khalid was amplifying his narrative as part of a conspiracy by sharing certain links with people with people from politics and others on social media. Pais argued that Umar Khalid was sharing the ‘correct narrative.’ The senior advocate had also submitted that there was a vicious media trial taking place against Umar Khalid. He also referred to various statements of news anchors from different media channels. He said that anchors were reading from the charge sheet around the clock. He further argued that no terror case is made out against Umar Khalid and police have no material to this effect. The court must see whether a terror case is made against him or not. There are contradictions in the statement of prosecution witnesses, Pais added. In this situation, the court must determine whether the witness statement prima facie makes a terror case against Umar Khalid. Earlier it was argued that there accused persons namely Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha were granted bail by the High Court. They had a similar role to that of Umar Khalid. While opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid, Delhi police had said that his chats revealed that he is in the habit of creating narratives on media and social media to influence bail hearings. It was also submitted by the Special Public Prosecutor that several people took to X (earlier Twitter) to influence bail hearing. He had referred to the post on X by Teesta Seetalvad, Amnesty India, Akar Patel, Raj Kaushik, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) while opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid referred to his WhatsApp chats. The SPP had submitted, “WhatsApp chats also revealed that he is in habit of creating media and social media narratives at the time of listing of bail applications of the person booked in cases to clearly influence bail hearings.” “Similar exercise is being adopted while applicants’ bails are being listed to influence his bail hearings, samples of post on X (earlier Twitter) with hashtag about applicant annexed herewith,” SPP added. “Thus in the light of the aforesaid, the present second application for grant of bail to the accused deserves to be dismissed by this honourable court in the interest of justice,” SPP Prasad submitted. SPP Amit Prasad also mentioned the Post on Twitter by Teesta Seetalvad, Aakar Patel, Kaushik Raj, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. SPP had also read some of the tweets in the court. One of the tweets read “Ram Raheem”s parole approved, Umar Khalid bail 14 times adjourned in SC. #freeumarkhalid.” “Umar Khalid withdraws his bail petition from SC. This is a travesty of Justice,” another tweet read. SPP submitted that Amnesty India also tweeted which read “SC has adjourned hearing his bail hearing 14 times. Acute Subversion of the right of Umar Khalid to get bail.” “#freeUmarKhalid was used,” the SPP submitted. The SPP argued that while they claim that they were subjected to media trial, it is he who was playing around with the media, how His father gave interviews in the media and people associated with him also doing the same. In his rebuttal arguments, Senior Advocate Tridip Pais argued that a mere meeting of accused individuals doesn’t imply terrorism. “None of the witnesses didn’t say anything but then miraculously said something two weeks later. All the witnesses here seem to be taking tablets for memory. Prima facie requires depth, not frivolously reading out the chargesheet,” Pais argued. Senior advocate Pais submitted that the prosecution argument is that because I (Umar Khalid) can fain tension. Therefore I don’t deserve bail. His father gave an interview therefore he doesn’t deserve the bail. While arguing, the senior advocate referred to the Supreme Court judgement in Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, Shoma Sen and Varnan Gonsalves. “It was submitted that the allegations should be good enough to establish the allegations are substantive, to reject the bail. The duty of the court is not to deal with the material meticulously but to see the broad probability,” the senior advocate added. On the point of terrorist activity aspect, it was submitted that there is no evidence to show it is a terrorist activity. There is nothing on record to attract section Section 15 of UAPA. The High Court and the Special Court haven’t distinguished between the acts or persons. They’ve just painted everything with a broad brush. There is not a single witness whose statement attracts 15(1) qua me (Umar Khalid). On the point of meeting Umar Khalid, the defence counsel rejected the prosecution’s arguements that meetings were secret ones. He said that Umar Khalid, Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi met at the office of PFI has been referred by the Prosecution on the basis of the statement of a witness CDR. “You want to rely on CDR to deny me bail, Pais questioned. “As per CDR they were not there at the given time and date,” he argued. He further argued that there is no credible case of conspiracy, which is also not terror activity. There is no seizure from me that can attract the offence of terror activity. “On the whimsical statement, sometimes even without witnesses, an act of terrorism is foisted towards me,” Pais submitted. “It was also said that Bangladeshi women and children were deployed at the protest sites. Did any women say that it was against me,” Pais questioned. “In the Varnan Gonsalves and Shoma Sen case, the views of the Supreme Court on Prima Facie and analysis of Prima facie have been clarified,” the defence counsel argued. Pais argued that at the time of hearing bail, the court was under a duty to scan the case diary to decide whether the allegations were prima facie true or not. Third-party hearsay can not be attributed to me. “Mere having a meeting is not enough to oppose the bail. There is no material as of now. The bail cannot be denied as the material can come later,” Pais argued. “If ten witnesses state my name, does that make a terror case against me? I have not indulged in a terrorist act. There is not even a seizure from me,” Pais submitted",

        "content": "After Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, accused in the alleged obscene case, alleged conspiracy against him, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said on Monday that he was free to say anything but is bound to face the law. “Prajwal Revanna may say whatever he wants, but eventually he will have to face the law once he lands,” Shivakumar told reporters at the KPCC office in Bengaluru on Monday. On asked about Prajwal Revanna’s allegation that the alleged case against him was a conspiracy of the Congress party, Shivakumar said, “I don’t have much information on Prajwal Revanna’s video, but I came across it through the media. No matter what he says, he doesn’t have a choice but to present himself before the SIT for investigation. The law will take its course in this case.” “Rahul Gandhi has spoken about Prajwal based on media reports, there is nothing wrong with it. Time will answer Prajwal’s allegation on Rahul Gandhi,” he added. Prajwal Revanna, earlier in the day, released a self-made video in which he alleged political conspiracy behind the case and said that he will appear before the SIT on May 31. The Hassan MP also claimed that he “went into depression” and “isolated” himself as he accused Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders of sparking a discussion on the issue as part of an alleged conspiracy. Revanna is facing a probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT) constituted by the Karnataka government over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in his household. Revanna’s video comes days after his grandfather and JDS patron HD Deve Gowda, issued a stern warning to return to India from abroad and face the law in the obscene video case. “I have already said that he should be given the harshest punishment under the law if found guilty. I also cannot convince people that I was unaware of Prajwal’s activities. I cannot convince them that I have no desire to shield him. I cannot convince them that I am not aware of his movements and that I was not aware of his foreign trip. I believe in answering my conscience. I believe in God, and I know the almighty knows the truth,” the former PM said in a post on X on May 23. “I will ensure that there will be no interference in the enquiry against him from me or my family members,” the former PM added. According to the sources, the Ministry of External Affairs of India has received a letter from the Karnataka government for the cancellation of the diplomatic passport in respect of MP Prajwal Revanna. The request is being processed. Siddaramaiah had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1 and May 23 urging him to take action to cancel the diplomatic passport of the Hassan MP, who is said to have flown to Europe after being accused of sexually exploiting several women. In his letter to the Prime Minister, the Karnataka CM said that it is shameful that Prajwal Revanna fled the country on April 27, 2024, to Germany using his diplomatic passport, shortly after news of his heinous actions emerged and just a few hours before the first FIR was filed against him. Speaking on the Karnataka government’s request for cancellation of Revanna’s diplomatic passport, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) received a request only on May 21 to impound Revanna’s passport Revanna. In an exclusive interview with ANI, Jaishankar clarified the procedural aspects, saying, “To impound a passport is governed by an act called the Passport Act. We need a judicial court or a police request to do so. The MEA got this request from Karnataka only on May 21.” Highlighting the adherence to legal procedures, Jaishankar emphasised that the external affairs minister acted promptly upon receiving the request. “We immediately acted on it. On 23rd of May... we have to follow a certain procedure and the procedure is initiated,” he added. However, Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said that they did not get any written communication from the MEA in this matter",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. The memo, obtained by The Times, said a “key theme” was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign after Mr Sunak surprised Westminster by calling a July 4 General Election. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer, staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.”",

That's when the OnePlus 13 , the Oppo Find X8 , and the Realme GT6 Pro will launch, all sporting 6,000 mAh cells, if this rumor turns out to be accurate. This move might increase each phone's weight, so, as they say, you win some (longevity), you lose some (ease of handling). The Find X8 should become official in October, just after the Snapdragon Summit where Qualcomm is unveiling the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC . Interestingly, some previous rumors have stated that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will require bigger batteries since it's going to be more power-hungry than its predecessor. Its CPU's performance cores are expected to reach 4.2 GHz. So perhaps you won't be gaining any longevity with these handsets after all, but merely not losing any compared to the previous generation.

        "content": "Inter Milan, Juventus, and Roma are all prepared to go head-to-head to sign wantaway Napoli captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo. This according to today’s print edition of Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, via FCInterNews . The newspaper anticipates that the Partenopei would expect a fee of around €25 million for the Italian international. Now it looks clear enough. Di Lorenzo will leave Napoli at the end of the season. Despite the 30-year-old having captained the Campanian team since the start of the 2022-23 season, a rift has formed between he and the club. And that is not something that the parties will be able to overcome. The difficult season that Napoli have had has caused some tensions behind the scenes. And this has prompted Di Lorenzo to seek a move elsewhere. Moreover, Tuttosport report, Di Lorenzo wants a move to a team within Serie A. Whilst there could be interest from other leagues, the 30-year-old’s priority is to stay within the Italian top flight. Inter, Juventus & Roma To Go Head-To-Head For Wantaway Napoli Captain Di Lorenzo And there would be no lack of interest in Di Lorenzo’s signature. First of all, there is Inter. The Nerazzurri have reportedly made contact with the Partenopei captain’s agent. Di Lorenzo would certainly be a tempting option for Inter as a replacement for Denzel Dumfries on the right flank, in the event that they sell the Dutchman rather than extending his contract. Then, Juventus are also eyeing Di Lorenzo up. The Bianconeri could look to bring the Italian international in as a defensive reinforcement for Thiago Motta. Particularly with their own captain Danilo’s contract expiring at the end of next June. And lastly, Tuttosport report, Roma coach Daniele De Rossi has also spoken to Di Lorenzo. He has made clear that the Giallorossi would be interested in signing him now that he’s available. Napoli, for their part, have made the price tag for Di Lorenzo clear. They want no less than €25 million if they are to part ways with their captain.",

        "content": "Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami directed government officials to keep the Chardham Yatra well organized and also said that offline registration should be kept closed till May 31. Dhami said this while reviewing arrangements in Chardham Yatra, Manaskhand Mandir Mala Mission, Kainchi Dham and Purnagiri at the Secretariat on Monday, according to an official statement. The Chief Minister said that the number of devotees in the Chardham Yatra will increase rapidly every year. He said that apart from the carrying capacity of the four Dhams, it is also necessary to assess the carrying capacity of devotees and vehicles at other places on the travel route, it added. The CM directed that proposals related to parking and basic necessities at the Chardham Yatra routes and important places of pilgrimage and tourism in the state should be sent to the Housing Department. A special plan should be made for every year during the peak period of Chardham Yatra. He said that before the start of Rishikesh-Karnprayag rail service, work should be done with a complete action plan to provide parking and other basic facilities on the railway routes and in Karnaprayag and its surrounding areas, as per the statement. The Chief Minister expressed satisfaction over the smooth running of the Chardham Yatra. He directed the officials of the government and administration to keep the Chardham Yatra well organized with the same dedication, it stated. The Chief Minister said that offline registration should be kept closed till May 31. He said that further decision will be taken on offline registration as per the Yatra. The Chief Minister directed the Garhwal and Kumaon Commissioners to work on the route divert plan for the convenience of the devotees in the Chardham Yatra, as per the statement. The statement added that the CM said that the number of devotees is also increasing rapidly in Kainchi Dham and Purnagiri. He directed the officials to keep adequate parking arrangements along with basic facilities in Kainchi Dham. Adequate parking should also be arranged on the routes leading to Kainchi Dham. Shuttle bus service should be started for Kainchi Dham. A bypass is also proposed for Kainchi Dham. The Chief Minister gave instructions to improve the arrangements keeping in mind the convenience of the devotees in Purnagiri. The Chief Minister said that the work should be expedited under the Manaskhand Mandir Mala Mission. In view of the convenience of the devotees, work should be done rapidly on infrastructure and connectivity as well as basic facilities. He said that work should be done to expand homestays and other facilities in Ranikhet and Chaukhutia areas to further strengthen the connectivity of Garhwal and Kumaon and to connect both the divisions with the devotees in terms of tourism and pilgrimage, the statement added. A presentation of ‘Yatra Samadhan’ mobile application was also done to make the Chardham Yatra smooth and better. The main objective of this mobile application is to provide all the facilities to the devotees on a single platform. Through this application, the police station, hospital, parking and other facilities near the four Dhams will be available. Through this mobile application, all the parties related to the Yatra, BKTC, temple administration, hotels, tour operators, transports will be able to connect with each other. The Chief Minister directed the ITDA and Tourism Department to work to further improve this mobile application, it added",

        "content": "Article content Another Saskatchewan Party MLA has announced he will not be running in the upcoming provincial election. Minister of SaskBuilds and Procurement Joe Hargrave will not seek another term with the party. The MLA for Prince Albert Carlton has previously served as minister responsible for SGI, Water Security Agency, as well as SaskEnergy and SaskTel. He was first elected in 2016. “It has been an honour to serve you and to serve with Premier Moe and all my caucus colleagues,” Hargrave said in an emailed statement sent out by the party. He was acclaimed as the candidate for Prince Albert Carlton on Nov. 23, 2023 but has now walked that decision back. “My family and I have given this a lot of consideration and have decided I just can’t commit to another four years as MLA,” he said in the statement. Hargrave marks the 14th sitting Sask. Party MLA that has announced they will not seek re-election. Government caucus is losing several long-serving MLAs including Don Morgan, Donna Harpauer, Dustin Duncan, Gord Wyant and Don McMorris. Two MLAs, Randy Weekes and Terry Dennis, lost their nominations and will not represent their constituencies in the coming election. Two former government caucus MLAs are currently sitting as independents and will not be running again. All told, since the 2020 election that saw 48 Saskatchewan Party MLAs elected, a total of 22 will not be representing the party on the ballot this year. The Sask. Party will nominate a new candidate for Prince Albert Carlton “in the coming weeks,” according to Monday’s statement, which also noted the party currently has 48 candidates nominated for the upcoming election, 28 of which are incumbent MLAs seeking re-election and 20 that are new candidates. Two NDP MLAs are also not seeking re-election — Saskatoon University MLA Jennifer Bowes and MLA for Cumberland Doyle Vermette. A provincial election is set to be held on or before Oct. 28. alsalloum@postmedia.com Share this Story : Joe Hargrave marks 14th Sask.

        "content": "A top Netflix executive thinks Barbie and Oppenheimer would have had the same level of success on Netflix as they did in theatres last year. In an interview with The New York Times , Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos discussed the types of content that the streamer will and won’t produce. Outside of “breaking news and that kind of thing,” which he says isn’t what Netflix’s audience wants, the company is largely open to new endeavours. The New York Times reported then brought up the two movies that dominated the theatre space last year, Barbie and Oppenheimer , and asked Sarandos if those would have been out of the streamer’s “wheelhouse.” In response, Sarandos said both films “would be great for Netflix,” arguing that they “definitely would have enjoyed just as big an audience on Netflix.” He went on to argue that Netflix has no reason to believe that “certain kinds of movies do or don’t work” on its platform. “There’s no reason to believe that the movie itself is better in any size of screen for all people,” he said. “My son’s an editor. He is 28 years old, and he watched Lawrence of Arabia on his phone.” (Why anyone would opt to watch the four-plus-hour Peter O’Toole-led epic on a phone is a mystery.) It’s clear that Sarandos is touting Netflix’s global audience of more than 260 million subscribers, and that certainly isn’t anything to scoff at. But on the flip side, he seems to be ignoring the nuances that helped make Barbie and Oppenheimer , collectively referred to as ‘ Barbenheimer ,’ so massive — namely, that a great deal of luck was involved. Universal had long planned for Oppenheimer to release in the summer, like many previous Christopher Nolan films, leading to a bit of a feud when Warner Bros. picked the same July 21st release date for Barbie . ( Some have even speculated this was Warner Bros. getting revenge against Nolan after their long-running partnership came to an end with Tenet .) However, what was seemingly once a bitter rivalry inadvertently ended up benefiting both parties, as the internet became obsessed with the amusing contradictory pairing of a colourful film about a sentient plastic doll and a harrowing drama chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb. This led scores of people to go see both movies. Barbie ended up grossing $1.44 billion USD (about $1.97 billion CAD), while Oppenheimer made $976 million USD (about $1.33 billion CAD) and took home Best Picture at the Oscars. While many people would have no doubt streamed Barbie and Oppenheimer had they gone straight to Netflix, it seems unlikely that they would have had anywhere near the same cultural impact. (Comparatively, a quick look at Netflix’s biggest hits to date shows quite a few forgettable titles. ) That’s to say nothing of the immense box office success of Barbie and Oppenheimer , which would have been cannibalized had they been Netflix-only releases. But above all else, I’m really just wondering why Sarandos’ son would opt to watch the four-plus-hour 1962 Peter O’Toole epic Lawrence of Arabia on his phone. Let’s just hope David Lynch doesn’t find out about that . Image credit: Warner Bros./Universal Source: The New York Times",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "News | Politics I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . Rishi Sunak insisted he took responsibility for the Conservatives’ election campaign after a leaked memo criticised MPs and ministers over a lack of effort. Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days Rishi Sunak The memo, obtained by The Times, said a “key theme” was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign after Mr Sunak surprised Westminster by calling a July 4 General Election. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer , staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. Election campaign day five: Bank Holiday bother for Rishi Sunak MP Lucy Allan quits Tories to back Reform UK candidate Tory MP Lucy Allan suspended for endorsing Reform UK candidate Why San Diego should be the start of your California road trip “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.” Create a FREE account to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.

        "content": "Home | Karimnagar | Ev Charging Stations Remain Elusive For Karimnagar EV charging stations remain elusive for Karimnagar Despite repeated reminders from officials, the firms which got the permission to install the charging stations have not started the works. By Raghu Paithari Published Date - 27 May 2024, 10:42 PM Karimnagar: The setting up of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations in the district is dragging on, with the process yet to start. Despite repeated reminders from officials, the firms which got the permission to install the charging stations have not started the works. It is said that the firms are reluctant citing the small number of EVs in the district. In order to establish EV charging stations in Karimnagar town, the Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation Limited (TSREDCO) had invited applications from different firms for 10 locations. A few firms submitted Expressions of Interest, after which REDCO gave permission for four firms to install the charging stations in ten locations. While P Ramachary firm got the permission to install stations in five locations, Sri Ganesh Service got three. Both Joel Point Private Limited and Bhavani Engineering Agency got one each. Though the installation as well as operation of the charging stations should have been commenced within three months, the process of setting up the stations has not been started even five months after the agreements were signed, according to sources. One firm, which started work near the civil hospital, has also stopped the work. It requires about Rs.20 lakh for the installation of a charging station. So firm owners are of the opinion that they will not get benefits if they do not get adequate vehicles, REDCO officials said. The accurate figure of electric vehicles in the district is not available since RTA authorities are not registering all types of charging vehicles. RTA authorities are not registering electric bikes with top speeds under 60 kmph. Approximately, there are 20,000 two wheelers, 1,000 autorickshaws and 500 EV cars in the erstwhile Karimnagar district. Speaking to Telangana Today, REDCO district manager, V Paramachary informed that when the firms were contacted last week, they had assured to start works in May but that did not happen. Since the firms were not responding, they have decided to serve notices to the firms, he said.

        "content": "With the smell of bratwurst floating through the air, Germany kicked off its Euro 2024 training camp under blue skies in front of 15,000 fans in the central town of Jena. Germany are based in Thuringia, part of the former East, for its pre-Euros training camp. England will be based at the same venue during the tournament itself, while Germany will head south to Herzogenaurach -- the small Bavarian village where clothing giant Adidas is headquartered. “It gives the team a great feeling that the country is behind us and everyone supports us,” coach Julian Nagelsmann said on Monday. After disappointing group-stage exits at the last two World Cups and a last-16 elimination by England at the most recent Euros, Germany’s wins over France and the Netherlands in March have boosted optimism ahead of the home tournament. Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann speaks to his players during training.| Photo Credit:KARINA HESSLAND/ REUTERS Germany sporting director Rudi Voeller said the hosts were “burning hot” for the tournament. “It’s a great opportunity to show ourselves and be approachable. That’s very important.” Tickets to the training session sold out in minutes. “We would have liked to go to an even bigger stadium. The demand was unbelievable,” Voeller said Monday. More than 16,000 people watched a livestream of the training session online. Three weeks out from the tournament opener against Scotland in Munich, Germany’s training camp started with several members of the squad missing due to club duties, with only 19 of the 27 squad members available. The injured Leroy Sane, Jamal Musiala, Aleksandar Pavlovic and David Raum did not take part in the full session. The players stayed afterwards and signed autographs while posing for pictures with fans. Four players will take part in Saturday’s Champions League final at Wembley -- Real Madrid’s Toni Kroos and Antonio Ruediger as well as Borussia Dortmund’s Nico Schlotterbeck and Niclas Fuellkrug. Bayer Leverkusen players Robert Andrich, Florian Wirtz and Jonathan Tah, who on Sunday celebrated winning the league and cup double for the first time, will arrive Wednesday. Captain Ilkay Gundogan and Marc-Andre ter Stegen of Barcelona will also arrive later in the week. Manuel Neuer also missed Monday’s session with a stomach bug. Nagelsmann called up youngsters Brajan Gruda, 19, and Rocco Reitz, 21, to “help out” the depleted squad during the camp, but they are not expected to be included for the tournament.

        "description": "Promises to waive off farm loans have been issued by most political parties during this Lok Sabha election. Here’s a look at how these waivers are implemented, the effect on farmers and governments and what alternatives exist",
        "content": "As the Lok Sabha seats in India’s largest farming belt — Haryana and Uttar Pradesh — go to the polls, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi has once again promised to waive off farmer debts if the Congress-led coalition is voted to power. The last pan-India farm loan waiver was done by the UPA government in 2008 in the form of a ₹60,000 crore economic package. Incidentally, the waiver came a year ahead of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, in which the UPA was re-elected with a bigger majority. Addressing an election rally in Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri on May 22, Mr. Gandhi promised to waive farmers’ debt and guarantee them Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops. Claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi felt farm loan waivers would “spoil the farmers,” he vowed, “We are going to ‘spoil the farmers’ when we return to power and waive their debts not just once but again and again....We will form a commission and every time farmers need a debt waiver, the panel would let us know and we will do that.” Congress’ Paanch Nyay gurantees The Congress has released five sets of ‘guarantees ’ in which it promises farmers a Standing Loan Waiver Commission to systematically evaluate and recommend debt waivers, apart from the immediate loan waiver which Mr. Gandhi has promised. Farmers, who have been protesting in various States (especially at Delhi’s borders) since February, have been asking for an immediate farm loan waiver and legal guarantee for MSP for all crops procured by the Centre. As of 2022, outstanding agricultural debt stood at ₹18.5 lakh crores. How do farm loan waivers work? Scheduled banks offer loans to individual farmers or group of farmers for agricultural or allied activities such as dairy, fishery, animal husbandry, poultry, bee-keeping and sericulture. Short-term (up to 18 months) loans are offered for raising crops during two seasons – Kharif and Rabi, while medium (more than 18 months up to 5 years) and long-term (beyond 5 years) loans are offered for purchasing agricultural machinery, irrigation and other developmental activities. Loans are also available for pre-harvest and post-harvest activities such as weeding, harvesting, sorting, and transporting farm produce. Most loans have a repayment period in installments up to five years and interest rates vary depending on the nature of loans and the issuing banks. A good harvest bodes well for both the farmers and the banks as installments get paid on time. However, in case of a poor monsoon or natural calamities, farmers may be unable to repay loans on time. As seasons go by, the loans get compounded, adding to the distress of farmers, coupled with crop loss and other damages. In such situations, the Centre or State government steps in, offering a waiver of penal interest or loan interest, rescheduling loans or a full waiver of outstanding farm loans. The liability of repayment to the banks is transferred to the government. Loan waivers are usually selective, explains Businessline . It depends on loan types (small, medium or long-term), the categories of farmers or loan sources. The waivers are introduced via a new scheme by the government, making a budgetary allowance for absorbing the debts. Why do farmers need a waiver now? “Farmers are indebted hence they are asking for waivers. We have seen protests due to it and it is during elections when everyone makes their claims,” says Dr. Dipa Sinha, Assistant Professor, School of Liberal Studies at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University Delhi. Speaking to The Hindu about farmer distress at large, she adds, “Farm distress is due to many reasons and farmers have made other demands too, like the legal guarantee for MSP.” Image for representation| Photo Credit:AKHILESH KUMAR Farmers are plagued by larger issues like disputed land holdings, low ground-water reserves, bad soil quality, rising costs of farming inputs (seeds, fertilizers, water, fuel, electricity) and low crop productivity. Due to a lack of assured remuneration for harvest, farmers are forced to borrow funds to tide through expenses, Businessline explains. The lenders are not always banks, as several small farmers do not have access to credit, leading to a dependence on private lenders (land owners or rich farmers), who levy exorbitant interest rates on such loans. This is why these indebted farmers depend on such loan waivers. “Waiver is not the long-term solution to indebtedness. It is about the larger reforms in agriculture so that farmers don’t end up in the situation that they need a waiver. If you don’t do that (reform) and farmers end up in such a situation, then you are forced to bail them out also,” explains Dr. Sinha. Terming such waivers as inevitable, Dr. Sinha draws a parallel, “If you have a fever, you have to give paracetamol (medicine). You cannot avoid it. However, you should take necessary steps, so that you don’t get the fever again.” When were farm loans last waived? Despite repeated demands from farmers for a pan-India loan waiver, the Modi government has refused to budge, often passing the buck to State governments. According to a study by State Bank of India (SBI), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana implemented a loan waiver in 2014, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra in 2017, Karnataka, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in 2018 and lastly, Jharkhand and Maharashtra again in 2020. The total amount of debt waived off over these ten instances is ₹2.52 lakh crores. Apart from these, one of the largest loan waivers in Tamil Nadu was announced by the AIADMK government in February 2021. Announcing a ₹12,110 crore-scheme ahead of the State elections in April that year, CM E Palaniswami said outstanding short-term crop loans of all farmers will be waived off. In 2016, the AIADMK government had written off loans for around 12.02 lakh small and marginal farmers, owning land up to 5 acres, to the tune of about ₹5,320 crores. The first pan-India loan waiver was done in the 1990-91 Budget when the V.P. Singh-led National Front Government was in power. Introducing the Agricultural and Rural Debt Relief Scheme (ARDRS), then-Finance Minister Madhu Dandavate stated that the National Front government would provide relief to farmers up to ₹10,000 on select loans. As on October 2, 1989, the loans availed by farmers from cooperative banks and regional rural banks were eligible for relief under the ARDRS scheme, which was allotted ₹1000 crores. The scheme came to a close on March 31, 1991 and was not renewed.

Subramanium The second such instance of a pan-India loan waiver was announced by then-Finance Minister P Chidambaram during his 2008-09 Budget Speech. Under the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme (ADWDRS), 2008, short-term and investment loans disbursed to marginal, small and other farmers by scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks, cooperative credit institutions and local area banks up to March 31, 2007 and overdue as on December 31, 2007, and remaining unpaid until February 29, 2008 were eligible for relief or waiver. With an allocation of ₹60,000 crores, the entire ‘eligible amount’ was waived off for marginal and small farmers i.e. (< 2 hectares of land). In case of ‘other farmers’ (> 2 hectares of land), a one-time settlement (OTS) of 25% of the eligible amount was offered as a rebate, if the farmer pays the remaining 75% of the balance. The rebate would be 25% of the loan amount or ₹25,000, whichever was higher, subject to the balance payment condition. The OTS relief was estimated to cost Rs 10,000 to the Centre, while debt waiver was pegged at ₹52,000 crores. What are effects of such waivers? According to a NABARD repor t, the 1990 ARDR scheme cost the Central government ₹7825 crores. States were forced to take additional loans from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cover their share of the loan waivers and 3.2 crore farmers (53% of the borrowers) were beneficiaries of the scheme. This totalled to one-third of the outstanding farm loans, which were wiped off. Similarly, the 2008 ADWDR scheme cost the government ₹52,000 crores and over 2.9 crore farmers benefitted from the scheme. However, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report concluded that the scheme had favoured several ineligible farmers and a large number of deserving small and marginal farmers were left out during its implementation. The CAG report found that no records were maintained of farmers’ applications accepted or rejected by lending institutions, or how many fresh loans were issued due to debt waiver/relief. A NABARD study on the impact of farm loan waivers from 1987 to 2020, found that farm loan waivers were announced without any development agendas or ideologies (be it a right-wing or left-wing government), and no link between waivers and drought intensities. Till 2016, waivers were found to be announced by s=State governments who could fiscally afford it. After 2016, high fiscal debt did not deter such announcements, while the timings of such announcements were found to be crucial. Any such announcements closer to elections reaped greater gains for the party in power. Of the 21 State governments which announced waivers close to State polls, only four lost. Farm loan waivers between 2014 and 2022 A more recent SBI study (2022) found that only half of the beneficiaries of the nine farm loan waivers announced by State governments since 2014 have actually received write-offs. Maharashtra, which announced two waivers in 2017 and 2020, ensured that 68% and 91% of the beneficiaries received write-offs. The poorest implementation was by Telangana in 2014, where only 5% of 51 lakh farmers eligible for write-offs received it. States like Madhya Pradesh (12%), Jharkhand (13%), and Punjab (24%) see lower rates of implementation, while States like Chhattisgarh (100%) and Andhra Pradesh (92%) haveeffectively implemented such waivers. The study concludes, “Despite much hype and political patronage, farm loan waivers by States have failed to bring respite to intended subjects, sabotaging credit discipline in select geographies and making banks and financial institutions wary of further lending,” terming such waivers a ‘self-goal.’ What are other alternatives? “Agriculture is a sector where markets won’t work and it is hugely subsidised and supported by governments across the world. It is not just about direct subsidies to the farmers but also about creating the larger infrastructure to make agriculture more viable. This needs a number of steps to be taken, like irrigation, electricity, access to seeds, fertilisers, research in agriculture, and extension services,” says Dr. Sinha. Recommending more public investment in agriculture, she adds, “If you look at the investment in agriculture as a proportion of total expenditure or GDP, it has been falling per year. Whichever party comes to power needs to have a long-term policy for agriculture.” When asked if the now-repealed farm laws were a solution to India’s agrarian crisis, she replied in the negative. “Those farm laws were reducing the support of the government even more.” Amritsar: Workers scatter wheat for drying after heavy rains in the city, at a grain market in Amritsar, Friday, April 23, 2021.| Photo Credit:- One of the biggest farming States in the nation is Punjab, which is facing severe depletion of ground water reserves and degradation of soil due to overuse of urea. The State’s farmers have largely stuck to growing wheat and rice, even as farmers in neighbouring Haryana have switched to oilseeds. Speaking about this vicious cycle plaguing Punjab, Dr. Sinha says, “Farmers are businessmen like any other. It is not (due to an) affinity to wheat and rice that they are growing it. In Punjab these are the only two crops which are viable because the government procures it. If they incentivize mustard or pulses, farmers will make the shift. They made the (initial) shift to wheat and rice through policy – via the Green revolution.” While it has promised several schemes to boost farm income, the Modi government has not promised any farm loan waivers if elected for a third time. Meanwhile, farmers continue to protest being caught in debt traps.

        "content": "The High Court has granted Mombasa Governor Abdulswamad Nassir, Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung'aro, and Taita Taveta Governor Andrew Mwadime three days to respond to a case challenging their order to ban muguka. In a brief ruling, Justice Olga Sewe of the Mombasa High Court issued the directive to the three county chiefs after certifying as urgent the lawsuit by two activists seeking to stop the further implementation of the muguka ban in Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties. She found the case by two activists, Peter Agoro and Michael Makarina, challenging the ban on muguka to be urgent and needing to be heard expeditiously, and scheduled it for Friday, May 31, 2024. \"Upon considering the application dated May 27, 2024, together with its supporting affidavit and the documents annexed thereto, it is hereby ordered that the application is certified urgent and the application to be served forthwith,\" Justice Sewe ordered. The court directives come hours after the two activist petitioners moved to court challenging the recent executive order to ban the sale, supply, and consumption of muguka by Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta Counties. The petitioners contend that the three county chiefs' order to ban muguka is illegal and unconstitutional. \"We also seek an injunction order to be issued restraining the effect and/or implementation of the Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties Executive Order 1 of 2014,\" Agoro and Makarina seek. In their court papers, the two activists also fault the three county bosses for failure to conduct public participation before banning muguka. The petitioners cited the law protecting the sale and distribution of miraa as a cash crop in the country, saying muguka could not be isolated from miraa since they are both from the parent plant, khat. They argue that according to Kenyan laws, only Parliament through the National Assembly and Senate can declare a substance narcotic or psychotropic through legislation. \"National Agency for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NACADA) has not declared muguka a narcotic nor banned it. The Crop (Miraa) Regulations 2021 recognize both miraa and muguka as legitimate crops in Kenya,\" the duo states in their court papers. According to Agoro and Makarina, the mandate of banning a product or service protected through an act of parliament is the sole power of the national government. The two petitioners argue that the ban on muguka by the three counties is unconstitutional, illegal, and unlawful as it underscores the complex interplay between public health concerns and economic dependencies in Kenya. \"Despite Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties having legitimate constitutional mandates to guarantee the safety of their citizens, they ought to have taken the legal procedures before undertaking the ban,\" the petitioners state. The petitioners also seek several reliefs, including a declaration that the Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties' Executive Order 1 of 2024 is illegal, irregular, unconstitutional, null, and void.",

        "content": "Worshipping false idols is a sin when it comes to Power Rankings and the Cronulla bubble burst in spectacular fashion at Penrith in Round 12. The Panthers are now back on top of these ranks even if the Sharks still hold a slight edge on the actual premiership ladder. Take your time, Nathan Cleary. The three-time premiers have the rare luxury of being able to give the game’s best player another week or two once his hamstring has healed to be back in time for the final couple of months of the regular season before their shot at history – a fourpeat, is that a thing? The Connect Four? An Awesome Foursome? And there’s also a change at the bottom with South Sydney rising to the dizzying heights of 15th on the back of their victory over Parramatta. More League We now move into the trickiest part of the season – the seven-week stretch when State of Origin tears the competition asunder. Top teams can come back to the pack as the rep workload takes effect while the struggling side can make a run if they jag an upset or two but also consign themselves to a miserable existence in the second half of the season if they can’t get going over this stretch. Team by team, here’s how the Power Rankings stack up after Round 12. 1 Panthers (last week 2): If they can knock off the first-placed team by 42 with Nathan Cleary out and Liam Martin only playing half the match, imagine how they’ll go at full strength. Tigers fans should be happy with what they saw from Jarome Luai on Saturday night in the demolition of the Sharks with the five-eighth starring as the chief playmaker. 2 Sharks (1): There were some big danger signs from this loss, not just the 42-0 scoreline. Cronulla averaged a fraction over 30 metres for each set, nearly 12 less than Penrith, and could not come up with a circuit-breaker to reverse the possession imbalance, finishing with a paltry 39% of the ball. Nicho Hynes’ calf complaint was a contributing factor to their lacklustre display but their concerns are much deeper than a simple muscle strain to their star halfback. (Photo by Mark Nolan/Getty Images) 3 Roosters (5): Their attack is humming with Canberra’s line broken eight times on Saturday on both edges of the ruck. They’ve scored 30 points in five straight matches, including their one loss to Cronulla during that stretch in Magic Round. All their back five ran for at least 100 metres in dominating the Green Machine while they also had just as many forwards topping that benchmark. 4 Broncos (3): The warning signs have been there in the lead-up to Sunday’s shocker against the Gold Coast. Brisbane have been flat for the past month despite racking up wins over Parramatta and Manly after copping a hammering from the Roosters. With two byes in the next four rounds, the Origin toll will not be too dramatic for them in the short term. 5 Storm (4): They were unusually flat at Brookvale on Friday night and by the time they got into their groove, they were playing from behind. With Cameron Munster and Ryan Papenhuyzen sidelined, perhaps Nick Meaney might be a better option at five-eighth to take some of the playmaking burden off Jahrome Hughes as Tyran Wishart and Sua Fa’alogo are more of a running threat. 6 Dolphins (6): It is to be expected that a team that continually over-exceeds expectations will fail to hit the mark on occasions. These Dolphins aren’t swimming with the big fish yet and they are still without a few key players so Wayne Bennett won’t be panicking in any way shape or form after their slip-up on Sunday in Auckland. (Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images) 7 Sea Eagles (8): After three straight losses, Friday’s upset at home to knock over Melbourne was just what the doctor ordered, particularly after reports emerged about Anthony Seibold getting shirty with the club over contract extension negotiations. Great to see in this age of players holding picnics on the field after matches that some grudges still exist with Nathan Brown having a running battle with Shawn Blore after they went toe to toe four long years ago when they were both playing for different teams. 8 Raiders (7): They lack the class to beat the top-four sides but they have the grit to grind their way past anyone else. Young halves Ethan Strange and Kaeo Weekes were targeted in defence but held their own, especially compared to some more-experienced teammates with Elliott Whitehead coming up with nine misses, Hudson Young seven and Jordan Rapana six. 9 Warriors (10): If you didn’t know any better, you’d be forgiven for thinking Addin Fonua-Blake was trying to get an early release from his Warriors deal to join Cronulla like he did when he was at the Sea Eagles to join his current club. He failed to front for the team song and coach’s post-game address after a win over the premiers because he supposedly needed to “step back and reflect on his own” after not being happy with his performance. Riiiiiiiiight. Well done to the Warriors on dropping him for Sunday’s boilover win over the Dolphins when the easy option for the injury-hit team would be to fine him or brush it under the carpet. 10 Knights (9): Coming off the bye, they have Canterbury this Friday then Penrith and Melbourne before their next week off. If ever there’s a good time to come up against those teams, it’s during Origin season so seventh-placed Newcastle have a glimmer of hope to make a significant move up the ladder over the next month. 11 Bulldogs (11): They are a frustrating side in that they can play without much imagination for 40 minutes and then produce plenty of attacking potency as they did in the second half against the Dragons. With so many new faces it was always going to take time for Cameron Ciraldo to get cohesion in their combinations and if they stay injury free, they could be big improvers in the second half of the season. 12 Cowboys (13): Todd Payten’s team has now completed the most uninspiring back-to-back wins of recent memory after sneaking past Souths and conceding 28 points while scoring 42 in a glorified leaguetag tussle with the Tigers. They will be hard hit during Origin but are in no place to absorb a few extra losses after going 6-6 to start the season. 13 Titans (15): They get a well-earned uptick for not giving two hoots about reputations against the Broncos in Brisbane on Sunday even though they were given little chance of causing an upset by anyone outside their immediate family members. Des Hasler needs to keep putting faith in younger players that he thinks could be part of the future like Tom Weaver and Keano Kini, and start to snip off some of the ageing deadwood that is withering on this roster. 14 Dragons (12): Shane Flanagan was caught short with four forwards on the bench when Jack Bird hurt his ankle and was being disingenuous when he claimed that it was hard for coaches to have a utility back in their interchange list because it increases the burden on the pack. Even with Bird missing the second half and Hame Sele only lasting 14 minutes, Raymond Faitala-Mariner (20) and Fa’amanu Brown (21) received limited game time as Flanagan persisted with Tom Eisenhuth defending out wide while not getting a breather. (Photo by Jason McCawley/Getty Images) 16 Rabbitohs (17): With Latrell Mitchell back, Cody Walker likely to return soon and Cameron Murray not too far away, all is not lost for Souths. Keaon Koloamatangi bagged two tries in the 16-point win over Parra and the more that interim coach Ben Hornby can get him set up with space or running at weak links in opposition defensive lines, the better for the Bunnies. 16 Eels (14): The swift removal of Brad Arthur was no surprise given the team’s indifferent form but it’s going to be extremely tough for this team to make the finals even if Mitchell Moses and Clint Gutherson are back in the next week or two. It’s only the prospect of the Eels possibly reversing their form with a couple of their big guns returning that saves them from the bottom of the rankings. 17 Wests (16): That’s eight straight defeats for the Tigers and more upheaval off the field with Isaiah Papali’i sprinting out the door at season’s end to Penrith with Brent Naden and Jayden Sullivan also being pointed towards the exit. David Klemmer should be on the list of Tigers being nudged straight outta Concord – his latest three-game ban continues a trend of the veteran prop leaving his team in the lurch while giving little value for money when he’s on the field.",

        "content": "Countless people dream of the day when an expected series of fortunate events will lead to a moment of brilliant luck and happiness. Tierra Barley, a Henrico County resident in , experienced a series of extremely fortunate events that resulted in her five-figure . While many people will use significant numbers such as birthdays or anniversaries when playing the lottery, Tierra simply she told the Virginia Lottery. Her luck took an incredible turn on May 8, when five of those numbers matched the day's drawing, winning her an incredible $50,000. But just before the drawing, Tierra almost had a turn of bad luck as she almost lost her ticket. After buying her ticket at Varina Superstore Supermarket on Darbytown Road in Henrico, she accidentally left it in the store while she went to take her daughter to the park. When she returned in search of her ticket, Tierra found someone else buying Powerball tickets, and they turned out to be very helpful in returning her ticket. She chose to use the numbers she found inside a fortune cookie and matched four of the five numbers and the Powerball. The numbers were 7-41-43-44-51 with a Powerball number 5, confirmed Virginia lottery. Another lucky lottery winner decided to pick up a ticket along with his chicken at the grocery store on his way home from work - a move that would see him ultimately winning $500,000. Russell Gomes, of South Boston, had just finished work when he stopped at the Food Lion on Halifax Road to buy some chicken. He decided to try his luck and buy a Magnificent 7s lottery ticket, scratching it off in the parking lot to reveal the $500,000 top prize. Speaking to lottery officials Mr Gomes said: \"I really didn't believe it. It feels great!\" Powerball is an American lottery game offered in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and overseen by the Multi-State Lottery Association. The odds of winning a Powerball are 1 in 25 and the prize money can go up to $120 million. The famous lottery system was launched in 1987 after the localites voted to start a state-operated lottery game. Since its inception, the Virginia lottery has supported K-12 public education in a commonwealth, the website confirms. Moreover, in 2023, it amounted to more than $867 million that went to public education in the state. The funds are about 10% of the commonwealth's budget for K-12 schools distributed throughout Virginia's counties.",

        "content": "a hallmark of India's rich cultural heritage, is experiencing a resurgence in the contemporary fashion landscape. Known for its intricate Jadau involves embedding precious stones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds into softened gold, creating exquisite pieces that exude opulence and tradition. This resurgence can be traced back to Bollywood’s influence, particularly through films like where Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s regal adornments captivated audiences, reigniting interest in traditional . Bachchan's wedding further cemented Jadau’s status as a timeless bridal choice, inspiring many to embrace its grandeur. Renowned filmmaker has significantly contributed to this revival. His collaborations with Shri Paramani Jewels for movies like and now the web series have showcased the beauty of Jadau on an epic scale, with meticulously crafted pieces that highlight the intricate artistry involved. Actor Aditi Rao Hydari, playing the role of courtesan Bibbojaan, epitomises the still-existing opulence of the British Raj era. During the movie promotions, Rao Hydari was seen in a multi-coloured floral anarkali paired with meticulously crafted Jadau earrings by designer Neety Singh. The art of jadau is not just a relic of the past but a vibrant part of Influencers and brides alike are blending these traditional pieces with contemporary styles, creating a fusion that celebrates both heritage and innovation. As Jadau jewellery continues to grace red carpets and , its enduring elegance promises to captivate generations to come. The prized craft of holds a special place in our ethnic wardrobes. An uncut diamond piece is considered a prized possession in any Indian , and is often lovingly passed down through generations as an heirloom. New Delhi-based Hazoorilal Legacy, one of the oldest jewellery houses in the country today, is known for experimenting with traditional jadau designs to serve the modern connoisseur. spoke to Rohan Narang, managing director, Hazoorilal Legacy to get a microscopic view at all that goes into the making of this craft. Excerpts below. Jadau work was introduced in India by the Mughals, but practiced and perfected by the skilled craftsman of , which to date is considered as the hub of jadau jewellery. It is essentially a technique of jewellery-making wherein precious gemstones such as uncut diamonds, pearls, and rubies are embedded into gold. Gold is actually turned into a frame on which precious stones are studded without the use of any adhesive. Jadau derives its name from the colloquial term ‘jad’ (which means to embed), and is commonly used in , and meenakari jewellery. The design of the jewellery is made by [a group of artisans called the] Chiterias, followed by engraving and spacing using pliable gold, which is done by Ghaarias. Once the stones are naturally set in the gold casing, the enameller decorates the back of the jewellery in meenakari work. The time to produce jadau varies, depending upon the piece that is being . It’s a tedious process requiring utmost care and finesse. So while a smaller piece can be finished in a couple of days, an elaborate piece can actually take up to a few months to be ready. It’s one of the of and has an interesting history behind it. The Mughals introduced it to India, but this workmanship was perfected and made native by the artisans of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It requires a skilled and unique craftsmanship, which of course, makes it very compelling. The traditional form of jewellery is made without any interference of technology, which increases the man hours [it takes to create it], and makes it extremely valuable. It’s pure hand work. If you ask me, it is surely a reminder of the rich cultural heritage of our country. Before investing in a , one should always check the purity of the gold being used. The jadau workmanship is usually done in 22-24k gold. The casing in which the stones are embedded should not be less than 22k gold. Another important point is to check if the stones are treated or natural. One should also be aware of the various treatments that are used to enhance the look of uncut diamonds and other precious and semi-precious in jadau jewellery. It’s very delicate and needs to be handled with utmost care. The should be kept neatly wrapped in padded cloth box or an airtight container to minimise any kind of exposure to moisture and other pollutants. This helps to protect the look and feel of the jewellery. It should be the last thing you should wear when you’re getting ready, as perfumes and hairsprays can corrode the , and it should also be the very first thing you take off.",

        "content": "When the first (erroneous) reports emerged regarding #Deflategate, my wife and I had a conversation about it, which went something like this. Wife: “What’s the issue?” Me: “They say someone took air out of footballs.” Wife: “Why would they do that?” Me: “To make it easier to grip.” Wife: “What’s the benefit of it?” Me: “Makes it easier to throw.” Wife: “Shouldn’t the NFL want that?” Nine years later, that simple, first-impression logic remains undeniable. The rule requiring footballs to be inflated between 12.5 and 13.5 psi was the ultimate “it was like that when I got here” rule. No one knew where it came from, why it was, or how the numbers were picked. Former Eagles center Jason Kelce recently pointed out the stupidity of the rule and the enforcement of it against the Patriots and Tom Brady, in an episode of the podcast. “ ,” Jason Kelce said, . “I’m pro-deflating footballs. I’ll say it. I’ll say it. I am pro-deflating footballs. . . . He outsmarted people. Why the fuck does it matter how much air is in that mutherfucker? If you’re throwing it and catching it, who the fuck cares? “We’re all mad because he had the common sense to fucking take a little air out so the receivers could catch the fucking thing? Why is that against the rules? You all could have taken the air out, too. You guys could have taken the air out, too. You just weren’t smart enough. So why am I getting penalized because you’re fucking dummies? It’s a rule, but it’s a stupid rule, though.” Amen to all of that. It is a stupid rule, and it was an even stupider investigation. Bungled from the outset, with the conclusion predetermined and the challenge becoming working backward to prove it. The thinking was that some in the league thought the Patriots didn’t get punished enough for the original Spygate controversy, and that this was a way to supplement their sanctions. It didn’t help that Brady destroyed his phone. It didn’t help that it seemed there was indeed a deliberate plan in place to secretly “take the top off” the balls. But it also didn’t help the league that the numbers were sloppily harvested and not inconsistent with atmospheric conditions, making the proper outcome inconclusive at best for cheating. The best evidence of that came from the 2015 epilogue. As explained in (the hardcover is ), the league began conducting random checks of air pressure at halftime of games. The numbers were kept under lock and key. And , apparently because they showed that the numbers from the 2014 AFC Championship did not suggest cheating with the clarity the NFL believed. Regardless of whether the investigation was handled poorly with a destination already determined, the rule itself was and is stupid. If the offense wants the ball to be lower than 12.5, so be it.

        "content": "No matter how often an owner explains to their dog that they can't eat a certain item, it only makes a canine want something more. As the saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder. For one , his heart grows for cookies. Who can blame him? But, of course, dogs cannot have cookies since these desserts often include toxic ingredients to dogs such as chocolate, raisins, nutmeg or macadamia nuts. Cookies are also high in sugar, butter, and flour, and while not toxic, these ingredients are harmful to dogs and can lead to obesity. Despite how harmful can be, this dog still tries sneaking one past his owner in a May 16 . He thought he was being sly, showing his owner innocent eyes, and distracting her with . She wasn't born yesterday and he was caught red-pawed. The text on the video reads: \"Life with a Lab.\" This dog truly thought he could sneak one past his owner by staying calm under pressure as she started badgering him with questions and demanding he open his mouth. He kept moving his head to avoid his owner prying his mouth open, but it was not enough. The owner managed to maneuver his mouth and reveal he did indeed steal a cookie. Defeated, he finally gave in. He let her win this time. But the owner knows there will be plenty more battles to come as this isn't the first time he tried getting into items he shouldn't. The owner told via TikTok, that he tries to steal items often and that shoes are his personal favorite. The video quickly reached viral status, bringing over 6.6 million views, 508,200 likes, and 2,090 comments. \"He just wanted a little sweet treat,\" defended a viewer. Another pointed out: \"Distraction paw shake.\" somehow always think doing a trick will make owners forget what they've done. One TikTok user wrote: \"He said, 'Chocy lab get chocy cookie. Duh.'\" Others were cracking up that this dog showed so much restraint. \"I'm impressed it was still in his mouth. My lab gets a hold of food, it is gone IMMEDIATELY,\" said another.

        "content": "The Attorney general of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi has advocated for the scrapping of State Independent Electoral commissions. Fagbemi made the call on Monday at the National Discourse on Nigeria’s Security Challenges and good governance at the local government level held in Abuja. According to Fagbemi, inspite of the constitutional provisions that were meant to safeguard local governments’ autonomy, there have been cases of arbitrary dissolution, abolition or fragmentation of local governments by the higher tiers of government, particularly the state governments. The Minister contended that the provision of the constitution under section 162 (5-8) on State Joint Local Government Account, which empowered the state Assemblies to decide the revenue to their local government facilitated state encroachment on local revenues. “Cases of state hijacking of local government revenues abound from 1999 to date In consequence of these weak constitutional provisions, the lifespan of the local government councils is at the mercy of the state governments. “There is no consistent pattern of local government elections. Some State Governors dissolved their Councils and appoint Caretaker Committees. There are several cases of abuse of the Joint Account by different state governments across Nigeria. “This has undermined the financial autonomy of the local government, as well as their ability to deliver on their statutory responsibilities On the fourth point relating to observed problems/challenges in the way we are implementing the constitutional/legal provisions and what those problems are:Under a true federal structure, the autonomy of local government is adequately guaranteed.” Fagbemi further explained that one of the persisting challenges of Nigeria’s federalism is the persistent failure to grant autonomy to local government as the third tier of government. Read also: Keyamo declares Nigeria Air project fraudulent, says it remains suspended “Although, the LGAs as the third tier of government in Nigeria and as enshrined in the constitution is ostensibly meant to serve as are an institutional framework for effective service delivery to the grassroots and the overall national development; however, LGAs in Nigeria have been performing poorly in provision of essential services to the people due to absence of autonomy. “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria did not provide adequately for the political autonomy of the local governments. The resultant effects of these inadequacies are that the state governments have the discretion to determine the nature, content and direction of local government elections and political activities. “The failure of the constitution to articulate a clear line of authorities to both the state and local authorities and the continuing debate over the involvement of state governments in distributing local government allocation from the Federation Account has affected the capacity of LGAs to provide essential services at the grassroots.Rather than function as a tier of government, LGAs have been operating as an appendage of the State governments in Nigeria. “The constitutional provisions on State Joint Local Government Account (section 162 (5-8)) have placed the local government councils in a political bondage.Politically, due to the flaws in the electoral process in the country, what is obtained is a virtual selection and not election of local government functionaries. “Local government chairmen are always imposed on the people by the State Governors. This erodes the three elements of good governance at the local government level, which are citizens’ participation, transparency and accountability. The imposed chairman will be accountable only to the Governor rather than the people. This results in lack of transparency and non-involvement of the citizens. “High level and rampant corruption.The absence of administrative and fiscal autonomy to LGAs created a dependency situation than independent one conceptualized under a true federal system of Govt. The local governments in many instances have continued to suffer fiscal emasculation in the hands of state governments. In all these unwholesome abuses, Sections 7 and 162 of the 1999 Constitution among others have been an escape route for many State Governments to manipulate the Local government and reduce same to a mere department in the Governors’ office. “State joint local government account (SJLGA) has been the anti-development instrument used to frustrate every progressive and patriotic action to make the Local Government work since the return of the Country to democracy in 1999.And finally, what are the solutions/recommendations to the observed problems/challenges: LGAs are created by the Constitution. ”Accordingly, in a tiered system like ours, constitutional amendment is imperative before a new system of local government administration can be instituted.Good governance at any level of governance is not possible without the transfer of authority, responsibilities, capacity and resources. “This is even more so for the LGAs.Accordingly, constitutional reforms should, among other things, aim to: increase fiscal and administrative autonomy of Local Govt system to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency; fiscal autonomy should be balanced with fiscal restraint by strengthening the internal controls system, processes and infrastructure for public financial management;ensure inclusiveness and citizens participation in the governance of LGAs.allow the legislative arms of local governments to decide what they should do with revenue accruing to them;need to capacitate LGAs for effective governance. Capacity building involves equipping local government officials with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties effectively. control corruption and institute transparency and integrity in financial accountability of LGAs. ”Transparent and accountable governance fosters public trust, while efficient service delivery enhances legitimacy and stability.Investing more in local government administration with institutionalised internal and external oversightEnsure adherence to the rule of law by upholding the principles of justice, fairness, and accountability Conclusion: “The ability of LGAs to perform developmental functions, particularly in a federal system like Nigeria revolves around the nature of the relationship between the federal, state and local government any major reform of the Local Govt System will invariably require the alteration of the Constitution and other incidental legislations touching on Local Government administration.On the other hand, constitutional alteration can only be achieved through consensus building and commonality of purpose between the three tiers, as with the three arms of Government. “We are therefore challenged to play our respective roles, when called upon to do so. The best time to act is now.To achieve this, many experts have proposed that there is need for the scrapping of the state independent electoral commission. Their functions and powers should be transferred to the independent national electoral commission because the state independent electoral commission remain an appendage to every incumbent governor. “This is perceived as the root cause of the problem of local government administration in Nigeria. I commend the leadership of the House of Representatives for this bold initiative, which not only signifies an intent but also the desire to fully reposition our governance structures and systems, which will enable us to find lasting solutions to our enduring security and governance challenges. “I happily look forward to further engagements on this crucial issue with the leadership and members of the House of Representatives, as with the National Assembly at large.” Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "It is difficult to understand how so many Republicans still support Donald Trump, when we know how incoherent and confused he is. An example: On September 15, 2023 he said, “I beat Obama in 2016, and I will do it again.” Of course, I have no personal experiences with Trump, so let’s get the opinions of those who have worked with him. Gen. Mark Milley, Trump’s Joint Chief of Staff, said in September of 2023, “We don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,” meaning Trump. In fact, after Jan. 6, Milley wanted to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office before the end of his term on January 20 because he was concerned Trump would do something else radical to stay in office. John Kelly, Trump’s Chief of Staff, reported that Trump felt that those seriously wounded in the service or who became POWs were “suckers,” because there was “nothing in it for them.” He also said that Trump admires autocrats and murderous dictators, and has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions and the rule of law. In January of 2021, Rex Tillerson, formerly Trump’s Secretary of State, said, “His understanding of global events, global history and of U.S. history was really limited. It’s really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesn’t understand the concept for why we’re talking about this.” It is certainly difficult to understand why so many Americans, who value our democracy, can support someone so very unfit to be our president.

        "description": "Rafael Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 today in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favourite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100 percent sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after today’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100 percent sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “If it’s the last time, I enjoyed it.” 🫶🧡 pic.twitter.com/7DApnv0rxD It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It’s such a great honour. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” Related articles Big interview: The woman who could save NZ tennis Paul Lewis: Novak Djokovic reveals a new side at the French Open No 23!

Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. Covalent is taking the next big steps in the progress towards the completion of the New Dawn now sitting at 85% progress for the series of network upgrades and governance proposals. Learn more about the recent progress on migrating staking back to Ethereum in initial preparation towards shipping Long-Term Data Availability via the modularized Ethereum Wayback Machine. As the Covalent Network expands, it is quickly running out of delegation room for CQT token holders relative to the time horizon needed to onboard more operators—meaning the community could quickly become blocked from delegating their CQT to earn emissions yield if not addressed now. CQT holders who wish to earn a targeted ~12% yield on emissions and likely do not run any of the data infrastructure operator types, fall into the category of delegates who stake to earn this yield. Staked delegates, staked operators and CQT holders alike can all participate in governance. However, the delegation room and network security come from the Block Specimen Producer Operators, not any other operator types currently. Much of the security budget—8% of the total supply—is reserved for this operation specifically, the rest is for other operator types. The Covalent Foundation proposes to increase the max delegation room for CQT Holders, increasing the Block Specimen Producer Operator Staking Max Multiplier to 34X targeting roughly ~20% supply staked—this target could increase to ~40% in the future. More details below. Roughly a month since migrating to Ethereum, the Covalent Network surpassed its previous total staked and now sits at 13.79% (~137M CQT) with the Covalent Network’s current target being ~20% (~200M CQT) of the total supply staked for this phase of network development. However, the Covalent Network is already coming close to the maximum delegation room with only 2.12% of room left with the current operator count—which has already increased. That means that the scale of CQT holders wishing to delegate their stake to earn additional emissions yield outstrips that of the anticipated time required to onboard new operator companies to run data infrastructure. Currently, The Covalent Network has three levers to adjust token economic emissions through the staking contract and thus network economic policy during this initial 4-year bootstrapping period by changing the following. To increase the delegation room to align with the increased CQT delegate demand, relative to the pace of operators onboarding, the proposal is to increase the Max Multiplier of each Block Specimen Producer Operator increasing the total delegation room. The current targeted ~20% total supply staked (200M CQT)—as ratified in the last —is not proposed to be changed. The Covalent Network expects to onboard more Block Specimen Producer Operators to a possible total of 19. Given the range Operators can choose to stake—of between 175K and 350K CQT—the proposal makes the assumption of 250K CQT average staked after factoring in that the existing Operators have largely staked at the cap of 350K CQT and proposes to raise the Max Multiplier from 27X to 34X. This slightly undershoots the goal of 200M CQT allowing room for other Operator types to stake and assumes all delegation room is absorbed by the market of delegates staking their CQT. These assumptions, combined with this calculation, set the upper bound and lower bound of the total possible CQT staked within a comfortable but narrow area, allowing the market to reach an equilibrium at roughly 200M CQT staked. As always, the ~12% targeted emissions yield for delegators is a target and will free-float a little. All CQT token holders, except those still staking/delegating on Moonbeam can participate in governance and are encouraged to vote “Yes” or “No” for this proposal to be ratified or not. Both CQT stakers and holders are encouraged to vote. These changes ensure the security and stability of the Ethereum Wayback Machine that solves the Long-Term Data Availability problem with modular data infrastructure.

        "content": "The Benue State House of Assembly has repealed the law to make provisions for the maintenance of former elected governors of the state and their deputies. The lawmakers took the decision today during the plenary presided over by Speaker Chief Hyacinth Aondona Dajoh. Presenting the report on the floor of the house, Chairman of the House Standing Committee on Appointment, Public Service, and Pension Matters, Hon. Douglas Akya, representing Makurdi South State Constituency, said the finances of the state could not guarantee the implementation of the law. He said the bill was not in the best interest of the state and recommended that the law be repealed. He expressed appreciation to the House for giving the committee the opportunity to serve in that capacity. Other members who contributed to the repeal of the law expressed happiness over the findings of the committee, saying the law was anti-people and needed to be repealed. They described the law as anti-mass, adding that the repeal was coming at the right time. It will be recalled that the immediate past governor, Samuel Ortom, towards the end of his tenure, initiated a bill to provide life pensions for all former governors and their deputies since 1999. The bill, which was hurriedly assented to by the governor on the eve of his exit, provided for the payment of a stipend of N40 million in four months in addition to the provision of two (2) Special Utility Vehicles (SUVs). The law also provided for six stewards to a former governor, while a former deputy was to be entitled to N25 million as a stipend in four months, 1 SUV vehicle, and three stewards.

Their newest arrival, a baby girl, was born \"early in the morning on May 23,\" Audrey announced in her Instagram story. \"It was my dream birth and we've been soaking in all the cuddles and adjusting to newborn life as a family of 6. I can't wait to tell you everything. But for now ... THESE ARE THE DAYS.\" Jeremy Roloff is the son of Matt and Amy Roloff, who anchored the TLC series that premiered in 2006. He married Audrey in 2014. Jeremy and Audrey Roloff first announced the pregnancy in that they posted in Nov. 2023. In the video, Audrey Roloff turns to her husband and whispers something in his ear. Jeremy Roloff then seemingly shares the secret by whispering in their 6-year-old daughter Ember’s ear, who then turns to her 3-year-old brother Bode and tells him what her dad told her. It then shows Bode telling 2-year-old Radley the news. Little Radley then throws his arms up in the air and repeats, “Big brother,” as the family rejoices in their happy news. \"We are so excited to be growing our family again and adding another little grommet to our crew!” the couple wrote on their joint video. The couple shared a gender reveal video in Jan. 2024. Standing in the drizzling rain, the parents saw pink smoke from their gender reveal cannons and immediately began to celebrate. Their three kids seemed hilariously nonplussed. \"I'm so pumped to do the girl thing again and for Ember to have the sister she prayed so hard for,\" Audrey wrote at the time. The proud mom has had three unmedicated births with her older children, and this was her first . What is the new baby's name? Only time will tell. Audrey has noted that she and her husband like to \"meet\" their babies before choosing what to call them. Rosie Colosi lives in New Jersey and is a reporter for TODAY Parents. She has bylines in The Atlantic, The Week, MSNBC, and PureWow, and she has written 33 nonfiction children's books for Scholastic, Klutz, and Nat Geo Kids. Once upon a time, she played Mrs. Claus in \"The Rockettes' Radio City Christmas Spectacular,\" but now she mostly sings songs from \"Annie\" to her two daughters ... while they beg her to play Kidz Bop.",

        "content": "After charging $1 a ride for its first three years, the Buffalo Heritage Carousel announced Saturday it's going to a different pricing model as it begins its fourth season of operation. The waterfront attraction at Canalside will now be asking people to pay what they can, with $1 being the minimum. \"A priority of this institution has always been to make this ride very, very accessible,\" board member Mark DePalma said. \"Up until this point we have been charging $1 a ride, a flat fee for everyone. But we recognize it costs quite a bit more to operate this carousel, so we are shifting to a donation-based ticket model, where we are asking people to pay what they can, with a minimum of a dollar, and to pay it forward.\" Two people who played a key role in making the solar-powered carousel possible were also honored with a plaque on the carousel's wall. Joan Bozer worked for years to see her dream of a solar-powered carousel become a reality in 2021, and Walter Simpson was a champion of alternative energy as the University at Buffalo's energy officer. Both started the Western New York Sustainable Energy Association. \"We are going to mount this plaque so that everyone understands that these two individuals had a pivotal role in this amazing, environmentally-focused and forward-thinking carousel,\" board member Marika Woods-Frankenstein said.

        "content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Rafa Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. \"I'm not 100% sure if it's the last time but I enjoyed it, the crowd were amazing during the whole week of preparation and today,\" Nadal said as the crowd rose to their feet. \"The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it's special to feel the love in the place I love the most. \"I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. But it's something I don’t feel yet.\" Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. \"I don't know what to say... thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world, it's such a great honour,\" Zverev said. \"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him twice on this beautiful court.\" Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.
