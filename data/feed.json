        "content": "Pope Francis spent a \"calm night\" as he marked three weeks in hospital with pneumonia, the Vatican said Friday, the day after the 88-year-old issued his first audio message. The Holy See had on Thursday evening reported the pontiff's condition was \"stable\" for the third day in a row, with no repeat of the respiratory crises that have punctuated his time at Rome's Gemelli hospital. It then released an audio recording made earlier in the day in which Francis, breathless, thanked those who have been praying for his recovery. \"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the Square, I accompany you from here,\" the Argentine said in a message broadcast in St Peter's Square. \"May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you,\" he said, taking laboured breaths as he spoke in his native Spanish. It was the first time the world has heard Francis's voice since he was admitted to the Gemelli hospital, which has a special suite for popes on the 10th floor, on February 14. Good sign Pilgrims have been gathering in St Peter's Square at the Vatican every evening to pray for the pope's recovery, and hundreds of people there on Thursday applauded when they heard his message. \"We were very happy that he could speak,\" said John Maloney, a 76-year-old English pilgrim. \"It's a good sign that he's actually able to speak,\" he told AFP, adding: “He's got a long way to go so he's in the hands of God.\" But for Claudia Bianchi, a 50-year-old Italian from Rome, \"It...",

The debate over the alleged imposition of a third language under the National Education Policy (NEP) in Tamil Nadu has escalated into a political clash between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). BJP Tamil Nadu Chief K Annamalai on Friday said that the party’s pro-NEP signature campaign had received a strong response from the public. “Thiru MK Stalin, our online signature campaign through http://puthiyakalvi.in is supported by over 2 lakh people within 36 hours, and our on-ground signature campaign continues to receive an overwhelming reception across TN. As the TN CM, you seem visibly rattled, and your rants against the signature campaign mean nothing to us,” Annamalai posted on X. He also criticized Stalin and the DMK, stating that the ruling party could not conduct a successful signature campaign against the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). “Despite being in power, you couldn't carry out a signature campaign against NEET, and remember that your cadres had to throw the pamphlets in the dustbin after realising where they truly belonged. Thiru MK Stalin, stop swinging your paper word against the delusional Hindi imposition. Your fake Hindi imposition drama has already been exposed. It's unfortunate that you haven't realised it yet,” he added. Annamalai’s remarks came in response...",

No. So, Atiku’s position hasn’t changed. Whichever way you look at this, there is a concern. Any society that does not optimally use the assets available to it, particularly by giving women the opportunity to thrive, is failing,” he said. “About half of our population is women, and if we don’t deliberately create an environment conducive to promoting women’s interests—whether in politics, business, or any other human endeavour—we are underutilising our potential.“We’re not providing half of our population the opportunities to thrive and add value to society. With International Women’s Day coming up on March 8, it raises serious concerns. The Senate’s action of suspending Natasha for six months without conducting an investigation is an attack on affirmative action.”Also, former Labour...",

The research is published in the journal JGR Atmospheres . \"Scientists still don't fully understand how lightning starts in thunderstorms,\" said Xuan-Min Shao, of Los Alamos' Electromagnetic Sciences and Cognitive Space Applications group and lead author of the new study. \"Using our 3D radio frequency mapping and polarization technology, we noticed an unusual pattern in how lightning begins; instead of just fast positive electrical discharge , the lightning flashes were quickly followed by an even faster, negative discharge.\" In general, lightning starts after opposing electrical charges—positive and negative—are separated in clouds, resulting in a discharge that people see as lightning. In their study, which took advantage of an innovative, Los Alamos-developed mapping and polarization system called BIMAP-3D, the team observed the signal polarization—how the discharge current is oriented—from these discharges had a slanted pattern away from the propagating direction, meaning they were not only following the thunderstorm's electric field.

Mounting global trade tensions and weak economic data from the U.S., the world's largest economy, are signaling weakness and unsettling investor sentiment, as this region accounts for the majority of revenue for Indian software companies. Amid this negative sentiment, the Nifty IT index tumbled 1.3% in early morning trade today, reaching 37,625 points. While the index recovered in the following hours, it remains 1.03% down as of 2:00 p.m. Eight of the 10 constituents of the index traded in the red, with Infosys emerging as the top loser, down 2.1%, followed by Mphasis, HCL Technologies, LTIMindtree, L&T Technology Services, and Tech Mahindra, all trading with losses between 1% and 2%.

The research was led by Prof. Hossam Haick, postdoctoral fellow Dr. Arnab Maity, and Ph.D. student Vivian Darsa Maidantchik from the Wolfson Faculty of Chemical Engineering at the Technion. The study also involved Dr. Dalit Barkan, research assistant Dr. Keren Weidenfeld, and Prof. Sarit Larisch from the University of Haifa's Faculty of Natural Sciences. The Technion researchers' method enables functional and molecular mapping of organoids—three-dimensional cell-based models that replicate the structural and functional characteristics of natural tissues.

Read More Buying alcohol in Karnataka may burn a hole in your pocket as liquor prices are likely to increase to match the rates of the neighbouring state. Chief minister Siddaramaiah , while presenting the state Budget 2025-26, said that alcohol rates will be reviewed. The CM further informed the Karnataka Assembly that excise tax collection last year stood at Rs 36,500 crore. The target for the coming year has been set at Rs 40,000 crore, he added. The beer lovers were already facing the brunt of steep hike in prices when the beer duties were increased on January 20. A 650ml bottle is now priced Rs 10-45 higher, depending on the brand. A report in Times of India had quoted Karnataka government as saying that the hike was necessary to plug a revenue gap in the excise department, despite a surge in liquor sales earlier this year. The report stated that the excise duty has increased from 185% to 195% of the billing price, or Rs 130 per bulk litre, whichever is higher. This means a bottle that once cost Rs 100 now costs Rs 145, while a Rs 230 bottle now sits at Rs 240.",

The Strictly Come Dancing pro, 47, and former England rugby star, 46, first met on the BBC show in 2013, sparking speculation that the infamous Strictly curse played a role in Cohen’s split from his wife, Abby. Though the sports star has always denied leaving his ex for the dancer, sources now claim financial struggles have driven him and Rihanoff apart. An insider told The Sun : “Ben left his wife Abby for Kristina, only to now split with her. It’s like the curse in reverse. “This will be like karma for Abby, she was so upset when Ben left her. It’s like he has got his comeuppance. “Those close to them who know them as a couple had hoped they would be able to work things out but for now it’s over and it looks like there’s no going back.” The couple, who got engaged in 2022 and share a daughter born in 2016, have allegedly faced a tough six months, even putting their £1.75 million Northampton home on the market. The pal added: “Those close to them who know them as a couple had hoped they would be able to work things out but for now it’s over and it looks like there’s no going back.” Last year, reports suggested they were fighting to save both their relationship and their home amid money troubles.

Over the years, she delivered several superhit films and became one of the richest actresses in Bollywood. Throughout her career, she worked with different actors, including Rajesh Khanna, Dev Anand, Dharmendra, and more. However, her career was ruined forever due to one mistake. If you are wondering who we are talking about, then the actress in discussion is Mala Sinha.Mala was born into a Bengali-Nepali family. Her initial name was Alda. However, after she got her first project as a child artist, she changed her name to Baby Nazma. Later, during adulthood, she changed her name to Mala Sinha.Mala made her debut with Badshah in 1954, and during her career spanning over four decades, she delivered several hit films. Once, she wanted to share screen space with Dilip Kumar. However, that couldn’t happen due to Waheeda Rehman. In one of her interviews, Sinha mentioned that she regretted not working with Dilip Kumar for the rest of her life.Mala was one of the leading actresses in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

From social media celebrations to personal messages, she acknowledged the overwhelming support she has received as a woman CM. Rekha Gupta also discussed how past governments had sidelined women in politics, citing Indira Gandhi’s cabinet and the long struggle for the Women’s Reservation Bill. She credited PM Modi’s bold decision to ensure 33% reservation for women and provide key ministerial positions to women leaders like Nirmala Sitharaman and the late Sushma Swaraj.

Then Whateley and Hudson keep using those terms to build the narrative while Garry Lyon and Jason Dunstall are working well off the back of their calls to add come context to the play of both sides.

Expressing its anguish, the Bench observed: \"What pricks the conscience of this court is that despite the fact that the complaint was filed in the year 2022 and the petitioner has been incarcerated for over four years, the trial is yet to commence. This inaction has effectively converted pre-trial detention into a punitive sentence, disregarding the bedrock principle of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty.\" Stringent bail conditions Justice Brar also noted that the petitioner, granted bail, was unable to secure his release due to the \"lamentably disproportional\" and \"onerous\" conditions imposed by the lower court.

        "content": "“An ‘IPO connect’ can meet the demand for mainland investors to invest in global assets,” Wong said on Friday in a written response to the Post. “For Hong Kong, a new IPO connect can attract more overseas firms to list here, and hence will further expand capital market activities and business opportunities.” “Hong Kong should leverage ... ‘one country, two systems’ to support the liberalisation of China’s financial sector,” Wong said. Wong said he would also like to see expansions of the existing connect schemes covering Hong Kong stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and wealth-management products to allow for greater participation by mainland-based investors. Beijing first introduced the Stock Connect scheme in 2014 to link the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets; Shenzhen was added to the mix in 2016. Under the scheme at the time, investors on the mainland could buy Hong Kong stocks, while international investors could trade in mainland stocks via Hong Kong. The Connect programme later expanded to include bonds, ETFs, wealth-management products and swaps.",

She is paired with Vikrant Massey in the film. In the photo, shot-ready Shanaya Kapoor posed with her debut film’s clapboard. She wore a black jacket, with a big smile plastered on her face. In the location bar, Shanaya mentioned that she is currently in Azerbaijan for work. Take a look at her photos here: Her mother, Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives stars Maheep Kapoor, who has often expressed how worried she is about her daughter’s debut film, wished her luck by posting multiple red heart and evil eyes emojis. Aankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan is touted to be a musical drama, based on Ruskin Bond’s short story titled The Eyes Have It. As per a Peeping Moon report, Shanaya will portray a theatre artist, while Vikrant will play a blind musician. The film’s storyline is expected to explore the intricacies of human connection such as compassion, resilience, independence, desire and self-belief. The film is helmed by Santosh Singh, known for his projects such as Broken But Beautiful and Apharan. The film is written by acclaimed writers like Niranjan Iyengar and Mansi Bagla.

This time last year, there were fewer than 9,000 spectators in the ground when Athlone Town’s German Fuentes made his international debut against Argentina. It may have been a friendly, but the World Cup winners wheeled out most of their big guns for the clash with El Salvador. Angel Di Maria, Emi Martinez, Enzo Fernandez, Lautaro Martinez, Cristian Romero and Rodrigo De Paul were all among the starters. Alejandro Garnacho, Alexis MacAllister and Nicolas Otamendi came on as substitutes, while Julian Alvarez was left on the bench throughout the 3-0 win. That was the scoreline when centre-back Fuentes was handed his senior El Salvador bow with 13 minutes remaining. “Argentina didn't want to look down on us so they put out a strong team,” Fuentes told Mirror Sport, while reflecting on that career highlight. “Ireland has been very good to me with my career and it has opened up a lot of doors in every aspect, with games like that.” Technically, it wasn’t the first time the 27-year-old defender donned the national shirt as he played in a game against Bonaire a few days before. He was unfortunate to be credited with an own goal, even if the blame rests entirely with his goalkeeper for allowing a routine backpass go under his foot and into the net. But there were no caps awarded for that clash at DC United’s Audi Field as Bonaire, the Caribbean island, is not a...",

Meanwhile, Bangalore’s real estate scene is driven by its booming tech industry, yet faces challenges like low rental yields and slow appreciation. A recent Reddit post has sparked a heated debate, drawing stark comparisons between the two markets. A Reddit user broke it down with a bold claim: “Bursting the bubble. Here’s a brutal, no-nonsense comparison of UAE vs Bangalore real estate in terms of investment returns, rental yields, and overall value.” In a point-by-point explanation of key points, the user pointed out: The post emphasized rental yields as Bangalore’s biggest weakness. \"While the UAE offers 6-8% net rental yields, Bangalore struggles at 2-3% gross (before taxes and maintenance). Example: A ₹3 crore flat in Bangalore rents for ₹60,000/month (₹7.2 lakh/year) → 2.4% gross yield. - A ₹3 crore flat in UAE rents for ₹1.5-2 lakh/month (₹18-24 lakh/year) → 6-8% net yield, almost three times better than Bangalore.\" it added. The user also criticised property appreciation in Bangalore as \"artificial\". The user claimed that while apartment prices have surged, salaries haven’t kept pace, making future resale uncertain. \"Meanwhile, UAE’s demand is backed by global investors and expats, ensuring sustainable appreciation,\" the user said. Liquidity was another concern. The user noted that reselling a Bangalore flat is slow...",

Roads turned into rivers, thousands of flights were disrupted, and operations at Dubai International Airport (DXB) were severely impacted. Yet, amid the chaos, the emirate’s response showcased its growing focus on climate resilience and disaster preparedness. As extreme weather events become more frequent, Dubai Airports is taking bold steps to enhance its climate resilience, CEO Paul Griffiths said at the Economist Intelligence Corporate Network. Griffiths said that the future of disruption management will be shaped by artificial intelligence, automation, and enhanced coordination. He explained, “Extreme weather events are no longer rare. The way forward is stronger infrastructure and smarter, data-driven crisis management that ensures we stay agile, sustainable, and prepared for what’s next.” “At Dubai Airports, we are integrating airport drainage with city-wide stormwater networks, expanding our solar capacity, and driving innovation in crisis preparedness,” he explained. These measures aim to ensure Dubai remains prepared for future climate disruptions. According to the aviation veteran, the climate event was a true test of DXB’s resilience. “Roads turned to rivers, 2,155 flights were cancelled, 115 diverted, and tens of thousands of bags needed repatriation. But resilience isn’t just about reacting—it’s about being prepared,” he said. DXB’s Gold...",

        "content": "Adani Wilmar Ltd (AWL) is doubling down on branded foods with its 600 crore acquisition of G.D. Foods Manufacturing (India) Pvt. Ltd, the maker of Tops sauces and pickles. The move marks a decisive shift beyond its core edible oil business into the high-margin, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) category. But will Tops be the growth catalyst AWL needs or just another incremental step in its diversification plan? Sure, the acquisition strengthens AWL’s hold in north India, where Tops enjoys a strong retail presence across 150,000 outlets. More importantly, with a 48% gross margin in FY24, the deal is expected to bolster AWL’s long-term push toward a 20-25% gross margin in its food business post-FY28. The challenge, however, lies in scaling Tops beyond its stronghold and translating those margins into sustained profitability. Also Read: The deal value of 600 crore implies an enterprise-value-to-sales ratio of 1.6 times based on Tops’ FY24 revenue of 384 crore. The valuation appears reasonable. AWL will initially acquire 80% of shares from existing promoters and the remaining 20% in phases over the next three years. AWL will fund the acquisition through internal accruals and, if needed, the initial public offering (IPO) proceeds. While Tops is strong in jams and sauces, its regional skew means AWL must expand its reach in underpenetrated western and southern markets to justify the valuation. Accelerating the FMCG pivot AWL’s timing appears opportune. Fresh off a strong December...",

What Happened: Nasdaq 100, slipped 9.76% from its previous record high of 22,222.61 points to 20,052.64 on Thursday. While a 10% fall from a recent high is considered a market correction, a 20% or greater decline from a recent high is considered a bear market. Additionally, the index fell below its 200-day simple moving average for the first time in nearly two years or 497 trading sessions. Despite being another 10% away from the bear market zone, Jason Goepfert , a consultant at White Oak Consultancy LLC, has highlighted a trend explaining that the next two weeks would be crucial for the index. “Every time it lost its 200-day after an extended run and suffered at least a -3.5% drawdown within the next 2 weeks, it led to a bear market.” However, if the Nasdaq 100’s two-week drawdown was less than 3.5%, its one-year returns were positive every time. The Nasdaq 100 $QQQ closed below its 200-day average for the first time in over a year. Watch the next 2 weeks. Every time it lost its 200-day after an extended run and suffered at least a -3.5% drawdown within the next 2 weeks, it led to a bear market.

Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag’s brother Vinod Sehwag was arrested by the police on Thursday over a cheque bounce case. The arrest comes after a local court decision in 2023 where Vinod and two others were assigned offenders for failing to appear in court proceedings. Officers from Chandigarh’s Manimajra police station arrested Vinod. The two other people who were arrested are Vishnu Mittal and Sudhir Malhotra. All three of them are directors of Xalta Food and Beverages Company. According to News18 Hindi , the complaint to the police was filed by Krishna Mohan Khanna, who owns Shree Naina Plastics. The Himachal Pradesh-based business had complained that Jalta Food and Beverages purchased the goods from his factory worth Rs 7 crore and paid them via cheque. The cheque bounced and bank officials told Krishna Mohan Khanna that there was no money in the account from which the funds were supposed to be debited from. The report also said that Xalta Food and Beverages had issued seven different cheques of ₹1 crore each. The report said that Vinod and the two others received legal notices but no action was taken. In 2022, the court declared the three of them as fugitives. Following a court order, the Manimajra police registered a case against the three accused on September 25, 2023, under Section 174 for disobedience to a court order....",

Reportedly, Nishant Tripathi died after uploading his suicide note on the website of the company where he worked. On February 28, Nishant put up a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on his room door and died by suicide by hanging himself in the bathroom. When he did not respond for a long time, hotel staff entered his room using a master key and found him hanging. Upon receiving the information, the airport police reached the spot and sent the body for post-mortem. During the investigation, the police found a suicide note that Nishant had uploaded on his company’s website and had locked with a password. In the note, he expressed his love for his wife but also blamed her and her aunt for his death. ‘’ By the time you read this, I'll be gone. in my last moments, I could've hated you for everything that happened, but I don't.

Most of them are employed in engineering, management, finance and IT sectors that demand skilled workers. While adapting to life in Japan, Indian expats face different challenges due to the cultural differences and language barrier. One such man has now opened up about how the locals treat the Indian community staying in the country. The person was approached by a Japanese vlogger who asked him, “How is it living in Japan as an Indian?\" In response, the Indian man spoke about his food preference before mentioning some instances of facing racism. “Many Indians don’t eat pork or beef and quite a few are strictly vegetarian. And since they can eat chicken or other meats, they have to cook for themselves to survive. We often just end up eating Kappa Maki (cucumber rolls),\" the man said in a video dropped on the Instagram page, ‘Riki With Japan Mates’. He then went on to recall how he “experienced racism two or three times\" while staying in Japan over the “past two years\". “Some random old guy started picking a fight with me. Another guy purposely bumped into my shoulders,\" the Indian-origin man said. “One on the train, I was not even talking, but a group of high school girls were loudly laughing.

As tensions between China and the United States rise due to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Chinese products, Beijing is now pushing for a stronger cooperation with India to “oppose hegemonism and power politics\" and uphold international norms. Addressing an annual press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, “China and India should be partners that contribute to each other’s success. A cooperative pas de deux of the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for both sides.\" “To support each other rather than undercut each other, work with each other rather than guard against each other — this is the path that truly serves the fundamental interests of both China and India and their peoples. When China and India join hands, the prospects for greater democracy in international relations and a stronger Global South will improve greatly.\" Wang stressed that a cooperative partnership between India and China is the only path that serves the fundamental interests of both countries and safeguard basic norms governing internal relations. “China stands ready to work with India to sum up past experience and forge a fast forward and advance China-India relations on the track of sound and stable development,\" he added.

We’re talking sequins, cut-outs, and a bevy of barely-there evening wear, served by A-listers like Sonam Kapoor, Ananya Panday, Mindy Kaling, and many more. For starters, Sonam Kapoor embraced 1920s flapper-era glamour in a milky-white satin dress by Anamika Khanna, layered with tassels and a matching cape. Hand-painted florals—a signature of the designer—added an artisanal touch, while Kapoor’s choice to wear her jewels in reverse nodded to an emerging trend. More notably, sequins, crystals, and other dazzling details had their moment this week. For the annual South Asian Oscar event, Mindy Kaling slipped into custom Rahul Mishra couture—a corseted sari-style gown with jharoka detailing—which she paired with radiant emeralds and diamonds from Effy Jewelry.

While property prices have increased across all areas over the last 12 months, the nation's largest mortgage lender has reported a marginal dip of -0.1% in average prices last month. According to Halifax , the average house price now stands at £298,602, down from £298,815 in January 2025. Despite the minor monthly decline, annual house price growth held steady at 2.9% in February. Halifax warned that the forthcoming stamp duty changes, set to take effect in April, are beginning to exert slight downward pressure on house prices . Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at the bank, said: \"The typical UK house price remained stable in February, with a slight monthly dip of -0.1%. Annual growth also held steady at +2.9%, with the average house price edging down by just £213 to £298,602.

In a for their upcoming Netflix film, the two actors discussed the differences between growing up in the 1990s versus today. When the topic of music came up, Pratt explained how albums were once listened to in a specific order on cassette tapes. The Guardians of the Galaxy actor said, “There was once a time where artists who made tapes, they curated their music into a very intentional list.” However, Brown quickly disagreed. She said, “No, that’s not true, Chris. Taylor Swift curates her album from start to finish.” Pratt challenged her by pointing out that modern streaming services like Spotify allow listeners to shuffle songs in any order. He said, “You don’t have to listen to her album that way. You can go on Spotify and hit shuffle and listen to it however the AI decides.” However, Brown said, “A true Swiftie wouldn’t.” This isn’t the first time Brown has shown her admiration for the pop superstar.

The rocket took off smoothly from the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, quickly disappearing into thick clouds. The ArianeGroup says the launch is significant because it \"guarantees independent access to space for France and Europe,\" according to a statement. \"Ariane confirms the return of autonomous access to space for Europe,\" Martin Sion, the CEO of ArianeGroup, said in a statement. \"It demonstrates the quality of the industrial development of Europe's new heavy-lift launcher\". This third CSO satellite also completes an Earth observation system that will transmit high resolution images to France's military and its European partners. Ariane 6 had its first flight in July 2024 after repeated delays. This first commercial launch was delayed, too, due to an \"anomaly\" on the ground.

He was attempting to take a low catch of Heinrich Klaasen which resulted in the niggle and forced him off the field. The 33-year-old though returned towards the end of the innings and sent down two more overs and picked up the wicket of Kagiso Rabada. “Matt obviously landed on his shoulder and it was pretty uncomfortable. I guess the positive thing from our perspective is that he got back out there to bowl. We’ve had some scans done on him,\" New Zealand head coach Gary Stead told reporters on Friday. Stead is positive Henry will recover in time for the title clash. “We’re going to give him every chance to be playing in this match, so still a little bit unknown at this stage. He’s obviously pretty sore just from landing on the point of his shoulder, but yeah, hopefully he will be okay,\" he said.

While it is an interim government, and Dr. Yunus, a Nobel Peace laureate, has spoken of elections toward the end of the year, its engagement with China and Pakistan continues. There has been considerable discussion about Dr. Yunus potentially visiting China on March 27 and 28, a significant development. The specifics of his meetings are still being worked out, but China has maintained close ties with Bangladesh, including a long-running program to develop a submarine base in the country. Initially named BNS Sheikh Hasina, the base is part of Bangladesh’s naval expansion, though the Bangladesh Navy currently operates only two submarines. A future visit by Chinese People's Liberation Army (Navy) submarines is expected. Meanwhile, there is a possibility of Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Ishaq Dar, visiting Dhaka in late April. This would be a momentous visit, and in preparation, a senior official from Pakistan's foreign ministry, Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, is reaching out to his Bangladeshi counterparts. Signs of strengthening ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, including security cooperation, have emerged in recent weeks. Not long ago, a Bangladeshi participated in a Pakistan Navy exercise—a first in many decades. A visit by the deputy PM could further boost economic, security, and socio-cultural links. And what about India?...",

        "content": "A “delicate balance” was seen in the housing market in February, with the average property price dipping by £213 month-on-month, according to an index. Property values fell by 0.1% on a monthly basis, taking the average house price in February to £298,602. Annual house price growth remained at 2.9%, which was unchanged from January. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax , said: “February’s figures highlight the delicate balance within the UK housing market. “While there’s been talk of a last minute rush on new mortgages ahead of the changes to stamp duty , inevitably we’ve seen some of the demand that was brought forward start to fade as the April deadline ticks closer, given the time needed to complete a purchase.” From April, stamp duty discounts will become less generous for some home buyers. Stamp duty applies in England and Northern Ireland. Ms Bryden added: “While house price growth has slowed overall, market activity remains strong and comparable to pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating a resilience amongst buyers that’s been evident in the face of higher borrowing costs. “While those affordability challenges persist, the ongoing shortage of housing supply coupled with sustained demand suggests property prices will continue to rise this year, albeit at a more measured pace compared to last year.” Andrew Montlake, chief executive of Coreco Mortgage Brokers said: “There is no shortage of economic headwinds facing the property market, and affordability is a constant...",

Water Fasting (2-3 Day Fast)One of the most extreme forms of intermittent fasting is the water fast, in which a person consumes only water for two to three days. While this method can have detoxification benefits, it is not recommended for people with chronic diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or who are underweight.

Ebola is now spreading in five of Uganda’s 146 districts, it said. That includes Kampala, the capital, where the outbreak was declared on January 30. Two Ebola deaths have been confirmed.

Clifford used a crossbow to kill his ex-girlfriend Louise Hunt and her sister Hannah Hunt, as well as stabbing their mother Carol Hunt to death at their home in Bushey , Hertfordshire , last July. He had already admitted to the murders, but on Thursday was also convicted of raping Louise Hunt in what prosecutors described as a “misogynistic” attack. Asked on Friday whether the case showed crossbows should be banned, health minister Stephen Kinnock told Times Radio: “I think crossbows are a lethal weapon and they should be regulated.” Adding he was “sure” the Home Secretary , Yvette Cooper , “will be looking at this”, he said: “It does seem to be too easy to get hold of a lethal weapon like a crossbow and it does seem that something does need to be done about that.” It is currently illegal to sell crossbows to people aged under 18 or carry one in public without a reasonable excuse, but there is no licensing or registration scheme for the weapon and adults are free to buy them. The previous Conservative government launched a consultation in February 2024 on introducing further controls on crossbow ownership after a 2021 incident in which a man, armed with the weapon, gained entry to the grounds of Windsor Castle. That consultation suggested a firearms-style licensing scheme for crossbows, but progress was stalled by last...",

New Delhi: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) will take feedback from market participants before making any decision on changes to the derivatives expiry day, its Managing Director and CEO, Sundararaman Ramamurthy, said on Friday. His statement came after the National Stock Exchange (NSE) recently shifted the expiry day for its futures and options contracts to Monday. Ramamurthy emphasised that BSE’s decisions are always based on what traders and investors want. “Our stand has always been, ‘we do what the market participants want.’ Whatever is the voice of the customer, that is what we implement,” he told NDTV Profit. Ramamurthy also made it clear that BSE would not make any unilateral decisions on expiry dates. “Any change in expiry dates will depend on what the market voice is. Once we are able to understand what the market advises, we will act accordingly.” The NSE’s move has sparked discussions about its potential impact on BSE’s market share in options trading and revenue. However, Ramamurthy maintained that BSE's primary focus is not just volumes but creating a well-regulated and investor-friendly marketplace. “Volumes are an outcome; the most important thing is to provide products that are required by the marketplace,” he said. Ramamurthy also highlighted BSE’s broader mission to make Indian markets more attractive to both domestic and global investors. He pointed out that...",

The United States Bancassurance Market was valued at USD 48.52 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 63.93 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.77%. A key driver of the United States Bancassurance Market is the rising consumer demand for convenient, all-in-one financial services. Consumers are increasingly seeking integrated solutions that allow them to manage both banking and insurance needs through a single institution. This trend is fueled by the desire for convenience, as customers look for time-efficient ways to access both financial products and insurance policies. Additionally, many customers prefer the trusted relationships they have developed with their banks, making them more inclined to purchase insurance through these institutions rather than standalone insurance companies. Recognizing the potential to diversify revenue and strengthen customer loyalty, banks are increasingly incorporating insurance products into their service offerings. By providing a broad spectrum of insurance solutions, banks can meet diverse customer needs, ranging from basic life and health insurance to more sophisticated financial protection plans.

At the peak on September 26 last year, 618 companies were part of the billion-dollar club. However, this number has now dropped to 500 following a $1 lakh crore loss in India's market capitalisation, largely due to the consistent selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Amid discussions on social media regarding the equity market correction, SIP investment, and bear markets, experts and financial planners have been advising investors to remain patient and continue investing in stocks even during the bear market. Abhijit Chokshi, Founder of Stockifi.in, highlighted in a recent post the remarkable growth of Suzuki India Limited as a multibagger. After debuting at Rs 125 per share, the stock has surged to Rs 13,000 per share. In 2003, the government sold a 25 per cent stake in Maruti Suzuki Limited (then known as Maruti Udyog Limited) at Rs 125 per share. The stock first traded on July 09, 2003 and closed the day at Rs 164, representing a 32 per cent increase from its issue price. Over the span of 20 years, Maruti's stock has outperformed Honda, Toyota, and Nissan combined. Chokshi wrote on X: \"If you had invested Rs 1 lakh in Maruti's IPO (800 shares at Rs 125), your investment would have grown to Rs 1 crore by 2017 at Rs 10,000 per share—a 100x return.

Over the past few months, AEW has parted ways with several talents who had already been absent from television for an extended period. Notably, Malakai Black, Miro, Ricky Starks, and Rey Fenix have all been released from AEW, with Fenix being the most recent departure. Each of these wrestlers had been away from AEW programming for several months before their exits. Miro last competed at World’s End in December 2023, where he defeated Andrade. Ricky Starks has also been off AEW television, with his last match taking place on an edition of AEW Collision in March 2024. Malakai Black’s removal from House of Black strongly hinted at his departure, while Rey Fenix had also been inactive for months, last appearing on AEW TV in July 2024. With these stars missing from television, many reportedly requested their release from the promotion. AEW initially resisted granting releases, but in February, reports that the promotion had let go of Black, Miro, and Starks. Earlier this week, Rey Fenix was also released this week, months after AEW had reportedly extended his contract due to injury. While fans expected AEW to let contracts expire, the promotion has instead granted several releases. Tony Khan recently shared insight into what led him to make this decision.

Thousands of passengers are disrupted as the cross-Channel operator cancelled 10 services on Friday morning. A large crowd of people who were booked on affected services gathered outside the check-in area at London St Pancras. “We would have thought there would be more Eurostar staff, to be honest,” said Lauren Romeo-Smith, part of a group planning to travel for a weekend away to celebrate a birthday. “We’re looking up flights, but our options are limited.” French transport minister Philippe Tabarot told broadcaster Sud Radio that trains will be “strongly disrupted” throughout the day, with only a limited service resuming in the afternoon. Eurostar told passengers to expect disruption because of “an object on the tracks”, and advised them to “change your journey for a different date of travel”. Fridays are one of the busiest days of the week for Eurostar, as many leisure travellers embark on international weekend breaks. The bomb was discovered at around 4am. A spokesperson for Eurostar said it was found during work on tracks in the St Denis area, north of central Paris. This resulted in the suspension of all services to and from Gare du Nord , which is Eurostar’s station in Paris. Services will only be permitted to resume once “mine clearance operations” by the French police are completed, the spokesperson added. Bombs left...",

Doncic and James had both been instrumental in dragging the Lakers back into the contest after the Knicks led by 10 points midway through the fourth quarter. The Knicks, meanwhile, were left ruing a potential victory that slipped through their fingers despite a majestic performance from Jalen Brunson, who scored a game-high 39 points. The agony of the Knicks’ defeat was compounded by an injury to Brunson in overtime, with the mercurial point guard limping off the court after rolling his right ankle in a collision with the Lakers’ Austin Reaves. “Our physicality in the fourth quarter was next level,\" an exhausted Doncic said afterward. “Once we got started, we played basketball. “They’re a great team with great players, and it’s a tough win. We’ve got eight in a row now, and every game is a battle for us.\" The Lakers looked to be struggling after trailing for most of the game against a fired-up Knicks, who led by as much as 13 at...",

Two trans persons have been arrested in connection with this. According to a Daily Thanthi report, the deceased Shailu alias Sivaji Ganesan, hailing from Sathankulam, Tuticorin, was residing with their friend Mahalakshmi, at Alankulam. The former, a man who was reportedly in the process of transitioning into a woman, was staying with their friend, also a trans person, for over two weeks. On Thursday, Mahalakshmi, along with another acquaintance Madhumitha, rushed Shailu with grievous injuries in their private parts, to the Alankulam government hospital where doctors declared them dead on arrival. Shailu's friends told the doctors that the deceased had cut off their genitals in an attempt to transition into a woman, which caused his death. However, a police team from Kadayam, arrived at the spot and conducted enquiries with Mahalakshmi and Madhumitha. During investigation, it was revealed that the duo had chopped off Shailu's genitals without any medical supervision to help him with the transition. The botched procedure caused excessive blood loss which resulted in Shailu's death. Following this, the cops arrested the trans person duo and remanded them to judicial custody. Investigations are on.",

Grumpy Cat, Keyboard Cat and even that chill Turkish Olympic shooter posing with his cat have left their mark. They’ve crashed countless Zoom calls without a hint of regret, sparked conspiracy theories (ever met a cat you really trusted?) and trained humans to serve them for centuries—all without lifting a paw. So, what’s it like for men, who believe the world is theirs to rule, to live with these fluffy dictators, who actually rule the world? In addition to teaching them humility, patience and the value of personal space, does being a cat dad make them more dateable? Social media would certainly have you believe so but in 2020, a cat astrophic study found that women were less likely to swipe right on men posing with a cat in their dating app picture. Perhaps this has to do with outdated perceptions that link soft men to queerness and foist on them the qualities cats are best known for: moodiness and an aversion to bullshit. So which one is it? To date or not to date a cat dad? We’ll let you be the judge.

With this result, Aravindh took his tally to 5.5 points, maintaining a half-point lead over compatriot R Praggnanandhaa, who drew with Vietnam's Quang Liem Le. In the final round, Aravindh will face Turkey’s Ediz Gurel, while Praggnanandhaa has a tougher challenge against Anish Giri of the Netherlands. After losing two of his first three games, top-seeded Chinese GM Wei Yi bounced back impressively, defeating local favorite Nguyen Thai Dai Van to move into sole third place with 4.5 points. Vincent Keymer (Germany), Ediz Gurel, and Giri share fourth place with four points each, followed by Quang Liem, Navara, and Sam Shankland, all on 3.5 points. Dai Van remains at the bottom with 2.5 points. The Berlin defense is normally known to get balanced endgames and this time too, Navara had little trouble reaching an equal endgame. A small oversight by both players at a critical moment briefly offered Aravindh a chance to push for victory, but the opportunity slipped, and both players signed truce in 32 moves. Praggnanandhaa, playing White, opted for his pet Catalan opening against Le. However, the Vietnamese GM found adequate counter play in the middle game by cornering the white queen.

This marks a significant achievement in strengthening cybersecurity in the age of quantum computing. The rapid advancement of quantum computing technology poses a serious threat to the current encryption methods used for e-commerce, telecommunications and digital signatures. Finding alternative encryption solutions has, therefore, become a global priority. Lattice SVP-based cryptography has been identified as a promising next-generation cryptographic standard capable of safeguarding sensitive data from quantum computer attacks. To address vulnerabilities in cryptographic standards, the cryptography community established the global SVP challenge in 2010, attracting leading mathematicians and computer scientists worldwide to explore the limits of lattice SVP. Professor Ding says: \"From a research perspective, our new record for solving the problem enhances our understanding of lattice-based cryptography's security foundations, providing empirical evidence to inform future post-quantum cryptographic standard s.\" \"In practical terms, it helps security experts more accurately assess the boundaries of existing cryptographic systems and guide the...",

        "content": "New Zealand could be in for a massive setback heading into the finals of Champions Trophy 2025 as they could lose the services of the tournament's highest wicket-taker, Matt Henry. Reportedly, the pacer could be out of action owing to a shoulder injury he picked up during the semi-final match against South Africa earlier this week. Speaking to the media ahead on Friday, Kiwi head coach Gary Stead said, “I guess the positive thing from our perspective is he got back out there to bowl,” “We’ve had some scans and stuff done on him, and we’re going to give him every chance to be playing in this match. It’s still a little bit unknown at this stage,” Stead added New Zealand to take on India on Sunday: To recap, New Zealand reached the final of the Champions Trophy 2025 by beating South Africa by 50 runs on Wednesday. Meanwhile, India qualified for the penultimate match by beating Australia in the semi-finals. The two teams will meet at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday to decide the winner of the Champions Trophy 2025. The Kiwis also faced the same opposition in the league stage, where he took 5 wickets to damage the Indian batting line-up and restrict them to 249, but strong Indian bowling brought the game back to the Men in Blue. With Henry possibly out of the playing XI for Sunday, skipper Mitch Santner and the team management will have to make some changes to give the Rohit Sharma -led side a tough fight. Notably, India had also made it to the final of the Champions...",

        "content": "The Indian Air Force (IAF) has achieved a significant milestone with the successful landing of its Globemaster aircraft at the Kargil airstrip, situated at an altitude of approximately 9,700 feet. This feat is a substantial boost to the Indian military's capability to rapidly induct men and material along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The trial landing, conducted in daylight, demonstrates the IAF's ability to enhance defence logistics in the region. The C-17 Globemaster's capacity to carry over 35 tonnes in winter will significantly enhance the IAF's transport capacity, making it easier to move troops and military supplies to posts near the LAC. Furthermore, the C-17's operational capability from Kargil will also provide a vital lifeline for civilians, who frequently become stranded due to heavy snowfall in the region. If needed, the aircraft can be swiftly deployed for humanitarian airlift operations, ensuring the safe evacuation of those affected. Notably, the C-17's larger capacity means fewer flights are needed to transport goods, making it a more efficient and effective option. Previously, only AN-32 and C-130 aircraft operated on the Kargil airstrip, with capacities of 6 to 7 tonnes, respectively. The successful landing of the C-17 at Kargil is a significant development aimed at increasing strategic depth by enhancing the mobility of troops and the availability of logistics support. This achievement underscores India's commitment to strengthening its strategic...",

DBUs are specialised, fixed-point business units or hubs equipped with certain minimum digital infrastructure to deliver digital banking products and services as well as servicing existing financial products and services digitally in a convenient and cost-effective way. Also read: “Ever since their launch in 2022, DBUs have constantly been expanded to cover all parts of the country, especially semi-urban, rural and remote areas that have limited access to banking services and no digital services. More than 100 DBUs are now operational and we want to fast-track the programme so that a similar number is added by the end of the next fiscal year,\" said the first person cited above. Insurance and pension products While DBUs currently provide ATM-like services – such as depositing and withdrawing cash from bank accounts – the government plans to expand their mandate to include financial products such as insurance and pension.

        "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday that it requires SpaceX to conduct a mishap investigation into the Starship explosion during its eighth test flight. What Happened: A mishap investigation will determine the cause of the incident and identify rectifying measures to avoid a recurrence. The investigation will be led by SpaceX and overseen by the FAA. Starships’ return to flight will be based on the agency determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety. Starship’s eighth flight test lifted off from Starbase, Texas, at 5:30 p.m. CT on Thursday. The Super Heavy booster was successfully captured at Starbase by the launch tower’s arms, but the Starship spacecraft exploded in space, raining debris. SpaceX said that “an energetic event in the aft portion of Starship” resulted in the loss of several engines, thereby leading to a loss of attitude control and ultimately loss of contact with the vehicle. “Final contact with Starship came approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds after liftoff,” it said. Following the explosion of the spacecraft, SpaceX coordinated with the FAA, air traffic control, and other safety officials to implement contingency responses, it said, while adding that it would conduct a “thorough investigation.” “Any surviving debris would have fallen within the pre-planned Debris Response Area. There are no toxic materials present in the debris and no significant impacts expected to occur to...",

The deal is “set for signing,” said the department although it did provide specific details.“Following the 75th anniversary of Philippines-Canada diplomatic relations in 2024, the two nations reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties through the conclusion of the SOVFA. This agreement will establish a framework for increased cooperation, fostering closer collaboration between defense and military establishments, improving interoperability between forces, and facilitating more effective joint exercises and capacity-building activities,” said the DND in a release to the media.A SOVFA would make it easier for troops from both countries to enter each others’ territories for activities like bilateral or even multilateral military exercises. A SOVFA defines, among others, the laws that apply to soldiers deployed to a host country, and the rules that would govern their stay and deployment to their host country.Both Ottawa and Manila have long signaled a desire to grow closer, particularly when it comes to security and defense.The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on defense cooperation in January 2024, months after Ottawa gave Manila access to its proprietary Dark...",

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a 25% tariff on C$155 billion ($109 billion) worth of U.S. goods. This decision comes as a direct response to the 25% tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Canadian goods What Happened : Trudeau has stated that these tariffs will stay in effect until the U.S. reverses its trade measures, reported BNN Bloomberg. The Canadian tariff plan, announced last month, includes two phases targeting a total of C$30 billion ($21 billion) in U.S. goods initially. An additional round of tariffs on a wider range of American products, worth C$125 billion ($87 billion), is scheduled to take effect in 21 days. Trump’s initial threat of punitive tariffs on Canadian goods in late November was intended to reduce the influx of illegal migrants and drugs across the border. Despite Canada's attempts to delay these tariffs, including a C$1.3 billion ($909.7 million) border plan and the appointment of a \"fentanyl czar,\" Trump confirmed on Monday that Canada will not receive any further reprieves. According to Reuters, the initial round of retaliation covers over 1200 products, including motorcycles, apparel, wine, coffee, footwear, peanut butter, cosmetics, beer, appliances, spirits, orange juice, and pulp and paper. Meanwhile, the second tranche could include a diverse selection of U.S. imports including...",

The original poster highlighted the grim reality: “Rents are increasing faster than salaries are increasing.” They added, “A 3 BHK is closer to 90K in top areas now. Even in Sarjapur Road/Bellandur near tech parks, it’s no less than 70K.” \"This is unsustainable as salaries are not increasing at this rate. I know this for a fact,\" the user said. The situation isn’t limited to Bangalore, as the user pointed out: “Spoke to a few friends in Delhi NCR. This is definitely the case in Gurugram and Delhi.” Mumbai? “No points even talking about that city.” The post resonated deeply with users. One shared a personal struggle, stating, “My current CTC is the same as my annual rent. Last year my hike was 8% whereas my rent increased by 10. My only saving grace is that mine is a two-income household.” Another lamented, “This is really unfortunate that one person’s income is completely consumed for rent. It is as if you are working for your landlord.” Some advised drastic measures to counter the rent crunch. One user bluntly suggested, “Bro, re-evaluate your lifestyle. Why tf is your rent same as your monthly salary? Move out. Look for other areas. Commute from further away places.” Others proposed homeownership as an...",

This time, wreckage from the latest explosion was seen streaming from the skies over Florida. It was not immediately known whether the spacecraft's self-destruct system had kicked in to blow it up. The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off from Texas. SpaceX caught the first-stage booster back at the pad with giant mechanical arms, but engines on the spacecraft on top started shutting down as it streaked eastward for what was supposed to be a controlled entry over the Indian Ocean, half a world away. Contact was lost less than 10 minutes into the flight as the spacecraft went into an out-of-control spin. Starship reached nearly 90 miles (150 kilometers) in altitude before trouble struck and before four mock satellites could be deployed. It was not immediately clear where it came down, but images of flaming debris were captured from Florida, including near Cape Canaveral, and posted online. The space-skimming flight was supposed to last an hour. The Federal Aviation...",

Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication reputable news agency proofread by Fabiola Sánchez The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change and habitat loss, experts said Thursday. The annual butterfly count doesn't calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there. Mexico's Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year's figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began. After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer. Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency's director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the...",

The economic output of Guangdong has ranked first in the country for 36 consecutive years. As a pioneer in China’s reform and opening-up movement that began in the late 1970s, Guangdong seized upon the opportunity to thrive with global industrial transfers over four decades, cultivating labour-intensive industries and its own manufacturing brands that helped carve out a reputation as the “world’s factory”. The province then gradually evolved into a technological hub for China as the home to tech giants such as Huawei, Tencent and DJI, as well as electric-vehicle makers BYD and Xpeng. In recent years, however, the province has borne the brunt of the increasing economic headwinds facing the country. Guangdong’s export-reliant economy, for example, is vulnerable to rising global trade tensions. Domestically, China’s other economic engines – such as Jiangsu province, the current No 2 – are also quickly catching up, putting pressure on Guangdong to keep its crown. Earlier this year, Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, also emerged as a new hub of innovation as breakthroughs by...",

So much of the commentary is focused on the attendances and Covid played a significant part in that. Cooped up at home with no live spotting events, we were like cattle bursting through the gates when restrictions were lifted. People were willing to try something new, and haven’t looked back. Investment is also increasing and it’s great to look around the league and see impressive, innovative people taking clubs to new heights.

It’s just the two pints for me, because I need to leave room for the red wine when I get home! But I’m always bumping into football heads in there and I can’t remember a time when the League of Ireland chat has been so positive. Anyway, there we were last Saturday and Armagh v Dublin was on TV. There’s about seven screens in the Willows, so it was hard to avoid it. It’s not the first time I’ve been forced to watch a GAA match but I was really struck by this one.

With India’s mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy poised to cause trouble, coach Gary Stead is preparing for a two-pronged challenge that could define their chances in the ultimate showdown. New Zealand’s pace spearhead Henry, who claimed five wickets against India in the Group A clash, remains under an injury cloud after landing awkwardly while taking a crucial catch to dismiss Heinrich Klaasen in the second semi-final in Lahore on Wednesday. The 31-year-old has been leading New Zealand’s pace attack, especially after the retirements of Trent Boult and Tim Southee. His absence could leave a glaring hole in the line-up, potentially handing India a significant advantage in the final. Despite the injury, Henry returned to bowl the 44th over, dismissing Kagiso Rabada and finishing with figures of two for 43. He currently leads the bowling charts in the 50-over tournament with 10 wickets but is still nursing a sore shoulder. His determination to keep playing under such circumstances highlights his crucial role in New Zealand’s quest for the title. Coach Gary Stead is hopeful the pacer will be fit for Sunday’s Champions Trophy final. “Matt obviously landed on his shoulder and it was pretty uncomfortable. The positive thing from our perspective is he got back out there to bowl. We’ve had some scans and stuff done on him...",

Trump imposed more blanket tariffs on Chinese imports this week, following a similar move last month — levies expected to hit hundreds of billions of dollars in total trade.

He warned the “law of the jungle\" could take hold if nations were to pursue purely their own interests. ‘China, US Must Co-Exist Peacefully’ Wang touted Beijing’s cooperation with the United States in the fight against the fentanyl epidemic, in which Washington has accused China of being complicit in justifying its tariffs.

The move will mean lower monthly payments for homeowners who have moved from a fixed rate and chosen not to take another mortgage product with the bank. The rate has been reduced by 0.25 percentage points, from 6.99% to 6.74% – the bank’s lowest SVR since January 2023. In general, homeowners can end up on their bank’s SVR when their initial deal comes to an end. SVR rates are set by individual banks. The move follows the recent quarter-point cut in the Bank of England base rate, to 4.5%. Oli O’Donoghue, HSBC UK’s director of mortgage lending, said: “Following a review, we are reducing our standard variable rate to 6.74%, which will benefit those customers who have chosen to transition onto an SVR after their fixed-rate term has finished.” The bank has not disclosed how many customers are on its SVR. In general, people on SVR typically have a smaller outstanding balance than those on a fixed-rate or tracker mortgage. HSBC UK said it is also expanding the availability of its mortgages to foreign national residents in the UK, by bringing lending rules for foreign nationals into line with UK residents for those who come direct to the bank, following similar changes to broker-originated mortgages last year. Among the changes, its standard policy requirements will apply where just one customer on an application has indefinite leave to remain. This is a change from requiring that both customers...",

        "content": "Guglielmo Vicario has said he “understands the frustration of the fans” after the Tottenham goalkeeper was involved in an emotional exchange after his side’s 1-0 defeat at AZ in the first leg of their Europa League tie. Vicario kept Ange Postecoglou’s side in contention to reach the quarter-finals with several fine saves as Spurs put in a disappointing performance in the Netherlands. The Italian went to the away fans after the full-time whistle and raised his arms in a gesture that appeared to be encouraging them to show more support. That did not go down well with some and Vicario reacted angrily before leaving the pitch. “I can assume the disappointment [was] for the night because we didn’t play our football,” he said. “So I can understand the frustration of the fans. But we still have a lot to play for, especially in the second leg. It’s just a way of trying to stay together because we have the opportunity to go through to the next round.” Asked whether the Tottenham supporters could make a difference in Thursday’s second leg, when Rodrigo Bentancur will be suspended after a yellow card, he said: “We need them every game, home and away. We know they are very important for us and now is a big moment of the season and with them we can play with one more man on the pitch, so it’s so important ... It’s the moment to stick together.” The Europa League is Tottenham’s only chance of a trophy this season. They are 13th in the Premier League and entertain Bournemouth on Sunday.",

AZ will take a deserved 1-0 lead to north London for Thursday's last-16 decider after Lucas Bergvall's freak own goal earned them a first win over an English club in 13 attempts. Ange Postecoglou 's toothless side did not muster a shot on target and had Vicario to thank for keeping the scoreline down , with the Italian saving from Troy Parrott and Ernest Poku either side of the interval. Vicario went over to try to rally a despondent away end after the final whistle, demonstrably waving his arms in what appeared to be a call for more support. The travelling Spurs fans responded angrily, leaving Vicario looking frustrated after the exchange. Asked if supporters were being critical of the players, Vicario said: \"They can do [that]. \"They have to be, they must be disappointed for the game we played but we still have another game to play against AZ at our place, so it's the moment to stick together now because we can go through this round. \"I can [understand] the disappointment for the night because we didn't play our football.

A military modernization team is currently studying the problem against the backdrop of a shortage of as many as 5,000 soldiers, Lt.-Gen. Mike Wright told CBC News in a recent interview at the NATO training centre in Adazi, Latvia. \"The army we have now is not the army that we need for the future,\" Wright said when asked if he was satisfied with the equipping of the troops on the Western military's alliance's deterrence mission in Eastern Europe. He made his remarks against a backdrop of threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to annex Canada through economic force. Several senior Canadian commanders have recently faced questions about how long the country could hold out if relations with Washington deteriorated further and the United States chose a military option. WATCH | Top soldier says major modernization of army is coming: Wright wouldn't comment, other than to say ties with the American military have remained unchanged and strong despite the political rhetoric. \"I'm not even going to imagine the unimaginable,\" he said.

        "content": "Ottawa's tech sector is caught in the whirlwind of U.S. President Donald Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs, with some companies weighing whether tariffs will force them to move operations south of the border. Genomadix is a biotech company located in the Kanata North tech park. It produces a small silver cube that does rapid genetic testing. That cube helps doctors treat strokes, by identifying which patients won't respond to a common drug. CEO Steve Edgett says about 75 per cent of their shipments go to the U.S. In the few days Canada faced U.S. tariffs this week, he watched business dry up. Steve Edgett, CEO of Genomadix, holds the cube his company produces at their Kanata facility. (Francis Ferland/CBC) \"Our ordering pattern has ground to an absolute halt this week,\" he said. \"People are standing on the sidelines and trying to wait to find out more information.\" Genomadix sources many of its materials from Canada – but not the reagents that are vital to genetic testing. They come from the U.S., and replacing those suppliers would be a difficult and lengthy process. Edgett says the company has been growing rapidly. It's now looking at a genetic test to help treat Alzheimer's. But most of the opportunities are in the U.S., and sustained tariffs would put that growth at risk. \"Even just the delays and the slowdowns that we're seeing, we'll look at hundreds of thousands of dollars of costs, immediately, and potentially millions of dollars of costs over the course of the...",

On its website, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says plum pox virus (PPV) can \"drastically reduce\" yields of plants including peaches, nectarines, plums, apricots, cherries and almonds. The Niagara Region is known for its stonefruit, with Tourism Niagara boasting the region grows more than 80 per cent of Canada's peaches. PPV \"is a serious threat to Canada's tender fruit, fruit processing and nursery industries,\" the CFIA said in a Feb. 24 news release. Since 2011, the CFIA has monitored and managed the virus, which doesn't harm people but negatively affects stonefruit trees. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has expanded an area in which it prohibits the movement and propagation of certain plants to prevent the spread of plum pox virus. (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) In 2013, CFIA established a \"regulated area\" which includes the northern part of Niagara bordering Lake Ontario and part of east Hamilton. In the regulated area, it's forbidden to move and grow plants that host the virus.

President Donald Trump had announced days before that he planned to increase the extra tariff he put on Chinese imports in February to 20%. Would he? By Tuesday, the last day of the Toy Fair, attendees had their answer , and the talk about how it would affect the prices of playthings grew more urgent. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are sourced from China, according to the Toy Association, a national industry group that sponsors the show formerly known as the North American International Toy Fair. Many toy makers are now renegotiating prices with retailers and taking a hard look at their products to see if they can cut costs. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said price increases of 15% to 20% are expected on games, dolls, cars, and other toys by the back-to-school shopping season. The price range that U.S. consumers are willing to pay is anywhere from $4.99 to $19.99, leaving little wiggle room to raise prices, he said. | “It’s untenable,” Ahearn said, noting that small businesses make up roughly 96% of the American toy industry. Trump also moved forward this week with 25% tariffs on products imported from Canada and Mexico . Some companies have moved some of their manufacturing to Mexico to be closer to the U.S. On...",

Just three-and-a-half years later, the casino giant is teetering on the brink of collapse. The story by the Herald’s investigative reporter Nick McKenzie and the now executive producer of the 7.30 program, Joel Tozer, revealed Star had been enabling suspected money laundering, organised crime, large-scale fraud and foreign interference within its Australian casinos for years, even though its board was warned its anti-money-laundering controls were failing. An 11th-hour deal to save the Star Entertainment Group raises as many questions as it answers. Credit: Brent Lewin “Star Entertainment has portrayed itself as the cleanskin casino company compared to its rival, Crown Resorts, whose reputation has been shattered by the findings of two royal commissions and a regulator’s investigation,” Nick and Joel wrote. “But an investigation by The Sydney Morning Herald , The Age and 60 Minutes has confirmed that Star has engaged in many of the same improper practices while escaping the withering public examinations faced by Crown’s executives and key shareholder James Packer.” This was journalism at its finest. It exposed corporate wrongdoing, uncovered extraordinary criminal activity, and embarrassed regulators who had been asleep at the wheel during all of it.

Hiring managers have begun to populate their interviews with questions about how prospective employees use AI in their work. According to industry experts, these types of questions will become more common as time goes on and AI continues to advance. In fact, 88% of C-suite leaders say speeding up AI adoption is important over the next year, according to LinkedIn’s 2025 Work Change Report . This can be daunting for people who don’t work in technology. You certainly don’t want to tell a hiring manager that you use ChatGPT to write and ideate everything for you, but you also don’t want to seem behind. We asked three hiring experts in different industries how non-techies can best navigate questions about AI in a job interview. | Tip 1: Show curiosity Good news! Not being skilled in AI isn’t a deal-breaker. Even if you are far from an AI expert, you should highlight your curiosity about the technology in your interviewing process, notes Gillian Davis, chief people officer at strategic communications firm Mission North. She recommends that job applicants speak about a willingness to learn and adapt quickly. “It’s most important that you’re interested in AI, that you have a curiosity about it, and that you’re willing to look at it as a powerful complement to talent,” Davis says.

Sunwing stranded the Waterloo, Ont., city councillor, and his wife, Tanya McConnell, in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, for five days after cancelling their Feb. 17 flight home. Sunwing, which offers flights and vacation packages, cancelled dozens of flights in February, amid winter storms and the Delta plane crash that caused slowdowns at Toronto's Pearson airport. According to Canada's air passenger regulations , when airlines cancel flights, they must offer to rebook passengers free of charge on the next available flight. For situations outside the airlines' control (like bad weather), large carriers (like Sunwing ) must transport passengers within 48 hours of their original departure time, or else book them on another carrier. Six groups of Sunwing passengers who experienced cancelled flights last month told CBC News that Sunwing didn't follow those rules. In Roach and McConnell's case, the airline flew the couple home five days after their scheduled departure date — not within the mandated 48 hours. \"It's very disheartening to think that a large airline like this would break that rule,\" said Roach. \"There was a real lack of communication from...",

On Monday, N.W.T. Supreme Court Justice Nicolas Devlin ordered lawyer Andrew Rogerson to return a $90,000 retainer from Barlas he illegally spent, and to pay all legal costs incurred by the First Nation during the legal action against Rogerson. It marks the conclusion of a particularly colourful offshoot of Lutsel K'e Dene First Nation's (LKDFN) wide-ranging civil action against Barlas, which is still ongoing. Barlas — who has been accused of misappropriating $12 million from LKDFN companies — hired Rogerson just days before all of Barlas's assets were frozen because of his alleged fraud. Barlas paid Rogerson a $90,000 retainer. Rogerson then transported hundreds of ounces of precious metals out of N.W.T. for Barlas and kept them in a safe at his Ontario law office. Among the metals were 300 ounces of gold — equivalent to 8.5 kilograms, or the weight of a large pug dog. Both the $90,000 retainer Barlas paid Rogerson and the precious metals were included under the court order which froze all of Barlas's assets. Despite this, Rogerson paid himself the entire retainer, providing no documentation to show what work for Barlas he had done to earn the money. Lawyers for LKDFN first reached out to Rogerson in 2023, asking him to disclose and return the $90,000 and the precious metals. After...",

        "content": "The popular show Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin (GHKPM), starring Param Singh, Vaibhavi Hankare, and Sanam Johar, is set to undergo a significant change. While the show recently went through a generational leap, the makers now announced that the show's on-air timing have been changed. GHKPM's new time slot As part of the channel's revised scheduling, the show will now air at 7:30 PM, effective Tuesday. This development comes amid speculation that the show's declining TRP ratings post the generational leap may have prompted the time slot change. Once a top performer, Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin has struggled to maintain its position among the top five, slipping to 11th place with a rating of 1.4 in the latest TRP rankings. To announce the new time slot, Star Plus released a promotional video featuring Munawar Faruqui. In the clip, Munawar jokingly narrates the show's storyline. Munawar reveals the upcoming twist In the video Munawar can be heard saying, \"Esko usse pyaar hai, usko iss se pyaar hai, aur issko jisse pyaar hai wo hai hi nahi! Matlab samjha tumko? Merko bhi nahi samajhta.\" He then introduces Tejaswini, adding, \"Esko acha khaasa doctor ne propose kiya tha, lekin nahi, inko life mein chahiye basad! Insaan drama se dhur bhaagta hai, aur ye drama ke taraf bhaagti hai.\" The promotional reel also teases some major upcoming twists, including Neil's proposal to Tejaswini and her shocking reaction. With its engaging narrative and dramatic turns, Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin...",

        "content": "Chennai: In a heart-breaking display of courage, a Class 12 student from Tamil Nadu appeared for his board exam just hours after losing his mother to a heart condition. Sunil Kumar, from Valliyur in Tirunelveli district, faced a tragedy on the morning of March 3, the first day of the Class 12 public examinations, when his mother, Subalakshmi, passed away. Despite his grief, Sunil gathered his strength and sat for the exam, honouring his mother’s dream of educating her children. Sunil’s father, Krishnamoorthy, died six years ago, leaving Subalakshmi to raise Sunil and his younger sister, Yasini, alone, as per reports. Her sudden death left the family shattered. However, relatives and neighbours rallied around Sunil, encouraging him to take the exam in memory of his mother’s wishes. Before leaving for the examination centre, Sunil placed his hall ticket at his mother’s feet and broke down in tears. His family comforted him, reminding him that his mother would have wanted him to continue his education and succeed. Support from the State Government Tamil Nadu’s Education Minister Anbil Mahesh’s team reached out to Sunil, offering emotional and practical support. A representative from the minister’s office said, “We assured him, like a brother, that the minister is with him and that he will receive all the help he needs.” Chief Minister MK Stalin also acknowledged Sunil’s resilience, sharing a post about the incident on X (formerly Twitter). He wrote, “This is the Tamil...",

And you shouldn't have been up there so long.” US President Donald Trump had some words of appreciation for NASA’s Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams' hair as he told a pair of stranded astronauts aboard the International Space Station that \"we're coming up to get you.\" Trump, 78, mused Thursday about the possibility of personally launching a rescue team into orbit to help bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Williams back to Earth — and blasted former President Joe Biden for their eight-day mission stretching to nine months and counting. “Biden left them up there,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, ‘Do me a favour. Can you get them out?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He is preparing to go up, I think in two weeks.” He added that Musk is “right now preparing a ship to go up” and get them. \"And I see the woman with the wild hair, good, solid head of hair she's got. There's no kidding, there's no games with her hair,” Trump said during remarks in the Oval Office Thursday while talking about Williams.

Kyrgios’ retirement stemmed from a wrist injury, which he had encountered during a recent practice session at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. On Thursday, Kyrgios took to the hard courts to face Botis van de Zandschulp, with the latter winning the first set 7-6. The Australian fell 0-3 behind in the second set soon enough. Kyrgios then opted to retire, with his wrist injury proving very painful to play through. He was reduced to tears. Watch the video here: It is the same wrist that Kyrgios underwent surgery on two years ago. “I wasn’t too confident that I was going to be able to play today, to be honest. Two days ago, I had to stop my practice because I felt pain in my wrist. I felt like it was okay to take the court,\" Kyrgios said later. “No one in the sport has had a wrist reconstruction and tried to play after that. There have been players that have had wrist surgeries and are nowhere near as bad as what I had,\" Kyrgios added. The Aussie tennis star said that he knew it would be touch and go after pain in his wrist forced him to stop practising earlier this week. Kyrgios added that he had not given up on the idea of playing the Miami Open, which begins on March 19. He said...",

Kurbaan Kurbaan featured the now a real-life couple - Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan. Hate Story The bold backless avatar of Bengali actress Paoli Dam didn't go down too well with all. After the West Bengal Censorship Board's interference with the posters of 'Hate Story', the makers were ordered that actress's back be painted blue. Julie Neha Dhupia's Julie poster invited the wrath of moral police back then. Jism 2 The sensual poster was apparently copied from fashion designer Felix Bendish's poster for a fashion show in 2010 in Goa.

        "creator": null,
        "content": "Hydrogen is emerging as a key player in the clean energy revolution. But this powerful, invisible gas comes with a challenge: its highly flammable nature makes it difficult to detect, posing huge safety risks. The absence of a smell makes hydrogen particularly hard for humans to detect. Now, scientists at the University of Manchester, in collaboration with King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), have developed a new hydrogen sensor for safer gas detection during leaks. Interestingly, this sensor rapidly detects minute hydrogen concentrations within seconds. Moreover, the device surpasses commercial alternatives with its small size, affordability, and low power consumption. “This sensor could offer a breakthrough in hydrogen safety technology. By combining affordability, reliability, and high performance, it has the potential to transform how we handle hydrogen across industries, homes, and transportation. I hope our organic sensor will help build trust in emerging hydrogen technologies, making them more accessible and safer for everyone,” said Thomas Anthopoulos, who led this sensor development. How does the hydrogen sensor work The innovative hydrogen sensor functions through a process called “p-doping,” a technique in which oxygen molecules are introduced to the sensor’s active material, thereby elevating the concentration of positive electrical charges. When hydrogen gas encounters the sensor, it initiates a chemical reaction with the pre-existing...",

At the launch event held at the Secretariat, Stalin handed over QR codes to auto-rickshaw drivers, marking the rollout of the initiative. The initiative leverages technology to enable real-time monitoring and seamless integration with existing vehicle tracking systems. Greater Chennai Police generated 88,859 unique QR codes for auto rickshaws and share autos operating within the city and surrounding areas. These codes will be fixed behind the driver's seat and can be easily scanned by passengers. By scanning the QR code and pressing the SOS button, passengers can instantly alert the Police control room, sharing the vehicle’s location, driver details, and ownership information. Passengers can also call the emergency helpline 112 for immediate police assistance. A key feature of the QR code system is its ability to identify passenger's location accurately during SOS alerts, which is especially crucial at night or during solo rides. This enables a swift response from police using their patrol vehicles. Additionally, Police has partnered with Rapido, Ola, and Uber to link their in-app emergency alerts directly to the police control room. If a passenger triggers an SOS alert via these apps, the police control room will receive real-time tracking...",

Her arrest by ICE agents was recently captured on video by residents of El Monte, a city east of Los Angeles. The arrest, which also involved her eldest son, Jonathan, set off a chain reaction that has disrupted the fragile balance thousands of Latino families in the United States are living under. Yolanda was the primary caregiver for her 21-year-old daughter, Xitlali Tejeda, who is battling bone cancer and is confined to a wheelchair. The arrest has sparked widespread outrage across California, leading to small protests in the streets and in front of the immigration detention center where Magallón has been held since the end of February. Magallón, a 50-year-old Mexican woman who has lived in the United States since 2002, was arrested when she stepped outside her home to move her car. As soon as she left the house, agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) emerged from several unmarked cars to question her. She remained silent as several neighbors watched. “Everything is fine, you haven’t done anything,” one of her four children tells her while recording on his phone his mother being handcuffed on February 24. “But they are...",

However, whenever a vacation is considered, the first thing that comes to mind is the budget, especially for international travel.

Here are six countries you can visit with a budget of Rs 60,000 only. To travel overseas on a budget of Rs 60,000, you must choose destinations that are affordable for Indian tourists.

Nepal Nepal is one of the most budget-friendly travel destinations for Indians. It is close to India, and Indian citizens can visit without a visa.

He was more subdued than usual and he recalled how much he missed his leader Soobin, who was on hiatus. Following this, he played a few songs, his eyes noticeably welling up. The fanbase was concerned and anxious, with many encouraging him ‘to cry it out’. While anguished, fans were moved that he trusted them enough to show his feelings so visibly. \"They have always been so real and true with us,\" one wrote. The emotions run high, especially when you’re part of a devoted fan base. In June 2022, BTS leader RM broke down during their anniversary dinner, while discussing painful subjects such as the hiatus, and also expressing how he would always want to keep performing for the band’s fans, and never would want to disappoint them. As he later said, he has never hidden anything from his fans, and wanted to see them as they are, not just as singers on stage. The rest of the members were visibly emotional and teared up. This isn’t their first time crying in public: The band has shed tears on stage, while receiving awards, and showed their most raw, vulnerable moments on camera. In 2023, Suga visibly teared up during his D-Day performances, which fans saw as an emotional release and catharsis. These instances highlight that crying, whether it's sobbing or quietly wiping away tears, doesn’t always need to happen behind closed doors. It’s also a step toward breaking the stigma...",

He attributed the decline partly to a dehorning program in KwaZulu-Natal, the region most affected by poaching. However, the minister expressed concern about a recent increase in rhino poaching in Kruger National Park, where 88 rhinos were poached last year, up from 78 in 2023, due to its remote and difficult-to-police terrain. The government is using lie-detector tests on staff in poaching hotspots like Kruger and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi parks as part of its anti-poaching strategy, according to the minister's statement.",

Anurag Kashyap’s much-anticipated noir thriller Kennedy, starring Rahul Bhat and Sunny Leone, continues to languish in uncertainty despite its screening at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. The film, which was caught in the financial turmoil of ZEE Studios, remains unreleased. In a recent conversation with The Hindu, Kashyap reflected on the setback, explaining that while the film has been locked and passed censorship, its fate now rests in the hands of a studio grappling with losses and the departure of key executives who had backed the project. But Kashyap is no stranger to stalled projects. He revealed that Kennedy originally took shape as a script for Malayalam superstar Mohanlal, which he had envisioned with longtime collaborator and cinematographer Rajeev Ravi as the director. When that plan fell through, Kashyap repurposed the narrative, ultimately shaping it into Kennedy. The film’s protagonist, Uday Shetty, an undercover cop, has been a character Kashyap has carried with him for years. He credited filmmaker Sudhir Mishra for first narrating the real-life story of a man in the Mumbai police force, which later inspired the film. Interestingly, Kashyap also hinted at a potential sequel in the form of a web series, where the character of Uday Shetty survives the events of Kennedy. Beyond Kennedy, Kashyap also spoke candidly about his...",

A new executive order mandates that applicants disclose their social media handles, reinforcing the government’s efforts to enhance national security. On March 5, 2025, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a notification in the Federal Register outlining the requirement for immigrants to provide information about their social media accounts. This regulation, enacted through Executive Order 14161, was signed by Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, as part of broader efforts to assess potential security threats. Under this policy, immigration officers will request social media handles but will not require applicants to disclose passwords. This measure applies to individuals seeking entry, permanent residency, or citizenship in the United States. Reports indicate that this new regulation could affect over 35 lakh immigration applicants annually. The DHS has provided a 60-day public comment period before finalising the policy. If implemented, applicants in nine key immigration categories will be required to submit their social media information as part of their applications. Categories of Applicants Affected The social media disclosure requirement applies to the following US immigration forms: N-400 – Application for US Citizenship...",

Parents-of-six Sofina Begum, 52, and Aminur Rahman, 55, had previously pleaded guilty to a total of nine housing offences. Judge Emma Smith, sitting at Snaresbrook Crown Court , previously said she was looking at sentencing the couple, of Wapping, east London, not on the fatality or the fire, but on the housing offences which they pleaded guilty to in November 2023. On Thursday, Judge Smith ordered Begum to pay a fine of £10,000 and £2,000 in prosecution costs. She was also told to pay a confiscation order of £78,049. Rahman, who was said to be of “no means”, was ordered to pay a fine of £2,000 and a confiscation order of £1.1p. The court heard the pair had no source of income other than the value of the Maddocks House property which stood at £155,000. Sentencing, Judge Smith said: “I am satisfied the two of you were equally involved in the criminality and shared financial gain... You showed a blatant disregard for the law and the occupants.” The property, which was licenced for three people from two households, is believed to have been occupied by 23 people.

King Charles has recorded his Apple Music radio show, named “The King's Music Room”, in his office at Buckingham Palace. The one-off show, released as “an interesting and innovative way” to celebrate Commonwealth Day according to the monarch, will feature the king sharing “songs which have brought (him) joy”, as well as anecdotes on the impact music has had on him. \"Throughout my life, music has meant a great deal to me. I know that is also the case for so many others,” he said. “It has that remarkable ability to bring happy memories flooding back from the deepest recesses of our memory, to comfort us in times of sadness, and to take us to distant places.” \"But perhaps, above all, it can lift our spirits to such a degree, and all the more so when it brings us together in celebration. In other words, it brings us joy.\" So, which artists have made the cut? Apple did not reveal the full playlist ahead of the show's release on Monday 10 March, but we do know that Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue, Grace Jones, Nigerian-American singer Davido and recent Oscar-performer RAYE all feature in the king’s top tracks. A trailer released today features the 76-year-old monarch introducing the project from behind a desk inside Buckingham Palace, intercut with a band of military guardsmen in the palace courtyard playing Marley’s reggae classic ‘Could You Be Loved’.

The apex court said that work on the project had already begun, refusing to overturn the Bombay High Court's decision in favour of the Adani Group. The matter was with the SC after UAE-based Seclink Technologies Corporation filed an appeal challenging the Maharashtra government's decision to award the Dharavi project to Adani Properties Limited after canceling Seclink's earlier bid. The SC further directed that all payments related to the project should be carried out from a single escrow account. Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna-led bench orally remarked that Bombay HC's decision was justified as it would also include developing a railway line. The court has sent notices to the Maharashtra government and Adani Properties. The next hearing has been scheduled for May 25. Seclink Technologies, which initially bid Rs 7,200 crore for the Dharavi redevelopment project, informed the Supreme Court that its ready to increase its offer by 20%. The court directed Seclink to submit an affidavit with the revised bid details. In December 2024, the Bombay High Court upheld the Maharashtra government's decision to cancel Seclink’s 2019 bid and issue a fresh tender in 2022, which ultimately awarded the project to the Adani Group. Seclink later appealed to the Supreme Court. The government defended its move, citing economic shifts between 2019 and 2022,...",

The Giggly Squad podcast host received criticism for her words while speaking to the rapper at Vanity Fair’s Oscar after-party red carpet on March 2. Why did Hannah Berner apologize? During the red carpet event, Berner and her co-host, Paige DeSorbo, interviewed Megan Thee Stallion, a Grammy-winning artist. While DeSorbo praised Megan’s music as a daily motivator, Berner took a different approach. She exclaimed, “Your music has literally made me, like, when I want to fight someone, I listen to your music.” Megan responded, “You want to throw that fighting shit out the window. You want to get cute and be a bad bitch.” Despite Megan Thee Stallion’s attempt to steer the conversation positively, Hannah Berner doubled down, adding, “When people are talking shit, I go, ‘Turn on Megan Thee Stallion!’” (via ) The comments drew criticism online, with many accusing Berner of perpetuating microaggressions and racial insensitivity. Megan Thee Stallion’s music often carries messages of confidence and self-empowerment, and she has condemned violence, especially against Black women, in the past. In response to the backlash, Hannah Berner took to Instagram Stories to address the situation. She wrote, “Interviewing Megan Thee Stallion was a dream of mine.

But I would say that I personally project the economy to perhaps... it’s going to do better than it has in the last 10 years in 2025. “And there are reasons for that. Part of the budget, we expect, we project 4.6% growth, which, even the 3.84% that we achieved in the last quarter of last year was the highest in three years.

On January 15th, Yoon became the first sitting president to be arrested on criminal charges after days of a standoff between presidential guards and arresting authorities. “The court’s decision to cancel the arrest showed this country’s rule of law is still alive,” Yoon’s lawyers said in a statement. Yoon's lawyers also said he may not be immediately released because prosecutors can appeal. The prosecutors' office did not immediately comment on the ruling. The defence team had argued that a warrant issued on January 19th that extended Yoon’s detention was invalid because the request filed by prosecutors was procedurally flawed. Yoon said his December 3rd martial law declaration was needed to root out “anti-state” elements but lifted the decree six hours later after parliament voted to reject it. He has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule. Weeks later he was impeached by the opposition-led parliament on accusations he had violated his constitutional duty by declaring martial law. The constitutional court is expected to rule soon on his impeachment. – Reuters",

And she said, ‘No.’ She’s like, ‘Ask me tomorrow,’ and I was like, ‘All right.’ And then I did, and I was sober, and it was nice.” (via ) Post Malone spoke highly of Jamie in past interviews, calling her the “No. 1 mom in the f**king universe” and expressing admiration for her heart and parenting. “I’ve always...",

        "content": "Reliance Industries, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has been under intense bearish pressure on the BSE, shedding 25 per cent of its value since it peaked at Rs 1,608.95 on 8 July. This steep decline—occurring amid a retail slowdown and weak refining margins—has resulted in a staggering Rs 5.4 lakh crore in market value disappearing as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) aggressively offload the stock. With the stock underperforming the Nifty by 10 per cent since January 2024, pessimism has reached extreme levels. Nevertheless, a glimmer of hope has emerged as the stock has rebounded 4 per cent in the last two trading sessions, suggesting that bargain hunters might be stepping in. Yet, the key question remains: is this rebound merely a short-lived dead-cat bounce or a sign that the worst is over? Analysts at Jefferies contend that the current valuation is overly bearish. They point out that the market capitalisation now implies an enterprise value of just US$48 billion for Reliance’s retail business, a stark contrast to US$106 billion during its last funding round. “A combination of same-store sales growth and area additions should restore 15 per cent growth in Retail in FY26. A tariff hike, likely Jio listing, and improvement in O2C profitability are other potential triggers,” Jefferies stated, labelling the valuation as the cheapest since COVID-19. The firm maintains a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,660. Jio continues to be a bright spot in the conglomerate,...",

For Gigi Hadid’s latest outing, it’s a throwback to the slick ’50s. Hadid arrived at the Le Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris for the Schiaparelli fall 2025 show , dressed in a black waxed leather bomber jacket, black straight leg jeans, and loafers. She wore her hair in a low-key, slick backed bun—a departure from her silver-toned flippy bob to match her gilded, mixed metal Moschino dress from her appearance at the Louvre earlier in the week. She looked every bit of a ’50s greaser, sans Danny Zuko’s Ford Deluxe convertible—or the fuckboys that hang around Le Marais. The overall look was playfully androgynous for Hadid, whose day-to-day style of recent revolves around knits from her own brand, Guest in Residence, and denim. Amid the tumult of fashion week, it’s a failsafe formula. Her pre-show outfit spoke to some of the style codes that Daniel Roseberry’s Schiaparelli show expanded upon. “All of the women I know are dressing for themselves and other women. I was imagining a global pandemic where mankind [as in just men], ceased to exist and women inherited the earth. What would they do with the remnants of male archetypes?” Roseberry said backstage. That meant some old Hollywood masculine tropes through a female gaze—suits with nipped in waists, leather pants like chaps,...",

The Australian Financial Review reported this week that Healthscope had retained insolvency experts KordaMentha to prepare a contingency plan in case it is placed into voluntary administration.

It provides public hospital services for around 350,000 people in the Sydney region. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email It is the only such arrangement in the NSW health system and a voluntary administration would put the major facility in unchartered waters, potentially triggering a “step in event” and requiring intervention from the state government. Healthscope also operates 37 private hospitals around Australia. All private hospital groups have been facing headwinds since the Covid pandemic, which caused prolonged shutdowns. Since then, private hospitals and private health insurers have been locked in a protracted battle over how much private hospitals should be paid from patients’ private insurance premiums. The problems for Healthscope are particularly acute. It was purchased in 2019 by the Canadian private equity fund Brookfield, and is burdened with more than $1.6bn in debt. Early this week,...",

Read More India’s Knowledge Realty Trust has applied for approval to launch an initial public offering (IPO) worth 62 billion rupees ($711 million), potentially becoming the country’s largest real estate investment trust (REIT) listing. The REIT, backed by Blackstone Inc. and Sattva Developers Pvt., owns office spaces in major Indian cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai. The proceeds from the offering will primarily be used to reduce outstanding debt. As India emerges as a key market for equity sales, REITs are becoming increasingly popular due to their potential for delivering attractive returns. Currently, there are four listed REITs in India, including Brookfield India and Embassy Office Parks. According to the draft red herring prospectus filed with India’s market regulator, Knowledge Realty is the largest REIT in India by gross asset value. In the last fiscal year, it reported a net operating income of approximately 29 billion rupees ($333 million) and maintained a committed occupancy rate of 89.9% as of December. The IPO will be managed by Morgan Stanley India, Kotak Mahindra Capital, Axis Capital, and BofA Securities India, among others.",

Even if you didn’t care for the political situation of the show, you would like this slow-burn of a series that concentrates on the beliefs of a Prince who refuses to believe that his world is changing, but at the same time shows how he manipulates this new world to his old world ways. And yes, he also has to deal with his rebellious family... Prince Salina (played by Kim Rossi Stuart) loves his nephew Tancredi (Saul Nanni from Disney’s Alex &Co) who lives off him even though he’s fighting with Garibaldi's nationalist troops hell bent on killing the aristocrats. Salina’s daughter Concetta is inordinately attracted to Tancredi who flirts with her for her affection. Prince Salina has four other children and a wife but their roles are peripheral to the central theme of the inevitability of change.

He's also known to be reluctant to take pictures with fans. On more than one occasion over the years, clips have emerged seemingly showing the Manchester United and Ireland legend declining supporters' requests for selfies. However, it appears that Keano doesn't have a blanket ban on taking photos with eager fans as he made an exception this week for a group of school kids. But maybe they got lucky because they are from Cork . Keane, 53, gave a group of young admirers a memory they'll never forget when he agreed to chat with them and pose for pictures during a chance meeting on Wednesday. Cork Beo reports that a number of second-year students at Scoil Mhuire gan Smál (SMGS) were shocked when, during a school trip to the Blarney Woolen Mills store this week, who should they cross paths with but Roy Keane. SMGS staff members Fiona Guiry and Leona Murphy couldn't believe their eyes when one of the greatest footballers this country ever produced appeared before their eyes and another team member, Linda, plucked up the courage to approach the notoriously temperamental pundit to see if he would be up for chatting to the pupils. And once he found it was for a group of schoolkids, Keane showed he can be \"very accommodating\".

Another rating agency ICRA too downgraded its rating for Gensol Engineering. The stock has fallen nearly 40% this week. In the current session, the renewable energy stock rose 16% to Rs 352.90 against a low of Rs 303 on BSE. However, profit-booking took the stock back to the red zone.

Tumbleweed, which we’re reviewing here, is a continuously evolving build comprising the latest stable version of each component, which is updated as and when new code appears. Leap, which is based on SUSE Enterprise Linux, is a stable release that receives periodic updates.The version that we installed was running the 6.6.3-1 kernel (the very latest build was 6.6.4 at the time of writing), and is available with a choice of desktop managers, including Gnome, Xfce, Cinnamon, Mate and KDE Plasma 5, the latter of which tops the installer’s list of options. That’s therefore what we chose for our tests. In our installation, this sat on top of the X11 Window System rather than Wayland.As well as the regular 64-bit and 32-bit builds for desktop use, there are alternative builds for ARM, IBM Z family mainframes, RISC and PowerPC. It will also run on Raspberry Pi.The installer is logical, but not the most friendly on test. Setting up Wi-Fi requires that you know which security protocol your network uses, and we failed on our first three attempts to boot into openSUSE at the end of the process.

META , to assess its compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act. What Happened : The investigation into Scale AI’s adherence to fair pay practices and working conditions was launched about a year ago under the Biden administration, reported Reuters. The startup, established in 2016, has been working with the department over the past year to clarify its business model. Scale AI, which provides a platform for AI-related information exchange and supplies large volumes of accurately labeled data crucial for training advanced tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has contributors in over 9,000 cities and towns. A company spokesperson stated, “The feedback we get from contributors is overwhelmingly positive, and we have dedicated teams to ensure people are paid fairly and feel supported.” Scale AI did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for comment. The company also stated that nearly all contributor payments were timely made, with 90% of payment-related inquiries resolved within three days.

France’s national train operator SNCF said in a statement that traffic was stopped at the request of police. French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said traffic would be ‘’strongly disrupted'' throughout the day with only limited service resuming in the afternoon, and urged travelers to postpone their trips. The bomb was discovered around 4 a.m. by workers doing earth-moving work near the tracks in the Seine-Saint-Denis region. Minesweepers were sent to the site and their operation is still going on. Stranded travelers converged on the station as it opened Friday. The Gare du Nord is a major European transit hub, serving international destinations north of France such as the EU capital, Brussels, and the Netherlands, as well as the main Paris airport and many regional destinations. Bombs left over from World War I or World War II are regularly discovered around France but it is very rare to find them in such a people-packed location. Tabarot, speaking on broadcaster Sud Radio, said local residents and people near the train stations should have “no fear” of a risk of explosion, stressing the procedures in place for defusing and removing such bombs.

        "content": "Filmmaker Kabir Khan aims to challenge stereotypes surrounding immigrants and refugees with his latest project, My Melbourne, an anthology film featuring four unique stories inspired by true events. His segment, Setara, follows the journey of a 15-year-old Afghan girl who finds solace in cricket after fleeing the Taliban and rebuilding her life in Melbourne. Khan, known for films like Ek Tha Tiger and Bajrangi Bhaijaan, said the story emphasizes the contributions immigrants can make when welcomed with open arms. “If you see refugees through just one perspective, they may never be able to contribute. But if you embrace them, they become a valuable part of society,” he told PTI in an interview. The director was inspired by the real-life experiences of Afghan women cricketers who relocated to Melbourne after the Taliban’s takeover. During a visit to the city, he met Setara, a young player whose dream of representing Afghanistan was cut short. “Her story perfectly captured the spirit of resilience and belonging,” Khan said. To ensure authenticity, Khan cast the real Setara in the lead role instead of opting for a known star. “We wanted to keep it real. Setara is the star of her own story,” he added. Produced by Mitu Bhowmick Lange, My Melbourne also features segments by filmmakers Imtiaz Ali, Rima Das, and Onir, exploring themes of diversity across sexuality, gender, disability, and race. The film is set for a theatrical release in India on March 14. While Khan acknowledges its...",

Increasing the allocations for the various schemes, the CM took a minute to quote Muzaffar Assadi, a renowned scholar and political commentator who recently passed away. Siddaramaiah said, “Behind the guarantee schemes lie the suffering of the poor, the violence of poverty, the struggles of women, and the vision of an unequal India.\" He also announced that this year’s budget would focus on six key developmental dimensions: Welfare Programmes Budget, Agriculture and Rural Development Budget, Development-Oriented Budget, Prioritising Urban Development, Investment and Job Creation, and Governance Reforms.

You had to believe her: she was not leaving her band, but a lacklustre relationship, an ex so innocuous they are barely a player in the song. “This time I’m only lookin’ at me, myself and I,” she sang, “I’ma do it on my own now.” On Ruby , it is strongest on the singles “Mantra”, where Jennie cheerleads in a chant-along chorus: “Pretty girls don’t do drama ’less we wanna/It’ll be depending on the day” atop brassy production perfect for prime time commercial placement.",

Pope Francis continued to recover in hospital on Friday, three weeks after he was brought in with pneumonia in both lungs. On Thursday, he thanked people for their prayers in an audio message broadcast. Pope Francis’ voice, discernible through his laboured breaths and in his native Spanish, was recorded Thursday from the hospital and broadcast to the faithful in St Peter’s Square who had gathered for the nightly recitation of the Rosary prayer. “I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square, I accompany you from here,” he said, his voice echoing in the hushed square. “May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you.” The 88-year-old pontiff has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man. The Vatican has given twice-daily updates on Pope Francis' medical condition, but has distributed no photos or video of him since the morning of 14 February, when he held a handful of audiences at the Vatican before being admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital for what was then just a bad case of bronchitis. The illness progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future at the helm of the Catholic Church.

Her initial petition was blocked but later referred to the Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges, and Public Petitions after she re-presented her case.Her refusal to appear before the Ethics Committee, citing a court order restraining the Senate from proceeding with an investigation against her, further intensified tensions.

The port opened to the public on February 1.The bank, however, attributed the delay to MPSA’s alleged failure to submit a duly-approved foreshore lease agreement (FLA) for the area occupied by the port.

        "content": "India has dominated the Champions Trophy, marching unbeaten to the final, where it faces New Zealand on Sunday. However, the hybrid model — ensuring all of India’s matches were played in Dubai — has sparked debate among players and experts. Some call it an undeniable advantage, while others dismiss it as mere excuses. Here’s what they had to say: The Critics: ‘It’s an Advantage’ Michael Atherton (Former England captain) “What about the advantage India have in playing only in Dubai? They don’t have to travel between venues or countries, unlike other teams.” Rassie van der Dussen (South Africa batter) “If you can stay in one place, train in the same facilities, and play on the same pitches, it’s definitely an advantage.” David Miller (South Africa batter) “It’s only a short flight between Pakistan and UAE, but flying out after a game and arriving at 7 AM isn’t ideal.” The Defenders: ‘No Such Advantage’ Gautam Gambhir (Former India opener) “Some people are just perpetual cribbers. This is as much a neutral venue for us as it is for others.” Rajiv Shukla (BCCI Vice President) “The ICC decided this long ago. India plays on different strips, so there’s no question of fair or unfair play.” Steve Smith (Australia batter) “I’m not buying into it. The conditions suit India’s style, but they simply played better.” The Neutral Take Nasser Hussain (Former England captain) “India were smart in their selection. They knew what Dubai would be like and picked spinners accordingly.” Rob Walter...",

While the first half of the month saw an outflow of ₹ 21,272 crore, the selling pressure eased slightly in the second half, with net outflows amounting to ₹ 13,302 crore. In the first four trading sessions of March, FPIs have offloaded Indian equities to the tune of ₹ 22,114 crore, NSDL data showed. “Elevated valuations of Indian equities, alongside concerns about corporate earnings growth, have led to a sustained outflow of FPIs. The earnings reports for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 have been modest, indicating an atmosphere of uncertainty. Revisions to forward earnings have struggled, with downgrades outpacing upgrades, particularly among companies outside the Nifty 50 index,” said Vipul Bhowar, Senior Director - Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors. Sectoral Trends: Broad-Based Selling Continues The data reveals that FPIs were net sellers across most sectors, with financial services experiencing the highest outflows in February. FPIs offloaded financial services stocks worth ₹ 6,991 crore, followed closely by the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, which saw net outflows of ₹ 6,904 crore. Significant selling was also observed in the capital goods sector, with FPIs withdrawing ₹ 4,464 crore, while the...",

Well, we could already see a glimpse of it in the Zohra Jabeen song . And now, we have more details on the film’s last song, all set to be shot on an even grander scale. An inside source from the film suggests that producer Sajid Nadiadwala and team have flown in 500 dancers from Turkey for the shoot. The last song from Sikandar will be remembered for its extravaganza. A source close to the development said, “For the final song of Sikandar, 500 highly skilled dancers from Turkey were specially flown in, bringing their exceptional talent and precision to create an unforgettable visual spectacle. This massive sequence, shot on an enormous scale, required meticulous planning and coordination. The dancers, known for their expertise in high-energy choreography, added a unique flair to the performance, making it one of the most ambitious and visually stunning segments of the film.\" Amid this, several reports of the whopping fee charged by Salman Khan are doing rounds on the web. As per a Filmibeat report, Salman charged a whopping Rs 120 crore for Sikandar. It remains unclear whether he opted for his usual profit-sharing model with this film too.

The default UI is dark, file management windows have black backgrounds and apps are dimmed when they lose focus. Yet somehow, even if you’re not a fan of dark modes (as this writer isn’t), it works.You can switch between windows for some real showmanship: apps swoop around each other to make space, and where two windows sit side by side, they part to let hidden windows through. The default font is skinny but easy on the eye, and while the launcher is too angular for our tastes, that’s a matter of personal preference.Where we think it’s less successful is in detaching the windows buttons – close, maximize and minimize – and putting them up in the screen’s top left corner, where they sit on the end of the menu bar. This is, presumably, why apps without focus are dimmed: so you know which one you’re going to close or enlarge when you click them. A side effect is that when switching between a browser and word processor, if you’re referring to the former while writing in the latter, your reference material will frequently change brightness.Elsewhere, the file manager (called Index) has a grid of quick access buttons for common folders, such as Music, Documents and Pictures – but when they all sport the same icon and there’s no label, as was our experience with the default theme, you have to hover over each one and wait for its name to appear in a tooltip.Buttons in the file manager...",

Aravinth provided a photograph of his personal, unbranded earbuds to the lost and found office and handed it over instead of the victim's AirPods. When the victim was contacted by staff from the lost and found office to verify his lost item, he discovered that the earbuds were not his. Following this an investigation was launched and Aravinth was arrested after it was established that he had misappropriated the Airpods. The victim's AirPods were recovered. According to the chargesheet, Aravinth has been using the AirPods since February 4 after he kept it at Terminal 2 of the Changi Airport. The case came to light on February 28 when the police were alerted about a suspected case of theft at Terminal 2. During his court hearing, Aravinth, who was unrepresented, said he intended to plead guilty, PTI reported quoting Channel News Asia.

        "content": "SEOUL: A South Korean court on Friday ordered impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol to be released from jail, more than a month after he was arrested and indicted over his short-lived imposition of martial law. The decision by the Seoul Central District Court would allow Yoon stand trial while not being physically detained. The hearings in his separate impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court concluded in late February and the court is expected to rule soon on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him. The Seoul Central District Court said it accepted Yoon's request to be released from jail because the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted in late January. The court said the investigative agency that detained Yoon before his formal arrest didn't have legal rights to investigate the criminal rebellion charges. Yoon's defence team welcomed the court's decision and urged prosecutors to release him immediately. The presidential office also welcomed the court's decision, saying it hopes Yoon will swiftly return to work. However, South Korea law allows prosecutors to hold a suspect temporarily while they pursue an appeal. Investigators have alleged that the martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he's convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon's martial law decree, which involved the dispatch of troops and police forces to the National Assembly, evoked traumatic memories of past military...",

From checking your credit score to carrying out proper research on the lender – everything plays an important role. Then there are numerous nuances linked to it. For example, what if the bank offers a loan at a lower rate of interest but charges a high processing fee. Additionally, what if the lender has a high hidden fee . So, you need to be careful of this and more. Let us understand the key tips and tricks so that you can secure a good personal loan at convenient terms and conditions. Getting a personal loan may be easier than ever, but managing to bag the best deal is definitely not as easy as it sounds. Here we list out the key tips and tricks Before applying: First of all, you need to check your credit score . You can check your score without any impact on it. Remember that if the score is over 700, you can bag the best deals (with low interest rate). A score between 650 to 700 can land you an average deal(s). For a score below 650, you need to improve the score before applying. If your score happens to be low, you can apply for secured credit cards (FD-based) for 3 months before applying for a loan. To reduce rate of interest: It is recommended to compare interest rates of different banks and financial institutions by using apps such as BankBazaar and Paisabazaar. You can also apply for pre-approved loans by checking on the bank's app. The bank apps show...",

Stokes, 33, has not played ODIs since the 2023 World Cup, where he reversed his initial decision to retire from the format. His Champions Trophy return was marred by a second hamstring tear in six months, sustained during the third Test against New Zealand. \"I think nothing's off the table really,\" Key was quoted saying in ESPNCricinfo. \"You look at every single option and you think, right, what is the best thing to do? How is that going to impact on other things? \"Ben Stokes is one of the best captains I've ever seen. So it would be stupid not to look at him. It's just the knock-on effect of what that means. \"He's an unbelievably good tactician, which we've seen in Test cricket, but he's a leader of men. He's someone who gets the best out of people. He's someone that, when the pressure is really on, he's able to throw a blanket around the players and actually say, 'no, no, this is the way forward.

Outside Google, Samsung was the first to announce a seven-year update program when it did so for its flagship S24 back in January 2024, a move that was met with applause back then. That means that for up to seven years, compatible devices will be receiving essential updates that keep them running safe while also receiving some new OS features. The update program starts with the HONOR Magic7 Pro, available in the Philippines in 2025, with expansion to more HONOR flagship phones and foldable devices, the brand said. MWC also sees the brand fully commit to AI this year, with what it calls the “HONOR ALPHA PLAN,” which is said to transform the company from a smartphone maker to an “AI device ecosystem company.” The announcement bolsters the current smartphone trend of manufacturers leaning heavily on AI, including Samsung with its Galaxy AI push, Apple with its Apple Intelligence products, and just recently at MWC as well, OPPO with a proclamation for more AI features on its devices.Must Read...",

EUR/USD is now up another 0.6% to 1.0854 currently and if my calculations are correct, is poised to post its best weekly performance since December 2008. In just a span of five days, we're suddenly closer to 1.1000 than we are to parity talk. Wild. While this is all coming amid a softer dollar as well, it can't be denied that the large chunk of the gains owes to a strong bids in the euro currency itself. The technical and fundamental stars lined up rather perfectly for the pair and it really doesn't get any better than that. So, where to now? One can look towards the November high of 1.0936 but I wouldn't pin that as being too crucial a technical level. As things stand, the 200-week moving average at 1.0872 is going to be one to watch ahead of the weekly close today. If we do get a break there, it's upwards and onwards to 1.1000 next. The primary concern for the euro is that there are still some potential setbacks in the pipeline for the next few weeks. Trump tariffs is of course one of them but markets are evidently less afraid now seeing how he has dealt with the whole situation involving Canada and Mexico. So, there's always wiggle room no matter what he says. But the bigger risk event for the euro will be the German parliamentary vote on the debt brake reform.

Chhetri is third among active international scorers with 94, an elite list topped by Cristiano Ronaldo (135) and Lionel Messi (112). “The qualification for the Asian Cup is very crucial for us,” India coach Manolo Marquez said. “Given the importance of the tournament and the matches ahead, I discussed with Sunil Chhetri about making a comeback to strengthen the national team. He agreed, and so we have included him in the squad.” Chhetri has been in fine form in the Indian Super League, scoring 12 goals in the regular season to help Bengaluru FC qualify for the championship playoff series. India’s national team, meanwhile, has been struggling and has failed to win any of its last 12 games. The Blue Tigers have qualified for three of the last four Asian Cups and will prepare for the Bangladesh game with a warmup against Maldives on March 19. India will also face Hong Kong and Singapore in Group C. Only the group winner will qualify for the 2027 tournament, which will take place in Saudi Arabia. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

Ederson has scored four goals and registered two assists in 39 appearances for Atalanta this season, including three goals and two assists in 27 Serie A outings, with La Dea third in Italy's top flight , three points behind leaders Inter Milan. Man City are believed to be keen to secure his signature this summer, but according to CaughtOffside , Man United and Liverpool are in the hunt, with the pair also determined to bring him to the Premier League. The report claims that the two English powerhouses have been in touch with Ederson's camp to determine the cost of a deal. Atalanta have allegedly signalled that they would want at least €60m (£50m) for the Brazilian, who has made 129 appearances for his current side since arriving from Salernitana in the summer of 2022, scoring 12 goals and registering four assists in the process. Man United are set to bring in a new central midfielder this summer, with Christian Eriksen expected to leave on a free transfer, while Casemiro will also depart if the club receive a suitable offer for his services.

The prime minister went public with the plan on the 7.30 program on the ABC on Friday night when host Sarah Ferguson asked him if he was “categorically” ruling out calling the election on Sunday or Monday. “That’s correct,” he said. “I have no intention of doing anything that distracts from what we need to do, and what we need to do is look after each other at this difficult time.

It was a fully grown female Bryde’s whale, about eight to nine metres long, and weighed about eight tonnes. It had been dead for at least three days, according to a forensic team of the Department of Fisheries. Its body and head had cut wounds, the team said. The cause of its death was assumed to be the impact of a being struck by a ship during feeding time, said Banjerd Udomsamuthirun, advisor of the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources. This cause of death was only an assumption and a detailed necropsy would be performed, he said. Bryde’s whales, also known as Eden’s whales, are not aggressive and their prey are small fish. It is an endangered species and about 100 have been found in the Gulf of Thailand. This was the first death reported in 2025.",

Ukraine came under a “massive missile and drone” attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. At least 10 people, including a child, were injured, authorities said. “Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,” Halushchenko wrote. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s power grid during the war. The attacks have depleted electricity generation capacity and disrupted critical heating and water supplies. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of “weaponizing winter” in an effort to erode civilian morale. Western-supplied air defense systems are crucial for Ukraine’s fight but further U.S. help is uncertain under U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he is determined to end the war and has paused American military aid for Kyiv as a way of pressuring Zelenskyy to negotiate. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said Thursday he would travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet the country’s crown prince, and his team would stay on to hold talks with U.S. officials.

Leaving a little earlier can reduce the pressure of rushing. Deep breathing and listening to calming music or a podcast can help maintain focus. Accepting that traffic is inevitable and reminding yourself that arriving safely is more important than speed can keep stress levels in check,” Dr Aslam Saleem, General Practitioner at Aster Hospital in Sharjah, said. He noted that managing stress on the road requires a combination of mindset and preparation. “Practicing mindfulness, such as being aware of your breathing and thoughts, helps. If stress or fatigue becomes overwhelming, taking a few deep breaths can help restore calm.” Dr Saleem also said ensuring a comfortable driving position and stretching before getting into the car can prevent physical discomfort that adds to stress. “Simple neck and shoulder stretches can relieve tension.” Mental fatigue Dr Hammad Khan, Senior Emergency Physician and Head of the Emergency Department at...",

        "content": "Britain’s love for its favourite cheese is undergoing a major transformation thanks to the changing British palate. For centuries the most popular strength for Cheddar across the UK was mild and medium, but latest sales data can reveal that the fastest growing varieties are now the most powerful extra mature and vintage types. Artisan Cheddar cheesemaker Ford Farms, based in Dorchester , which specialises in making the very strongest varieties, has seen demand soar. And in order to meet the growing demand, supermarket Tesco has increased the pack sizes of its own label top strength cheeses while ordering more to be ready once they have matured for the requisite 18 months. Cheese experts say the change is all down to our love of spicier food which now dominates British cuisine and has hardened our palates. The latest 12-month volume sales data from all retailers analysed by Kantar showed the demand for vintage Cheddar growing by 5.4% and extra mature Cheddar up by 2%. But sales of medium Cheddar has fallen by 5.6% and mild Cheddar down by 2.4%. At Tesco, demand for extra mature and vintage Cheddar have increased by nearly 25% in the last year. Tesco UK cheese buyer Darren Atherton said: “The gradual move towards stronger tasting Cheddar varieties has come about because of our love of spicy food. “With curries, Asian and Mexican food now a regular part of the UK diet, our palates are acclimatising to these stronger and more exotic flavours so that we tend to go for more...",

The victim was transferred to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei with injuries to his hand, ear, head and back. Cheng Hak-wo, vice-chairman of Hong Kong Taxi Council and founder of Chung Shing Taxi firm, told the Post that the attackers “should definitely be condemned”. “Such an assault and terrible attitude will scare drivers,” Cheng said. “This is rare. Police should step up enforcement and protection for drivers.” He said all cars had monitoring systems and cameras installed, adding such treatment “displayed a despicable attitude”. According to the force, the assault took place after one of the four people failed to flag down the taxi. One of them then stopped the vehicle and slapped the driver.",

South Africa said it had received notice that the US had withdrawn from the International Partners Group (IPG), a bloc of rich countries that has pledged money for energy transitions in South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam and Senegal. The bloc includes the European Union, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan, Norway and Denmark. The US had declared, effective immediately, its withdrawal from the agreements in South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, said Chrispin Phiri, a spokesperson for the South African Foreign Ministry. The US had not pledged money for Senegal's energy transition, although other members of the IPG did. It’s another move by President Donald Trump to take the US out of global climate pacts after he signed an executive order in January to withdraw from that brings countries together to combat global warming. That agreement is aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels or, failing that, keeping temperatures at least well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

No. 11 Moreau was no match for a physical and scrappy Lincoln-Stockton team as the Trojans dismantled the Hayward school in a 69-45 blowout at home in the second round of the NorCal Division I playoffs. Lincoln will host No. 10 St. Ignatius in the regional semifinals on Saturday. In the last five days, Moreau defeated Cardinal Newman in the North Section Division II championship game and Dougherty Valley in the first round of NorCals in crazy comeback wins that went down to the wire. Coach Frank Knight said the emotional toll of those games had Moreau leading up to Thursday’s game. “We’re definitely tired,” Knight said. “Anytime you’re an underdog and you’re outkicking your coverage, it weighs on you. “We never thought we’d be a Division I team either, but we didn’t care where they put us. But we’re just tired.”Lincoln held Moreau star and University of the Pacific-bound senior Kellen Hampton to just three points, two days after he scored 43 to lift Moreau over Dougherty Valley. Lincoln believed the key to coming away with the win was to shut down Hampton at all costs. “We weren’t going to let Hampton score 40 points,” Lincoln coach Anthony Matthews said. “We just over helped and dug in his lanes, and if he was...",

Former WWE superstar Paul Roma can’t agree with people calling John Cena the “greatest of all time\". In terms of achievements, the Cenation Leader remains unparalleled. He has become the World Champion 16 times, matching the historic record of the legendary Ric Flair. Cena made his debut on the WWE main roster in 2002 and dominated the wrestling circuit for nearly two decades. He rejoined the company earlier this year to embark on his farewell tour, likely to be wrapped up at the next WrestleMania in Las Vegas. Despite his illustrious career, Roma has refused to consider Cena the GOAT of WWE. He feels former superstars Curt Hennig and Bret Hart are more deserving of the title. “Take a Curt Hennig or a Bret Hart, right? Okay, now you look at them and you’re like, ‘Wow! These guys can go, man. They know all these different moves. They could wrestle.’ Okay, you wanna name one of them the greatest of all time, I get it. That makes sense,\" Paul Roma said on the Power & Glory podcast. “But is it because you won X amount of titles, which someone relinquished to you anyway? Like, how do you win 70 championship belts? Well, if you’re the greatest that won 70, that means you had to lose 70 times too, right? I mean, somewhere along the line you lost just as many matches if not more to get those titles,\" he added.

According to a report by Reuters quoting three sources, the list could include other countries as well but they did not know which ones. A report by the New York Times said that the ban could be applicable to certain countries that would be broader than the list that Trump issued in his first term. The NYT report noted that a draft recommendation proposes a “red” list of countries whose citizens will not be allowed to enter the US. In the last term of Trump, these countries included Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. These countries are likely to stay on the list. This policy had gone through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump travel ban: Possible timeline If the government review goes through, the ban could start as soon as next week, Reuters reported. Trump's directive is part of an immigration crackdown that he launched at the start of his second term. He gave an indication of his plan in an October 2023 speech, vowing to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and “anywhere else that threatens our security.” Trump issued an executive order on January 20 requiring intensified security vetting of foreigners seeking US admission to detect national security threats.

Previously, important documents — such as school registration forms, driver’s license applications, and requests for healthcare services like Medicare and Medicaid — were available in multiple languages to ensure accessibility for all. However, this will no longer be mandatory, posing a significant barrier for the millions of foreigners who do not speak English. The administration has framed the measure as a way to promote migrant integration. In an executive order , it stated that establishing English as the official language would streamline communication, “reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society.” However, migrant advocates see it as part of a broader exclusionary policy. “America will always be a multilingual and multicultural society, no matter how many xenophobic policies Donald Trump tries to enact,“ Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, said in a statement. ”It is unclear how far this shameful executive order will be...",

        "content": "It could be frustrating to have a low credit score without ever taking a loan, but there are multiple reasons for this to happen, particularly if you are new to credit or have not actively used credit products. Here’s why your score might be low: Reasons for a low credit score without any loan I. No credit history : If you have never taken out a loan or credit card, credit bureaus such as CRIF High Mark would – in all likelihood - have no data to assess your credit score. This could be common among youngsters such as students or those who always pay via cash or debit card. II. Inactive credit card : If you have a credit card but never use it, the credit bureaus can't assess how you manage credit. Inactivity can be treated the same as having no credit history. III. Credit inquiries : If you have applied for a credit card which was declined, that inquiry will show up on your report, and would bring down your score, albeit temporarily. IV. Low credit age : Credit score algorithms prefer older credit histories. As a result, if your first credit product is recent, your score will be low at first. V. Errors in credit report : There could be occasions where wrong information like another person’s loan or late payment gets added to your report by mistake. VI. Lack of credit mix : Credit bureaus prefer a mix of credit types such as credit cards, personal loan , etc. Only having one type of credit may make your score lower. VII. High CUR : If you have a credit card and use more than...",

Spanning just 20 square kilometers, Nauru is offering citizenship for $105,000 (approximately Rs 91.44 lakh) per passport to raise funds for climate protection and relocation efforts.Bold Move For SurvivalThe proceeds from this initiative will be used to relocate Nauru’s 12,500 residents to safer, higher ground. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and storm surges pose a threat to the island. So the country needs to take immediate action for survival.Nauru’s President, David Adeang, emphasized the urgency of this step, stating, “While the world debates climate action, we must take proactive steps to secure our nation’s future.”Nauru’s Citizenship BenefitsNauru’s citizenship comes with perks, including visa-free access to 89 countries such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. This makes it particularly appealing to individuals from countries with restrictive travel policies.However, the scheme has strict eligibility criteria. Individuals with criminal records or other red flags will be denied citizenship to prevent any misuse of the program.Nauru’s Economic And Environmental StrugglesNauru has long grappled with economic and environmental challenges.

The 24-hour service, available throughout Ramadan, provides a secure and efficient way for pilgrims to store their luggage before entering the mosque. Six designated collection points have been set up near the main gates of the Grand Mosque, allowing worshipers to check in their belongings quickly and retrieve them with ease after completing their prayers. The system relies on an advanced electronic tracking mechanism, where each item is assigned a QR code linked to the owner's information. This technology ensures fast and accurate retrieval, eliminating delays and minimizing congestion around mosque entrances. Luggage is stored on monitored shelves equipped with continuous surveillance systems, ensuring maximum security. Worshipers receive a smart bracelet with a unique tracking code when they check in their items, allowing for seamless retrieval. The storage areas are subject to periodic security checks every four hours to maintain efficiency and safety.

COST reported a mixed second quarter , acknowledging the impact of tariffs on its business but remained confident to mitigate challenges using its global buying power and supplier relationships to reduce price increases. What Happened: Acknowledging the impact of tariffs, Ron Vachris , the president and CEO of the membership-based retailer company, said during its earnings call that “When it rains, it rains on everyone.” Approximately one-third of Costco’s U.S. sales are from imports, with less than half of those coming from China, Mexico, and Canada. This indicates a significant portion of their merchandise could be subject to tariffs. The CEO reiterated that Costo will continue to rise to this challenge by leveraging “global buying power, strong supplier relationships and innovation.” “Our goal is always to be the first to lower prices where we see opportunities to do so and the last to increase prices in the face of rising costs, said Gary Millerchip , the executive VP and CFO of the company. They will likely absorb some cost increases to maintain their value proposition and competitive pricing. The management also explained how its merchandising flexibility, with its “Treasure Hunt” approach, allows them to readily replace or substitute items if necessary, offering some buffer against tariff impacts on specific goods. However, the management added that for certain categories like fresh foods with tighter margins, passing along some price increases...",

        "content": "This review first appeared in issue 354 of PC Pro. Many Debian-based distros, Linux Mint included, use Ubuntu as their jumping-off point. The latest release – 21.2 Victoria – is based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and will continue to be supported until 2027. That means it currently uses the 5.15 LTS kernel, but there’s a bleeding-edge edition, aptly called 21.2 Cinnamon Edge, that uses 6.2 should you prefer. Where many Ubuntu spin-offs stick with Gnome display manager, as used by Ubuntu itself, Mint’s default is Cinnamon. This started as an offshoot from Gnome 2 when version 3 was released. Version 3 was the first to drop support for the panel (taskbar in Windows parlance) in favor of a purer shell, which likewise demoted widgets and jettisoned desktop icons. Cinnamon puts all of these front and center, which is one of the reasons it’s often held up as an ideal distro for anyone switching from Windows. It also has a Windows-like menu, with applications sorted into categories, and essential tools – such as the browser and settings – kept in view up the side. You can pin your most used apps to the panel so they’re never more than a click away. Cinnamon is certainly a sturdy, tidy interface, but we think it feels a touch old-fashioned when compared directly with Microsoft ’s Fluent UI for Windows 11 . If it doesn’t immediately grab you, you can tweak the colors, install a theme, or opt for one of the alternative desktop managers, since Mint is also available with Mate or Xfce. And,...",

Four Eurostar trains departing from London’s St Pancras station have been cancelled, as have the first six leaving Paris for London. The service’s website stated: “Due to an object on the tracks near Paris Gare du Nord, we are expecting disruption to our services this morning. Please change your journey for a different date of travel.” SNCF said services at Gare du Nord would be suspended until mid-morning at the request",

Apparently a mere 300 bottles have been produced, and only 38 of those will be made available in Ireland. At 46 years of age, it is the oldest single malt whiskey ever released, having spent that time in old Oloroso casks. Each numbered bottle comes in a smart walnut cask. My sample duly arrived, beautifully packaged in a specially designed box. Unfortunately, my tiny bottle had leaked a little, losing what was probably a few hundred euros worth of whiskey into the cardboard packaging. However, I managed to salvage enough for two little tastes, one diluted with a drop of water. So what does a €12,000 whiskey taste like? It’s deep in colour and smells of polished old mahogany cupboards and Christmas cake. At 46.3 per cent abv, it tasted quite fiery, but fairly exploded with all sorts of complex flavours and I could still taste it a minute later. [ ‘Masterpiece of Irish whiskey’: Belfast hotel launches £1,000 cocktail Opens in new window ] Is it worth €12,000? Could any bottle of anything be worth that much? I think this is one those “if you have to ask then it’s not for you” things. I suspect the bottles will be purchased by whiskey collectors who will keep it for a few years before selling it on again at an even higher price.

Read More Pratik Jain, co-founder and director of I-PAC, recently took to LinkedIn to highlight a hidden bias in Indian cities—what he calls “PIN Code Racism.\" He described it as a deep-seated prejudice where a person’s residential address influences how they are perceived socially and professionally. In a thought-provoking post, Pratik Jain pointed out how cities like Mumbai and Delhi judge individuals based on their locality. He compared it to a social ranking system, where some PIN codes open doors while others close them. The Loaded Question: ‘Where Do You Live?’ Pratik Jain argued that from childhood, people are subjected to societal classification. Initially, kids are judged based on their parents’ profession. Later in life, the most defining question becomes, “Where do you live?\" According to Jain, this is not just a casual question but a background check in disguise. “In Delhi, ‘GK’ (Greater Kailash) is a flex. ‘Uttam Nagar’ is an apology. In Mumbai, ‘Bandra’ opens doors. ‘Ghatkopar’ slams them,\" he wrote. A Personal Experience Jain, an IIT Bombay graduate from Ranchi, shared a personal anecdote to illustrate the issue. He recalled being invited to play golf with an elite group. When asked about his handicap, he jokingly responded, “The longer clubs.\" His answer led to an awkward silence. “The silence that followed taught me something – my real handicap wasn’t about golf...",

Connor Jones and Jack Reid ran an industrial-scale organised crime gang that stole more than 70 family motors, police said. Masked burglars are captured on CCTV creeping around outside properties in the early hours using a “relay” system to hack security. One then holds up a loop of wire which boosts the signal of the keyless fob inside, tricking cars into thinking the driver is at the controls. Mercedes, Cupra, Volkswagen, Ford and Vauxhall models were among brands stolen in Edmonton , Essex, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. Last October, armed police with dogs raided a lock-up garage in Waltham Abbey where cars had been taken to be stripped for parts. Officers released video of them arresting and handcuffing primary suspects Reid, 22, and Jones, 26, before seizing a Fiesta - which was in the process of being taken apart – as well as number plates, keys, balaclavas and transmitters. Outside the “chop shop”, they confirmed a further four vehicles were stolen. At Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday Reid, of Boyne Drive, Chelmsford, having admitted conspiring to commit burglary and motor vehicle theft was jailed for three years and nine months. Jones, of Shortlands Avenue, Ongar, received four years and 11 months. One of their victims Katie Evans, who had a Ford Kuga stolen from her driveway...",

You know it happened once, are forever being warned it could again, but so far... well, actually, let’s not go jinxing anything just now. The point is that though while James famously played part of his teenage loan spell at Wigan in the middle of the park, and has been touted as having the skill set to transition ever since, it is an option almost no Chelsea manager has used. In turning to it twice in the last fortnight, Enzo Maresca has already done so more often from the start of matches than all of his predecessors combined. Following a trial in the 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa last month, James was again stationed at the base of midfield here in Copenhagen, and from there strode forward to drive the opening goal in his side’s Conference League victory by the same score . In both instances, you suspected the Englishman’s redeployment was a case of needs must. With Romeo Lavia injured, Cesare Casadei, Carney Chukwuemeka and Renato Veiga all sent out on loan, and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s Chelsea career so far a non-event, Maresca has few options beyond his first-choice pair of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez. At Villa Park, with his forward line so depleted, Maresca tried to compensate by strengthening in midfield, starting James alongside both Caicedo and Fernandez in a rarely-seen three. Here in the Danish capital, James playing 90 minutes allowed the overworked pair...",

Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna, leading a bench that included Justice PV Sanjay Kumar, remarked orally that the Bombay High Court’s decision was justified as the railway line would also be developed and incorporated into the project.The court issued notices to the Maharashtra government and Adani Properties and has scheduled the next hearing for May 25.Seclink Technologies,...",

Most enterprise storage systems are designed to scale in at most two key dimensions — capacity (how much data can be stored) and performance (how quickly data can be accessed). Driven by the complex, dynamic and unpredictable nature of AI workloads and cloud-native applications, there’s been a dramatic shift in the demands placed on storage infrastructure. Storage systems built for an earlier era are now being stretched and strained in ways their designers could never have anticipated. These unprecedented demands can’t be met by simply adding sheer capacity or raw performance. What does this mean for your organization? To keep pace with emerging workloads and unknown future requirements, your storage infrastructure must scale — without tradeoffs — in any dimension that might be conceivably required. 2025 business priorities: tackling the data crunch and storage crisis Five pillars for practical GenAI implementation Chief Marketing Officer at Scality. What is “multidimensional scaling” in data storage?

The Rossoblu head for Stadio Bentegodi following back-to-back wins, while their hosts have recently lost three from four and are still threatened by relegation. One week after conquering European contenders Fiorentina with a stoppage-time winner, Verona were brought back down to earth by Juventus when the pair met on Monday evening. Hellas coach Paolo Zanetti , who was serving a touchline ban, could only look on from the stands in frustration as his team conceded twice in the last 20 minutes to suffer defeat in Turin. As a result of another failure up front, the Gialloblu have scored only three times in their last nine Serie A matches, recording just two wins in the process; yet, they are still four points clear of the drop zone . Zanetti's men now aim to win consecutive home games for the first time in the league this season, and Verona's recent record against their next visitors suggests that could be achievable. Unbeaten in five meetings at the Bentegodi, dating back to 2017, they will look to follow up December's dramatic 3-2 away win and do the double over Bologna for the first time in Serie A. By contrast with their hosts, Bologna are enjoying the transition to spring, as they recently ended a long winless run against AC Milan and then produced a spirited comeback to beat Cagliari.

With the current job market in defensive mode, even top talent is struggling to get hired,\" Nair wrote on X. But what are these mistakes due to which almost 90 per cent job seekers are unable to secure any offers? Firstly, the lack of practical experience when it's much easier to build websites and projects. \"You don't need to build the next Facebook or Twitter -- but a calculator app won't cut it either. Build decent projects that push your limits while showcasing your skills at the same time!\" Nair further said that applying blindly to every second listing on LinkedIn is another blunder that job seekers make, often out of desperation. \"Most recruiters can smell a mass application from a mile away.\" His word of advice: Job seekers should apply to lesser jobs and customise their resume and cover letter to show that they are genuinely interested in the company and the job role they are applying for. Nair further highlighted that a lack of personal brand has adversely impacted job seekers. \"If your only presence online is a private Instagram account and a...",

Park Hyung Sik stars as Seo Dong Joo, the leader of the Daesan Group chairman’s Public Affairs team. Previously, Seo Dong Joo narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by Yum Jang Sun ( Heo Joon Ho ) and Heo Il Do ( Lee Hae Young ), but the ordeal left him with complete memory loss. Before losing his memories, Seo Dong Joo was an ambitious figure determined to climb to the top of Daesan Group. He shared a close relationship with Daesan Group chairman Cha Kang Cheon (Woo Hyun), who trusted him enough to reveal the secrets of his slush fund vault. Now, newly released stills tease a tense reunion between Seo Dong Joo and Cha Kang Cheon. Seo Dong Joo appears bewildered as he locks eyes with the chairman, but his confusion quickly shifts to suspicion—gripping Cha Kang Cheon’s arm tightly and having his fist up, as if preparing for a confrontation. Meanwhile, Cha Kang Cheon looks startled by Seo Dong Joo’s unexpected reaction. With their fateful reunion, curiosity is mounting over whether Seo Dong Joo will regain his memories—and if he does, whether he will keep it a secret.

The company, which operates more than 1,800 Boots stores in the UK, has been sold to the US private equity firm Sycamore Partners after struggling in the internet era as customers have turned to online shopping for cheaper products. Walgreens’ market capitalisation has collapsed by 90% since 2015 and is now valued at $9.3bn. It has debt and lease obligations of $30bn. Sycamore Partners has struck an $11.45-a-share deal for the company, giving it an equity value of around $10bn. However, investors could receive an extra $3 a share based on the sale of Walgreens’ primary care business, VillageMD, valuing the business, including debt, at $23.7bn. After the emergence of the deal talks in December, it was reported that if a sale was completed, Sycamore was likely to retain the US retail business and sell or spin off the remainder of the business, which includes the UK pharmacy chain Boots. Boots has more than 50,000 employees, including at its headquarters in Nottinghamshire, who face further uncertainty after nearly three years of speculation over its future ownership. In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale but later dropped the plans as potential buyers struggled to raise funds . A plan to float the business was dropped last year.

However, it is important to note that there has not been any official confirmation regarding the same from the authorities.According to the reports, the Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief (DR) for employees and pensioners are likely to increase, as the central government is expected to declare it before Holi. Reports further add that the DA and DR are expected to increase by 2 percent this time, as everyone awaits the central government’s official announcement. DA is provided to serving government employees, while DR is given to pensioners.To recall, the last DA Hike was announced by the Modi government in October 2024. Union Cabinet approved a 3 percent Dearness Allowance (DA) increase for central government employees. A dearness allowance of 53 percent of basic pay is being provided to central government employees, as opposed to the previous 50 percent.Dearness Allowance (DA) hikes are based on the average All India Consumer Price Index (CPI-IW) for industrial workers, which reflects changes in the cost of living.

Dominic Solanke Status: Major doubt Type of injury: Knock Possible return date: March 9 (vs. Bournemouth) Dominic Solanke made his first appearance since the middle of January on Thursday evening after recovering from a knee injury, but the England international lasted just 20 minutes due to a knock. Postecoglou is keeping his fingers crossed that the issue is not severe, but he may now miss out on a reunion with his former side.

        "content": "While it doesn’t surprise you, Nadaaniyan offers a lighthearted experience that can be enjoyable. Read our full review here. There’s something oddly charming about a film that fully embraces what it is – Nadaaniyan does just that. It doesn’t try to be deep, doesn’t get caught up in logic and certainly doesn’t pretend to have any grand message. Instead, it offers an unapologetic dose of lighthearted, over-the-top storytelling, packed with classic tropes and a script so unrestrained that it keeps you entertained. If you’re in the mood for carefree fun, Nadaaniyan delivers exactly that. At the heart of the story is Pia Jai Singh (Khushi Kapoor), a South Delhi socialite who is forced to treat love like a business transaction. Enter Arjun Mehta (Ibrahim Ali Khan), a Noida boy with big dreams. Arjun wants to win a high school debate competition that, in this world, is the golden ticket to an Ivy League university. And how does he secure a spot in this prestigious event? By flashing his six-pack abs in front of a room full of students who suddenly decide that maybe he is, in fact, worthy of the challenge. If you’re looking for a moment that encapsulates Nadaaniyan, this is it. The film thrives on excess—excessive privilege, excessive montages of rich kids and lavish parties and excessive scenes reminding us that rich people have unhappy marriages. It’s a world we’ve seen a hundred times before but still, we enjoy watching it again now with this Dharma film. Performances are a mixed...",

According to the Enforcement Directorate sources, investigations revealed that after promising assured returns in exchange for their investment against plot/commercial space, the funds were diverted and siphoned off to several shell companies to acquire lands at various locations. “Investigations also revealed that hundreds of crores were also diverted abroad to suspicious entities in Singapore whose beneficial ownership is with family members of Ashish Bhalla,” the Enforcement Directorate sources said. The financial probe agency further revealed that the WTC group “had collected more than ₹ 3000 crore from various investors across several states such as Haryana, UP, Chandigarh, Ahmadabad, Punjab etc.” Earlier, the Enforcement Directorate conducted search operations under Section 17 of the PMLA on February 27, during which Ashish Bhalla “remained absconding and induced key persons against cooperating with...",

What Happened : The trio, in a paper titled “Superintelligence Strategy,” expressed concerns over the U.S. government’s potential pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in a manner akin to the Manhattan Project. The experts worry that such a race could trigger dangerous global conflicts, reminiscent of the nuclear arms race. \"What begins as a push for a superweapon and global control risks prompting hostile countermeasures and escalating tensions, thereby undermining the very stability the strategy purports to secure,” wrote the co-authors in the paper. The authors argue for a cautious approach to AI development, rather than a competition to surpass global rivals. They introduce a unique concept—Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM)—inspired by the nuclear arms race’s Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). The paper also recommends that nations participate in nonproliferation efforts and deterrence strategies, akin to their approach with nuclear weapons. SEE ALSO: Trump Vs.

At just 17 years and 348 days, he now follows only Bojan Krkic and Jude Bellingham in this prestigious record.Additionally, during Arsenal’s...",

Shauna Gautam’s debut directorial attempts a glossy Netflix-style rom-com, but what we get is a half-baked, logic-defying, snooze-fest that screams privilege. Starring Ibrahim Ali Khan and Khushi Kapoor, this film makes one thing clear - audiences are done with these unrelatable, ultra-rich tales. If Bollywood still doesn’t get the memo, then maybe it’s time for another disaster to drive the point home.Nadaaniyan Plot: When poor is just a punchlineLet’s break it down, Khushi Kapoor’s character Pia hails from one of Delhi’s most powerful families, and to seek validation from her childhood best buddies, she decides to hire Ibrahim Ali Khan’s Arjun as her fake boyfriend for Rs 25,000 per week. So far, so cliché. The problem? Arjun is supposed to be ‘poor,’ except his father is a doctor, and his mother teaches at the same posh school to which Pia goes. If this was meant to be a ‘struggles of the middle class’ story, someone forgot to do their research.Predictably, Arjun and Pia catch feelings, leading to an obvious misunderstanding, dramatic confrontation, and a grand gesture at the end, because apparently, 2025 Bollywood still thinks audiences are stuck in the 2000s. The writing is painfully outdated, and the characters are so hollow that even AI-generated movie plots sound more creative.Nadaaniyan Performances: Bland and...",

Scientists have uncovered a stunning revelation from the depths of the ocean – a world teeming with life where survival seems almost impossible. Recent research identified thousands of never-before-seen microbial species thriving at depths of up to 6 kms beneath the ocean’s surface. This groundbreaking discovery, made in some of the ocean’s deepest trenches, including the Mariana Trench, sheds new light on life in the Hadal Zone. The Hadal Zone, an extreme environment beginning at 6,000 metres and extending to a staggering 11,000 metres, is so deep that it could accommodate 30 Empire State Buildings stacked atop one another or nearly one and a half Mount Everests. Despite the crushing pressure, near-freezing temperatures, and scarce nutrients, life flourishes in this seemingly inhospitable world. A team of Chinese researchers embarked on an ambitious exploration mission, conducting an astounding 33 deep-sea dives using a manned submersible. They collected sediment and seawater samples from the ocean floor, only to find themselves astonished by the results – over 7,500 unique microbial species, 90% of which were previously unknown to science. How Do These ‘Alien’ Microbes Survive?

A bench led by Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna heard a plea filed by Dubai-based Seclink Technology Corporation, challenging the award of the project to Adani. However, the court agreed on Friday to examine Seclink’s petition and issued notices to the Maharashtra government and the Adani Group. The top court refused to halt the ongoing work at the project site after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the Adani Group, said that construction had already started. He said that Adani had employed over 2,000 workers, invested significant funds, procured construction equipment worth crores of rupees, and initiated the demolition of railway quarters on the site.

Real Madrid legend Marcelo has confessed he wanted to hit Lionel Messi during heated El Clasico battles. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner often featured on the right wing of Barcelona’s attack in the last two decades. Being the team’s star left-back, Marcelo was tasked with marking Messi in those games. The Brazilian recently spoke about what it was like to face the Argentine great while appearing on the Spanish TV program La Revuelta earlier this week. “The problem [with Messi] is that I wanted to hit him, but I couldn’t get him,\" he jokingly suggested. Marcelo called time on his illustrious career in early February this year. The Brazilian competed for 15 memorable years at the Santiago Bernabeu. He made 546 appearances for the Los Blancos, guiding them to six La Liga titles and five Champions League crowns. Marcelo won a total of 25 trophies at the Spanish capital. His silverware count, however, could have been far greater were it not for Messi’s Barcelona. The Argentine tormented the Real defender regularly, posing Marcelo with plenty of challenges he would prefer to forget. In the same show, Marcelo revealed that he had a lot of respect for Lionel Messi. “I appreciate him [Messi] a lot.

The study was first published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, as Times of India reports. The Chandrayaan-3 mission, launched by ISRO from Bengaluru, made a successful soft landing near the Moon's south pole on 23 August 2023. The landing site, located at approximately 69 degrees south latitude, was later named 'Shiv Shakti Point' on 26 August 2023. At the landing site, located on a six-degree Sun-facing slope, temperatures ranged from 82 degrees Celsius at their highest to -170 degrees Celsius during the night. In contrast, a flat surface just one metre away recorded a peak temperature of about 60 degrees Celsius. According to NASA, the slope conditions are similar to the proposed Artemis mission landing sites at the Moon's south pole.

Chennai: Women's employment in urban India has jumped 10 per cent in the last six years (2017-18 to 2023-24), according to a report, ahead of the International Women’s Day 2025, on Friday. The white paper launched by Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai, showed that urban women in their forties have the highest employment rate among women in urban India -- 38.3 per cent in 2023-24. It also warned of pressing challenges including the underutilisation of educated women’s skills and the looming risk of a diversity backlash. More than 89 million urban Indian women still remained out of the labour market during 2023-24, said the report. Factors such as caregiving responsibilities, lack of flexible work arrangements, and commuting challenges continue to prevent many highly qualified women from fully participating in the economy. Further, in a concerning trend, young male unemployment in urban India outpaced women's (10 per cent vs 7.5 per cent for ages 20-24). The findings also highlighted gender gaps even in highly educated households. Even among dual-income, highly educated couples, gender disparities remain stark. In 62 per cent of such families, husbands earn more, despite equal educational qualifications. Additionally, wives continue to take on the primary...",

Veteran finance ministry bureaucrat Pandey last week replaced Madhabi Puri Buch as the chief of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Buch, who helmed SEBI for three years, came under attack towards the end of her term after the now-shuttered Hindenburg Research alleged conflict of interest in SEBI's investigations into the Adani group because of her previous investments. Both Buch and the Adani group had denied the allegations. \"We will be coming forward with our own plan to further transparently reveal these conflicts of interest, etc. for the public,\" Tuhin Kanta Pandey said in his first public speech since taking over as SEBI chief. He did not specifically refer to any individual's conflict of interest. SEBI is \"conscious of the need to create an inclusive environment\" for foreign capital and will engage with portfolio investors and alternative investment funds to address their difficulties and further rationalise regulations, he said. Foreign investors have sold Indian shares worth more than $27 billion since September 2024, pushing the benchmark Nifty 50 down 15% from its record high.",

        "content": "Coventry Building Society has reported a drop in its annual profits after seeing mortgage costs reduce, as it kicks off merging with The Co-operative Bank after buying the rival lender at the beginning of the year. The building society, which is the second largest in the UK behind Nationwide , made a pre-tax profit of £323 million in 2024, down from £474 million the prior year. It said it generated less income during the year due to the impact of mortgage costs coming down, as UK interest rates were cut, while savings customers moved money into higher interest-bearing accounts. This dragged on the group’s net interest margin – the difference between what a bank generates from loans and pays out to savers. But the building society saw mortgage and savings balances grow through the year, which it said was partly driven by offering competitive rates to members and incentivising savings. Coventry’s chief executive Steve Hughes said it grew savings and mortgage balances in an “uncertain environment, with the UK economy experiencing more persistent inflation and higher interest rates than many believed to be the case at the start of the year”. The building society completed the £780 million acquisition of rival lender Co-op Bank at the start of 2025. The tie-up created a banking giant with millions of customers and an estimated £89 billion worth of assets. It returned the Co-op Bank to a mutual structure, meaning it is owned by individual members rather than shareholders and...",

        "content": "Hong Kong is considering designating the city’s first maternity hospital for Chinese people and a 130-year-old temple as monuments, with the government antiquities office citing the worship site’s value in revealing the inhumane living conditions of the 19th century. The Antiquities and Monuments Office on Friday sought to upgrade the heritage status of the main building of Old Tsan Yuk Maternity Hospital in Sai Ying Pun, which is the existing Western District Community Centre, and Kwong Fook Tsz temple in Sheung Wan, according to government documents. Both buildings are currently given a grade-one status, the highest of the three-tier scale where no protection is guaranteed. “The two historic buildings ... have significant heritage value,” the office said. “They have reached the ‘high threshold’ to be declared as monuments for permanent protection.” Opened in 1922, the hospital was established by the Chinese Public Dispensaries Committee to offer Western medical services to the community. It provided maternity services for Chinese women and modern training for Chinese midwives until its relocation in 1955 due to the rapidly increasing demand during the post-war period. The main building then became a community centre in 1961.",

The Argentina international again showed his frustration, which was also the case when he was withdrawn in the first half of the Premier League game against Ipswich Town at the end of February. Garnacho has gone 22 games without scoring, but Man United lost their attacking intent when he was replaced on Thursday, and Amorim has revealed why he decided to bring the 20-year-old off. \"I felt he (Garnacho) was tired, and you see it because we did a lot of transitions in the second half because sometimes he was late to defend. And sometimes he's in a good position to transition but I felt he was tired to recover and do the same things. I look at the game as a whole and not just in transitions,\" Amorim told reporters. Explaining his decision to select Garnacho on the right rather than the left, Amorim said: \"We look at the opponent, the way they try to press, where is the space? Which player is going to follow the run? And we try to imagine the right characteristics for that game.

Both, China and the US are now looking to build greater ties with India, just to counter each other. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday that Beijing's relations with India had made positive strides in the past year and the meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan last year provided strategic guidance for the improvement and development of the bilateral ties. Yi said it's in the best interest of the two nations to work together. \"Both sides have earnestly followed through on the important common understandings of our leaders, strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels, and achieved a series of positive outcomes. China and India are each other’s largest neighbours. China always believes that the two should be partners that contribute to each other’s success. A cooperative pas de deux of the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for both sides,\" said Wang Yi. China's statement comes amid Beijing's ongoing trade war with the United States. Both, China and the US are now looking to build greater ties with India, just to counter each other. \"As important members of the Global South, we have the responsibility to take the lead in opposing hegemonism and power politics.

Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo penned a heartfelt note for Real Madrid on its 123rd birth anniversary. He spent nearly nine years in the Spanish capital. He moved to Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2009 on a record £80-million deal and departed as the club’s leading goal-scorer in 2018. Ronaldo struck 450 times in his 438 appearances for the Los Blancos across all competitions. During his time in Madrid, he lifted as many as 17 trophies, including four Champions League titles. With his dominant performance, the Portuguese icon also secured four Ballond’Ors. On March 6, when Real Madrid completed 123 years of its journey, Ronaldo sent a beautiful message to his former club. Accompanying the post was a glimpse of the 2016 Champions League win. Ronaldo, donning the Real Madrid shirt, was captured proudly lifting the trophy after beating derby rivals Atletico Madrid in the summit showdown in Milan. Sharing the picture on X (formerly Twitter), the legendary forward wrote, “123 years of Real Madrid; Happy birthday to the entire Real Madrid family and Hala Madrid.\" After leaving Real Madrid, Ronaldo shifted his base to the Italian club, Juventus. The 40-year-old later revealed the discussion between him and Florentino Perez at the time of his departure. “It exhausted me because Perez had agreed that I would leave, but then he did not treat me well, and I could...",

        "content": "We’ve all been there—staring in the mirror, wondering what it would be like to have different facial features, a different hair texture, a different something . And while beauty trends come and go , the universal appeal of the oval face remains constant. With its balanced proportions and harmonious dimensions (think a 3:2 length-to-width ratio), it’s the ultimate blank canvas for hairstyles. You can pull off almost anything, from daringly short crops to cascading layers, making the search for the best haircuts for an oval face both exciting and overwhelming. If you’re unsure about your face shape, Mumbai-based celebrity hairstylist Aasif Ahmed has a simple trick to figuring it out. “Pull all your hair back into a tight ponytail—this gives you a clear view of your features. If you have an oval face, you’ll notice a broad forehead and a long jawline as the most prominent characteristics,” he shared in a previous conversation with Vogue India. If you’re looking for inspiration, we’ve rounded up nine of the best haircuts for an oval face. Save this for when you have one of those impulsive ‘I need a haircut immediately’ moments. Chin bob A bolder take on the bob, this shorter version, stopping right at the chin, accentuates the jawline and cheekbones, adding a touch of playful chic. It’s a great option for those wanting a low-maintenance yet stylish look. Pixie cut A timeless symbol of nonconformity and chicness, the pixie cut is surprisingly versatile. From the gamine charm of...",

The search for the ideal replacement to Buttler is on, with the T20 World Cup 2026 and the ODI World Cup 2027 on the horizon. Many have predicted the likes of Joe Root and Harry Brook as the likely replacements. However, it looks like head coach Brendon McCullum might go in for a familiar face as the leader. In an interaction with ESPN Cricinfo, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) director Rob Key has hinted that Ben Stokes might be the next England white-ball captain, in addition to being the Test captain of the side. Calling Stokes as one of the best captains he has ever seen and a good tactician, Key said that it would be 'stupid' not to consider him as the next skipper in line for white-ball cricket.

It's just the knock-on effect of what that means,\" Key said. \"He's an unbelievably good tactician, which we've seen in Test cricket, but he's a leader of men.

McManus is famed for landing massive gambles over the years but he told the Racing Post that these days he can enjoy watching his horses without a bet. \"Do you know, I don't really bet like I used to,\" he said. \"In those days I always wanted to be in the fast lane. I was headstrong. \"I've done a lot of foolish things but as you get older, you become more mature. I have a more considered approach now. \"Back then, I used to have my mind made up about things. That's dangerous. \"When you have your mind made up, it means you can't change your mind. These days I would delay making a decision until one has to be made.\" McManus has assembled one of the strongest ever teams for this year's Cheltenham Festival. At the time of writing he has the ante-post favourite for 12 of the 28 races. But surprisingly the Limerick businessman's only wager on the Festival is a Willie Mullins-trained and Edward Ware-owned horse called Copacabana. The Blue Bresil gelding is currently vying for favouritism for the Champion Bumper after making an impressive racecourse debut at Navan last month. \"Cheltenham is coming up but I think I've only had the one small bet on a horse in the bumper, just something that would pay my hotel bill for the week,\" McManus said. \"It's hard for me to get on, anyway.

She alleged that the accused even sent her inappropriate text messages on the phone several times in four years - starting from 2020 - when she was 17. The woman alleged that the pastor also threatened to eliminate her and her family if she reported the matter. The pastor allegedly took her mobile number and began sending her messages. She claimed that she was afraid of him and could not confide in her parents.

        "content": "Marine biologists at the University of Gothenburg have identified what may be the world’s largest known clonal organism—a vast expanse of bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus) spanning over 300 miles along Sweden’s Baltic coastline. Initially misclassified as a distinct species, genetic sequencing has confirmed that this extensive seaweed population is a single asexually reproducing clone. Bladderwrack plays a foundational role in the Baltic Sea’s ecosystem by forming dense underwater forests that serve as habitat and refuge for numerous marine organisms, including mollusks and crustaceans. These macroalgal beds extend from the water’s surface to depths of approximately 32 feet, contributing to biodiversity and acting as critical structural components of the coastal environment. These underwater forests provide shelter, breeding grounds, and food sources for a wide variety of marine species, fostering intricate ecological interactions that support the overall health of the ecosystem. The stability and resilience of these habitats are of paramount concern as climate change causes changes in temperature and salt levels, which could disrupt marine life and upset the balance of the ecosystem. “This clone comprises millions of individuals, and in some areas, it is completely dominant, while in other areas it grows alongside sexually propagated individuals of bladderwrack,” explained Ricardo Pereyra, a researcher leading the genetic analyses. “We have found a few more large clones in...",

New Delhi: Actor Naga Chaitanya's recent success 'Thandel' has now marked its entry into the Rs 100 crore club. Interestingly, here's a fascinating trivia behind a song from the film that required eight days of practice before the final cut was shot. For the song 'Namo Namah Shivaya', both Naga Chaitanya and the film's female lead, Sai Pallavi, underwent intense rehearsals for the song. They practiced rigorously for almost eight to nine days because the choreography was slightly different from typical dance styles, demanding extra effort and precision. After 8 days of intense practice, the final shot was taken. Thandel is a heartbreaking tale of a fisherman who gets captured by Pakistani forces in international waters. The film deeply resonated with audiences, evoking strong emotions and leaving many viewers teary-eyed as they left the theaters. The on-screen pairing of Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi was widely appreciated, winning over audiences and receiving a warm reception.

The passenger bust-up took place 30,000ft in the air and led to the pilot having to make an emergency landing at Porto Airport in Portugal. Upon landing, both families were thrown off the plane and greeted by police , but the five-year-old boy’s mother insists they were the victims. “This incident involved racial abuse, discrimination, and physical assault, she told The Sun . “My son was left extremely scared and distressed.” The family, from South London , were returning from a holiday in Lanzarote when they boarded a flight travelling to Gatwick Airport . The boy was allegedly watching the 2010 remake onboard the flight when a woman four rows in front became irritated and asked him to turn it off. His mother, a 26-year-old letting agent, claims the boy was watching the film on low volume, but the woman became aggressive and started shouting racial abuse at him. She also alleges that the woman's other half grabbed her disabled partner by the neck during the ruckus. Sources told The Sun that both families were aggressive towards the cabin crew. A spokesperson for EasyJet said: “Safety is our highest priority. We do not tolerate disruptive behaviour.”",

It is Jonas’ first fight since she became unified welterweight champion and added the WBC title with a dominant points win over Croatia’s Ivana Habazin in Liverpool in December, having previously won the vacant IBF belt with a late stoppage of Kandi Wyatt in summer 2023 and then successfully defended it with a controversial split-decision win over Mikaela Mayer. Jonas was already the unified light-middleweight world champion, holding the IBF, WBC and WBO belts and now having rattled off seven successive wins since her draw with Terri Harper and defeat by Katie Taylor in 2021. Now she faces the toughest of tests in a major showdown with Price, the former Cardiff and Wales footballer who won Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth gold as an amateur and has now produced eight successive victories as a professional, becoming the first-ever Welsh female world champion in only her sixth fight as she picked up the WBA, IBO and Ring Magazine titles by unanimous technical decision against Jessica McCaskill, whose eye injury caused the fight to be stopped in round...",

The Army has a track record of carrying out HADR missions in India and abroad. Parts of India are prone to floods, earthquakes, and cyclones. Due to its vast experience, determination, and resilience, the Army often responds to crises as a first responder. This is evident from an operation that the Army carried out recently in Uttarakhand amid difficult weather and terrain. On February 28, 2025, A BRO Labour Camp, located between Mana and Badrinath was struck by an avalanche, burying 57 workers inside eight containers and one shed. The Indian Army, as first responders, immediately started rescue work and continued the efforts despite harsh weather and ongoing avalanches, with medical teams performing critical surgeries and roads being cleared for further access. The Indian Army is always prepared for rapid disaster response, deploying its expertise and personnel for critical life-saving missions. It is also well-equipped to carry out logistics, rapid response, and rescue operations. This is due to the training the Army receives in dealing with crises. In addition to being battle-hardened, the Indian Army regularly undergoes training for disaster relief. It conducts regular HADR exercises, both independently and in collaboration with its sister services and friendly foreign countries. These exercises aim to improve coordination...",

On Thursday night, the Lakers provided Redick with another memorable callback moment. Los Angeles began a stretch of five games against some of the top teams in the NBA with a 113-109 overtime victory over the New York Knicks. The Lakers have won eight straight and are second in the Western Conference at 40-21. “Our guys, in what felt like a playoff game at times, really just gutted out a win,” Redick said. The Lakers trailed by double digits midway through the fourth quarter, but rallied to force overtime. It was tied at 107 — on free throws by injured Knicks star Jalen Brunson — late in the extra session before Los Angeles closed it out with a 6-2 run. “We haven’t had many of those games because frankly, we’ve had the lead a lot lately,” Redick said. “I think it’s a good reminder for our group going forward that we can win games like this where we’re not at our best offensively, where we get off to a slow start defensively but we have enough toughness and grit to get these games.” On a night when Luka Doncic led the Lakers with 32 points and LeBron James added 31, it was other players who also stepped up when needed. Gabe Vincent made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and Jaxson Hayes made a pair of free throws to give the Lakers a 109-107 lead. Austin...",

Friday, March 7, is the first Friday of Lent. “Walang saysay ang mag-fasting sa karne pero o-order ka naman ng African sea bass sa mamahaling restaurant, o lobster (It is meaningless to fast on meat but order African sea bass at an expensive restaurant, or lobster),” said David in a homily on Ash Wednesday, March 5, the start of the Lenten season.“‘O, hindi ako kumain ng baboy, lobster lang (Oh, I didn’t eat pork, just lobster),’” David said, mimicking the arguments of Catholics who engage in this practice. “And you call that fasting?” he remarked.David, 66, is the bishop of the Diocese of Kalookan and president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines. Trained by Jesuits at San Jose Seminary, the 10th Filipino cardinal in history is known for skewing more toward social justice in interpreting Catholic doctrine. In his homily at the beginning of Lent, the cardinal added that Catholics should not call it penance “if our intention is just to reduce weight or get sexy.”“Hindi ba mas makabuluhang penitensya kaysa bawas-kanin ang bawas-tsismis, o ang bawas-oras sa social media?” he said.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — It is fitting that in a town built on movies and television, JJ Redick likes to use a popular directing term to refer to different moments in his first season as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.On Thursday night, the Lakers provided Redick with another memorable callback moment.Los Angeles began a stretch of five games against some of the top teams in the NBA with a 113-109 overtime victory over the New York Knicks.The Lakers have won eight straight and are second in the Western Conference at 40-21.“Our guys, in what felt like a playoff game at times, really just gutted out a win,” Redick said.The Lakers trailed by double digits midway through the fourth quarter, but rallied to force overtime. It was tied at 107 — on free throws by injured Knicks star Jalen Brunson — late in the extra session before Los Angeles closed it out with a 6-2 run.“We haven’t had many of those games because frankly, we’ve had the lead a lot lately,\" Redick said. \"I think it’s a good reminder for our group going forward that we can win games like this where we’re not at our best offensively, where we get off to a slow start defensively but we have enough toughness and grit to get these games.”On a night when Luka Doncic led the Lakers with 32 points and LeBron James added 31, it was other players who also stepped up when needed.Gabe Vincent made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and Jaxson Hayes made a pair of free throws to give the Lakers a 109-107 lead. Austin Reaves was 2...",

        "content": "City gas distributors (CGDs) Mahanagar Gas Ltd ( ), Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) and Gujarat Gas Ltd are in focus, as February's CNG vehicle registrations normalised after January's seasonal high. Total OEM CNG vehicle registrations fell to 12,915 in February, down 39 per cent month-on-month (MoM), but up 3 per cent year-on-year. While CNG volume, vehicle registrations, and adoption remained healthy over the last few months, the structural decline in APM gas allocation remained a big overhang, Antique Stock Broking said on Friday. The domestic brokerage believes CGDs will prioritise volume growth over margins, as it does not foresee big price hikes, and felt the current margin levels to continue. \"The conflict between sustaining CNG arbitrage and CGDs guiding for margin recovery makes both events mutually exclusive. We stay negative on the CGD space due to APM cuts capping margins, maintaining HOLD on MGL, Gujarat Gas, and SELL on IGL,\" Antique said. The broking firm noted that CNG arbitrage against petrol and diesel remains the highest in Mumbai compared to Ahmedabad and Delhi. The current CNG price in Mumbai at Rs 78 per kg is 25 per cent and 13 per cent cheaper than petrol and diesel, respectively. In Delhi, at Rs 75.10 per kg, it is 21 per cent and 14 per cent cheaper. In Gujarat, CNG's discount stood at 16 per cent against petrol and 12 per cent against diesel. \"Following the APM deallocation, MGL and Gujarat Gas have raised CNG prices in their key GAs, whereas IGL has...",

        "content": "H onestly, a title like Plankton: The Movie is about as difficult to evaluate as any movie that comes down the Hollywood pike or, in this case, washes up on its shores. Not because it’s a spin-off of SpongeBob Squarepants – or at least, not because there is anything inherently wrong with a spin-off movie of such a durably silly and enjoyable kids’ franchise – but because it often feels somewhere to the side of genuine feature-film status. In executive terms, it is more like content. Lengthwise, Plankton does qualify as a feature, though its official runtime of nearly 90 minutes doesn’t really do justice to the fact that it runs closer to 75 when you take out the extensive end credits. Anyway, that’s not a problem; there’s a rich tradition of animated movies aimed at kids not overstaying their welcome, and Plankton himself is such a little guy. For a tiny, amorphous blob, he’s quite accomplished, having parlayed a bit role on the long-running Nickelodeon series to a fixture as the self-appointed nemesis of SpongeBob and his beloved employer, the Krusty Krab. Like Pinky and the Brain before him, Plankton (voiced by an animator and voice actor known as Mr Lawrence) has attempted to overcome his diminutive status with somewhat obtuse world-conquering schemes, which he’s convinced can and should begin with stealing the recipe for the Krusty Krab’s Krabby Patty. One of the best jokes of Plankton’s spin-off movie (presumably long-awaited by, at very least, Plankton himself) is that...",

Published: March 7, 2025 1:30 PM IST By Edited by The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final between India and New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday may have a massive bearing on the international future of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as well. There is speculation that Rohit Sharma can step down from captaincy or even walk away from the 50-over format of the game after the final comes to an end on Sunday. Both Rohit and Kohli had retired from T20 international cricket after India won the T20 World Cup 2024 title last year. Rohit Sharma has managed to bounce back well after a disastrous tour of Australia where Team India lost 3-1 following their 3-0 Test series whitewash at home at the hands of New Zealand. Indians failed to qualify for the World Test Championships (WTC) final for the first time in their history as well. According to a report in Times of India newspaper, chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir will be sitting down with Rohit Sharma to discuss his future plans. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have also delayed in announcing the new central contracts due to this reason. “Rohit still believes there is some cricket left in him. He has been told to communicate his plans going forward. Retiring is his call but there will be another discussion around continuing with captaincy. Rohit himself understands...",

In an effort to reduce their reliance on the US, these nations—guided by their unique interests—are likely to reassess, recalibrate, and potentially enhance their existing relationships with Russia, China, and other suitable partners, the former envoy said. India has skilfully balanced its relationships with Russia and China , even as a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) by adopting a nuanced approach and avoiding direct confrontation or criticism of either country. The diplomat stated that while the Sino-Indian relationship has been strained by longstanding border disputes, both countries are committed to maintaining peace along the Line of Actual Control (LoC) while in pursuit of strengthening their robust economic ties, which boast an annual bilateral trade turnover of $118.4 billion in fiscal year 2024. India has further solidified its strategic partnership with the United States, particularly in the realms of defence and security cooperation. At the same time, India and Russia have cultivated a growing energy partnership. Historically, Russia has been a key supplier of crude oil and natural gas to India and continues to be one of its largest defence partners, he stressed.

Despite the algae speck’s self-proclaimed genius-level intellect, his plans invariably fail, often due to incompetence, hubris or, worse, SpongeBob’s assistance. If only he would listen to his smart, long-suffering computer wife, Karen. Following on from last year’s Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie, Plankton’s outing is the latest in a series of character-driven spin-off films from the late Stephen Hillenburg’s beloved franchise. Mr Lawrence, the voice of Plankton and longtime series writer, provides a pleasing origin story for Plankton and Karen’s sarcasm-driven marriage, framed by the tiny terror’s latest scheme. It’s about time: a rightly fed-up Karen – retooled as a nefarious, many-headed supercomputer – makes her own bid for supremacy, leaving her husband to form an uneasy alliance with SpongeBob. In theory, the computer-generated animation now used in Kamp Koral and other SpongeBob properties offers more opportunities for comic expression and pratfalls. In practice it’s never as effective (or charming) as the original series’ cel animation and makeshift live-action inserts. There are many things to love, nonetheless.

Sacks added that in the past the US sold some 195,000 bitcoins for just $366 million, representing a significant financial loss for taxpayers.The primary source of the US government’s cryptocurrency holdings is derived from criminal or civil asset forfeiture. Trump has instructed the Treasury secretary to explore “budget neutral” strategies for acquiring more bitcoins, although this directive does not extend to other digital assets.

Updated: March 7, 2025 1:30 PM IST By Edited by The Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) is among the most popular teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), but they have not secured an IPL championship. It is quite unexpected for RCB to remain trophy-less considering the caliber of players who have played for the team. The franchise has faced challenges, particularly in their bowling performance, which has hindered their success in past seasons. Former Pakistan opener Ahmad Shahzad expressed that the inclusion of Mohammad Amir in the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) could be beneficial for the team in their pursuit of their first title. Shahzad shared this opinion during a discussion on a Geo TV show, which also featured Amir and former wicketkeeper-batter Rashid Latif. Latif commented that RCB should not expect to win the title while MS Dhoni is still playing for Chennai Super Kings (CSK). “If Amir plays for RCB, they could win the IPL title,” said Shehzad. “Till MS Dhoni is there in CSK, don’t even think RCB can touch the IPL trophy.” replied Latif.

It appeared that she had slit her wrist using a sharp object. \"I Am Sorry\" Written in BloodWhen the washroom door was forced open, the girl was found in a weakened state. Shockingly, the words \"I am sorry\" were written in blood on the wall of the stall. She was immediately rushed to a public hospital, where she is currently admitted to the Intensive Coronary Care Unit (ICCU) and receiving treatment. The Government Railway Police (GRP) at CSMT are investigating the incident. However, the motive behind the attempt remains unclear as the girl is not yet in a position to give a statement.

All necessary measures are being taken to stabilise power and gas supplies,” he added. The attack damaged natural gas production facilities of Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas firm Naftogaz, the company said in a statement. “Production facilities that ensure gas production were damaged. Fortunately, there were no casualties,” Naftogaz said via the Telegram messaging app. Ternopil Governor Viacheslav Nehoda said the attack struck a critical industrial facility in the western region and announced possible limits on gas supplies. Ukraine’s air defence shot down a missile and there were no reported casualties, he said. Further attacks were reported in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the northern region of Chernihiv and the western region of Ivano-Frankivsk. The strikes on western Ukraine caused Nato member Poland to scramble aircraft to secure its airspace. “Attention, due to the intensive activity of long-range aviation of the Russian Federation, which is carrying out strikes on objects located, among others, in western Ukraine, Polish and allied aircraft have begun...",

But the first few shots, where she’s enjoying bee farming, reminded me of a recent documentary chronicling David Beckham’s life. What’s with wealthy people and raising bees in their backyard with the help of a professional? Has bee farming become the new Bugatti with the hood down? While I swatted those niggling doubts away, I was treated to some beautiful shots of her extracting honey—because honey seems to be the panacea for the wealthy set. Listen, you can catch flies or fans with honey, but what exactly is the goal here? Every scene in the first episode felt contrived and orchestrated to showcase how lovely, amiable, and down-to-earth Meghan is. Her first guest at her not-so-humble home was her hairdresser bestie. Now, here’s the issue with that: Their friendship seemed to have a we-are-not-equals dynamic. Honestly, his job was to talk her up and marvel at her cucumber-chopping skills rather than be real with her. His wonderment and glee over her making a one-pot pasta in her fancy dish was baffling. Why was the dude so excited about pasta with no cream sauce? Fortunately, her second guest—top producer and actress Mindy Kaling—was more real. That seemed more like a friendship of equals. The sprightly Mindy, who’s generally loved by most, was asking all...",

It was a performance that just so happened to be the most productive offensive showing by a defenseman in franchise history. “I don’t know if they were really great,” the Colorado Avalanche standout said about his six-point outing in a 7-3 victory over San Jose on Thursday. “Nothing was super pretty.”Teammate Nathan MacKinnon might beg to differ. He made sure to put Makar's achievement in proper perspective.His entire season, too.“Tough to find a better player in this league,” said MacKinnon, who had two goals and three assists against the Sharks. \"It’s amazing. It’s fun to see.” Makar became the third defenseman in the last 30 years to have a six-point game, joining the company of Kris Letang (Dec. 27, 2023) and Sheldon Souray (Jan. 10, 2004), according to NHL Stats. “It seems like the forwards are really rolling,” explained Makar, who has 24 goals and 50 assists this season. “They’re finding ways to get to the net. And when guys do that, we just try and get the puck to the net from the back-end and they get rewarded.\"The 26-year-old star was setting up plays for teammates in all sorts of ways, situations and fashion. There was a pass that led to Joel Kiviranta's short-handed goal to kick off Colorado's scoring spree. Another pass helped set up Martin Necas' power-play goal and two more assists paved the way for MacKinnon's goals.Makar joined Tampa Bay forward Nikita...",

This time around, she decided to share a behind-the-scenes story about her iconic song Chura Liya Hai Tumne from Yaadon Ki Baaraat, released in 1973. Taking a trip down memory lane, she recalled fighting with the director to wear the trendsetter “white number\" in the song. Beginning her elaborate note, Zeenat Aman shared how the song gained the stature of a “theme song\" in her career. She wrote, “The clinking of the wine glasses, the sensuous lyrics, the ivory culottes and black choker... Chura Liya inadvertently became something of my theme song. Any event I’ve ever attended anywhere in the world has leaned on it for a gimmick or two.\" Moving on, Zeenat went on to explain how her director Nasir Saab (Nasir Hussain) “wanted to present her in the likes of the heroines of the 60s whose churidar-kurta look with winged eyeliner and bouffant.\" Popular for her style and individuality at that time, Zeenat wanted to wear the white dress in the song. Talking about the same, she continued, “I personally felt gawky in the original outfit and was keen on wearing something more true to my own style.

Further, it revealed Harmony Cobel’s background of joining Lumon, making her another possible candidate. So, who created the Severance program? Here’s what the recent episode has disclosed. Did Harmony Cobel create the Severance before Season 2? Severance Season 2 Episode 8, titled “ ,” revealed that Harmony Cobel was the true creator behind various procedures of the severance program.

Former India cricketer Venkatesh Prasad has questioned Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s strategies with less than a month to go for IPL 2025, asking why the franchise doesn’t have any faith in local talent. Bengaluru have built a reputation for being reliant on star players and overseas talent and have not been able to develop players from scratch, like some of the other sides. Prasad has criticised Bengaluru’s management for prioritising brand value instead of promoting local talent. “How a team is managed makes all the difference. Other teams are putting faith in local talent, so why is RCB not doing the same? Are they building a brand, or are they truly focused on winning the IPL?\" Prasad questioned while speaking on JioHotstar. Bengaluru’s current team boasts Manoj Bhandage and Devdutt Padikkal as local players. The former is an all-rounder who has featured in the Karnataka Premier League and was in the Bengaluru squad for the last two seasons as well but didn’t play any games. Bhandage last played a match in December, in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy . He picked seven wickets in as many matches in the tournament, at an impressive economy of 7.55. Padikkal , on the other hand, has plied his trade for Bengaluru before. He was last seen in action in the Ranji Trophy, where he scored 129 runs in four matches at an average of 32.25. The...",

        "content": "The CDU/CSU and SPD are proposing to create a special fund of €500bn for infrastructure and defence by reforming the country's \"debt brake\" provision. Just over a week after his victory in Germany's federal elections, the country's likely next Chancellor Friedrich Merz is planning to hugely boost defence and infrastructure spending by loosening constitutional fiscal restraints known as the \"debt brake\". Merz announced this week that his centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) — together with its Bavarian sister party (CSU) and likely coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD) — will present a joint bill in parliament next week to ease the country's debt brake. The bill includes a special €500bn fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure by financing projects outside of normal budget spending during the next decade. Given that the debt brake is written into Germany's constitution, the proposals need a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag to pass, which means a race against time for Merz. On Tuesday evening, Merz said that \"in view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent,\" the motto \"whatever it takes\" must also apply to the country's defence. \"The political developments in Europe and the world are evolving faster than we anticipated just a week ago,\" Merz said. \"Germany and Europe must now undertake extraordinary efforts to ensure our defence capabilities.\" Since the confrontation between US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart...",

The bomb was discovered overnight during routine maintenance work in the Saint-Denis suburb, the French national railway company, SNCF, stated. The suburban RER B train service also confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that the device dated back to the Second World War. Authorities immediately suspended all train traffic to and from Gare du Nord, affecting high-speed TGV and Eurostar services. The station, which handles nearly 700,000 passengers daily, faced severe disruptions as police and bomb disposal teams worked to contain the situation. Eurostar’s official website noted that at least three morning departures were canceled as a precaution, with passengers traveling to London, Brussels, and other destinations experiencing significant delays. While officials have not confirmed the bomb’s origins, unexploded ordnance from World War II is still occasionally found in Europe during construction and maintenance projects.

Read More Apple has recently introduced the iPad Air 7th Gen with the M3 chip and the iPad 11th Gen powered by the A16 chip. While both devices come with iPadOS 18, they differ significantly in terms of hardware and performance. If you’re planning to buy a new iPad but are unsure whether to invest in the high-performance iPad Air or opt for the more budget-friendly iPad 11, this quick comparison can help you make an informed choice. iPad 11th Gen and iPad Air 7th Gen: About Software and Performance The primary difference between the iPad Air 7th Gen and the iPad 11th Gen lies in their performance capabilities. The iPad Air 7th Gen is powered by Apple’s M3 chip—the same processor found in MacBooks and iMacs, whereas the iPad 11th Gen runs on the A16 chip, which debuted with the iPhone 15 series. Additionally, the iPad Air comes with support for Apple’s Stage Manager and Apple Intelligence, both expected to roll out in April this year. While Apple doesn’t officially disclose RAM specifications for its devices, the absence of Apple Intelligence support on the iPad 11th Gen suggests it may have less RAM compared to the iPad Air 7th Gen. iPad 11th Gen and iPad Air 7th Gen: Check Design and Screen Size When it comes to design, the iPad 11th Gen and the iPad Air 7th Gen are nearly identical, featuring a sleek build with minimal differences.

Hojlund had an encouraging first season at Old Trafford after arriving from Atalanta BC in 2023, scoring 16 times in all competitions, including 10 goals in the Premier League, but it has been a struggle this term. The 22-year-old has only managed seven goals in 36 appearances for the Red Devils during the current campaign, and he has not found the back of the net in the Premier League since the start of December. Hojlund drew another blank against Real Sociedad in the Europa League on Thursday night, and there is currently speculation surrounding his long-term future at Old Trafford. Man United are set to bring in a new striker this summer, but Amorim has said that he still has full confidence in Hojlund's abilities, insisting that the forward is \"trying really hard\". \"He's trying really hard. He gave everything. He makes the runs,\" Amorim told reporters. \"We know that he also has [to play against] a high line and he uses this space to win, to fight. \"The other things are going to appear in the right moment. He has to continue to play, not be anxious in that position. He did a great run to win the position. Sometimes the ball comes, sometimes it doesn't. So he needs to think in the best way, in this case, in the next game.\" Amorim also addressed Diogo Dalot 's failure to...",

Unapologetically Gritty The glimpse features the setting, language, narrative, and backdrop unapologetically gritty and unrefined. It opens with a disclaimer ‘raw truth, raw language’ setting the tone for what’s to ensue. The story is about a young man (Nani) in a bold and larger-than-life role becomes a leader. Sporting a rugged look, including a watch strapped to his shoes and a country-side gun pulled from the water, Nani walks with a fierce determination. Talking about the criticism and cuss words with Variety, Srikanth says that this time, they are are not blurring or masking societal taboos. “‘The Paradise’ will stand as one of the most authentic, original and unapologetically honest Indian films. It carries immense potential and relevance to resonate with a global audience,” says the director. 'The Paradise Will Be India’s Mad Max' The Paradise is Nani’s most raw and intense character to date. The actor said that The Paradise is going to be India’s ‘Mad Max.’ “The tone and nature of ‘The Paradise’ will be wild, and that wildness will be accompanied by poetic justice,” Nani added.

        "content": "ROME (AP) — Pope Francis hit the three-week mark Friday in his hospitalization for double pneumonia, after giving the world a tangible indication of just how frail he is. The Vatican said the 88-year-old pope had a good night’s rest and woke up Friday morning just after 8 a.m. Doctors said they didn’t expect to give another medical update until Saturday, given his continued stability and absence of respiratory crises or other setbacks for several days now. But Francis offered a first public sign of just how weak he is on Thursday by recording an audio message that was broadcast to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square who had gathered for the nightly recitation of the rosary prayer. In it, Francis thanked the people for their prayers. But his voice was barely discernible through his labored breaths and he spoke in his native Spanish, perhaps because it came more easily to him than Italian. “I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square, I accompany you from here,” he said to the hushed square. “May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you.” The messaged served many purposes. It was the first public sign of life from the pope since he entered Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14, and put to rest right-wing conspiracy theories and rumors calling into question his true medical status. But the audio also underscored just how weak Francis is. For anyone used to hearing his voice, which is often so soft it sounds like a whisper, the audio...",

Grandmaster Aravindh Chithambaram came within striking distance of winning his first major tournament after an easy draw with David Navara of the Czech Republic in the eighth and penultimate round of the Prague Masters tournament. With this result, Aravindh took his tally to 5.5 points, maintaining a half-point lead over compatriot R Praggnanandhaa, who drew with Vietnam’s Quang Liem Le. In the final round, Aravindh will face Turkey’s Ediz Gurel, while Praggnanandhaa has a tougher challenge against Anish Giri of the Netherlands. After losing two of his first three games, top-seeded Chinese GM Wei Yi bounced back impressively, defeating local favorite Nguyen Thai Dai Van to move into sole third place with 4.5 points. Vincent Keymer (Germany), Ediz Gurel, and Giri share fourth place with four points each, followed by Quang Liem, Navara, and Sam Shankland, all on 3.5 points. Dai Van remains at the bottom with 2.5 points. The Berlin defense is normally known to get balanced endgames and this time too, Navara had little trouble reaching an equal endgame. A small oversight by both players at a critical moment briefly offered Aravindh a chance to push for victory, but the opportunity slipped and both players signed a truce in 32 moves.

The composition also seemed to successfully straddle Genesis’ past and future approaches to songwriting.8. In The CageFrom The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, 1974In The Cage captures the mounting panic of the album’s protagonist, Rael, trapped in a prison formed of stalactites and stalagmites.

This makes it an ideal solution if you’re looking for a machine capable of handling 4K video editing. There’s also the fact that it features dual M.2 slots for internal storage, and while the 1TB SSD in my review sample is rather small, you can boost this to an impressive 8TB using two 4TB sticks. But what really interests me—both for video, image editing, 3D graphics and gaming—is the fact that it offers an OCULINK option, enabling you to connect an external GPU such as the GP1. Even without the graphics boost, you still have the option to plug in up to four 4K displays, along with plenty of connection options and network connectivity through both dual LAN and high-performance Wi-Fi.

BOYNEXTDOOR’s Leehan has found himself in the middle of a controversy after a picture of the idol from his pre-debut days surfaced online showing him smoking as a minor. The picture in question shows Leehan holding a cigarette in his hands while exhaling the smoke from his mouth. While it was unclear whether the singer was in middle or high school, it is likely that he was still underage. Smoking as a minor is considered illegal in South Korea, even the sale of tobacco to minors remains prohibited by law. The picture also features another person, whose face was covered with an emoji to avoid disclosure of identity. The picture went instantly viral, leaving fans divided. Many criticised Leehan for his actions, considering underage drinking and smoking are disregarded in the country, others came out in his support. One wrote, “If only smoke was seen in the photo, he could’ve explained it away, but as a cigarette is being held right in view, he can’t deny it even,\" while another added, “Even just by his graduation pic... Personally, I’m fascinated by how such kids even think of debuting. Smoking underaged is FR only what really bad kids do.\" Many even referred to the pre-debut graduation picture of the star, where Leehan’s harsh wording for the yearbook photo also gained immense criticism among fans. On the other hand, many other fans asked haters to not interfere in his personal life. One...",

This is what was suggested during a post-budget webinar held the day before on how to execute the announcements made in the Budget, attended by heads and faculty of these premier engineering institutions. While presenting her eighth consecutive budget, Sitharaman on February 1 this year announced to expand infrastructure across five newer IITs (established after 2014) to accommodate 6,500 more students. She also announced setting up of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) centre of excellence in education while presenting the Budget for 2025-26. These five third generation IITs where seats and infrastructure will be expanded over the next five years include – IIT-Tirupati, IIT-Palakkad, IIT-Jammu, IIT-Dharwad and IIT-Bhilai. The FM also announced that over the next five years, under the PM Research Fellowship (PMRF) scheme, the government will provide 10,000 fellowships for technological research in IITs and IISc with enhanced financial support.

The index was recently down slightly year to date but has still more than tripled investor money over the past decade. There are anxieties for those who know where to look for them, however. This year, the S&P 500 Equal Weight index is doing better than the regular index, which is dominated by tech behemoths. Is that a change in leadership? Defensive sectors are rallying. Healthcare, one of last year’s worst performers, is this year’s best. Value stocks outperformed growth by 3.9 percentage points in February, one of the top 5% of months for relative value returns going back to 1979, according to BofA Securities. Meanwhile, shares in Europe and China are outperforming the U.S. this year. All of this will leave indexers torn over whether to fiddle with their fund mixes. Three U.K. professors have released a report that doesn’t address this topic directly, but offers clues to how investors should think about long-term returns. Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton at London Business School, and Elroy Dimson at Cambridge University, compiled evidence on the exploits of stocks, bonds, bills, currencies, and consumer prices across countries and time periods, including ones that Wall Street doesn’t typically include in its glossy brochures. The three presented their findings in a book near the turn of the millennium called Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment...",

The pictures of Zegler’s unfiltered look were shared on X (formerly Twitter), where they gained traction, especially among Indian users. Zegler’s look sparked a wave of reactions online where desis couldn’t help but draw comparisons to a typical Indian college student.

While India’s refusal to play in the country dented its image and economic prospects, Pakistan team’s early exit from the tournament and the security perception are unlikely to give the expected economy boost even for the matches they are hosting, according to intelligence sources. India’s stance led to their matches being shifted to a neutral venue, Dubai . Pakistan agreed to the hybrid model of hosting on the condition that they will also not send their team to India for upcoming International Cricket Council (ICC) events. The arrangement, which saw other teams shuttle in and out of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) while India stayed put, showed India’s influence over cricket. THE INFRA OVERSPEND & LOSSES This was Pakistan’s first global event since 1996 and venues in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi were made ready with new infrastructure and technology.

Lowry is among a group of players tied for second after a 69, one better than McIlroy and Justin Rose. They are all chasing Wyndham Clark who shot a five-under-par 67 to take a two-stroke lead in a wind-hit first round. Two late birdies lifted former US Open champion Clark to the top of the leaderboard. Lowry shared the lead on four-under-par after an eagle at the 16th, but he dropped a shot at the last. He is tied with American Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley, Canadian Corey Conners and Christiaan Bezuidenhout of South Africa. McIlroy also bogeyed the last, having dropped a stroke on the opening hole. In between, he carded six birdies and two more bogeys en route to a 70. Rose joined him at two-under-par late in the day, despite also opening with a bogey and adding a double bogey six at the ninth. South Korea’s Si Woo Kim, Australian Cam Davis and American Max Greyserman also shot 70s, one better than world number one Scottie Scheffler. He was joined at one-under-par by fellow Americans Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas and Patrick Cantlay.

The Times of India reported, quoting sources, the BCCI may have a 'tough discussion' over Rohit Sharma's future as India's captain for ODIs and Tests. Rohit has retired from the T20 format after helping the team win the big tournament last year. A World Cup winning Indian skipper, Rohit Sharma believes he still has some cricket left in him. The BCCI has asked the Indian captain to share his plans for the future. A BCCI source told TOI, “Retiring is his call but there will be another discussion around continuing with captaincy.

There was an apology. There was an acknowledgement that the United States has done so much for the country of Ukraine and a sense of gratitude,\" he added.

This match presents a significant opportunity for India to break their title drought in One Day Internationals (ODIs), as their last victory in this format occurred in 2013. To provide some context, India’s most recent major ICC trophy in ODIs was the Champions Trophy in 2013, which was won under the captaincy of MS Dhoni. Virat Kohli, who was a member of that team, is now aiming for his second Champions Trophy title and a notable record in the upcoming final.Kohli has participated in four finals of the ODI World Cup and the Champions Trophy, scoring a total of 137 runs across these matches with an average of 34.25, including one half-century. He is just five runs short of becoming India’s top run-scorer in the final matches of these two tournaments.Sourav Ganguly holds the record for participating in the most ICC ODI finals, having appeared in four of them. During these matches, he has accumulated 141 runs in two innings, achieving an impressive average of 70.5, which includes one century.Adam Gilchrist from Australia leads the list of run-scorers in finals, having scored 262 runs in four finals during his distinguished career, with an average of 65.5 and a strike rate of 132.99, including two half-centuries and one century.

Raducanu was playing for the first time since dealing with a stalker at the Dubai Open last month. The former US Open champion, 22, is receiving extra security in California after the man was able to approach her twice while she was alone. Raducanu - who had been left cowering behind the umpire's chair in tears after receiving repeated unwanted attention from a \"fixated\" man before and during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova in Dubai - made a positive start against Uchijima. However, after taking an early break chance in the opening game to hold for a 2-0 lead, Raducanu seemed to struggle in the blustery conditions. Uchijima soon reeled off four games in a row after twice breaking back. Raducanu, though, dug in to win the seventh game with another break to love, only to then be unable to hold again and trail 3-5. Uchijima kept the pressure on and secured a first set point when Raducanu sent a return long. Raducanu - starting a trial period with Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik - was moving freely enough at the start of the second set, but soon found herself facing another couple of break points, which Uchijima eventually converted. Despite Raducanu coming to the net, Uchijima's power proved the difference as another big forehand saw the world No52 open up a 2-0 advantage. Raducanu saved a break point in the next game with...",

The cutbacks threaten to halt the small gains aid workers have made combatting Gaza’s humanitarian crisis during the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. They also could endanger the tenuous truce, which the Trump administration helped cement. USAID was supposed to fund much of the aid to Gaza as the ceasefire progressed, and the Trump administration approved over $383 million on Jan. 31 to that end, according to three USAID officials. But since then, there have been no confirmed payments to any partners in the Middle East, they said. The officials, who have survived multiple rounds of furloughs, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Two senior officials at aid organizations confirmed they have not received any of the promised funds, after spending millions of dollars on supplies and services. They said they could not afford to continue aid operations indefinitely. Some organizations have already reported laying off workers and scaling down operations, according to internal USAID information shared with the AP. That could imperil the ceasefire, under which Hamas is supposed to release hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners and ramping up the entry of humanitarian...",

Directed by Ha Jung Woo , “Lobby” follows the story of Chang Wook (Ha Jung Woo), a startup CEO who has spent his life focused solely on research. However, when faced with the challenge of securing a 4-trillion-won (approximately $2.8 billion) government contract, he is forced to step into the high-stakes world of lobbyist golf for the first time. The recently released character stills capture the unique personalities of the dynamic ensemble cast, led by Gwang Woo ( Park Byung Eun ), the rival company CEO who secures business deals through his lobbying prowess, as he faces off against Chang Wook, a startup CEO who relies on his technical skills. The sharpness of Gwang Woo, a skilled lobbyist and rival businessman, is highlighted in a scene where he is engaged in a conversation at a funeral. His image, which is the complete opposite of Chang Wook’s, hints at just how much of a threat he poses to him.

And Hungary, of course, did not support it because this was completely contrary to our position in favor of peace,” Orban told reporters after the meeting.

Military officials said that South Korea’s air force also stopped the flights of its entire aircrafts except surveillance planes and others needed for emergency situations.Military officials said the Freedom Shield training will proceed as scheduled and they plan to restart live-fire and flight training after...",

        "content": "This week, the new US president addressed the US Congress in what turned out to be the longest speech in history. Apart from talking about immigration, geopolitical conflicts and making America great again, Donald Trump reiterated his strong stance on tariffs. He singled out India for its high tariffs on US auto exports to India and threatened reciprocal tariffs. Now is the time to delve into the intended and unintended consequences of . Tariffs have been a recurring theme under Trump In the six weeks since Trump assumed office, he has imposed (and threatened) tariffs on a whole bunch of countries and sectors. Countries on his radar have included the US’ largest trading partners–China, Mexico, and Canada. Tariffs were paused to bring them to the negotiating table, only to be reapplied a month later. He has also threatened tariffs on the European Union and India. Products under the tariff-heat include steel, aluminium, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Most recently, reciprocal tariffs have been threatened wherein somehow, ignoring the economics of demand and supply, the US would impose the same tariff on other countries, as is imposed on them by those countries. Trade tactics or a tool for negotiation? To be sure, tariffs are not new to the Trump regime. For instance, while Trump had imposed 25% tariffs on Chinese goods during his first term, Biden increased the tariffs exponentially to 50% on Chinese electronics and 100% on Chinese electric vehicles. But what...",

More than 70 people were killed and dozens more wounded in Syria in fighting between government security forces and militants loyal to deposed ruler Bashar al-Assad, a war monitor said Friday. “More than 70 killed and dozens wounded and captured in bloody clashes and ambushes on the Syrian coast between members of the Ministry of Defense and Interior and militants from the defunct regime’s army,\" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a post on X. It said earlier that fighting Thursday between government forces and Assad loyalists had killed 48 people in the coastal town of Jableh and adjacent villages, saying they were “the most violent attacks against the new authorities since Assad was toppled\" in December. The overall toll during this week’s unrest was not immediately clear. Pro-Assad fighters killed 16 security personnel while 28 fighters aligned with the ousted president and four civilians were also killed, the Observatory said Thursday. The earlier fighting was in the Mediterranean coastal province of Latakia, the heartland of Assad’s Alawite minority who were considered bastions of support during his rule. Mustafa Kneifati, a security official in Latakia, said that in “a well-planned and premeditated attack, several groups of Assad militia remnants attacked our positions and checkpoints,\" targeting patrols in the Jableh area.

        "content": "India’s stock market isn’t just facing a downturn, it’s being suffocated by its own taxation policies, according to angel investor Naman Shrivastava. While many point fingers at global factors, Shrivastava, in a post on LinkedIn, argues that the real damage is coming from within. Until 2018, India had zero Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax on equities held for over a year, creating an environment where investors thrived, and the market flourished. That changed when the government reintroduced LTCG at 10% on gains above ₹1 lakh—only to raise it again to 12.5%. Add a surcharge and cess, and suddenly, long-term investing wasn’t as attractive, he writes. Countries such as Singapore, UAE, Hong Kong, and the Netherlands still have 0% LTCG on equities, making them a haven for global investors. The contrast is stark. “If I change my tax residency to UAE and use it as a base to invest in US markets, I may not pay any tax on equities,” Shrivastava points out. The tax squeeze doesn’t stop at LTCG. Until 2020, Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) was 15% at the company level, making it manageable. Now, dividends are taxed in the hands of investors, with top earners facing rates as high as 42%. That’s not all—India also imposes a direct trading tax on every buy-sell order, something that no other major economy does while also taxing capital gains, his post says. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are offloading Indian equities at a relentless pace, disregarding sectoral outlooks....",

Clearly, rugby fans of all stripes will be salivating at Saturday’s key clash between Ireland and France. It’s a bit less usual to get excited at the kind of historical mismatch which, in the past, I might have watched as highlights, late in the evening, when I already knew the result. Is it because I expect the action to be good? Uncertain. Italy pushed England close last year and dominated Wales in Rome last month, which salts the dish. The home team need a sizeable win – four tries for the bonus point – to stay in the title hunt, which raises the question of whether Steve Borthwick’s reformatted backline can finally cut loose and run in a cricket score. Or will Italy bounce back from a drubbing at the hands of the French and provide a last-minute Twickenham thriller for the third game running? I don’t know, and right now I don’t really care either way. The true reason I’m invested in this game – along with all the others happening this weekend – is because the Six Nations has become, over the past few weeks, the kind of escapism that I want and desperately need. It’s the one genuine safe space I can retreat into while civilisation appears to be collapsing in on itself. This probably began a month ago, when President Trump announced plans for a Gaza riviera .

        "content": "US President Donald Trump repeated his criticism of India’s high tariffs, indicating the country remains a target of reciprocal duties set to take effect April 2. “India’s a very high tariff nation,” Trump said Thursday during an Oval Office event, calling the upcoming reciprocal tariffs “the big one” among the many new duties he has pledged. India is expected to be hit hard by the like-for-like duties given the high tariffs it charges when compared with the US. Trump’s remarks are the latest criticism of India’s trade barriers, which the US president has said unfairly penalize American businesses. The remarks come as Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal visits the US this week to meet with Trump administration officials to discuss trade policy between the two countries. During a White House meeting in February, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump reached an agreement to increase their bilateral trade to £500 billion by 2030. and negotiate a trade deal by the fall of this year. Indian officials are hoping that ongoing discussions toward such a deal will give the country a reprieve from the April 2 duties. Trump hasn’t indicated whether any countries will be exempted from the reciprocal tariffs. However, the US president on Thursday offered major reprieves to Mexico and Canada, the US’s two largest trading partners, by exempting goods from those nations that are covered by the North American trade agreement known as USMCA from his 25 per cent tariffs....",

Former Pakistan opener Ahmad Shahzad made a big remark and said that having Mohammad Amir in RCB could help the team win their maiden title. Shahzad made the remake on Geo TV show which also had Amir and former wicketkeeper-batter Rashid Latif, who said that RCB should not think of winning the title till MS Dhoni is in the CSK. If Amir plays for RCB, they could win the IPL title,\" said Shehzad. \"Till MS Dhoni is there in CSK, don't even think RCB can touch the IPL trophy.\" replied Latif.

Tropical Cyclone Alfred was forecast to cross the coast of Queensland state north of downtown Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city, early Saturday, Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said. “It‘s important to note that the exact track is still uncertain,” Collopy told reporters in Brisbane. Alfred was moving west with sustained winds near the center of 95 kph (59 mph) and gusting to 130 kph (81 mph).

Coach Tom Thibodeau said after the game that Brunson was still being examined by the medical staff. “It’s a bummer of an injury. We expect him to be out for a little bit,” forward Josh Hart said. Brunson — who is seventh in the league in scoring (26.3 points per game) and eighth in assists (7.4 per game) — rolled his right ankle with 1:24 remaining in overtime after landing on the foot of Lakers guard Austin Reaves after being fouled on a drive to the basket. Brunson got help up from teammates and stayed in the game to make both free throws and tie it at 107. He then came out and went to the locker room. Brunson led the Knicks with 39 points and 10 assists. He sent the game into overtime with a three-point play after the Lakers rallied from a double-digit deficit midway through the fourth quarter. “His mental toughness is through the roof. It doesn’t surprise me the way he played the whole game. He still keeps battling and battling,” Thibodeau said about Brunson, who was 13 of 26 from the field and made 12 of his 13 foul shots. Brunson’s injury could not come at a worse time for the Knicks. The loss to the Lakers began a five-game West Coast trip.
