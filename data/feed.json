        "content": "The Federal Government has asked members of the National Assembly to subject the Nigerian National Anthem Bill to wider consultations before passing it. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, stated this in Abuja on Monday at a public hearing on the bill to revert to the old national anthem. Recall that the House of Representatives accelerated and passed the bill in a single sitting last Thursday, while the Senate passed the bill through first and second readings. Speaking at the hearing jointly organised by the Senate Committees on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters and Interior, Fagbemi said the lawmakers failed to get the opinions of other stakeholders before passing the bill. He said there was a need for a wider process where Nigerians and other arms and tiers of government would participate in the decision to revert to the old national anthem before it finally becomes law. Fagbemi specifically proposed consultations through zonal public hearings and resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. He said: “ Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem, whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians. I thank you all for granting me the audience to contribute my thoughts to this national cause.”",

Fire crews were expected to remain at the scene of a fire on Logan Avenue for much of Monday. Firefighters were sent to the three-storey commercial building on the 1000 block of Logan at 4:35 a.m. Smoke from the fire was visible from many areas of the city later in the morning. Crews fought the flames from outside the building, using aerial ladders to douse the blaze with water. The building is attached to G&L Sales, a liquidation store. Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service crews work at putting out a fire as smoke billows from a large building on Logan Avenue. (Mike Deal / Free Press) The rail line running through the property was shut down while firefighters were at the scene. Earlier, at 2:33 a.m., firefighters were sent to a fire in another commercial building, on the 900 block of Erin Street. Crews initially fought the fire from inside but moved outside when it became unsafe. The blaze was declared under control at 4:35 a.m., the same time crews were sent to the Logan Avenue fire. The building sustained significant fire, water and smoke damage, the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service said in a news release. Crews were sent to the scene of a garage fire on the 1400 block of Alexander Avenue at 1:41 a.m. Crews brought the fire, which had started to spread to the adjacent house, under control at 2:30 a.m. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. At 8:06 p.m. Sunday, crews were sent to a vacant, two-and-a-half storey house on the 300 block of McGee Street after city police officers spotted a fire. The fire was declared under control at 10:13 p.m. Crews were sent to a two-storey commercial building on the first 100 block of Higgins Avenue at 11:28 p.m. Saturday. The fire was put out by 12:06 a.m. Fire crews were sent to a two-storey home on the 100 block of Notre Dame Avenue at 12:52 a.m. Saturday.

        "content": "KEY WEST, Fla. (WFLA) — A fleet of wacky “do it yourself” vessels set sail from Key West on Sunday, battling it out in an annual competition that raises money for local veterans. In the Schooner Wharf Minimal Regatta, competitors must fashion a boat and paddles out of just a single sheet of plywood, some two-by-fours and duct tape. The creatively-designed vessels can be surprisingly intricate, ranging from simple canoes to recreations of the Titanic and pirate ships. The teams are asked with staying afloat long enough to complete a short course without ending up in the water. “Costumes and themed entries are encouraged, and many boats end up being more scenic than seaworthy,” the competition’s website reads. “Entries in past regattas have included alligators, spaceships, guitars, wine bottles and replicas of schooners, shrimp boats, pirate vessels and paddle boats!” Sailors can win prizes in categories like “most creative design” and “fastest boat.” Organizers present the “sinker awards” to captains who go down with their ships. The $20 entry fee goes to support the local American Legion Post 28.",

        "content": "Norwich City have agreed compensation close to £400,000 for Nordsjaelland head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup, according to reports. The Canaries are known to have offered Thorup the job, having decided on him over fellow candidates Will Still and Pascal Jansen late last week. The Dane is keen on the move, leaving only negotiations over details. Those negotiations have escalated since the conclusion of the Danish Superliga season at the weekend, with part of those being the compensation fee for Thorup. Those behind the scenes at Carrow Road were relaxed about the agreement of compensation, with other issues including contracts and potential backroom staff included in discussions over recent days. Now Danish outlet Tipsbladet have claimed that a deal has been struck with the Tigers for the transfer of their head coach, whose work permit was sorted during the interview process. Norwich sporting director Ben Knapper has long been a fan of Thorup, who has gained a good reputation across Europe for his development of young players and positive tactical style. Although due diligence included considering other coaches, Thorup was the frontrunner for some time. The 35-year-old declined to discuss reports of a move to England when asked after his last game at Nordsjaelland, telling Viaplay: \"Have I heard anything from [Norwich]? I want to say, as I have also said several times during this season, that when I am employed somewhere, I have so much respect for the place I am employed. \"Just look at this scenery that is behind me right now. I think it would be so disrespectful of me to go out and talk about other clubs or other situations. \"No matter if it was close or completely miles away - I'm never ever going to go into that because this club means so much that we shouldn't be standing here on the last day of the season talking about everything else.\"",

The Sky Blue Star suffered a 3-2 defeat against Kwara United on Sunday. The visitors conceded three times in the first half before scoring twice late in the game. Ogunmodede commended his players for their performances and vowed to keep pushing for the title. “We will not give up. We will keep fighting to the end. We knew it wouldn’t be easy, but we’ll learn from our mistakes and come back stronger,” he said after the game. “The only disappointment is that we were unable to get the maximum three points. We planned for the win, but unfortunately, we couldn’t get our desired results. “That is the only disappointment. I understand there is no excuse for failure; if not, I would have been talking about the abrupt break we had for a month, so you expect a team to come back and give it their best—it’s impossible. “But nevertheless, it was a good fight. Kwara United took advantage of their early goal; you know this is a team who had the luck of playing about two matches during the holidays, which tells of their match fitness, and the early goal gave them a lot of confidence. We were struggling; they took advantage again and scored their second goal before the whistle sounded for the second half. “We came in the second half and fought hard; we were unlucky and scored an own goal. We wanted to be champions, and we know what it means to be champions—as champions, you don’t give up. So we fought. We got two consolidating goals, but it wasn’t enough.” Related Topics: NPFL Ogunmodede Remo Stars Don't Miss Transfer: Balogun signs one-year contract with Rangers You may like NPFL: New Super Eagles invitee Ismail bags 13th assist Remo Stars’ Ismail celebrates maiden Super Eagles’ invitation Ogunmodede excited with Ismail’s Super Eagles invitation NPFL rejects Katsina United’s request for postponement of Shooting Stars clash 2026 WCQ: Remo Stars celebrate Ismail’s Super Eagles invitation NPFL urges clubs, referees to abide by regulations Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

        "content": "Veteran Super Eagles and Rangers defender, Leon Aderemi Balogun, has signed a new deal that will see him stay at the club for another year, Soccernet.ng reports. The 35-year-old joined the Scottish record Champions for a second spell from Queens Park Rangers last summer, but the move didn’t pan out how he wanted it, as he could only play 18 games all season. After signing for the Gers on a year contract for a second stint, Balogun’s contract was set to expire at the end of this season. Soccernet.ng earlier reported that Rangers boss, Philippe Clement, was impressed with his performances towards the end of the season before the former Mainz 05 man picked up an injury that kept him out of the Scottish Cup final. The 46-time capped Super Eagles defender is also keen on extending his stay at Ibrox. According to The Scottish Sun , Philippe Clement has rewarded Balogun’s performances with a new deal that will see him continue at the club for another season. Rangers are set to bolster their central-defensive options over the coming weeks and it’s believed Levski Sofia stopper – Jose Cordoba, is top of their wishlist. While Rangers are in renewal talks with John Souttar, Connor Goldson, Ben Davies and Leon King, they will also be parting ways with John Lundstram, Borna Barisic, Ryan Jack and John McLaughlin who are all out of contract at the end of the season, and Balogun’s experience will help the club’s new signings to settle in nicely. Balogun last played for Nigeria in their 10-0 win over São Tomé and Príncipe, coming off the substitute’s bench with 19 minutes left to play.",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak insisted he took responsibility for the Conservatives’ election campaign after a leaked memo criticised MPs and ministers over a lack of effort. Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer, staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.”",

        "content": "Mr Wike stated this in Abuja on Monday, after he inspected the Southern Parkway Road and Abuja Rail Mass Transit, in preparation for commercial inauguration on May 29. According to Mr Wike, Mr Tinubu has done very well in FCT and the country in just one year, particularly in physical infrastructure and human capital development. “Mr President “Renewed Hope” agenda is no longer a story; it’s a reality. It is a promise made and a promise fulfilled. “I think Mr. President has done very very well in terms of reassuring Nigerians that he is committed to deliver the dividend of democracy. “From what we have seen on the ground, there is really hope for Nigerians. “So, we are very happy.” He added that in FCT, Tinubu has rekindled the hope of civil servants by instituting their career progression “and I am sure the civil servants are happy”. The minister noted that although there were some areas that needed to be looked into, one year was not enough for Tinubu to deliver 100 per cent expectations of Nigerians. On the inauguration of the projects, Mr Wike said: “We are good to go; just putting finishing touches. “We have been to the Southern Parkway, and we are 100 per cent ready. Here in the Metro Line, we are also ready. “We are happy that all our efforts have come to fruition. “The residents are very happy and by the end of the day, the train services will be available for Nigerians. “So, for us at FCTA, we are very very happy,” the minister said.

        "content": "The NHL fined New York Rangers captain Jacob Trouba $5,000 on Monday for elbowing Florida Panthers forward Evan Rodrigues. The incident occurred late in the second period in Game 3 on Sunday. Trouba received a two-minute minor for the elbow as well as a minor penalty for slashing during the same sequence. Rodrigues, who was struck in the side of the face, left the ice with help but eventually returned in the third period. Trouba, 30, contributed two assists on Sunday in Sunrise, Fla., as New York won 5-4 in overtime to seize a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals. Trouba has one goal and six assists in 13 games this postseason. The defenseman tallied 22 points (three goals, 19 assists) and 73 penalty minutes in 69 games during the regular season.

        "content": "The road to Omaha has officially begun with the 64-team field for NCAA Division I baseball championship being revealed. Tennessee is the No. 1 (50-11) overall seed after dominating for the entire year and winning the SEC regular-season title and conference tournament. The rest of the top four includes two other SEC schools -- Kentucky at No. 2, Texas A&M at No. 3 -- and North Carolina at No. 4. LSU will look to defend its title on the road in the Chapel Hill Regional with its first game against Wofford, and elsewhere, the Bryan-College Station Regional should bring the drama with the opportunity for Texas A&M to face in-state rival Texas. Notably, Florida State is back in the tournament after missing it for the first time since 1977 last year. The SEC and ACC are each hosting five regionals. The other host regional sites include two schools from the Big 12, two from the Pac-12 -- Arizona was crowned the last Pac-12 champion and is hosting -- and one from the AAC and one from the Big West. Oklahoma is hosting for the first time since 2010, and UC Santa Barbara is hosting for its first time on campus as the only other time the school hosted was in 2015 and did so at a neutral location.

        "content": "Former Mamelodi Sundowns player Lovers Mohlala has spoken about how frustrating it was to miss out on a move abroad, when the club rejected an offer from a Danish club. Soccer Laduma spoke to the retired player to talk about the years he spent with the Tshwane giants. I was there from 1997 until 2003 I think. My time at Sundowns was very nice and painful as well. The nicest part about being at Sundowns was that we were a team that was winning. Players dedicated their lives to represent the Sundowns badge. At some point, I was frustrated. Frustrated how? Remember FC Conpenhagen bought Sibusiso Zuma? I actually went for trials there. They were supposed to buy me. They offered $400 000 to Sundowns. But Sundowns wanted $700 000. The painful part is that what Motsepe is doing today, Sundowns did not do back then. We didn't get bonuses for the Champions League. They said we would share what we win, but we lost in the final and we did not get a cent. We had great players, the likes of Alex Bapela, John Tlale, Roger Feutmba and (Joel) Fire Maselela. We had a bunch of good players and there was unity. We were not celebrity. We were protected by king pins and taxi owners. Even in the township, the Sundowns players would not be hijacked so easily. I remember Albert Kometsi who used to play for Swallows was hijacked. Then we called around and we told him that he would find his car at the police station, but he would not find the tyres and the radio. We were protected and we were not paying a protection fee. We had the nicest time at Sundowns, but there was no money. I'll tell you one thing...the highest that I earned at Sundowns was R12 000. We were playing with players who really wanted to win. The painful part is that you retire in football, but you can't even enter the yard at Sundowns. That's the sad part. When you play, there is no pension. We are the only ones who pay tax and not get a pension fund. That's the sad part of football. My first game was against Chiefs and we beat them 4-1. I was on the bench and Bra Stan said 'boy, what''s your nickname?' Then he said 'today, your name is Horse'. I created two goals that day. That's where I started. I knew when I got there, I had already made a mark for myself. When I got there, it was a matter of showing my skill. It was frustration. They did not want to sell me to Copenhagen. When Copenhagen bought Zuma, Sundowns refused to sell me. They gave me the offer in my hand. They called Sundowns and they even offered me a salary. That's when I got frustrated.",

        "content": "Getting a medical staffing company prepared to compete for $43 billion worth of work will be a \"bit of a crystal ball exercise,\" says Bill Rivard. Rivard is CEO and founder of Matrix Providers, which specializes in recruiting and placing health care professionals across the nation's military bases. Denver-based Matrix on Thursday joined 10 other companies selected to fill a $43 billion contract to recruit thousands of health care workers for the national network of Army, Navy, and Air Force bases over the next 15 years. It's the federal government's largest health care staffing contract yet, enlarged in part to respond to the national health care staffing shortage, said Rivard, an optometrist who spent 21 years on active duty with the Army and seven with the reserves. The constraints of the national staffing shortfall, coupled with the fact that health care jobs serving the military look a bit different, means that Rivard has his work cut out for him. > Read the full story at the Denver Business Journal.

        "content": "The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry has ordered the shuttering of two B.C. based technology companies, one of which makes drones with military applications. In a brief statement posted Friday (May 24), Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said two companies must be dissolved, following a national security review. The companies in question are Bluvec Technologies Inc. and Pegauni Technology Inc. “The government’s decisions are based on facts and evidence and on the advice ofCanada’s security and intelligence community, and other governmentpartners,” Champagne said in the news release. “While Canada continues to welcome foreign direct investment, we will act decisively when investments threaten our national security.” Bluvec, based in Burnaby, makes a drone detection system, which has potential military applications. As reported by Glacier Media last year, Bluvec was successfully sued by another Burnaby drone detection company , Skycope Technologies for stealing proprietary source code. The founders of both Bluevec and Skycope were friends who originally worked for the same cybersecurity company in China, according B.C. Supreme Court documents. The principals of Bluvec identified in the lawsuit are Junfeng Jia (aka Jack Jia), Leyuan Pan (aka Michael Pan), Kunyu Zhang (aka Eric Zhang) and Qianqi Zhuang (aka Tim Zhuang). Also listed as defendants in the case were Xiaoqian Wu (aka Karl Wu) and Jiawei Li. The principal of Skyscope Technologies is Zhenhua (Eric) Liu, according to the court ruling. The court case notes that both Bluvec and Skyscope developed technology that “enables users to detect and block or ‘jam’ unwanted drones.” Bluvec and two of its principals – Junfeng Jia and Leyuan Pan – were ordered to pay Skycope Technologies $800,000 for breaching employment agreements with Skycope. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Bluvec said Jack Jia was unavailable. [email protected] twitter.com/nbennett_biv",

        "description": "Nairn County have confirmed season ticket prices will remain unchanged for next season, but under-16s will get free entry at Station Park.",
        "content": "Preparations for the 2024/25 Highland League season have continued in earnest at Nairn County. The Wee County have unveiled their new home shirt for the upcoming season, featuring thin black stripes and the club’s new badge, as well as sponsors Murray Travel. It will be available for purchase from the Town Barbers on Nairn’s High Street at the beginning of June. Fixtures for the next Highland League campaign have also been released, with Ross Tokely’s men given a tricky start after the summer. On the opening day of the season on Saturday, July 27, Nairn will travel to defending champions Buckie Thistle – although that match is subject to change depending on the Jags’ League Cup group stage fixture list. Should there be a clash, Nairn’s first league game will take place on Wednesday, July 31 at Victoria Park. The weekend after it does not get any easier, with 2023/24 runners up Brechin City due to make the journey to Station Park. Nairn’s first scheduled midweek fixture of next season will be a derby away at Clachnacuddin on Wednesday, August 7, which is then set to be followed by a trip to another side who will hope to be in title contention, Banks O’Dee. The first round of the Highland League Cup has also been slotted into the calendar, due to take place on Saturday, November 9. With the fixture list being released, excitement will naturally begin to build about the return of football at Station Park, and season tickets are on sale at the same prices as last season. Under-16s, though, will get free entry for all league matches in the 2024/25 campaign. More good news in the meantime as goalkeeper Dylan Maclean has signed a new contract to remain at the club. Maclean’s new deal will see him remain with Nairn until the summer of 2026. The 28-year-old shot stopper has already spent eight seasons as the Wee County’s number one, having made his debut from the bench at home against Brora Rangers on September 9, 2015. He made his first start in the same fixture on the opening day of the following season, and has since gone on to make 186 appearances for the club, keeping 40 clean sheets. Maclean is a three-time supporters’ player of the year, and won his first piece of silverware in the North of Scotland Cup last season – having played a key role in the semi final win over Caley Thistle, saving the decisive penalty in the shoot-out. Manager Ross Tokely was pleased to have tied down the shot-stopper, saying: \"Dylan has been a regular part of the team for a number of years now and played in all but two of our games last season. \"Having played in front of him for the past season-and-a-half, I know how dependable Dylan is. He is capable of making some great saves throughout the season and is clearly a popular player with the supporters. \"I am delighted with the goalkeepers we have at the club and it is a clean slate when we come back after our summer break, so Dylan and the others will have the chance in training to show they can start the season as the club's number one.\"",

        "content": "The Press Information Bureau (PIB), which is a part of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, has fact-checked the media reports claiming New Delhi Railway Station will be shut down for 4four years. The New Delhi Railway Station isn't shutting down in 2024. The Ministry of Railways has made this clear. Many media houses had said that the station would close for four years because of development works. They also said that many trains would run from other stations in Delhi. The government has now said that they will give information beforehand if they need to divert any trains. The Press Information Bureau (PIB), which is a part of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, has posted about this. They have rejected the reports that said the New Delhi Railway Station would close. Clarification about Shut down of New Delhi Railway Station for redevelopment Some sections of the media have reported that New Delhi Railway Station will be shut down by the end of this year for redevelopment work It is to announce that New Delhi Railway Station will never be...— PIB India (@PIB_India) May 27, 2024 Many Indian Railway Stations Getting A Makeover The Indian Government has a plan called the Amrut Bharat Station Scheme. Under this plan, they will redevelop 1318 railway stations in the country. The British built most of these stations. The list of stations for redevelopment includes big ones like New Delhi, Delhi Cantonment, Anand Vihar, Gurugram, and Faridabad. In 2022, the Ministry of Railways shared a photo of the proposed redevelopment of the New Delhi Railway Station on social media. The planned proposal calls for a 40-story twin tower, multi-level parking, and pick-up and drop areas at the station, per a Hindustan Times report. The infrastructure of these stations will be modernised by this renovation plan. For millions of travellers, it will improve travel. The government's clarification guarantees that the renovation project won't interfere with the New Delhi Railway Station's normal operations. This allays the worries expressed in the preliminary findings.",

        "content": "A prominent businessman residing in Montego Bay, St James, is now in critical condition at the Cornwall Regional Hospital following an incident where he was shot and seriously injured by gunmen at his home in the Green Pond community on Saturday night. Reports indicate that around 11:00 PM, the businessman, who operates a supermarket at Farm Bridge, closed up business for the day and drove home to Capital Heights in Green Pond with his girlfriend. Upon reaching the yard, the supermarket operator alighted from the vehicle and was in the process of entering his house when two armed men ambushed them and opened fire, hitting him multiple times. ‘Rubba’ and the female fled while the gunmen made their escape. The police were summoned, and upon arrival, the businessman, discovered suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, was rushed to the hospital where he was treated and admitted in serious condition.",

        "description": "The News Mill",
        "content": "Delhi’s Karkardooma court on Tuesday is likely to pronounce an order on the bail plea of Umar Khalid in the larger conspiracy of Delhi riots case of 2020. He has been in custody since September 2020 in a case under UAPA. Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid has sought regular bail on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons. Special Judge Sameer Bajpai reserved the order on May 13 after hearing the counsel at length. Delhi police’s Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) opposed the plea calling it frivolous and baseless. He also filed written submissions. Umar Khalid’s Counsel had argued that no terror case was made out against him and his name was repeated in the charge sheet of Delhi police. Repeating his name doesn’t make a lie, a truth. There was a vicious media trial taken against him. He had also filed his written submissions. It is alleged by the Delhi police that Umar Khalid had pre-planned protests in 2020 at 23 sites that culminated in riots. After withdrawing his bail plea from the Supreme Court in February, Khalid moved to trial court seeking bail on the grounds of a change in circumstances and parity with other account-used persons. Senior advocate Tridip Pais questioned the submissions of Delhi police and asked, “Is sharing messages a criminal or terror act?” He also responded to submissions earlier made by the Special public prosecutor (SPP) who had said that Khalid was amplifying his narrative as part of a conspiracy by sharing certain links with people with people from politics and others on social media. Pais argued that Umar Khalid was sharing the ‘correct narrative.’ The senior advocate had also submitted that there was a vicious media trial taking place against Umar Khalid. He also referred to various statements of news anchors from different media channels. He said that anchors were reading from the charge sheet around the clock. He further argued that no terror case is made out against Umar Khalid and police have no material to this effect. The court must see whether a terror case is made against him or not. There are contradictions in the statement of prosecution witnesses, Pais added. In this situation, the court must determine whether the witness statement prima facie makes a terror case against Umar Khalid. Earlier it was argued that there accused persons namely Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha were granted bail by the High Court. They had a similar role to that of Umar Khalid. While opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid, Delhi police had said that his chats revealed that he is in the habit of creating narratives on media and social media to influence bail hearings. It was also submitted by the Special Public Prosecutor that several people took to X (earlier Twitter) to influence bail hearing. He had referred to the post on X by Teesta Seetalvad, Amnesty India, Akar Patel, Raj Kaushik, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) while opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid referred to his WhatsApp chats. The SPP had submitted, “WhatsApp chats also revealed that he is in habit of creating media and social media narratives at the time of listing of bail applications of the person booked in cases to clearly influence bail hearings.” “Similar exercise is being adopted while applicants’ bails are being listed to influence his bail hearings, samples of post on X (earlier Twitter) with hashtag about applicant annexed herewith,” SPP added. “Thus in the light of the aforesaid, the present second application for grant of bail to the accused deserves to be dismissed by this honourable court in the interest of justice,” SPP Prasad submitted. SPP Amit Prasad also mentioned the Post on Twitter by Teesta Seetalvad, Aakar Patel, Kaushik Raj, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. SPP had also read some of the tweets in the court. One of the tweets read “Ram Raheem”s parole approved, Umar Khalid bail 14 times adjourned in SC. #freeumarkhalid.” “Umar Khalid withdraws his bail petition from SC. This is a travesty of Justice,” another tweet read. SPP submitted that Amnesty India also tweeted which read “SC has adjourned hearing his bail hearing 14 times. Acute Subversion of the right of Umar Khalid to get bail.” “#freeUmarKhalid was used,” the SPP submitted. The SPP argued that while they claim that they were subjected to media trial, it is he who was playing around with the media, how His father gave interviews in the media and people associated with him also doing the same. In his rebuttal arguments, Senior Advocate Tridip Pais argued that a mere meeting of accused individuals doesn’t imply terrorism. “None of the witnesses didn’t say anything but then miraculously said something two weeks later. All the witnesses here seem to be taking tablets for memory. Prima facie requires depth, not frivolously reading out the chargesheet,” Pais argued. Senior advocate Pais submitted that the prosecution argument is that because I (Umar Khalid) can fain tension. Therefore I don’t deserve bail. His father gave an interview therefore he doesn’t deserve the bail. While arguing, the senior advocate referred to the Supreme Court judgement in Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, Shoma Sen and Varnan Gonsalves. “It was submitted that the allegations should be good enough to establish the allegations are substantive, to reject the bail. The duty of the court is not to deal with the material meticulously but to see the broad probability,” the senior advocate added. On the point of terrorist activity aspect, it was submitted that there is no evidence to show it is a terrorist activity. There is nothing on record to attract section Section 15 of UAPA. The High Court and the Special Court haven’t distinguished between the acts or persons. They’ve just painted everything with a broad brush. There is not a single witness whose statement attracts 15(1) qua me (Umar Khalid). On the point of meeting Umar Khalid, the defence counsel rejected the prosecution’s arguements that meetings were secret ones. He said that Umar Khalid, Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi met at the office of PFI has been referred by the Prosecution on the basis of the statement of a witness CDR. “You want to rely on CDR to deny me bail, Pais questioned. “As per CDR they were not there at the given time and date,” he argued. He further argued that there is no credible case of conspiracy, which is also not terror activity. There is no seizure from me that can attract the offence of terror activity. “On the whimsical statement, sometimes even without witnesses, an act of terrorism is foisted towards me,” Pais submitted. “It was also said that Bangladeshi women and children were deployed at the protest sites. Did any women say that it was against me,” Pais questioned. “In the Varnan Gonsalves and Shoma Sen case, the views of the Supreme Court on Prima Facie and analysis of Prima facie have been clarified,” the defence counsel argued. Pais argued that at the time of hearing bail, the court was under a duty to scan the case diary to decide whether the allegations were prima facie true or not. Third-party hearsay can not be attributed to me. “Mere having a meeting is not enough to oppose the bail. There is no material as of now. The bail cannot be denied as the material can come later,” Pais argued. “If ten witnesses state my name, does that make a terror case against me? I have not indulged in a terrorist act. There is not even a seizure from me,” Pais submitted",

        "content": "After Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, accused in the alleged obscene case, alleged conspiracy against him, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said on Monday that he was free to say anything but is bound to face the law. “Prajwal Revanna may say whatever he wants, but eventually he will have to face the law once he lands,” Shivakumar told reporters at the KPCC office in Bengaluru on Monday. On asked about Prajwal Revanna’s allegation that the alleged case against him was a conspiracy of the Congress party, Shivakumar said, “I don’t have much information on Prajwal Revanna’s video, but I came across it through the media. No matter what he says, he doesn’t have a choice but to present himself before the SIT for investigation. The law will take its course in this case.” “Rahul Gandhi has spoken about Prajwal based on media reports, there is nothing wrong with it. Time will answer Prajwal’s allegation on Rahul Gandhi,” he added. Prajwal Revanna, earlier in the day, released a self-made video in which he alleged political conspiracy behind the case and said that he will appear before the SIT on May 31. The Hassan MP also claimed that he “went into depression” and “isolated” himself as he accused Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders of sparking a discussion on the issue as part of an alleged conspiracy. Revanna is facing a probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT) constituted by the Karnataka government over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in his household. Revanna’s video comes days after his grandfather and JDS patron HD Deve Gowda, issued a stern warning to return to India from abroad and face the law in the obscene video case. “I have already said that he should be given the harshest punishment under the law if found guilty. I also cannot convince people that I was unaware of Prajwal’s activities. I cannot convince them that I have no desire to shield him. I cannot convince them that I am not aware of his movements and that I was not aware of his foreign trip. I believe in answering my conscience. I believe in God, and I know the almighty knows the truth,” the former PM said in a post on X on May 23. “I will ensure that there will be no interference in the enquiry against him from me or my family members,” the former PM added. According to the sources, the Ministry of External Affairs of India has received a letter from the Karnataka government for the cancellation of the diplomatic passport in respect of MP Prajwal Revanna. The request is being processed. Siddaramaiah had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1 and May 23 urging him to take action to cancel the diplomatic passport of the Hassan MP, who is said to have flown to Europe after being accused of sexually exploiting several women. In his letter to the Prime Minister, the Karnataka CM said that it is shameful that Prajwal Revanna fled the country on April 27, 2024, to Germany using his diplomatic passport, shortly after news of his heinous actions emerged and just a few hours before the first FIR was filed against him. Speaking on the Karnataka government’s request for cancellation of Revanna’s diplomatic passport, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) received a request only on May 21 to impound Revanna’s passport Revanna. In an exclusive interview with ANI, Jaishankar clarified the procedural aspects, saying, “To impound a passport is governed by an act called the Passport Act. We need a judicial court or a police request to do so. The MEA got this request from Karnataka only on May 21.” Highlighting the adherence to legal procedures, Jaishankar emphasised that the external affairs minister acted promptly upon receiving the request. “We immediately acted on it. On 23rd of May... we have to follow a certain procedure and the procedure is initiated,” he added. However, Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said that they did not get any written communication from the MEA in this matter",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. The memo, obtained by The Times, said a “key theme” was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign after Mr Sunak surprised Westminster by calling a July 4 General Election. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer, staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.”",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak insisted he took responsibility for the Conservatives’ election campaign after a leaked memo criticised MPs and ministers over a lack of effort. Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. The memo, obtained by The Times, said a “key theme” was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign after Mr Sunak surprised Westminster by calling a July 4 General Election. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer, staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.”",

That's when the OnePlus 13 , the Oppo Find X8 , and the Realme GT6 Pro will launch, all sporting 6,000 mAh cells, if this rumor turns out to be accurate. This move might increase each phone's weight, so, as they say, you win some (longevity), you lose some (ease of handling). The Find X8 should become official in October, just after the Snapdragon Summit where Qualcomm is unveiling the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC . Interestingly, some previous rumors have stated that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will require bigger batteries since it's going to be more power-hungry than its predecessor. Its CPU's performance cores are expected to reach 4.2 GHz. So perhaps you won't be gaining any longevity with these handsets after all, but merely not losing any compared to the previous generation.

        "content": "Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami directed government officials to keep the Chardham Yatra well organized and also said that offline registration should be kept closed till May 31.

The CM directed that proposals related to parking and basic necessities at the Chardham Yatra routes and important places of pilgrimage and tourism in the state should be sent to the Housing Department. A special plan should be made for every year during the peak period of Chardham Yatra. He said that before the start of Rishikesh-Karnprayag rail service, work should be done with a complete action plan to provide parking and other basic facilities on the railway routes and in Karnaprayag and its surrounding areas, as per the statement. The Chief Minister expressed satisfaction over the smooth running of the Chardham Yatra. He directed the officials of the government and administration to keep the Chardham Yatra well organized with the same dedication, it stated.

Despite repeated reminders from officials, the firms which got the permission to install the charging stations have not started the works. It is said that the firms are reluctant citing the small number of EVs in the district. In order to establish EV charging stations in Karimnagar town, the Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation Limited (TSREDCO) had invited applications from different firms for 10 locations. A few firms submitted Expressions of Interest, after which REDCO gave permission for four firms to install the charging stations in ten locations. While P Ramachary firm got the permission to install stations in five locations, Sri Ganesh Service got three. Both Joel Point Private Limited and Bhavani Engineering Agency got one each. Though the installation as well as operation of the charging stations should have been commenced within three months, the process of setting up the stations has not been started even five months after the agreements were signed, according to sources. One firm, which started work near the civil hospital, has also stopped the work. It requires about Rs.20 lakh for the installation of a charging station. So firm owners are of the opinion that they will not get benefits if they do not get adequate vehicles, REDCO officials said. The accurate figure of electric vehicles in the district is not available since RTA authorities are not registering all types of charging vehicles. RTA authorities are not registering electric bikes with top speeds under 60 kmph. Approximately, there are 20,000 two wheelers, 1,000 autorickshaws and 500 EV cars in the erstwhile Karimnagar district. Speaking to Telangana Today, REDCO district manager, V Paramachary informed that when the firms were contacted last week, they had assured to start works in May but that did not happen. Since the firms were not responding, they have decided to serve notices to the firms, he said.

        "description": "Promises to waive off farm loans have been issued by most political parties during this Lok Sabha election. Here’s a look at how these waivers are implemented, the effect on farmers and governments and what alternatives exist",
        "content": "As the Lok Sabha seats in India’s largest farming belt — Haryana and Uttar Pradesh — go to the polls, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi has once again promised to waive off farmer debts if the Congress-led coalition is voted to power. The last pan-India farm loan waiver was done by the UPA government in 2008 in the form of a ₹60,000 crore economic package. Incidentally, the waiver came a year ahead of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, in which the UPA was re-elected with a bigger majority. Addressing an election rally in Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri on May 22, Mr. Gandhi promised to waive farmers’ debt and guarantee them Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops. Claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi felt farm loan waivers would “spoil the farmers,” he vowed, “We are going to ‘spoil the farmers’ when we return to power and waive their debts not just once but again and again....We will form a commission and every time farmers need a debt waiver, the panel would let us know and we will do that.” Congress’ Paanch Nyay gurantees The Congress has released five sets of ‘guarantees ’ in which it promises farmers a Standing Loan Waiver Commission to systematically evaluate and recommend debt waivers, apart from the immediate loan waiver which Mr. Gandhi has promised. Farmers, who have been protesting in various States (especially at Delhi’s borders) since February, have been asking for an immediate farm loan waiver and legal guarantee for MSP for all crops procured by the Centre. As of 2022, outstanding agricultural debt stood at ₹18.5 lakh crores. How do farm loan waivers work? Scheduled banks offer loans to individual farmers or group of farmers for agricultural or allied activities such as dairy, fishery, animal husbandry, poultry, bee-keeping and sericulture. Short-term (up to 18 months) loans are offered for raising crops during two seasons – Kharif and Rabi, while medium (more than 18 months up to 5 years) and long-term (beyond 5 years) loans are offered for purchasing agricultural machinery, irrigation and other developmental activities. Loans are also available for pre-harvest and post-harvest activities such as weeding, harvesting, sorting, and transporting farm produce. Most loans have a repayment period in installments up to five years and interest rates vary depending on the nature of loans and the issuing banks. A good harvest bodes well for both the farmers and the banks as installments get paid on time. However, in case of a poor monsoon or natural calamities, farmers may be unable to repay loans on time. As seasons go by, the loans get compounded, adding to the distress of farmers, coupled with crop loss and other damages. In such situations, the Centre or State government steps in, offering a waiver of penal interest or loan interest, rescheduling loans or a full waiver of outstanding farm loans. The liability of repayment to the banks is transferred to the government. Loan waivers are usually selective, explains Businessline . It depends on loan types (small, medium or long-term), the categories of farmers or loan sources. The waivers are introduced via a new scheme by the government, making a budgetary allowance for absorbing the debts. Why do farmers need a waiver now? “Farmers are indebted hence they are asking for waivers. We have seen protests due to it and it is during elections when everyone makes their claims,” says Dr. Dipa Sinha, Assistant Professor, School of Liberal Studies at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University Delhi. Speaking to The Hindu about farmer distress at large, she adds, “Farm distress is due to many reasons and farmers have made other demands too, like the legal guarantee for MSP.” Image for representation| Photo Credit:AKHILESH KUMAR Farmers are plagued by larger issues like disputed land holdings, low ground-water reserves, bad soil quality, rising costs of farming inputs (seeds, fertilizers, water, fuel, electricity) and low crop productivity. Due to a lack of assured remuneration for harvest, farmers are forced to borrow funds to tide through expenses, Businessline explains. The lenders are not always banks, as several small farmers do not have access to credit, leading to a dependence on private lenders (land owners or rich farmers), who levy exorbitant interest rates on such loans. This is why these indebted farmers depend on such loan waivers. “Waiver is not the long-term solution to indebtedness. It is about the larger reforms in agriculture so that farmers don’t end up in the situation that they need a waiver. If you don’t do that (reform) and farmers end up in such a situation, then you are forced to bail them out also,” explains Dr. Sinha. Terming such waivers as inevitable, Dr. Sinha draws a parallel, “If you have a fever, you have to give paracetamol (medicine). You cannot avoid it. However, you should take necessary steps, so that you don’t get the fever again.” When were farm loans last waived? Despite repeated demands from farmers for a pan-India loan waiver, the Modi government has refused to budge, often passing the buck to State governments. According to a study by State Bank of India (SBI), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana implemented a loan waiver in 2014, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra in 2017, Karnataka, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in 2018 and lastly, Jharkhand and Maharashtra again in 2020. The total amount of debt waived off over these ten instances is ₹2.52 lakh crores. Apart from these, one of the largest loan waivers in Tamil Nadu was announced by the AIADMK government in February 2021. Announcing a ₹12,110 crore-scheme ahead of the State elections in April that year, CM E Palaniswami said outstanding short-term crop loans of all farmers will be waived off. In 2016, the AIADMK government had written off loans for around 12.02 lakh small and marginal farmers, owning land up to 5 acres, to the tune of about ₹5,320 crores. The first pan-India loan waiver was done in the 1990-91 Budget when the V.P. Singh-led National Front Government was in power. Introducing the Agricultural and Rural Debt Relief Scheme (ARDRS), then-Finance Minister Madhu Dandavate stated that the National Front government would provide relief to farmers up to ₹10,000 on select loans. As on October 2, 1989, the loans availed by farmers from cooperative banks and regional rural banks were eligible for relief under the ARDRS scheme, which was allotted ₹1000 crores. The scheme came to a close on March 31, 1991 and was not renewed.

Subramanium The second such instance of a pan-India loan waiver was announced by then-Finance Minister P Chidambaram during his 2008-09 Budget Speech. Under the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme (ADWDRS), 2008, short-term and investment loans disbursed to marginal, small and other farmers by scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks, cooperative credit institutions and local area banks up to March 31, 2007 and overdue as on December 31, 2007, and remaining unpaid until February 29, 2008 were eligible for relief or waiver. With an allocation of ₹60,000 crores, the entire ‘eligible amount’ was waived off for marginal and small farmers i.e. (< 2 hectares of land). In case of ‘other farmers’ (> 2 hectares of land), a one-time settlement (OTS) of 25% of the eligible amount was offered as a rebate, if the farmer pays the remaining 75% of the balance. The rebate would be 25% of the loan amount or ₹25,000, whichever was higher, subject to the balance payment condition. The OTS relief was estimated to cost Rs 10,000 to the Centre, while debt waiver was pegged at ₹52,000 crores. What are effects of such waivers? According to a NABARD repor t, the 1990 ARDR scheme cost the Central government ₹7825 crores. States were forced to take additional loans from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cover their share of the loan waivers and 3.2 crore farmers (53% of the borrowers) were beneficiaries of the scheme. This totalled to one-third of the outstanding farm loans, which were wiped off. Similarly, the 2008 ADWDR scheme cost the government ₹52,000 crores and over 2.9 crore farmers benefitted from the scheme. However, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report concluded that the scheme had favoured several ineligible farmers and a large number of deserving small and marginal farmers were left out during its implementation. The CAG report found that no records were maintained of farmers’ applications accepted or rejected by lending institutions, or how many fresh loans were issued due to debt waiver/relief. A NABARD study on the impact of farm loan waivers from 1987 to 2020, found that farm loan waivers were announced without any development agendas or ideologies (be it a right-wing or left-wing government), and no link between waivers and drought intensities. Till 2016, waivers were found to be announced by s=State governments who could fiscally afford it. After 2016, high fiscal debt did not deter such announcements, while the timings of such announcements were found to be crucial. Any such announcements closer to elections reaped greater gains for the party in power. Of the 21 State governments which announced waivers close to State polls, only four lost. Farm loan waivers between 2014 and 2022 A more recent SBI study (2022) found that only half of the beneficiaries of the nine farm loan waivers announced by State governments since 2014 have actually received write-offs. Maharashtra, which announced two waivers in 2017 and 2020, ensured that 68% and 91% of the beneficiaries received write-offs. The poorest implementation was by Telangana in 2014, where only 5% of 51 lakh farmers eligible for write-offs received it. States like Madhya Pradesh (12%), Jharkhand (13%), and Punjab (24%) see lower rates of implementation, while States like Chhattisgarh (100%) and Andhra Pradesh (92%) haveeffectively implemented such waivers. The study concludes, “Despite much hype and political patronage, farm loan waivers by States have failed to bring respite to intended subjects, sabotaging credit discipline in select geographies and making banks and financial institutions wary of further lending,” terming such waivers a ‘self-goal.’ What are other alternatives? “Agriculture is a sector where markets won’t work and it is hugely subsidised and supported by governments across the world. It is not just about direct subsidies to the farmers but also about creating the larger infrastructure to make agriculture more viable. This needs a number of steps to be taken, like irrigation, electricity, access to seeds, fertilisers, research in agriculture, and extension services,” says Dr. Sinha. Recommending more public investment in agriculture, she adds, “If you look at the investment in agriculture as a proportion of total expenditure or GDP, it has been falling per year. Whichever party comes to power needs to have a long-term policy for agriculture.” When asked if the now-repealed farm laws were a solution to India’s agrarian crisis, she replied in the negative. “Those farm laws were reducing the support of the government even more.” Amritsar: Workers scatter wheat for drying after heavy rains in the city, at a grain market in Amritsar, Friday, April 23, 2021.| Photo Credit:- One of the biggest farming States in the nation is Punjab, which is facing severe depletion of ground water reserves and degradation of soil due to overuse of urea. The State’s farmers have largely stuck to growing wheat and rice, even as farmers in neighbouring Haryana have switched to oilseeds. Speaking about this vicious cycle plaguing Punjab, Dr. Sinha says, “Farmers are businessmen like any other. It is not (due to an) affinity to wheat and rice that they are growing it. In Punjab these are the only two crops which are viable because the government procures it. If they incentivize mustard or pulses, farmers will make the shift. They made the (initial) shift to wheat and rice through policy – via the Green revolution.” While it has promised several schemes to boost farm income, the Modi government has not promised any farm loan waivers if elected for a third time. Meanwhile, farmers continue to protest being caught in debt traps.

        "content": "The High Court has granted Mombasa Governor Abdulswamad Nassir, Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung'aro, and Taita Taveta Governor Andrew Mwadime three days to respond to a case challenging their order to ban muguka. In a brief ruling, Justice Olga Sewe of the Mombasa High Court issued the directive to the three county chiefs after certifying as urgent the lawsuit by two activists seeking to stop the further implementation of the muguka ban in Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties. She found the case by two activists, Peter Agoro and Michael Makarina, challenging the ban on muguka to be urgent and needing to be heard expeditiously, and scheduled it for Friday, May 31, 2024. \"Upon considering the application dated May 27, 2024, together with its supporting affidavit and the documents annexed thereto, it is hereby ordered that the application is certified urgent and the application to be served forthwith,\" Justice Sewe ordered. The court directives come hours after the two activist petitioners moved to court challenging the recent executive order to ban the sale, supply, and consumption of muguka by Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta Counties. The petitioners contend that the three county chiefs' order to ban muguka is illegal and unconstitutional. \"We also seek an injunction order to be issued restraining the effect and/or implementation of the Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties Executive Order 1 of 2014,\" Agoro and Makarina seek. In their court papers, the two activists also fault the three county bosses for failure to conduct public participation before banning muguka. The petitioners cited the law protecting the sale and distribution of miraa as a cash crop in the country, saying muguka could not be isolated from miraa since they are both from the parent plant, khat. They argue that according to Kenyan laws, only Parliament through the National Assembly and Senate can declare a substance narcotic or psychotropic through legislation. \"National Agency for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NACADA) has not declared muguka a narcotic nor banned it. The Crop (Miraa) Regulations 2021 recognize both miraa and muguka as legitimate crops in Kenya,\" the duo states in their court papers. According to Agoro and Makarina, the mandate of banning a product or service protected through an act of parliament is the sole power of the national government. The two petitioners argue that the ban on muguka by the three counties is unconstitutional, illegal, and unlawful as it underscores the complex interplay between public health concerns and economic dependencies in Kenya. \"Despite Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties having legitimate constitutional mandates to guarantee the safety of their citizens, they ought to have taken the legal procedures before undertaking the ban,\" the petitioners state. The petitioners also seek several reliefs, including a declaration that the Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties' Executive Order 1 of 2024 is illegal, irregular, unconstitutional, null, and void.",

        "content": "Worshipping false idols is a sin when it comes to Power Rankings and the Cronulla bubble burst in spectacular fashion at Penrith in Round 12. The Panthers are now back on top of these ranks even if the Sharks still hold a slight edge on the actual premiership ladder. Take your time, Nathan Cleary. The three-time premiers have the rare luxury of being able to give the game’s best player another week or two once his hamstring has healed to be back in time for the final couple of months of the regular season before their shot at history – a fourpeat, is that a thing? The Connect Four? An Awesome Foursome? And there’s also a change at the bottom with South Sydney rising to the dizzying heights of 15th on the back of their victory over Parramatta. More League We now move into the trickiest part of the season – the seven-week stretch when State of Origin tears the competition asunder. Top teams can come back to the pack as the rep workload takes effect while the struggling side can make a run if they jag an upset or two but also consign themselves to a miserable existence in the second half of the season if they can’t get going over this stretch. Team by team, here’s how the Power Rankings stack up after Round 12. 1 Panthers (last week 2): If they can knock off the first-placed team by 42 with Nathan Cleary out and Liam Martin only playing half the match, imagine how they’ll go at full strength. Tigers fans should be happy with what they saw from Jarome Luai on Saturday night in the demolition of the Sharks with the five-eighth starring as the chief playmaker. 2 Sharks (1): There were some big danger signs from this loss, not just the 42-0 scoreline. Cronulla averaged a fraction over 30 metres for each set, nearly 12 less than Penrith, and could not come up with a circuit-breaker to reverse the possession imbalance, finishing with a paltry 39% of the ball. Nicho Hynes’ calf complaint was a contributing factor to their lacklustre display but their concerns are much deeper than a simple muscle strain to their star halfback. (Photo by Mark Nolan/Getty Images) 3 Roosters (5): Their attack is humming with Canberra’s line broken eight times on Saturday on both edges of the ruck. They’ve scored 30 points in five straight matches, including their one loss to Cronulla during that stretch in Magic Round. All their back five ran for at least 100 metres in dominating the Green Machine while they also had just as many forwards topping that benchmark. 4 Broncos (3): The warning signs have been there in the lead-up to Sunday’s shocker against the Gold Coast. Brisbane have been flat for the past month despite racking up wins over Parramatta and Manly after copping a hammering from the Roosters. With two byes in the next four rounds, the Origin toll will not be too dramatic for them in the short term. 5 Storm (4): They were unusually flat at Brookvale on Friday night and by the time they got into their groove, they were playing from behind. With Cameron Munster and Ryan Papenhuyzen sidelined, perhaps Nick Meaney might be a better option at five-eighth to take some of the playmaking burden off Jahrome Hughes as Tyran Wishart and Sua Fa’alogo are more of a running threat. 6 Dolphins (6): It is to be expected that a team that continually over-exceeds expectations will fail to hit the mark on occasions. These Dolphins aren’t swimming with the big fish yet and they are still without a few key players so Wayne Bennett won’t be panicking in any way shape or form after their slip-up on Sunday in Auckland. (Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images) 7 Sea Eagles (8): After three straight losses, Friday’s upset at home to knock over Melbourne was just what the doctor ordered, particularly after reports emerged about Anthony Seibold getting shirty with the club over contract extension negotiations. Great to see in this age of players holding picnics on the field after matches that some grudges still exist with Nathan Brown having a running battle with Shawn Blore after they went toe to toe four long years ago when they were both playing for different teams. 8 Raiders (7): They lack the class to beat the top-four sides but they have the grit to grind their way past anyone else. Young halves Ethan Strange and Kaeo Weekes were targeted in defence but held their own, especially compared to some more-experienced teammates with Elliott Whitehead coming up with nine misses, Hudson Young seven and Jordan Rapana six. 9 Warriors (10): If you didn’t know any better, you’d be forgiven for thinking Addin Fonua-Blake was trying to get an early release from his Warriors deal to join Cronulla like he did when he was at the Sea Eagles to join his current club. He failed to front for the team song and coach’s post-game address after a win over the premiers because he supposedly needed to “step back and reflect on his own” after not being happy with his performance. Riiiiiiiiight. Well done to the Warriors on dropping him for Sunday’s boilover win over the Dolphins when the easy option for the injury-hit team would be to fine him or brush it under the carpet. 10 Knights (9): Coming off the bye, they have Canterbury this Friday then Penrith and Melbourne before their next week off. If ever there’s a good time to come up against those teams, it’s during Origin season so seventh-placed Newcastle have a glimmer of hope to make a significant move up the ladder over the next month. 11 Bulldogs (11): They are a frustrating side in that they can play without much imagination for 40 minutes and then produce plenty of attacking potency as they did in the second half against the Dragons. With so many new faces it was always going to take time for Cameron Ciraldo to get cohesion in their combinations and if they stay injury free, they could be big improvers in the second half of the season. 12 Cowboys (13): Todd Payten’s team has now completed the most uninspiring back-to-back wins of recent memory after sneaking past Souths and conceding 28 points while scoring 42 in a glorified leaguetag tussle with the Tigers. They will be hard hit during Origin but are in no place to absorb a few extra losses after going 6-6 to start the season. 13 Titans (15): They get a well-earned uptick for not giving two hoots about reputations against the Broncos in Brisbane on Sunday even though they were given little chance of causing an upset by anyone outside their immediate family members. Des Hasler needs to keep putting faith in younger players that he thinks could be part of the future like Tom Weaver and Keano Kini, and start to snip off some of the ageing deadwood that is withering on this roster. 14 Dragons (12): Shane Flanagan was caught short with four forwards on the bench when Jack Bird hurt his ankle and was being disingenuous when he claimed that it was hard for coaches to have a utility back in their interchange list because it increases the burden on the pack. Even with Bird missing the second half and Hame Sele only lasting 14 minutes, Raymond Faitala-Mariner (20) and Fa’amanu Brown (21) received limited game time as Flanagan persisted with Tom Eisenhuth defending out wide while not getting a breather. (Photo by Jason McCawley/Getty Images) 16 Rabbitohs (17): With Latrell Mitchell back, Cody Walker likely to return soon and Cameron Murray not too far away, all is not lost for Souths. Keaon Koloamatangi bagged two tries in the 16-point win over Parra and the more that interim coach Ben Hornby can get him set up with space or running at weak links in opposition defensive lines, the better for the Bunnies. 16 Eels (14): The swift removal of Brad Arthur was no surprise given the team’s indifferent form but it’s going to be extremely tough for this team to make the finals even if Mitchell Moses and Clint Gutherson are back in the next week or two. It’s only the prospect of the Eels possibly reversing their form with a couple of their big guns returning that saves them from the bottom of the rankings. 17 Wests (16): That’s eight straight defeats for the Tigers and more upheaval off the field with Isaiah Papali’i sprinting out the door at season’s end to Penrith with Brent Naden and Jayden Sullivan also being pointed towards the exit. David Klemmer should be on the list of Tigers being nudged straight outta Concord – his latest three-game ban continues a trend of the veteran prop leaving his team in the lurch while giving little value for money when he’s on the field.",

        "content": "Countless people dream of the day when an expected series of fortunate events will lead to a moment of brilliant luck and happiness. Tierra Barley, a Henrico County resident in , experienced a series of extremely fortunate events that resulted in her five-figure . While many people will use significant numbers such as birthdays or anniversaries when playing the lottery, Tierra simply she told the Virginia Lottery. Her luck took an incredible turn on May 8, when five of those numbers matched the day's drawing, winning her an incredible $50,000. But just before the drawing, Tierra almost had a turn of bad luck as she almost lost her ticket. After buying her ticket at Varina Superstore Supermarket on Darbytown Road in Henrico, she accidentally left it in the store while she went to take her daughter to the park. When she returned in search of her ticket, Tierra found someone else buying Powerball tickets, and they turned out to be very helpful in returning her ticket. She chose to use the numbers she found inside a fortune cookie and matched four of the five numbers and the Powerball. The numbers were 7-41-43-44-51 with a Powerball number 5, confirmed Virginia lottery. Another lucky lottery winner decided to pick up a ticket along with his chicken at the grocery store on his way home from work - a move that would see him ultimately winning $500,000. Russell Gomes, of South Boston, had just finished work when he stopped at the Food Lion on Halifax Road to buy some chicken. He decided to try his luck and buy a Magnificent 7s lottery ticket, scratching it off in the parking lot to reveal the $500,000 top prize. Speaking to lottery officials Mr Gomes said: \"I really didn't believe it. It feels great!\" Powerball is an American lottery game offered in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and overseen by the Multi-State Lottery Association. The odds of winning a Powerball are 1 in 25 and the prize money can go up to $120 million. The famous lottery system was launched in 1987 after the localites voted to start a state-operated lottery game. Since its inception, the Virginia lottery has supported K-12 public education in a commonwealth, the website confirms. Moreover, in 2023, it amounted to more than $867 million that went to public education in the state. The funds are about 10% of the commonwealth's budget for K-12 schools distributed throughout Virginia's counties.",

        "description": "From the origin of the traditional jewellery style to the things to keep in mind while investing in a jadau piece, Rohan Narang, managing director, Hazoorilal Legacy, reveals it all",
        "content": "a hallmark of India's rich cultural heritage, is experiencing a resurgence in the contemporary fashion landscape. Known for its intricate Jadau involves embedding precious stones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds into softened gold, creating exquisite pieces that exude opulence and tradition. This resurgence can be traced back to Bollywood’s influence, particularly through films like where Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s regal adornments captivated audiences, reigniting interest in traditional . Bachchan's wedding further cemented Jadau’s status as a timeless bridal choice, inspiring many to embrace its grandeur. Renowned filmmaker has significantly contributed to this revival. His collaborations with Shri Paramani Jewels for movies like and now the web series have showcased the beauty of Jadau on an epic scale, with meticulously crafted pieces that highlight the intricate artistry involved. Actor Aditi Rao Hydari, playing the role of courtesan Bibbojaan, epitomises the still-existing opulence of the British Raj era. During the movie promotions, Rao Hydari was seen in a multi-coloured floral anarkali paired with meticulously crafted Jadau earrings by designer Neety Singh. The art of jadau is not just a relic of the past but a vibrant part of Influencers and brides alike are blending these traditional pieces with contemporary styles, creating a fusion that celebrates both heritage and innovation. As Jadau jewellery continues to grace red carpets and , its enduring elegance promises to captivate generations to come. The prized craft of holds a special place in our ethnic wardrobes. An uncut diamond piece is considered a prized possession in any Indian , and is often lovingly passed down through generations as an heirloom. New Delhi-based Hazoorilal Legacy, one of the oldest jewellery houses in the country today, is known for experimenting with traditional jadau designs to serve the modern connoisseur. spoke to Rohan Narang, managing director, Hazoorilal Legacy to get a microscopic view at all that goes into the making of this craft. Excerpts below. Jadau work was introduced in India by the Mughals, but practiced and perfected by the skilled craftsman of , which to date is considered as the hub of jadau jewellery. It is essentially a technique of jewellery-making wherein precious gemstones such as uncut diamonds, pearls, and rubies are embedded into gold. Gold is actually turned into a frame on which precious stones are studded without the use of any adhesive. Jadau derives its name from the colloquial term ‘jad’ (which means to embed), and is commonly used in , and meenakari jewellery. The design of the jewellery is made by [a group of artisans called the] Chiterias, followed by engraving and spacing using pliable gold, which is done by Ghaarias. Once the stones are naturally set in the gold casing, the enameller decorates the back of the jewellery in meenakari work. The time to produce jadau varies, depending upon the piece that is being . It’s a tedious process requiring utmost care and finesse. So while a smaller piece can be finished in a couple of days, an elaborate piece can actually take up to a few months to be ready. It’s one of the of and has an interesting history behind it. The Mughals introduced it to India, but this workmanship was perfected and made native by the artisans of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It requires a skilled and unique craftsmanship, which of course, makes it very compelling. The traditional form of jewellery is made without any interference of technology, which increases the man hours [it takes to create it], and makes it extremely valuable. It’s pure hand work. If you ask me, it is surely a reminder of the rich cultural heritage of our country. Before investing in a , one should always check the purity of the gold being used. The jadau workmanship is usually done in 22-24k gold. The casing in which the stones are embedded should not be less than 22k gold. Another important point is to check if the stones are treated or natural. One should also be aware of the various treatments that are used to enhance the look of uncut diamonds and other precious and semi-precious in jadau jewellery. It’s very delicate and needs to be handled with utmost care. The should be kept neatly wrapped in padded cloth box or an airtight container to minimise any kind of exposure to moisture and other pollutants. This helps to protect the look and feel of the jewellery. It should be the last thing you should wear when you’re getting ready, as perfumes and hairsprays can corrode the , and it should also be the very first thing you take off.",

        "content": "No matter how often an owner explains to their dog that they can't eat a certain item, it only makes a canine want something more. As the saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder. For one , his heart grows for cookies. Who can blame him? But, of course, dogs cannot have cookies since these desserts often include toxic ingredients to dogs such as chocolate, raisins, nutmeg or macadamia nuts. Cookies are also high in sugar, butter, and flour, and while not toxic, these ingredients are harmful to dogs and can lead to obesity. Despite how harmful can be, this dog still tries sneaking one past his owner in a May 16 . He thought he was being sly, showing his owner innocent eyes, and distracting her with . She wasn't born yesterday and he was caught red-pawed. The text on the video reads: \"Life with a Lab.\" This dog truly thought he could sneak one past his owner by staying calm under pressure as she started badgering him with questions and demanding he open his mouth. He kept moving his head to avoid his owner prying his mouth open, but it was not enough. The owner managed to maneuver his mouth and reveal he did indeed steal a cookie. Defeated, he finally gave in. He let her win this time. But the owner knows there will be plenty more battles to come as this isn't the first time he tried getting into items he shouldn't. The owner told via TikTok, that he tries to steal items often and that shoes are his personal favorite. The video quickly reached viral status, bringing over 6.6 million views, 508,200 likes, and 2,090 comments. \"He just wanted a little sweet treat,\" defended a viewer. Another pointed out: \"Distraction paw shake.\" somehow always think doing a trick will make owners forget what they've done. One TikTok user wrote: \"He said, 'Chocy lab get chocy cookie. Duh.'\" Others were cracking up that this dog showed so much restraint. \"I'm impressed it was still in his mouth. My lab gets a hold of food, it is gone IMMEDIATELY,\" said another.

        "content": "The Attorney general of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi has advocated for the scrapping of State Independent Electoral commissions. Fagbemi made the call on Monday at the National Discourse on Nigeria’s Security Challenges and good governance at the local government level held in Abuja. According to Fagbemi, inspite of the constitutional provisions that were meant to safeguard local governments’ autonomy, there have been cases of arbitrary dissolution, abolition or fragmentation of local governments by the higher tiers of government, particularly the state governments. The Minister contended that the provision of the constitution under section 162 (5-8) on State Joint Local Government Account, which empowered the state Assemblies to decide the revenue to their local government facilitated state encroachment on local revenues. “Cases of state hijacking of local government revenues abound from 1999 to date In consequence of these weak constitutional provisions, the lifespan of the local government councils is at the mercy of the state governments. “There is no consistent pattern of local government elections. Some State Governors dissolved their Councils and appoint Caretaker Committees. There are several cases of abuse of the Joint Account by different state governments across Nigeria. “This has undermined the financial autonomy of the local government, as well as their ability to deliver on their statutory responsibilities On the fourth point relating to observed problems/challenges in the way we are implementing the constitutional/legal provisions and what those problems are:Under a true federal structure, the autonomy of local government is adequately guaranteed.” Fagbemi further explained that one of the persisting challenges of Nigeria’s federalism is the persistent failure to grant autonomy to local government as the third tier of government. Read also: Keyamo declares Nigeria Air project fraudulent, says it remains suspended “Although, the LGAs as the third tier of government in Nigeria and as enshrined in the constitution is ostensibly meant to serve as are an institutional framework for effective service delivery to the grassroots and the overall national development; however, LGAs in Nigeria have been performing poorly in provision of essential services to the people due to absence of autonomy. “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria did not provide adequately for the political autonomy of the local governments. The resultant effects of these inadequacies are that the state governments have the discretion to determine the nature, content and direction of local government elections and political activities. “The failure of the constitution to articulate a clear line of authorities to both the state and local authorities and the continuing debate over the involvement of state governments in distributing local government allocation from the Federation Account has affected the capacity of LGAs to provide essential services at the grassroots.Rather than function as a tier of government, LGAs have been operating as an appendage of the State governments in Nigeria. “The constitutional provisions on State Joint Local Government Account (section 162 (5-8)) have placed the local government councils in a political bondage.Politically, due to the flaws in the electoral process in the country, what is obtained is a virtual selection and not election of local government functionaries. “Local government chairmen are always imposed on the people by the State Governors. This erodes the three elements of good governance at the local government level, which are citizens’ participation, transparency and accountability. The imposed chairman will be accountable only to the Governor rather than the people. This results in lack of transparency and non-involvement of the citizens. “High level and rampant corruption.The absence of administrative and fiscal autonomy to LGAs created a dependency situation than independent one conceptualized under a true federal system of Govt. The local governments in many instances have continued to suffer fiscal emasculation in the hands of state governments. In all these unwholesome abuses, Sections 7 and 162 of the 1999 Constitution among others have been an escape route for many State Governments to manipulate the Local government and reduce same to a mere department in the Governors’ office. “State joint local government account (SJLGA) has been the anti-development instrument used to frustrate every progressive and patriotic action to make the Local Government work since the return of the Country to democracy in 1999.And finally, what are the solutions/recommendations to the observed problems/challenges: LGAs are created by the Constitution. ”Accordingly, in a tiered system like ours, constitutional amendment is imperative before a new system of local government administration can be instituted.Good governance at any level of governance is not possible without the transfer of authority, responsibilities, capacity and resources. “This is even more so for the LGAs.Accordingly, constitutional reforms should, among other things, aim to: increase fiscal and administrative autonomy of Local Govt system to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency; fiscal autonomy should be balanced with fiscal restraint by strengthening the internal controls system, processes and infrastructure for public financial management;ensure inclusiveness and citizens participation in the governance of LGAs.allow the legislative arms of local governments to decide what they should do with revenue accruing to them;need to capacitate LGAs for effective governance. Capacity building involves equipping local government officials with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties effectively. control corruption and institute transparency and integrity in financial accountability of LGAs. ”Transparent and accountable governance fosters public trust, while efficient service delivery enhances legitimacy and stability.Investing more in local government administration with institutionalised internal and external oversightEnsure adherence to the rule of law by upholding the principles of justice, fairness, and accountability Conclusion: “The ability of LGAs to perform developmental functions, particularly in a federal system like Nigeria revolves around the nature of the relationship between the federal, state and local government any major reform of the Local Govt System will invariably require the alteration of the Constitution and other incidental legislations touching on Local Government administration.On the other hand, constitutional alteration can only be achieved through consensus building and commonality of purpose between the three tiers, as with the three arms of Government. “We are therefore challenged to play our respective roles, when called upon to do so. The best time to act is now.To achieve this, many experts have proposed that there is need for the scrapping of the state independent electoral commission. Their functions and powers should be transferred to the independent national electoral commission because the state independent electoral commission remain an appendage to every incumbent governor. “This is perceived as the root cause of the problem of local government administration in Nigeria. I commend the leadership of the House of Representatives for this bold initiative, which not only signifies an intent but also the desire to fully reposition our governance structures and systems, which will enable us to find lasting solutions to our enduring security and governance challenges. “I happily look forward to further engagements on this crucial issue with the leadership and members of the House of Representatives, as with the National Assembly at large.” Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 today in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favourite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100 percent sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after today’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100 percent sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “If it’s the last time, I enjoyed it.” 🫶🧡 pic.twitter.com/7DApnv0rxD It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It’s such a great honour. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” Related articles Big interview: The woman who could save NZ tennis Paul Lewis: Novak Djokovic reveals a new side at the French Open No 23!

Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. Covalent is taking the next big steps in the progress towards the completion of the New Dawn now sitting at 85% progress for the series of network upgrades and governance proposals. Learn more about the recent progress on migrating staking back to Ethereum in initial preparation towards shipping Long-Term Data Availability via the modularized Ethereum Wayback Machine. As the Covalent Network expands, it is quickly running out of delegation room for CQT token holders relative to the time horizon needed to onboard more operators—meaning the community could quickly become blocked from delegating their CQT to earn emissions yield if not addressed now. CQT holders who wish to earn a targeted ~12% yield on emissions and likely do not run any of the data infrastructure operator types, fall into the category of delegates who stake to earn this yield. Staked delegates, staked operators and CQT holders alike can all participate in governance. However, the delegation room and network security come from the Block Specimen Producer Operators, not any other operator types currently. Much of the security budget—8% of the total supply—is reserved for this operation specifically, the rest is for other operator types. The Covalent Foundation proposes to increase the max delegation room for CQT Holders, increasing the Block Specimen Producer Operator Staking Max Multiplier to 34X targeting roughly ~20% supply staked—this target could increase to ~40% in the future. More details below. Roughly a month since migrating to Ethereum, the Covalent Network surpassed its previous total staked and now sits at 13.79% (~137M CQT) with the Covalent Network’s current target being ~20% (~200M CQT) of the total supply staked for this phase of network development. However, the Covalent Network is already coming close to the maximum delegation room with only 2.12% of room left with the current operator count—which has already increased. That means that the scale of CQT holders wishing to delegate their stake to earn additional emissions yield outstrips that of the anticipated time required to onboard new operator companies to run data infrastructure. Currently, The Covalent Network has three levers to adjust token economic emissions through the staking contract and thus network economic policy during this initial 4-year bootstrapping period by changing the following. To increase the delegation room to align with the increased CQT delegate demand, relative to the pace of operators onboarding, the proposal is to increase the Max Multiplier of each Block Specimen Producer Operator increasing the total delegation room. The current targeted ~20% total supply staked (200M CQT)—as ratified in the last —is not proposed to be changed. The Covalent Network expects to onboard more Block Specimen Producer Operators to a possible total of 19. Given the range Operators can choose to stake—of between 175K and 350K CQT—the proposal makes the assumption of 250K CQT average staked after factoring in that the existing Operators have largely staked at the cap of 350K CQT and proposes to raise the Max Multiplier from 27X to 34X. This slightly undershoots the goal of 200M CQT allowing room for other Operator types to stake and assumes all delegation room is absorbed by the market of delegates staking their CQT. These assumptions, combined with this calculation, set the upper bound and lower bound of the total possible CQT staked within a comfortable but narrow area, allowing the market to reach an equilibrium at roughly 200M CQT staked. As always, the ~12% targeted emissions yield for delegators is a target and will free-float a little. All CQT token holders, except those still staking/delegating on Moonbeam can participate in governance and are encouraged to vote “Yes” or “No” for this proposal to be ratified or not. Both CQT stakers and holders are encouraged to vote.

        "content": "\"Little People, Big World\" alums Jeremy and Audrey Roloff are now the proud parents of four young children. Their newest arrival, a baby girl, was born \"early in the morning on May 23,\" Audrey announced in her Instagram story. \"It was my dream birth and we've been soaking in all the cuddles and adjusting to newborn life as a family of 6. I can't wait to tell you everything. But for now ... THESE ARE THE DAYS.\" Jeremy Roloff is the son of Matt and Amy Roloff, who anchored the TLC series that premiered in 2006. He married Audrey in 2014. Jeremy and Audrey Roloff first announced the pregnancy in that they posted in Nov. 2023. In the video, Audrey Roloff turns to her husband and whispers something in his ear. Jeremy Roloff then seemingly shares the secret by whispering in their 6-year-old daughter Ember’s ear, who then turns to her 3-year-old brother Bode and tells him what her dad told her. It then shows Bode telling 2-year-old Radley the news. Little Radley then throws his arms up in the air and repeats, “Big brother,” as the family rejoices in their happy news. \"We are so excited to be growing our family again and adding another little grommet to our crew!” the couple wrote on their joint video. The couple shared a gender reveal video in Jan. 2024. Standing in the drizzling rain, the parents saw pink smoke from their gender reveal cannons and immediately began to celebrate. Their three kids seemed hilariously nonplussed. \"I'm so pumped to do the girl thing again and for Ember to have the sister she prayed so hard for,\" Audrey wrote at the time. The proud mom has had three unmedicated births with her older children, and this was her first . What is the new baby's name? Only time will tell. Audrey has noted that she and her husband like to \"meet\" their babies before choosing what to call them. Rosie Colosi lives in New Jersey and is a reporter for TODAY Parents. She has bylines in The Atlantic, The Week, MSNBC, and PureWow, and she has written 33 nonfiction children's books for Scholastic, Klutz, and Nat Geo Kids.

        "content": "After charging $1 a ride for its first three years, the Buffalo Heritage Carousel announced Saturday it's going to a different pricing model as it begins its fourth season of operation. The waterfront attraction at Canalside will now be asking people to pay what they can, with $1 being the minimum. \"A priority of this institution has always been to make this ride very, very accessible,\" board member Mark DePalma said. \"Up until this point we have been charging $1 a ride, a flat fee for everyone. But we recognize it costs quite a bit more to operate this carousel, so we are shifting to a donation-based ticket model, where we are asking people to pay what they can, with a minimum of a dollar, and to pay it forward.\" Two people who played a key role in making the solar-powered carousel possible were also honored with a plaque on the carousel's wall. Joan Bozer worked for years to see her dream of a solar-powered carousel become a reality in 2021, and Walter Simpson was a champion of alternative energy as the University at Buffalo's energy officer. Both started the Western New York Sustainable Energy Association. \"We are going to mount this plaque so that everyone understands that these two individuals had a pivotal role in this amazing, environmentally-focused and forward-thinking carousel,\" board member Marika Woods-Frankenstein said.

        "content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Rafa Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. \"I'm not 100% sure if it's the last time but I enjoyed it, the crowd were amazing during the whole week of preparation and today,\" Nadal said as the crowd rose to their feet. \"The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it's special to feel the love in the place I love the most. \"I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. But it's something I don’t feel yet.\" Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. \"I don't know what to say... thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world, it's such a great honour,\" Zverev said. \"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him twice on this beautiful court.\" Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.

The regulator says two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. The bureau also says domestic fares appear relatively high and that more and more passengers are filing complaints. The regulator says its market study, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, will pave the way for recommendations to government that would improve competition and make it easier for consumers to make informed choices. The market study announced May 9 is the bureau’s first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies.

Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines, with the latter two making up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau.

        "content": "No opening-round match in French Open history has garnered so much interest as the contest between Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev on Monday. Like many enthusiasts, Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Iga Swiatek also made sure to witness Nadal play in his potentially final match at Roland Garros... even if it means that they have to sacrifice crucial rest of their own. Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz are two young players in the tennis world who grew up idolizing Rafael Nadal. After finishing off their first-round battles, both these prodigies made it to the stands to showcase their support to the King of Clay. It was also pleasantly surprising to witness Novak Djokovic present in the arena. Of course, the Serb shares a mutual respect for his long-time rival. But considering that Djokovic has his first-round clash on Tuesday, it is heartwarming to see him dedicate his resting time to support Nadal. While the stadium erupted “Vamos Rafa” chants, Zverev became a party spoiler and handed Rafa his first-ever opening-round loss at Roland Garros. Alexander Zverev Snapped an Insane Rafael Nadal Streak Apart from eliminating Rafael Nadal from what could mostly be his final French Open tournament, Alexander Zverev also snapped the Spaniard’s insane streak of winning his past 80 matches in the Grand Slam against all players except Novak Djokovic. Alexander Zverev won 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to avenge his 2022 French Open semi-final loss to Rafael Nadal, which also makes the victory more significant.",

Cool for 1 hour and refrigerate. 5. Meanwhile, place the strawberries in a bowl and sprinkle with sugar; gently toss and leave at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. Toss again; cover and refrigerate. 6. Serve chilled custard topped with strawberries, and if desired, sprigs of fresh mint.

        "description": "California has no minor age requirement for child marriage as long as a parent or guardian and a judge consents.",
        "content": "Actress and political activist Alyssa Milano has singled out a California Democrat for the amendments he proposed to an assembly bill in April that blocked it from appearing before the assembly's Judiciary Committee. Child marriage has long been a taboo subject in the U.S., but under certain circumstances—such as approval from a judge or a parent or guardian—it is permitted in several states, including California. Child marriage occurs when one or both parties is under the age of 18, but in most cases, it occurs between an underage girl and an adult man. California has no minor age requirement for child marriage as long as a parent or guardian and a judge consents. In February, the California state assembly proposed a bill that would prohibit marriage for children under 18. However, —and Fraidy Reiss—a forced marriage survivor who founded Unchained At Last, a nonprofit organization fighting against child marriage—have written an opinion piece for the accusing Assemblymember Ash Kalra of proposing amendments that prevented the bill from achieving a hearing at the Judiciary Committee. reached out to Kalra by email for comment. Milano and Reiss said that more than 8,000 minors are married in California each year, most of them young girls. \"Child marriage gives a 'get out of jail free' card to would-be child rapists, because statutory rape within marriage is not a crime. Child marriage is a harmful practice that devastates sexual and reproductive rights,\" the women argued. Milano and Reiss alleged that Kalra was swayed by arguments from liberal organizations including Planned Parenthood, the Children's Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union against prohibiting child marriage. Last year, California for children under 18, but the aforementioned organizations spoke out against the legislative proposal. They said that imposing an age requirement on marriage could impede a minor's ability to seek an abortion, among other concerns, reported. \"Their arguments are perplexing. They claim banning child marriage would drive minors in abusive relationships 'underground,' out of reach of social services,\" Milano and Reiss wrote in the opinion piece. \"Does anyone believe a minor in an abusive dating relationship benefits from marrying their abuser? Or that a minor with abusive parents can access social services only if their parents enter them into marriage?\" According to the , any form of child marriage is considered a \"human rights violation and a harmful practice that disproportionately affects women and girls globally, preventing them from living their lives free from all forms of violence.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "Ahead of 29th May, Governor Dauda Lawal of Zamfara State has commissioned a modern Quranic School in the company of the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III in the Gummi local government area. Speaking during the commissioning ceremony, Governor Dauda, said the establishment of the school is part of the campaign promises aimed at promoting combined Islamic Religious Knowledge and Western education. Other projects visited by Governor Lawal were the newly constructed hospital in Nasarawa Burkullu under the Bukkuyum local government area and the other renovated hospital in the Maru local government area of the state. The Governor while delivering his speech at Gummi, emphasized the need to educate the growing children in the modern Quranic Schools in the state with a view to prepare them with peace-loving and brother-keeper attitudes. He further cried that the alarming rate of insecurity bedevilled the state and the entire nation was the handiwork of evil who always accommodates illiteracy as his sole tool to derail society into crimes and cruelties. “Zamfara has been one of the states that slipped into the target of banditry and other heinous crimes therefore, desperately needs to be educated to avoid producing crime-living generations instead”, Governor Lawal has stressed. In his remarks shortly after cutting the tape, the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar III, positioned that, the commissioned school is unique as it would not graduate students who will later become street beggars. “This type of Quranic school would teach, train and discipline its students to become lucrative products in the society as it doubles as a ground to inculcate patriotism and both ethnic and religious tolerance”, the Sultan has added.",

        "content": "VIENNA - Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to get economic sanctions imposed over it's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing it down. This is all under the guidance of Iran's supreme leader and likely won't change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. Read more of the latest international headlines The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war . Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other's territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% -- an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the UN watchdog in February. Uranium enriched at 60 per cent purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA's definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible -- if the material is enriched further, to 90 per cent. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \"several\" nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the UN agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran's centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges -- machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran \"to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.\" According to the report, Grossi \"deeply regrets\" Iran's decision to bar inspectors -- and a reversal of that decision \"remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.\" The deaths of Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,\" the report said. Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA's request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency \"will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran's declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 -- although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April \"successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.\"",

        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks have an opportunity to reach the NBA Finals for just the third time in franchise history when they seek to close out a sweep of the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals Tuesday night. The Mavericks scored 14 of the final 17 points for a 116-107 home win in Game 3 on Sunday night that left them five wins away from their second-ever NBA title, having captured the crown in their last visit to basketball's grand stage in 2011. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points each Sunday, but the Mavericks also got key contributions from P.J. Washington, Daniel Gafford and Derrick Jones Jr. in a win that gave them a 3-0 series lead. Gafford, acquired in February from the Washington Wizards, had to put in yeoman's work after big-man sidekick Dereck Lively II departed with a sprained neck in the third quarter. Gafford wound up playing a playoff career-high 29 minutes and saved his best for last, blocking a Mike Conley layup attempt with 56 seconds left before slamming down a Doncic alley-oop pass 22 seconds later to clinch the win. Lively went straight to the locker room after catching Karl-Anthony Towns' knee to the back of his head while falling in pursuit of a rebound. He reportedly passed a concussion test, but his status for Game 4 remains uncertain. With or without Lively, Gafford acknowledged after Sunday's win that the Mavericks' success inside is tied to the unselfish play of Doncic and Irving. \"We're trying to find the seams and just what can put us in position to where we can help the team,\" Gafford said. \"Everybody just put trust in us to just finish around the basket. And that's what we did.\" The last time the Mavericks had a 3-0 lead in a playoff series was in 2011 when they finished off the sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the West semifinals en route to the title. When informed after the Game 3 win that no team in NBA history has ever blown a 3-0 lead in a playoff series, Irving wanted none of it. \"It means absolutely nothing right now,\" Irving said of a 154 times a team won the first three games of a playoff series. \"Going into Game 4, it's still 0-0. And that's the type of mentality we have in that locker room.\" After being held to 33.3-percent shooting in two home losses, Anthony Edwards broke through for Minnesota with an 11-for-24, 26-point outing in Game 3. But All-Star teammate Towns continued to struggle, missing all eight of his 3-point attempts on a night when he totaled 14 points on 5-for-18 shooting. Towns has now gone 15-for-54 overall and 3-for-22 from deep in the series, yet seemed unperturbed when asked about it following the Game 3 defeat. \"I put up 1,500 shots a day. Shot so well all playoffs,\" Towns said. \"Confidence extremely high, and to be having these unfortunate bounces, these looks are just not going in. It's tough. \"I don't mean to smile, but you have to laugh. It's very disappointing.\" The Timberwolves have trailed 3-0 in a best-of-seven series just one time previously in their history and responded well, forcing the eventual champion Denver Nuggets to a fifth game last year in the first round by winning 114-108 at home in Game 4.

        "description": "Defending champions face a raft of challengers in the unpredictable 200-mile gravel race with a stacked field",
        "content": "Once a year, the gravel community turns all eyes with a laser-like focus to Emporia, Kansas. Winning Unbound Gravel is a coveted prize, whether the signature 200-mile event or one of the other four distances. The race started out in 2006 with under 40 riders, all men, and now captures the imagination around the globe with some of the best men's and women's riders from across disciplines, drawn to the Flint Hills of the central US plains to capture gravel's biggest prize. Keegan Swenson (Santa Cruz Bicycles-SRAM) claimed one of the few big gravel results missing from his palmares when he won the elite men's race last year. Carolin Schiff (Canyon CLLCTV) delivered a debut performance in 2023 that shone through the mud and rain-soaked edition, leaving no doubt that she had found her cycling home when she fully committed to gravel at the start of the season. Both are lining up to defend their titles on June 1, but it has been many years since an elite rider has doubled up in the 200-mile race. What's more, the competition is intensifying, with the trickle of international riders turning into a flood, so that now half the elite men's field is from outside the United States and a third of the elite women's field. The draw to riders in other disciplines, too, is becoming ever more obvious with Matej Mohorič, who claimed the UCI Gravel World Championships on his debut, bringing the rainbow stripes to Kansas along with two of his Bahrain Victorious teammates. Unbound Gravel 200 is also the second stop of the Life Time Grand Prix, so the majority of the 60-rider field in that season-long competition will be in Emporia, including 2023 women's champion Sofia Gomez Villafañe (Specialized Off-Road), who was second to Schiff last year. The race is anything but predictable, with the serious potential for mechanicals and mishaps to strike out a number of the strongest and best-prepared riders. Cyclingnews has run the ruler over the start list and picked out the names of a number who seem to have what it takes to be at the front of the fields for the 200-mile and 100-mile races. Women's Elite Unbound 200 Carolin Schiff on the road at Unbound 200 in 2023 (Image credit: SnowyMountain Photography) Carolin Schiff Unbound record - 2023 winner When Carolin Schiff (Canyon CLLCTV) lined up for Unbound in 2023, she wasn’t exactly an unknown. She did get a mention in our contenders' preview after all, but the German also wasn’t exactly the first name that rolled off the tongue when talking race favourites. It was, after all, her debut at Unbound, but her impressive performances in Europe at the UCI Gravel World Series and with a Traka 200 win plus, in the US, a victory at the 2023 Gravel Locos were a warning shot to her rivals. There will, however, be no question marks over her status this year, with Schiff not only the defending champion at Unbound but also coming into the race once again with the Traka 200 win behind her. This time Schiff has the experience and the confidence to know just what she can achieve at the race on her side, however, there are elements of her preparation that haven’t been ideal. Schiff crashed at the 3RIDES Gravel World Series race in Aachen earlier in May, and the result was, as she put it in an Instagram post, “ a big, deep and dirty cut that had to be fixed in the hospital”. Still, she was quickly back on the bike, so there is no reason to discount the rider who crossed the line first last year. Sofia Gomez Villafañe Unbound record - 2023 second, 2022 winner So what race hasn’t Sofia Gomez Villafañe (Specialized Off-road) won in the past two seasons where she was the favourite? It is a very short list, and the first one that jumps off the page is second place at Unbound 200 last year. She won three of the Life Time Grand Prix races wrapped around Unbound last year to secure the series title, plus added victories at BWR Arizona and SBT GRVL Black Course. She started the 2024 Grand Prix by winning Sea Otter Classic Fuego XL a second time with the flat bars. The Argentine-born rider returned to Cape Epic in the spring with new partner Samara Sheppard in the team-focused stage race for a block of racing leading to Unbound 200, looking at a formula that worked well in 2022 when she won both races. While the duo did not crack the top 10 in South Africa, Villafañe was in top form and went straight back to winning with the drop bars, as she defended her title at BWR Arizona and then won the inaugural Valley of Tears. “Unbound is a race where you can not go into it with a solid race plan as the dynamics of the race are unpredictable, and the weather can have a major impact on how things unfold,” the 30-year-old told Cyclingnews . But what is predictable is that the 2022 Unbound Champion can win it all again. Geerike Schruers Unbound record - 2024 debut The one-time road racer turned soigneur, and then gravel racer has quickly made a considerable mark on the sport. Geerike Schreurs dipped the toe into the discipline last year but then launched with full force in 2024 as she signed up to represent SD Worx-Protime on the gravel. The rider, who has largely raced gravel in Europe so far, made the trip over to the US earlier this year for the Belgian Waffle Ride Arizona, coming fourth but has been working her way up the podium as the season has progressed. In the UCI Gravel World Series Wörthersee in April, it was second, then came The Traka, when Schreurs tested out her ability to perform in a race even longer than Unbound, choosing the 360km option. That was when the Dutch rider made her claim as a contender clear, coming second behind Karolina Migon and in front of Sarah Sturm. Then, to confirm her form, she took first at The Gralloch round of the UCI Gravel World Series in mid-May. They were results that make Schreurs hard to ignore, as does the jersey of the powerful road team who knows all too well how to time form peaks to perfections. Plus, there is no longer any room to rule out the possibility of a European debut rider winning, not after Schiff's performance in 2023. Sarah Sturm Unbound record - 2023 third, 2022 seventh Sarah Sturm (Specialized) returns for her third Unbound 200, where she finished in the top 10 both times, including third last year. The Colorado resident comes in with high marks from recent races, including third at The Traka 360, third at The Growler and top 10s at Sea Otter Classic Fuego XL and The Mid South. Part of her homework to prepare for the second stop in her Life Time Grand Prix requirements was to travel to Kansas a week early and recon the north course. “I think I have medal potential; I’d like to throw my name into that hat,” she said. Lauren De Crescenzo Unbound record - 2023 DNF, 2022 second, 2021 winner Lauren De Crescenzo has moved into the privateer realm of off-road racing for 2024, but the lack of an organised team environment has not slowed her down in any way as a solo LDC. The 2021 Unbound Gravel 200 champion returns for another victory on the north course. She’s on form with a third consecutive victory at The Mid South in March and a win at the newly-created spring classics-style The Growler road race. A former road pro, De Crescenzo put the gravel bike aside for the US Pro Road National Championships, where she finished fifth in the elite women’s road race. She’s back for another season in the Life Time Grand Prix, where 2023 found her with a victory at The Rad Dirt Fest and podiums at Crusher in the Tushar and Big Sugar Gravel. Unbound Gravel 200 is her big target. Also in the mix It was straight from a win in the UCI Gravel World Series at La Indomable to victory at The Traka 360 for Karolina Migon (PAS Normal) , showing she's got both the gravel form and staying power over a long distance that is essential for Unbound. It's a strong Australian contingent in the women's race this year , with Tiffany Cromwell (Canyon-SRAM) swapping over from the 100, where she has a winning record and Australian champion Justine Barrow drew the attention with a win at the SEVEN UCI World Series race followed by victory at Gravel Locos, even though a challenging recovery from a shoulder injury may have left her with a less than ideal preparation. Then there is also Matilda Raynolds (Team Bridgelane), who has claimed victory at the longest gravel race in the nation the Dirty Warrny. There are a couple of other former Unbound 200 winners on the start line as well, in 2019 victor Amity Rockwell (PAS Racing) and last year's 360 winner Kristen Legan . Men's Elite Unbound 200 Keegan Swenson wins 2023 Unbound Gravel 200 (Image credit: SnowyMountain Photography) Keegan Swenson Unbound record - 2023 winner, 2022 second In 2023, Keegan Swenson (Santa Cruz Bicycles) won the first four races in the Life Time Grand Prix series, including Unbound Gravel 200. He’s the king of US gravel and even has the stars-and-stripes jersey to prove it. The 30-year-old from Utah is proud of a mass collection of trophies, which include back-to-back wins at SBT GRVL on the black course and a new course record last year in his third consecutive win at Leadville Trail 100 MTB. Unbound Gravel 200 is a beast, and Swenson has spent a full training block training for a third title. With rain in the forecast to turn dirt roads into mud again, he has been focused on ‘pounding the pedals’ and ‘panic packing all of my Maxxis tires’. Challenger and reigning gravel world champion Matej Mohorič asked Swenson on social media if they should use slick tyres “for the extra challenge”. Even that might not slow down Swenson. Petr Vakoč Unbound record - 2023 second It was a sprint to the line last year in Unbound 2023, and Petr Vakoč was bested by Keegan Swenson, but coming so close in the event \"really made me believe that racing gravel is the right path for me,\" said the Czech rider in his end of season wrap up. The former road professional had made a relatively late decision to join the fray last year as an independent racer, but now the Isadore Canyon rider is entering with a team behind him and the knowledge of just what he can do in the discipline and at the event. He added a couple of UCI Gravel World Series round wins to his tally in 2023 and has already started his victory list for 2024, claiming the opening prologue and overall at the Sata Vall stage race in Spain and The Traka 200 at the start of the month, topping Jasper Ockeloen. With another season of experience and the knowledge that comes with a subsequent appearance at the race, there is no telling what Vakoč could do the second time around. Matej Mohorič Unbound record - 2024 debut The road professional hasn't been a regular on the gravel scene, but on his very first race in the discipline, he claimed the UCI World Championship, winning the 2023 race solo even after a late crash. As a result, the Slovenian will be lining up in the rainbow jersey, one that hasn't exactly been out and about in racing, given the Bahrain-Victorious rider's heavy commitments with his WorldTour team. The rider will face a considerably different challenge when he lines up in Emporia than the one that unfolded in Veneto, Italy. For a start, the distance is far longer than the 163km World Championships and with far more gravel and possibly mud than the course where he claimed the rainbow bands, which was only about half unpaved. Still, he'll be doing just his second gravel race with two of his road teammates by his side Matevž Govekar and Lukas Wiśniowski. \"It's double the distance, double the time, and double the elevation gain, so it suits riders with more endurance and stamina. I'm not sure how I will go against the others, but I will definitely do my best, and enjoy my day out in the rainbow jersey as the current World Champion,\" said Mohorič. Peter Stetina Unbound record - 2023 seventh, 2022 eighth, 2021 third, 2019 second Peter Stetina (Canyon) is one of the stalwarts at Unbound Gravel 200, and gravel racing in general, having switched from Grand Tours to gravel adventures in 2019. It’s his fifth appearance in the signature event, finishing every time in the top 10 with podium spots in 2019 and 2021. It is interesting that the two years he finished second and third were on the northern route, where Unbound heads on June 1 for only a third time in its 18-year history. \"I've had a great spring, which takes the pressure off a bit heading into the race, but in gravel, things can change in an instant, especially on the northern course at Unbound,” Stetina said at a recent Unbound Gravel press conference. The 36-year-old has indeed been great this year, with the overall title at BWR Triple Crown, including the win at BWR Utah, the overall title at the Grasshopper Adventure Series, with the win at Ukia-Mendo Gravel Epic, and the top prize in early May at The Traka 360. An early indication that Stetina should be back on the podium in Kansas is his familiarity with the north route and his form on a very muddy Traka course. Forecasts call for two days of rain prior to the start this Saturday, so Stetina may have an advantage on a route littered with saturated soil and slippery flint rocks. Matt Beers Unbound record – 2023 11th The South African is heading toward his second Unbound, once again with a Cape Epic title to show for his early season efforts. The difference is that he also \"cracked the code\" of US gravel racing to take victory at the Belgian Waffle Ride California and has a year of experience racing the Life Time series in the US under his belt. As it did for many, Unbound last year threw up a number of challenges for Beers on his debut, and he ended up in 11th. A year on, however, Beers is entering the race with the benefit of knowing what he is in for and the incentive to build on his solid start to the Life Time Grand Prix series after taking third at the Fuego XL. The Specialized Off-road racer had a rough run in the series last year, plunging out of the top ten when he crashed at Big Sugar, and suffered a shoulder separation and broken ribs. However, with an intensified focus on the block of racing and longer stints planned in the US, a solid result at Unbound is just what Beers needs to consolidate his position as a contender for those sports right near the top of the results table. Also in the mix A large contingency of Dutch contenders will line up in Empoira, led by Laurens ten Dam , Jasper Ockeloen and Niki Terpstra . All three raced the 150-mile Gravel Locos in Texas and came away with top 10s, with Terpstra second overall. Ten Dam tested his ulta-endurance this spring and won the non-stop Transcordilleras gravel race across Colombia. Ockeloen has a string of top results including second overall at BWR California and The Traka 200. Brendan Johnston is on a roll, having just won the Australian MTB Marathon nation title and victory at the SEVEN Gravel World Series race in Nannup. The results have been building in the US for the Giant Off-Road rider and he generally copes well with longer distances. Lachlan Morton , who was an impressive third in last year’s seven-rider sprint at Unbound 200. This year he finished eighth at BWR California and competed at his third Cape Epic. Among the long list of US contenders is gravel newcomer Chad Haga , a recent convert from the WorldTour peloton. He finished third at The Traka 360 and fourth overall at Santa Vall gravel stage race in Spain. It is his debut at Unbound Gravel 200. Doubtful to start is 2022 Unbound 200 men’s winner Ivar Slik , the Dutch rider hospitalised last week with a severe concussion suffered on a training ride in Arkansas. Also missing from the list of contenders is USA’s Alexey Vermeulen , who was fifth in 2022, as he takes a break from racing to attend his brother’s wedding. Unbound 100 Alison Tetrick on the Kansas gravel (Image credit: Wil Matthews) Unbound Gravel 200 isn’t the only game in town, with the focus of that signature event on the 209 elite racers from the 1480 on the start line. There are a total of 5,000 participants at Unbound Gravel in 2024, a new record, across five total distances, and the Unbound Gravel 100 has the single largest field with a total of 1829 starters. Headliners among the elite racers in the 100-mile race include Alison Tetrick, Caroline Mani, Kaya Musgrave and Flavia Oliveira Parks on the women’s side. On the men’s side, look for battles among retired pro road veterans Travis McCabe and Tom Danielson. US cyclocross champion Jake Wells is in the field, and is a wild card as he has experience from 2022 in the 200-mile race. Tetrick is a former road pro turned gravel gladiator, and she marked her foray into off-road racing in 2017 and won the 200-mile race in Kansas. She finished third the next year and second in 2019. She rode the 200 distance three more times, but each year outside the top 10. This marks her first time to ride the 100-mile event. The six-time Unbound 200 finisher will be tough to beat on the women’s side, but Oliveira Parks could do just that. Across high-elevation gravel events, she finished on the podium at SBT GRVL twice (2021 and 2023). This season she won the 75-mile Ukiah-Mendo Gravel Epic and was third at 68-mile Highlands Gravel. Like Tetrick, she had a road career and turned to gravel four years ago. She returned to her road bike at The Growler and finished fourth on a hilly and bumpy course almost suited for a gravel bike. Two cyclocross riders to watch are French rider Caroline Mani and US rider Kaya Musgrave. They represent two ends of the spectrum, Mani having raced on the road and off-road for 16 years and Musgrave, at 17 years of age, demonstrating a big engine across technical terrain. Mani has a proven record at Unbound 200, where she finished 21st among elite women so the 100-mile test should be a good one. McCabe is in the veteran category like Mani, the 35-year-old having a stellar career on the road until he retired from the WorldTour in 2020. He gave it a try at Unbound 200 last year, but withdrew after 124 miles and ended in the “what the hell did I just get myself into” category. He was 24th at BWR California this spring, so the 100-mile distance is in his wheelhouse. Danielson is new to gravel, having top 20 results this year at Belgian Waffle Ride Utah and The Mid South. He had stepped out of the limelight of racing in 2015 when he tested positive for synthetic testosterone, which was a second strike following a six-month ban in 2012. and had been coaching Lauren De Crescenzo for a few years, but she is now solo.",

Libertarian Milei is set to travel to San Francisco late on Monday and stay through Friday, during which time he is set to meet Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Timothy Cook and Open AI CEO Sam Altman. He will also speak at the Bay Area Council's Pacific Summit and Stanford University's Hoover Institution, a think tank which promotes limited government, and meet with the university's chancellor and the think tank's director, Condoleezza Rice. Rice served as U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Advisor in the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush. Milei is also scheduled to meet with economists from the think tank as well as investors and entrepreneurs linked to artificial intelligence (AI). The president is set to fly back on Friday evening, after a stopover in El Salvador where he will attend the inauguration of the second term of President Nayib Bukele, who won a landslide re-election in February. Milei met Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk in Texas in April, when they discussed a variety of topics, from the need to boost declining birthrates worldwide to pursuing technological development and defending \"liberty.\"",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Argentina's President Javier Milei is set to meet with top-level executives from Google, Meta and Apple during a trip to the United States this week, his spokesman Manuel Adorni said on Monday. Libertarian Milei is set to travel to San Francisco late on Monday and stay through Friday, during which time he is set to meet Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Timothy Cook and Open AI CEO Sam Altman. He will also speak at the Bay Area Council's Pacific Summit and Stanford University's Hoover Institution, a think tank which promotes limited government, and meet with the university's chancellor and the think tank's director, Condoleezza Rice. Rice served as U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Advisor in the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush. Milei is also scheduled to meet with economists from the think tank as well as investors and entrepreneurs linked to artificial intelligence (AI). The president is set to fly back on Friday evening, after a stopover in El Salvador where he will attend the inauguration of the second term of President Nayib Bukele, who won a landslide re-election in February. Milei met Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Texas in April, when they discussed a variety of topics, from the need to boost declining birthrates worldwide to pursuing technological development and defending \"liberty.\" (Reporting by Peter Frontini; Writing by Sarah Morland; Editing by Gabriel Araujo and Brendan O'Boyle)",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese three short-squeeze stocks with high short interest could be prime candidates for a massive breakout.The post 3 Stocks That Could Skyrocket in a Massive Gamma Short Squeeze appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Short-squeeze stocks have seen an explosion in interest after the recent Roaring Kitty saga that sent many meme stocks soaring to dizzying heights. Now, before we dive in, I would like to mention that meme stocks are something that are generally best avoided, like the plague. Yes, certain meme stocks did surge, but the chance of actually timing any sort of investment correctly is slim to none. Not only that, but most of the mania is short-lived. Thus, you would have to sell at the precise right time to make the most of any rally. And that’s a near-impossible feat for retail investors. In fact, retail investors lost billions in just the past week alone as meme stocks came crashing back down to earth. However, that doesn’t mean you should avoid short-squeeze plays altogether. In my opinion, you can make some sensible bets that aren’t excessively high-risk and provide some asymmetric upside. These stocks are still risky, but at least they aren’t perpetually decline. Furthermore, it’s possible their underlying businesses can likely survive even if a short squeeze doesn’t materialize. Here are three such short-squeeze stocks to consider right now. Upstart (UPST) Upstart’s (NASDAQ: UPST ) recent Q1 results show the company is navigating current economic challenges with foresight and flexibility. While revenue of $127.8 million was $2.71 million above estimates (and rose 24.2% year-over-year) , the company’s earnings per share also beat estimates by 20%. Still, consumers are simply borrowing less, and it’s having a big impact on Upstart. Banks are a lot more cautious when partnering up with Upstart, as they’d rather play it safe than experiment with AI technology. That said, I see a bright future ahead once interest rate cuts begin, and lending volume increases. I’m encouraged by the steps management is proactively taking to cut costs responsibly, including reducing annual personnel expenses by $20 million and computing costs by 23%. The launch of personal loans secured by automobiles in seven states should help more qualified borrowers access loans at lower rates. With ASPL rates 20% lower on average than alternatives, this product seems well-positioned to meet the affordability needs of consumers. Plus, funding is improving on Upstart’s platform for banks, credit unions, and other financial backers. However, with consumer credit risk and interest rates remaining high for now, loan volumes will likely stay restrained in the short term. Upstart is wisely scaling back non-research uses of its own funds for new loans during this period of uncertainty. I think it is only a matter of time before UPST stock heads higher once interest rate cuts start. Some big quarterly beats should cause a short squeeze, considering the stock’s current short interest sits at 32.2% . This is definitely one of the top short-squeeze stocks to buy, in my books. iRobot (IRBT) iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT ) has been one of the worst-performing stocks in the market this year, and over a longer-term time horizon. The Roomba company is down 94% from its peak, but I see promising trends emerging. T he company’s Q1 results exceeded what analysts had predicted. Total revenue of $150 million surpassed estimates by over $5 million, though sales were still 6.4% lower than the previous year. The company’s aggressive restructuring efforts seem to be paying off, with operating losses shrinking to $40 million. Notably, iRobot also beat earnings per share estimates by nearly 24%. If this number continues to improve faster than analysts think, the upside potential with IRBT stock could be huge. Those who have bet against the stock might be in trouble. The company is getting $94 million in termination fees from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). This alone is nearly a third of IRBT’s entire market cap. Furthermore, the short interest in this name is above 30%, so any positive news could trigger a rush by short sellers to cover their bets. The appointment of turnaround expert Gary Cohen as the new CEO may provide that catalyst. Regardless, iRobot still faces strong headwinds. Gross profit margins of 24.6% remain squeezed due to intense competition and weaker consumer spending on home appliances. While management is wisely focusing on cost-cutting, making operations more efficient, and participating in the more affordable product segment, a true recovery will depend on growth resuming on the top line. When that will happen remains uncertain, hence the high short interest. Guess? (GES) Guess? (NYSE: GES ) is among the most aggressively-shorted stocks in the market right now. The company sports a short interest ratio of 32.4%, which is quite surprising since this company just had an incredible quarter. Additionally, I believe the company’s stock could climb much higher. Revenues grew 9% year-over-year to $891 million , surpassing estimates by more than $36 million. Even more impressively, adjusted earnings per share of $2.01 far exceeded expectations by 44 cents. Management highlighted that all five of their business divisions increased revenues, with Americas Wholesale, Asia, Licensing, and Europe leading the way. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, Guess? also finished out the year with inventory down a healthy 9%. With the stock still trading at a reasonable price relative to earnings, the exceptional results of the fourth quarter sets the stage for a potential short squeeze. If this momentum continues, those who have bet against the stock may feel forced to cover their positions. The company’s recently-announced special dividend of $2.25 per share simply adds another catalyst to the list. Currently, GES stock provides a dividend yield of 4.84%, and unsurprisingly, analysts are bullish on this name.

        "description": "Karl-Anthony Towns said he takes 1,500 shots while discussing struggles against the Dallas Mavericks, but the \"Inside the NBA\" crew wasn't buying it.",
        "content": "What a brutal Western Conference Finals it has been for and the . After the first two rounds where they have shown amazing potential in sweeping Phoenix and taking down the defending champs Denver, Minnesota has fallen back down to earth as they stare at a 3-0 series deficit against the . Their struggles in the fourth quarter are one of the main reasons why they have been unable to beat Dallas, but Towns' inefficiency shooting from the field has been heavily concerning. It also doesn't do Towns any favors that in his attempt to alleviate concerns, he says that he's taking 1,500 practice shots every day. The \"Inside The NBA\" crew . Take forward , for example. \"KAT cappin'. Ain’t nobody shooting 1500 shots a day, right now,\" - Draymond Green Charles Barkley was even more blunt on the topic, stating that \"first of all, [Towns] is lying.\" Towns Struggled Again In Game 3 With Dallas having another strong performance, especially in the fourth quarter, to get a 116-107 victory against Minnesota in Game 3, Towns' showing became an immediate point of criticism. He finished with a stat line of 14 points, 11 rebounds, and three assists. Not only was he providing enough scoring-wise, he also shot 5-of-18 from the field and missed all eight of his three-point attempts. It has summed up a series where Towns has been unable to showcase his shooting prowess. In the West Finals, he is averaging 15 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and a steal on horrendous shooting splits of 27.8 percent from the field and 13.6 percent from downtown. Compared to the first two rounds, where he shot 51.7 percent overall and 44 percent from beyond the arc, his steep decline has held back Minnesota's offense from being able to explode against Dallas' defense. And with all three games being close as they were decided in the fourth quarter, Towns' inability to make an impact has created the hole the team finds themselves in now. While he did not take the podium in the postgame press conference after Game 3, he spoke to reporters in the hallway. He told them that he's attempting 1,500 shots every day in an attempt to lessen the concern some may have for his shooting woes in the series so far. \"I shot so well all playoffs. Confidence is extremely high. And to be having these unfortunate bounces and shots just not going in, it’s tough. It’s tough for sure. Confidence wise, I just have to keep shooting,\" Karl-Anthony Towns That did not go over well, especially with the \"Inside The NBA\" crew picking apart his statement. NBA legend Charles Barkley sees his shot selection from the three-point line as a huge issue, especially with that shot not falling for Towns as it was in previous series. \"If he’s shooting 1,500 threes, that’s the problem. It’s the types of shots he is getting. That’s the problem. It has nothing to do with him not working on his game. If he’s just out there shooting threes, he’s still 4 for 32,\" - Charles Barkley What's Next For Towns and Minnesota Minnesota's season now hangs in the balance, and it requires Towns to at least play solid for the remainder of the series. A 3-0 series comeback seems improbable, especially with all 154 teams having failed to do so throughout NBA history, but the Timberwolves have a chance to attempt it as long as Towns and return to the form they had in the first two rounds. Minnesota will fight to keep their playoff run alive when they face Dallas in Game 4, taking place on May 28 at 8 p.m. EST.",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Travelers flocking to airports over the weekend shattered previous records ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3 million passengers on Friday, marking the highest single-day total in history. This summer, over 270 million passengers are anticipated to travel on U.S. airlines, reflecting a 6% increase from last year. Following the holiday, the Federal Aviation Administration forecasts this Memorial Day weekend will be the busiest in 14 years. Road travelers are also expected to set new records. According to AAA, more than 38 million people will have traveled by car over the long weekend, the highest number since tracking began in 2000. Hertz highlights the cities with the highest rental car demand as Orlando, Denver, Atlanta, Boston, and Las Vegas. Conversely, severe storms across multiple states over the weekend disrupted travel in some regions. Parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas experienced extensive damage due to tornadoes, downed trees, and destroyed buildings, resulting in at least 20 fatalities. The storms caused flight delays and cancellations, and storm-hit roads faced blockages. By 8:30 a.m. on Monday, over 1,000 flights had been delayed and nearly 130 canceled within, into, or out of the U.S. for the Memorial Day holiday.",

What Happened: Self-proclaimed value investor Mike Alfred predicted a swift rise to $80,000, urging investors to be discerning about whose advice they heed. According to him, “So many people are kicking themselves for not buying more at $60,000. Be very careful who you listen to,” Alfred warned. Popular cryptocurrency analyst Michael van de Poppe touched on macroeconomic factors, highlighting the persisting high inflation and its potential impact on the financial system. “Overall, I think that we’re in the stages of high inflation and remain into that stage,” he stated. Van de Poppe saw a scenario where debt becomes unsustainable, pushing more individuals towards Bitcoin out of necessity. “Slowly but surely,” more people would adapt to Bitcoin out of a need, van de Poppe wrote.

While the Seattle-based carrier has specifically done so through its Fallen Soldier Program, it more recently has featured three aircraft in a dedicated to service members. Plane spotters in Washington have spotted a fourth aircraft donning the patriotic paint scheme. The plane, which is believed to be Alaska’s second , is expected to join the carrier’s fleet The airframe, registered as N806AK, was first noticed last month at Renton Municipal Airport (RNT) with its wingtip painted in the US flag colors and its tail partially painted. The livery comprises a red stripe and blue fuselage with the phrase “Honoring Those Who Serve” displayed above the windows. Symbolic crests near the rear of the aircraft represent the airline’s Fallen Soldier Program, while an “Alaska Airlines Salutes” medallion with six stars is featured near the aircraft’s nose. The stars, along with six stripes on the engine cowls, represent the six branches of the US Armed Forces – the US Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Space Force. Earlier this month, the fully painted aircraft was seen departing from King County International Airport (BFI) on a test flight. According to data from , the aircraft had flown 49 minutes and returned to BFI. Last week, it performed another test flight. The 737 MAX 8 flew from BFI to Grant County International Airport (MWH) in Central Washington and then flew back to BFI later in the day. Alaska confirmed on Monday that N806AK would soon enter its fleet. “Our fourth Honoring Those Who Serve aircraft, which is dedicated to members of the US military and honors those who serve today and those who served in the past, will soon be joining our fleet.” The other three aircraft, a 737-800 (N570AS), a 737-900ER (N265AK), and an Embraer E175 (N651QX), feature the livery and are deployed throughout Alaska’s route network. The Fallen Soldier Program was established in 2011 to ensure the proper military protocols are implemented when transporting the remains of those who made the ultimate sacrifice to serve in the armed forces. The program allows the bodies to be flown to their final resting place with the highest honor. Alaska also honors members of the armed forces with customized baggage carts. They are stationed at 15 airports across the country to respectfully the remains of service members to and from aircraft and are available for use by all airlines. the airline said.",

        "content": "The Washington Nationals reinstated Lane Thomas from the 10-day injured list on Monday and designated fellow outfielder Victor Robles for assignment. Thomas missed a month with an MCL sprain in his left knee. He was injured stealing second base in an April 23 game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Thomas, 28, is batting .184 with two homers, 10 RBIs and 11 stolen bases in 22 games this season. He is a career .247 hitter with 59 home runs, 190 RBIs and 46 steals in 453 games with the Cardinals (2019-21) and Nationals, who acquired Thomas in the July 2021 trade that sent left-hander Jon Lester to St. Louis. Robles, who turned 27 last week, is batting just .120 with three runs and four stolen bases in 14 games this season. He hit .299 in 36 games last season and is a career .236 hitter with 31 home runs, 156 RBIs and 70 steals in parts of eight seasons with Washington. He finished sixth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting in 2019. This article first appeared on Field Level Media and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Scott Alan Johnston, Universe Today Four zebrafish are alive and well after nearly a month in space aboard China's Tiangong space station. As part of an experiment testing the development of vertebrates in microgravity, the fish live and swim within a small habitat aboard the station. While the zebrafish have thus far survived, they are showing some signs of disorientation. The taikonauts aboard Tiangong—Ye Guangfu, Li Cong, and Li Guangsu—have reported instances of swimming upside down, backward, and in circular motions, suggesting that microgravity is having an effect on their spatial awareness. The zebrafish were launched aboard Shenzhou-18, which carried them, as well as a batch of hornwort, to orbit on April 25, 2024. The aim of the project is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem, studying the effects of both microgravity and radiation on the development and growth of these species. As a test subject, zebrafish have several advantages. Their short reproductive and development cycle, and transparent eggs, allow scientists to study their growth quickly and effectively, and their genetic makeup shares similarities with humans, potentially offering insights that are relevant to human health . The zebrafish genome has been fully sequenced, and for these reasons zebrafish are commonly used in scientific experiments on Earth. Seeing how these well-studied creatures behave in such an extreme environment may have a lot to tell us about the life and development of vertebrates across species while exposed to microgravity. The taikonauts aboard Tiangong perform feeding and water sampling at regular intervals , and cameras allow scientists on the ground to monitor the aquarium. This is not the first time fish have been to space. Starting in 2012, a Japanese research project brought medaka and zebrafish to the International Space Station for study in a similar aquatic habitat. The results of those studies revealed a decrease in bone density in the fish within just ten days. Human astronauts experience similar effects in orbit, though not on such quick time scales, and they can be mitigated somewhat through rigorous exercise routines. Earlier fish in space include a mummichog aboard Skylab 3 in 1973 (and again in 1975 aboard Apollo-Soyuz), and zebrafish aboard the Soviet space station Salyut 5 in 1976. A variety of fish reached orbit aboard space shuttles in the 1990s, too. The health and sustainability of animal life in space is a key area of research for human spaceflight efforts. If humans are to travel on long-term space missions, like those required to reach Mars, then understanding the biological implications of space travel is vital. These zebrafish are the latest in a long line of experiments undertaken in this pressing area of research. Provided by Universe Today",

Memorial Day was celebrated on Monday and celebrities took to social media to celebrate the annual US holiday. Matthew McConaughey wrote on social media, 'Remember and respect,' as he added, 'Happy Memorial Day' Sofia Vergara wore a fiery red dress with her hair down as she posed with a female friend and her new Chihuahua puppy at Cecconi's in West Hollywood Melissa Joan Hart shared a photo of a US flag: 'Today I pray for the lives of those who went before us in bravery and courage to protect our freedoms and our country! Thank you for your service, sacrifice and selflessness!#MemorialDay2024 (Artist unknown)' Bette Midler shared, 'Today is #MemorialDay in the US, so read #FlandersFields, but spare a thought for the millions who died from the senseless hate humans have rained down on each other in the last 100 years since then, and the one million #Americans who perished during Covid just a few years ago.' Memorial Day tends to mark the unofficial start of summer for many Americans, though the season really begins with the Summer Solstice in mid-June. The annual holiday - which is celebrated on the last Monday of May - is a federal holiday in the United States for mourning the U.S. military personnel who have died while serving in the United States armed forces. Since the Revolutionary War ended, 646,596 American troops have died in battle and more than 539,000 died from other, non-combat related causes. It was formerly observed on May 30 from 1868 to 1970. Flag etiquette on Memorial Day is unique, according to the Farmers Almanac . At sunrise, flags are to be raised to full staff briskly, then lowered to half staff position, where they will remain until noon. See guidelines for flying the American Flag. Traditionally, on Memorial Day (U.S.), volunteers often place small American flags on each grave site at national cemeteries. A national moment of remembrance takes place at 3:00 p.m. local time. Consider visiting a local cemetery to place flags; many organizations would be grateful for volunteers. Contact your local American Legion post, Daughters of the American Revolution, or Boy or Girl Scouts troops. The custom of honoring ancestors by cleaning cemeteries and decorating graves is an ancient and worldwide tradition. In early rural America, it was usually performed in summer and was an occasion for family reunions and picnics. The ritual of visiting family graves and memorials was never a morbid tradition. Rather, it was an annual act of remembrance, as well as a chance to clean and decorate family memorials. Often, families would picnic as well; cemeteries were often the only open green spaces in crowded cities. Memorial Day was originally known as Decoration Day, starting with the American Civil War. It's believed that the tradition of honoring the dead was inspired by the way Southern states decorated the graves of both Confederate and Union soldiers with flowers, wreaths, and flags.

On May 5, 1866, Waterloo, New York, hosted its own community-wide event that, in 1966, led to President Lyndon Johnson declaring the town as the birthplace of Decoration Day. Meanwhile, on May 5, 1868, inspired by the suggestion of veteran, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (a fraternal organization of Union Civil War veterans), issued General Order No. 11, designating the 30th of May as an annual day of remembrance. The idea caught on. U.S. President Joe Biden honored fallen soldiers during the 156th observance of Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery outside the nation's capital on Monday. Biden placed a wreath of flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in a solemn ceremony, where he was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'We gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives for this nation,' Biden said afterward at the cemetery's amphitheater. Earlier in the day, Biden hosted a White House breakfast in honor of Memorial Day that included administration officials, military leadership, veterans and so-called Gold Star family members, referring to those who have lost an immediate relative in military action. US President Joe Biden speaks at the 156th National Memorial Day observance at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, May 27, 2024 'We gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives for this nation,' Biden said afterward at the cemetery's amphitheater Earlier in the day, Biden hosted a White House breakfast in honor of Memorial Day that included administration officials, military leadership, veterans and so-called Gold Star family members, referring to those who have lost an immediate relative in military action The Memorial Day ceremony is the latest in a string of events where Biden has focused on active and retired military personnel, including delivering the commencement speech on Saturday at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York . Next week, the president will travel to Normandy, France, to participate in ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion . He is expected to give a major speech about the heroism of Allied forces in World War Two and the continuing threats to democracy today. Thursday will mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Biden's son Beau, who served in Iraq as part of Delaware's National Guard. Beau died from glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer that his father believes was possibly a consequence of exposure to military burn pits in Iraq. 'This week marks nine years since I lost my son, Beau,' Biden said. 'Our losses are not the same. He didn't perish on the battlefield. He was a cancer victim. 'The pain of his loss is with me every day ... so is the pride in his service,' the president said. On Memorial Day, each grave site at Arlington will have a small American flag carefully positioned exactly one boot ́s length away from the headstone. The flags were placed by 1,500 soldiers from the Army ́s 3rd Infantry Regiment, better known as The Old Guard. The regiment has carried out the tradition, known as 'Flags In,' just before Memorial Day every year since 1948, when it was designated as the Army ́s official ceremonial unit.

        "content": "Novelist Elizabeth Day reveals politicians have turned down her award-winning podcast How to Fail because they don't want to be associated with the word 'fail' By Dolly Busby Published: 17:50 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:06 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Elizabeth Day has revealed politicians won't be guests on her award-winning podcast How to Fail because they don't want to be associated with the word 'fail'. The 45-year-old novelist told an audience at the Hay Literature Festival: 'There are some politicians who, I won't name names, won't come on the podcast because it has the word \"fail\" in the title and they don't want to be seized upon. 'So if I really thought about it I might not have branded it that way. 'But I'm not fetishising the pursuit of failure. I'm simply saying that failure is something that happens to us all and it connects us which is really liberating.' Politicians who have braved the podcast have discussed their failures in Whitehall, their mental health problems and personal relationships. Elizabeth Day (pictured, in May at The Podcast Show in London) has revealed politicians won't be guests on her award-winning podcast How to Fail because they don't want to be associated with the word 'fail' Ed Milliband appeared on Ms Day's podcast in 2021 and discussed his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failure to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive In 2019, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told Ms Day about her failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends Ed Milliband appeared on Ms Day's podcast in 2021 and discussed his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failure to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive. Read More Clive Myrie reveals how he wouldn't report on the Notting Hill Carnival as he refused to be pigeonholed by the BBC In 2019, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told Ms Day about her failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends. She talked about the failure in contraception that resulted in her eldest son, her failure to get on the Home Office Fast Track scheme and, in an extremely moving admission, her self-perceived failure to fix her brother's drug addiction. The same year, the former Conservative politician Chris Patten went on the show to discuss losing his seat in the 1992 election and his time as Chairman of the BBC where he presided over the Jimmy Saville scandal. The Magpid author shared that her dream guests for the podcast were Sienna Miller, Michelle Obama, Beyonce and Taylor Swift - though the Midnights singer no longer does interviews. Speaking about her latest non-fiction project, Friendaholic, which shot to Number One on the Sunday Times Bestseller list, she encouraged people to have a wedding ceremony with their friends before getting married to their partner. She said: 'An audience member in Bath said that before she got married to her husband, she got married to her best friend because she thought that relationship was as important to her. 'I completely and utterly agree. - they'd gone into the woods and done a wedding ceremony and I thought that was genius. 'I think people should think about having platonic wedding ceremonies that I put it as an extra chapter in the paperback version of my book.' The Magpid author shared that one of her dream guests for the podcast was Beyonce The former Sunday Telegraph journalist also revealed she was set up on a date with fellow journalist and author of Empireland, Sathnam Sanghera Ms Day got divorced from her first husband the BBC News Editorial director, Kamal Ahmed, who she divorced at 36 after four years of marriage in 2014 and is now married to CEO Justin Basini. The former Sunday Telegraph journalist also revealed she was set up on a date with fellow journalist and author of Empireland, Sathnam Sanghera. She said: 'We quickly realised we worked way better as friends and he's been a very close friend of mine ever since.'

Following the incident, the Lucea police have launched a manhunt for the shooter whose identity has been given so far only as ‘Coolie’. Reports are that about 5:00 PM, the accused man and another man got involved in an argument in the community. The accused reported rode his motorcycle from the scene but returned shortly afterward with a pillion. They brandished handguns and opened fire at the man who was standing with his father along the roadway. Both father and son ran to avoid being shot to death while the gunmen rode away on the motorcycle. It was later discovered that the father had received gunshot wounds, and he was rushed to the hospital where he was treated and admitted in serious condition. His son managed to escape unhurt.",

OceanGate's Titan submersible disappeared on June 18, 2023 , after it plunged into the sea to explore the wreck of the Titanic - killing all five people on board, including the company's CEO, Stockton Rush. The cost of the expedition was $250,000. The company was slammed for flouting warnings of the risks and offering cut-price tickets to some of those on the trip. But despite the catastrophic implosion, rich thrill-seekers are still spending thousands on similar expeditions. One of the companies still operating deep sea dives, including an expedition back to the Titanic wreck, is Triton. Its operators insist their submersible is safer than Titan, which was criticized for having no official safety certification. America's super-wealthy are still risking their lives on deep sea adventures even after the catastrophic implosion of OceanGate 's Titan last year, that killed all on board (Pictured: next-generation Triton submersible, the Triton 660/9 AVA, called the Scenic Neptune II) They refused to share the per-person cost for a seat on their sub, or tell DailyMail.com when they plan to plunge to the depths of the Atlantic to reach the Titanic wreck. Triton's subs have been used in the past for the 'world's deepest dive' to Australia's Great Barrier Reef in July 2023 with British biologist Sir David Attenborough . This year, Triton subs were used for expeditions to the Mariana Trench, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Arctic Ocean. Influential individuals have recognized how the tragic implosion could impact the investment in deep ocean research, said Sophie Bentham-Wood, Executive Director of Global Marketing and Sales Strategies for the leading submarine company Triton. 'Some have already approached us to discuss the build of deep-diving submersibles purely to counteract any negative impact those events could have had and maintain momentum in the ocean space,' Bentham-Wood told Dailymail.com. Ohio real-estate investor and businessman, Larry Connor, is one of them. He is planning to be on the first sub to dive back to the titanic wreckage since the Titan imploded last June. Ohio real-estate investor and businessman, Larry Connor (left) says he is signed up for an expedition to the Titanic later this year OceanGate 's Titan submersible (pictured) disappeared on June 18, 2023, after it plunged into the ocean to explore the wreck of the Titanic. The cost of the trip was $250,000 The sub diver is determined to prove submersing down 12,500 feet to the 112-year-old titanic wreckage is perfectly safe - and he has the money to do so. Connor is set on taking a two-person submersible down to titanic wreck depths to show people worldwide that 'while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way,' he told the Wall Street Journal. He is planning the dive with Patrick Lahey, President and co-founder of Triton Submarines, one of the leading submersible companies in the world. The two have worked together previously diving to some of the ocean's deepest depths. Triton clients have already made various dives this year, from exploring the Mariana Trench, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Arctic Ocean. Despite OceanGate's catastrophic implosion last June, the pair aims to prove to the world that such an expedition can be carried out safely. Connor, who has previously explored the Mariana Trench, the deepest oceanic trench on Earth, said they plan to undertake the journey in a two-person vessel called the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer, named '4000' for the depth in meters it can reach. It's unclear when the trip will take place or how much it will cost.

'If there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,' she told Dailymail.com (Pictured: Project Hercules, a collab between Triton Submarines and Espen Øino International, a luxury sub) Historically, submersibles have successfully dived deeper than the Titanic for decades (Pictured: The world's first and only submersible certified 'Depth: Unlimited') The TRITON 660 AVA series employs our revolutionary Advanced Versatile Acrylics to create the world's first submersibles with a free-form acrylic pressure hull (Pictured: TRITON 660 AVA) The world’s deepest dive to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was achieved by Sir David Attenborough in a Triton submersible Lahey was among many industry figures who criticized OceanGate before and after the disaster, accusing it of questionable safety standards. After the implosion, he described Rush's recruitment tactics use to convincing people to get on board as 'quite predatory' and emphasized that certified submersibles are generally safe. Lahey emphasized that this tragedy wasn't reflecting of the industry as a whole. 'In that sense, OceanGate didn't make the industry look bad,' McCallum told the WSJ. 'It made us look good.' Lahey said that after the implosion, Connor called him saying, 'You know, what we need to do is build a sub that can dive to [Titanic-level depths] repeatedly and safely and demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that, and that Titan was a contraption.' With respect to the lives lost last June, Bentham-Wood said the 'continued exploration of the deep ocean in manned submersibles is essential to understanding the ocean environment, which is a key component of our future on this planet.' 'If there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,' she told Dailymail.com 'Plus everyone realizes the deep ocean is no place for compromise – therefore, the need for programs to solely employ submersibles with full classification certification in their operations is not an option, but a prerequisite.' Before Titan, the only major sub disaster included the USS Thresher's 1963 implosion, killing 129 crew members Dakar - World's Record Deep Sea Dive (1954) Historically, submersibles have successfully dived deeper than the Titanic for decades. When the wreck of the Titanic was first first discovered in 1985, submersibles had already been diving to greater depths for several decades. The first to do so was the FNRS-3 bathyscaphe in 1954, setting a record by reaching 4,050 meters. In 1960, the Trieste descended 10,916 meters in the Mariana Trench. Since then, at least 16 submersibles have repeatedly taken people deeper than the Titanic over the past 69 years. The US submersible Alvin made the first dives to investigate the Titanic in July 1986, followed by the French submersible Nautile in 1987, which returned in 1993 and dived to the wreck 47 times in total. Today, ten submersibles in service can reach Titanic depths and beyond. According to the Marine Technology Society's submarine group, OceanGate was the only company operating a submersible capable of reaching Titanic-wreck depths that was not certified, raising industry concerns. 'There are only 10 submarines in the world that can go 4,000m or deeper and all of them are certified except the OceanGate,' Will Kohnen, chair of the Marine Technology Society's submarine group told CBC News in June 2023. OceanGate was conducting deep-ocean expeditions since 2009, with over 200 successful dives using its three submersibles in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. The Titan was designed to reach deeper depths of over 13,000 feet, according to the company. Before Titan, the only major sub disaster included the USS Thresher's 1963 implosion, killing 129 crew members. British explorer Hamish Harding was among those killed in the 'catastrophic implosion' French Navy veteran PH Nargeolet (left) was in the sub along with Stockton Rush (right), CEO of the OceanGate Expedition But after the implosion, many in the industry called for extra caution around any future trips to the titanic wreckage. Other have called for greater oversight of the submersible industry as a whole. Last year, titanic expert Tim Maltin said trips to the wreckage should be paused until more is discovered about what occurred to the Titan sub. 'We need to make sure that any vessels that go down there carrying fee-paying passengers...[are] certified to greater depths than they will be put through,' said Maltin. Caroline Heaven, a member of the British Titanic Society, said the dangers outweigh any benefits. 'I see no point in even considering the perilous journey to the wreck,' she told the BBC . 'The dangers involved are too great, the conditions are too cramped, and visibility is limited when the wreck is reached. Debris from the Titan submersible recovered from the ocean floor near the wreck of the Titanic, is unloaded from a ship 'Out of the entire population of submersibles, 90 to 95 per cent are certified. There's a five to 10 per cent fringe, so in that aspect they are an outlier, but sure, in the deep submersibles they really stand out.'

On June 18, the OceanGate's Titan was launched around 8am in the Atlantic Ocean above the site of the Titanic shipwreck. The five passengers, tourists Hamish Harding , 58, Shahzada Dawood , 48, and his son Sulaiman Dawood, 19, French Navy pilot Paul-Henry (PH) Nargeolet and OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, started to descend as Rush piloted the vessel. At 9:45am, the ship lost contact with its mothership, the Polar Prince, during a descent to the wreck of the Titanic 12,500 feet beneath the surface. Days later, its debris was recovered.

        "content": "Netflix fans are unimpressed with Jennifer Lopez’s new flick. The trailer for her new project Atlas has received poor reception from some viewers who flocked to social media to share their thoughts. Over on X/Twitter under a clip from the preview, one person wrote: “Absolute garbage, that’s as much as I’ll watch of this, the acting is hollow. Hard to watch even this amount of it.” Another person simply branded it “awful” while one said: “Why as a society [do] we keep doing this. Not sure I was looking for JLo action movie.” More comments flooded in, with one scathing remark stating: “What is this, 1999?” However, someone praised Lopez’s hard work and quipped: “She been working like the rent due lately, I respect it.” Jennifer’s brand new science-fiction thriller follows data analyst Atlas Shepherd who is wary about artificial intelligence. She joins a mission to capture a robot but is forced to worked with AI. The Jenny From The Block singer spoke out about the film and said: “I loved that this is a big sci-fi action movie, but at its core it’s a story of friendship and a love story, in a way. I always see everything as a love story, but this is a different kind of love between two beings who connect in disastrous circumstances and teach each other how to be more human.” Elsewhere in news, one freaky film has left streamers with “so many questions” after watching and discovering a “hidden message”. Leave The World Behind is an apocalyptic psychological thriller film which stars Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke and Kevin Bacon as a group of people navigating an apocalyptic event. The film follows Amanda who plans a vacation with her family as the world suffers a cyber attack. The “catastrophic environmental effects” begin to play out and creepy scenes show teeth falling out, dead-eyed deer that haunt the family and a piercing alarm. Fans over in the Netflix Bangers Facebook group said that the film was “kind of freaky but a good watch” and that they “enjoyed” the thriller as one person urged: “Love it.

'You are an enabler, President Biden,' she told a crowd at the Peoples' Conference for Palestine . 'Each year, our country, and I say our country because it is our country, sends billions of dollars to maintain an apartheid government and support the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,' said Tlaib. 'It is disgraceful that the Biden administration and my colleagues in Congress continue to smear them for protesting to save lives, no matter faith or ethnicity,' she said, referring to the pro-Gaza protesters that have popped up at universities and elsewhere throughout the country.' Tlaib was behind a group of Arab activists who convinced Michigan Democrats to vote 'uncommitted' in the state's primary to protest the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Palestine war. 'You are an enabler, President Biden,' she told a crowd at the Peoples' Conference for Palestine Tlaib also tore into Biden for saying Israel is not committing 'genocide' as its defense forces push further into the southern city of Rafah. It comes as Hamas fired rockets from Rafah toward Tel Aviv for the first time in four months, signaling the militant group is still capable of threatening Israel. All of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. 'The International Court of Justice just ruled that the Israeli government must stop its invasion of Rafah, but President Biden says what's happening [in Gaza] is not a genocide,' the 'Squad' member said. 'Where's your red line, President Biden?' 'Attacking the authority of the International Criminal Court and interfering in the legal process is nothing more, nothing more than an attempt to prevent the genocidal maniac Netanyahu and his senior Israeli officials from being held accountable for those crimes against humanity.' 'You are an enabler,' Tlaib said to Biden. 'But we're not going to forget in November, are we?' Read More BREAKING NEWS Israeli troops exchange fire with Egyptian soldiers near Rafah, killing one: IDF says incident 'under investigation' Tlaib and a handful of her progressive colleagues refused to clap during Biden's March State of the Union address, instead holding up signs that said 'stop sending bombs.' At least 45 people were killed, including women and children, in an Israeli airstrike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah over the weekend, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Israel, meanwhile, said it killed two 'senior Hamas terrorists' there and is investigating the circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area.' Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said the rockets fired from Rafah proved 'the IDF must operate in every place Hamas still operates from, and, as such, the IDF will continue to operate wherever necessary.' Close to 36,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict since October 7, when Hamas killed some 1,160 Israelis and kidnapped over 200 . Biden has in recent months grown more vocal about Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Gaza conflict but staunchly defended the U.S. ally after ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week announced he is seeking arrest warrants for the prime minister and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, in addition to Hamas' Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, political chief Ismail Haniyah, and as Mohammed Deif, who is behind its armed wing. 'We don't recognize their jurisdiction — the ICC — the way it's being exercised,' Biden told reporters last week during a press conference with Kenyan President William Ruto. 'It's that simple. We don't think there's an equivalence between what Israel did and what Hamas did.' Biden has in recent months grown more vocal about Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Gaza conflict but staunchly defended the U.S. ally after ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week announced he is seeking arrest warrants for the prime minister and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Pro-Palestine demonstrators march holding a banner expressing their opinion in the neighborhood of Astoria, Queens, N.Y., in mid-May 'Contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what's happening is not genocide,' Biden had said earlier. 'We reject that. And we'll always stand with Israel and its — in the threats against its security.' In an olive branch to progressives and Arab-American voters, Biden publicly touted a pause on the shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel on May 8 in protest of the IDF pushing into Rafah, where some 1.4 million Palestinians took shelter as many of their homes in the northern part of Gaza had been razed. But shortly after that the Biden administration announced a $1 billion arms deal with Israel - and the U.S. will continue to supply Israel with weapons even as they push into Rafah. That package includes $700m in tank ammunition, $500m in tactical vehicles and $60m in mortar rounds.

        "content": "Crisco inferno? A Connecticut woman is lucky to be alive after a half-baked attempt to extinguish a grease fire literally blew up in her face, as seen in this video setting the internet ablaze. “This is exactly what you SHOULD NOT DO,” warned LaTeasha Brost in the caption to the clip, which boasts over 6.2 million views on TikTok. In the viral footage, the TikToker is seen cooking in her kitchen, when all of a sudden, a fire erupts in the pan. “What do I do?” cries the petrified Brost, who decides to try and douse the blaze with water. Unfortunately, this backfires horribly, creating a giant fireball. Terrified, Brost flees to the living room and chucks the flaming pot, which nearly hits her dog, before she trips and falls in the living room. Thankfully, the fire appeared to go out on its own. Why did the water paradoxically act as an accelerant? As Brost pointed out, the inferno was an oil-based blaze, Yahoo News reported. When water is combined with grease, it sinks beneath the less-dense oil, pushing the grease to the surface. This water then rapidly heats and vaporizes, propelling the flaming top layer of oil into the air and creating a flaming greaseball. Thankfully, Brost said there was no “apartment damage” and that she only sustained second-degree burns in the freak accident. She said she hopes that sharing the video will help prevent others from making the “same mistake.” “It’s okay if you laugh,” she added. “This is your sign to get a fire extinguisher or fire blanket in your kitchen ... We didn’t know what to do and although we are very embarrassed, we hope people can learn from this so they don’t make the same mistake as we did.” It’s okay if you laugh...there was no apartment damage and luckily only recieved 2nd degree burns. This is exactly what you SHOULD NOT DO! Sharing this because we didn’t know what to do and although we are very embarrassed, we hope people can learn from this so they don’t make the same mistake as we did. Social media had a field day with the flaming fiasco. “The accidental stop drop and roll is insane,” exclaimed one bemused viewer, while another wrote, “not you almost throwing the fire ON your dog.” Brost clarified in the comments that she chucked the pan because it was burning her skin. “The important thing is that you didn’t panic,” snarked one TikTok wit. “Friendly reminder not to add water to a grease fire,” advised one social media Samaritan. In the event of a grease fire, people are advised to turn off the stove and cover the pot with a non-glass lid or other pot to starve the flames of oxygen, ABC 27 reported. Failing that, one should try and put it out with an extinguisher or call 911 if the fire’s raging out of control.",

        "content": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has criticised a “siloed” approach to disability services and problems in Ireland as he encouraged local authorities to help solve the housing crisis. At the launch of his party’s local and European manifesto in Dublin, Mr Harris said that he was “sick and tired of the national pass the parcel” in relation to disability services in Ireland. He said Fine Gael would promote a universal design approach for travel and playgrounds and invest in sensory spaces in libraries. “Parents don’t care, children don’t care about it, I don’t care about who does the job – we just need to get it done,” he said. He also said that housing was “the defining societal issue” in Ireland and went beyond a crisis to an “inter-generational anxiety”. He called for a review of the bulk purchase of houses by institutional investors. “I’m pleased with a number of the measures the housing minister and the finance minister have brought in, I think they’ve been good, I think they’ve been effective, but I don’t think we can close our ears in relation to this.” He also said local authorities would be “held to account” for their housing delivery, and said it was “about time every part of the public service puts their shoulder to the wheel”. Asked about the comments afterwards, Mr Harris said: “I don’t say this to be critical, but there isn’t a consistency in relation to the delivery of housing across the country. “And I don’t say that to be critical, the reason I make that point is because sometimes there can be blockages. So this is not about local government and national government having a spat here.” He said he wanted to know if there were “blockages” or resourcing issues behind why some local authorities take longer than others to “turn a vacant property into a home for a family”. He added: “I don’t want to be blaming anybody, nor them blaming us, but I want every arm of this state to work together because what I can tell you, seven weeks as Taoiseach, I am concerned genuinely about the siloed approach that is taken to problems in this country. “I have huge respect for our public servants, I described them as the best in the world today at the National Economic Dialogue, that is my view. But I do sometimes think there can be ‘that’s a matter for somebody else’, ‘that’s a matter for that agency’. The public are sick and tired of that. “I have a very low threshold in terms of tolerance for that. I want to fix housing once and for all and I want everyone to play their part in that.”",

Officials urge caution at the intersection of Thicke Road and the TCH as crews are working on drainage in the area. According to a news release issued May 24 by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, “The work protects the long-term resiliency of the highway as flooding from nearby drains had been affecting the road base.” The ministry noted that the timing of the construction was selected “based on weather and low traffic-volume times to ensure minimal impact to travellers in advance of the summer travel season.” Work is expected to take two weeks. The highway will be fully open overnight and on the weekends though at the end of the two-week work period, the southbound slow lane will require 24-hour a day closure for five days to complete repairs. “Drivers are reminded to observe traffic management personnel and signage in the area, and drive with caution in active construction zones,” said the release.",

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press Immigration Minister Marc Miller is lifting the cap on Palestinian who can be brought by relatives to Canada through a program that faces widespread criticism. Miller speaks during an announcement in the Foyer of the House of Commons, in Ottawa, Thursday, May 23, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld Immigration Minister Marc Miller is increasing the number of applications that will be processed under a much-criticized program to reunite Palestinians with Canadian relatives. The move comes as he testifies about measures introduced months ago that were meant to bring relatives of Canadians from conflict zones in the Gaza Strip and Sudan to safety. The Gaza program initially had a cap of 1,000 applications that could be \"accepted into processing,\" but Miller is now increasing that number to 5,000, each of which can include multiple family members. Palestinian Canadians have complained about inconsistent messaging and onerous requirements that left people unable to leave Gaza before Israel effectively closed access to Egypt. Civil war in Sudan broke out last spring, yet family members say officials expect their relatives will not reach Canada until the end of this year, citing delays with fingerprinting and other biometric requirements Miller is providing a briefing about both programs today at the House of Commons immigration committee. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it has issued 179 temporary-resident permits through the Gaza program as of April 29, but the department doesn't know whether anyone has actually reached Canada. In a statement, Miller said that Canada has been sending the names of approved temporary residents to Israeli and Egyptian authorities, even though they can't currently exit the Gaza Strip. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time,\" Miller said. \"With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves.\" There continue to be reports of Palestinians paying thousands of dollars to cross into Egypt amid uncertainty over their resettlement status. Relatives in Canada say they were given mixed information from Ottawa about whether those who paid to cross could still access the Canadian program. The Gaza program involves temporary residency permits, while the Sudan program is for permanent residency. The NDP has accused the government of bungling both programs, and not learning from other conflict situations, such as the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021.",

        "description": "Jacob Trouba should have had a major and a game misconduct Sunday. Instead, he got two minutes and the NHL got yet another black eye.",
        "content": "Article content Don’t take my word for it. Listen to P.K. Subban, who is rapidly becoming the articulate, fearless charismatic commentator hockey so desperately needs. After the Rangers Jacob Trouba got two minutes for hammering Florida’s Evan Rodrigues with an elbow to the jaw, P.K. didn’t mess around. “The arm is extended,” Subban said. “The elbow is out from the start. Where is this a hockey play? There’s no shoulder involved, don’t tell me he hit him in the neck. It’s a straight elbow to the chin. I’m not going to harp on it too long — it’s a major, for me. That was a missed call.” Exactly. Not surprisingly, there were other media types and no shortage of fans lining up with the usual horse patootie to excuse yet another dirty, dangerous play: “The head was not the principal point of contact.” “It was a hockey play.” “It’s playoff hockey.” The worst was Kevin Bieksa, who tried to tell us it wasn’t an elbow and anyway, it’s all O because he used to hit that way. No, Kevin. It was an elbow to the jaw. Cut the bull. Brendan Gallagher got five games for the same thing. Trouba is not merely a headhunter, he’s a serial headhunter. There was the play against Carolina when Trouba launched himself at a falling Martin Necas. Trouba missed his target, which would have been Necas’s head, but his skate clipped Necas as Trouba crashed into the boards. Then there was the time Trouba hit Tyler Toffoli squarely in the back, driving him face-first into the glass. One of the worst came in Game 7 against New Jersey a year ago, when Trouba came off the bench and Timo Meier didn’t see him. Trouba drove his shoulder into Meier’s jaw, wiping him out completely and prompting one analyst to claim, “he went through the centre core of the body.” No, he didn’t. He went through the centre core of the head. In January, Trouba was handed a two-game suspension for elbowing the Golden Knights’ Pavel Dorofeyev, yet the refs essentially gave him a pass on the shot that levelled Rodrigues. Look, Jacob Trouba is a serial headhunter. He is dangerous. He is as dirty a player as we have seen since Matt Cooke hung up the skates that once slashed Erik Karlsson’s Achilles tendon. And yet the hockey world saw fit to honour Trouba with the Mark Messier Award for “leadership” this year. Leadership in what, pray tell? CTE? Trouba is developing the sort of symbiotic relationship with Matt Rempe that Bobby Clarke once had with Dave Schultz. Like Clarke, Trouba does the dirty stuff knowing that Rempe is there to assault anyone who comes after him. Trouba should have had a major and a game misconduct Sunday. If the referees had done their job, it’s likely the Rangers would not have won the game to take a 2-1 lead in the series against a tough Florida Panthers team. Instead, Trouba got two minutes and the league got yet another black eye. That Florida’s Dimitry Kulikov also got two minutes for interference for hitting the Rangers’ Alex Wennberg in the head with his shoulder earlier in the series doesn’t matter — two wrong calls don’t make it right. Not what the PWHL needs: In almost every way — almost — the PWHL has been a brilliant success in its inaugural season. The playoffs, unfortunately, have been a mixed bag. Too many extended overtime games. Too little scoring. And an injury (which can’t be helped) to the league’s biggest star, Nathalie Spooner. But the worst of it came Sunday night in Minnesota when, with a crowd of 13,104 at the Xcel Energy Centre celebrating what appeared to be the championship winning goal in double overtime and Minnesota players going wild on the ice, the league announced that the goal was being reviewed. Minnesota star Taylor Heise had carried the puck down the left wing and fallen and she cut to the goal. As she slid into the crease, the puck went to Minnesota’s Sophie Jaques, who scored over the shoulder of Boston goalie Aerin Frankel. Heise did not “crash” into Frankel. She didn’t knock her down. Frankel had a full, unobstructed view of the shot. And yet the curse of goaltender interference would strike again. The goal was waved off and one minute later, Alina Müller scored to send the series back to a deciding Game 5 in Boston. The NHL makes similar mistakes night after night, but the NHL can get away with it. The PWHL has to get it right and waving off the winning goal was not right.

        "content": "Article content By: Jane Sims LONDON, ONT. — The former mayor of Woodstock has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault allegations in a London courtroom. Trevor Birtch, 48, who served two terms as mayor until he was defeated in the fall of 2022, entered not guilty pleas Monday to two counts of sexual assault and one count of assault involving a single female complainant in 2021. The complainant was expected to testify during Monday’s proceedings, using a closed-circuit suite away from the courtroom. Her identity is protected by a court order. Birtch, who was wearing a suit and sporting a ponytail, appeared in the London courtroom seated beside his defence lawyer, James Battin. The trial, scheduled to last four days, is being heard by Superior Court Justice Michael Carnegie. Birtch was charged in London in February 2022. A second set of three sexual assault charges, involving a different complainant between January 2017 and April 2022, was laid in London in April 2022. Birtch is scheduled to go to trial on those charges in September. ran for a third term in the fall of 2022, with the high-profile criminal charges looming, and was trounced at the ballot box – finishing fourth out of six candidates with just 300 votes. He studied political science at Western University and worked as a financial analyst for the County of Oxford for more than a decade before entering municipal politics in Woodstock. Jerry Acchione won the 2022 race and now serves as mayor of Woodstock, in his first term.",

SteelSeries’ ClearCast 2 microphone — found on its flagship Arctis Nova Pro headset — makes its way onto the new Arctis Nova 5, albeit in an updated (and seemingly better) version the brand is calling ClearCast 2.X.

It features over 100 game-specific audio presets that users can flip between at any time — including whilst playing — with profiles included for many of the most popular titles like Fortnite and Minecraft.

Session gamers can expect to get up to 60 hours of wireless play on a single charge, and with its fast charging capability via USB-C it takes just 15 minutes to get from empty to six hours worth of juice.

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 The forthcoming second edition of Vision Golfe, endorsed by the esteemed Mr. Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic, is set to launch with great anticipation. This prestigious event will take place at the Ministry of the Economy in Paris and seeks to enhance both economic and cultural ties between France and the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, which include the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Jointly hosted by the French Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Europe, the summit will concentrate on areas such as trade, technological advancements, and cultural cooperation. In an exclusive interview, Thierry Rayer, President of the Cercle d’Études Scientifiques Pierre Rayer (CESR), reveals the implications of this event and the crucial role of “Universæ Analysis”, a method he has developed for analyzing works of art. Rayer said, “Vision Golfe aims not only to strengthen commercial and technological ties but also to enrich the cultural exchange between these dynamic regions.” Impact on cultural institutions and investors Beyond its cultural contribution, “Universæ Analysis” also offers valuable analytical tools for art investors. “It provides means of authentication paving the way for more strategic investments in the art sector,” says Rayer . Sites like Al Ula and Neom could benefit from these approaches to attract an international audience and redefine their acquisition policy. Collaboration with international art collectors Interaction with international art collectors also plays a crucial role, enriching the cultural experience in Gulf countries through the introduction of rare and valuable works. “These partnerships not only enhance local collections but also encourage a deeper cultural dialogue between countries,” adds Rayer . “Universæ Analysis: A Revolution in Art Analysis” “Universæ Analysis” combines biology, geometry, and mathematics with thorough research in Egyptology and the histories of ancient civilizations like Greece and Rome. According to Rayer, this comprehensive method is designed to uncover previously hidden insights in the artworks of classical masters like Da Vinci and Raphael, and modernists such as Brancusi and Kandinsky. This method is not just academic; it has substantial practical implications for museums and cultural institutions, facilitating enriching partnerships between France and the Gulf countries. Rayer notes, “We use ‘Universæ Analysis’ to enhance the understanding and appreciation of works, which inevitably strengthens cultural and economic ties.” National missions to Gulf countries to enhance cultural tourism Initiatives involving national missions to Gulf countries are poised to stimulate cultural innovation and enhance cultural tourism. These missions are dedicated to promoting artistic exchanges and cultural partnerships, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and appreciation of the diverse cultural wealth shared between France and the Gulf nations. Conclusion Thierry Rayer expresses optimism regarding the potential impact of Vision Golfe 2024: “We expect this conference to serve as a springboard for new partnerships and innovations, affecting both the economic landscape and the preservation of global cultural heritage.” These national missions in the Gulf are crucial for fostering cultural innovation and enhancing cultural tourism, thus opening new avenues for artistic exchanges and economic development. Vision Golfe 2024 is shaping up to be an essential gathering for stakeholders in the realms of economy, culture, and the advancement of arts and sciences.",
