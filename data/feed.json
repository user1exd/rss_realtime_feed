        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

The match getting by far the most attention — Rafael Nadal vs. Alexander Zverev — will be third in Court Philippe Chatrier. That means it should start at around 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT; 9:30 a.m. EDT). That will be preceded by No. 8 Ons Jabeur against Sachia Vickery, which starts play in the main stadium at noon (1000 GMT; 6 a.m. EDT), and the second match there, with Iga Swiatek against Leolia Jeanjean. Another match that could generate interest will be Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who is coming off a hip injury, against Chris Eubanks, a big-serving American who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year. That starts the day in Court Suzanne Lenglen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT; 5 a.m. EDT). What Happened on Sunday? Two-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz pronounced his recently injured forearm “fully recovered,” even if it still is “feeling weird,” after overwhelming J.J. Wolf 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. “It's still in my mind, but I didn’t feel anything after the match ... which is really, really good for me.” Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka won a match at a major for the first time in more than two years by defeating Lucia Bronzetti 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to advance to what could be a second-round showdown against Swiatek. Other players moving into the second round included Caroline Garcia of France, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, No. 30 Dayana Yastremska and Donna Vekic in the women's draw, and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men's. No. 17 seed Ugo Humbert was eliminated by Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.

How to Watch the French Open on TV — In the U.S.: Tennis Channel, NBC, Peacock. — Other countries are listed here . Betting Guide Nadal is usually favored to win the championship at the French Open — he has 14, after all — but BetMGM Sportsbook has him as the underdog in the first round against No. 4 seed Zverev on Monday. Zverev is a -350 money-line favorite against Nadal, who is listed at +260 for that match. Nadal is just 7-4 this year and missed nearly all of last year while dealing with injuries; that is why he is unseeded and so could have been drawn to face anyone to begin the tournament. Zverev was a semifinalist in Paris each of the past three years and is coming off a clay-court title at the Italian Open this month. Swiatek is a big favorite to win the title (-155), so it makes sense that she is listed at -10000 against Jeanjean, who has +1600 money-line odds for their match.

        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

        "description": "Former South African President Jacob Zuma is the wild card in Wednesday’s election for Africa’s most advanced country. He leads a new political party that's draining support from the ruling African National Congress that he once said would rule until...",
        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died.

Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "An Egyptian soldier was killed during a clash with Israeli troops at a Gaza border crossing on Monday while an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 40 Palestinians at a camp for displaced people, further inflaming regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Egypt’s military confirmed that a border guard died at the Rafah border crossing on Monday, in bloodshed that threatened to escalate tensions with Israel. Separately, the airstrike at the camp northwest of the Gazan city of Rafah drew international condemnation. Israel acknowledged the death of dozens of people in the strike, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “a tragic mistake” in an address to the Knesset. Israeli leaders said they were still investigating both incidents. In the border clash, the Israel Defense Forces said “a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border,” and that discussions with Egypt were ongoing, without giving any more detail. Israel said the airstrike late Sunday at a Rafah tent community was based on “precise intelligence” and that it killed two “senior” officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union. But governments across the world were quick to condemn Israel for the strike. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged,” while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified.” The White House said in a statement that images of innocent civilians killed in the strike were “heartbreaking.” “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” the National Security Council said in a statement. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Israeli troops started operations around the outskirts of Rafah, which lies in southern Gaza, early this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will attack the city because it’s the last bastion of Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group, and several thousand of its fighters are lodged there. The U.S. and other countries fear mass casualties among the Palestinian civilians in Rafah and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail an assault to prevent harm to innocents. The White House said Monday it was “actively engaging” with the IDF and partners in the region to better assess what had occured. The U.S. and others have also voiced concerns about an Israeli attack on Rafah worsening ties with Egypt. The two Middle Eastern countries signed a peace deal in 1979, which is seen as crucial to Israel’s security. Egypt has been highly vocal of the war in Gaza and consistently called on Israel to agree to a cease-fire. The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. Israel’s counterattack has killed some 35,000 Gazans, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. (With assistance from Justin Sink.) ©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

        "content": "NEW YORK -- While has remained one of the most productive hitters in the majors this season, he continues making progress in his recovery to getting back on the mound after Tommy John surgery. The superstar said he started throwing from 60 feet last week and reached 80 mph. \"Just progressively increasing the distance,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter Monday before the Dodgers' series opener against the was postponed. \"Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance. Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I'm not quite sure how far I'm going to go out there, but that's the progression.\" Ohtani underwent the elbow surgery last September as a member of the after going 10-5 with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts in 132 innings across 23 starts. He is limited to only hitting this season and is on pace to post the best offensive year of his major league career. Ohtani, 29, entered Monday leading the majors in batting average (.336) and total bases (131) in 53 games as the Dodgers' designated hitter. He was tops in the National League in slugging percentage (.621), OPS (1.024) and OPS+ (188). Ohtani has recently played through a hamstring contusion he suffered when he was hit by a pickoff throw last week. He has remained in the lineup, but Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters over the weekend that he was advised to not push the hamstring. Ohtani said the injury has affected his running but not his swing. \"It's getting better day by day,\" he said. \"Today is definitely a lot better than yesterday.\"",

        "description": "The Yankees rotation without Gerrit Cole is now on the offensive during a dominant stretch that has played a key role in the club’s recent surge.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM, Calif. — So much for just holding down the fort. The Yankees rotation without Gerrit Cole is now on the offensive during a dominant stretch that has played a key role in the club’s recent surge. Yankees starters have gone 14 straight games in which they have thrown at least five innings and allowed two or fewer runs, tying the MLB record since 1893, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Nestor Cortes will get the ball on Tuesday against the Angels and try to make it 15, which would surpass the 2022 Mets, 1968 Pirates and 1907 Phillies. “It’s been nice, each guy’s been building on the last one,” pitching coach Matt Blake said Sunday before Clarke Schmidt took a shutout into the sixth inning in what became a 5-2 loss to the Padres . “I feel like they’ve got a nice rapport going as a group and they’re all committed to helping each other. The conversations are good. It just feels like they’ve gotten into a good rhythm and each one’s building off the last.” The Yankees entered Monday’s off day with the second-lowest starter ERA in the majors at 2.72. The only rotation that had been better at preventing runs was the Phillies (2.69), who were also the only team that had won more games than the Yankees. But the group of Cortes, Luis Gil, Carlos Rodon, Marcus Stroman and Schmidt have taken their starts to another level of late, with 18 of their last 21 starts going for at least five innings and allowing two or fewer runs. “It’s been really all year,” manager Aaron Boone said. “It’s like virtually every day they’ve given us an opportunity to win a game. But what we’ve seen over the last couple weeks and now this turn in the rotation, they’ve been remarkable. Ultimately it starts on the bump and starts with that starting pitcher. They’re the reason — it starts with them — why we’ve been off to this kind of start.” During this 14-game stretch alone, the Yankees rotation has posted a 0.84 ERA with 84 strikeouts and 24 walks across 85 2⁄3 innings. In eight of those outings, the starter has not allowed an earned run. The Yankees are 11-3 during that span. “I think we’re all just a bunch of starters who know we can be elite in this game,” Stroman said. “The flow of information, the pitching coaches and the staff, everything’s so dialed in here. I think we all feel really confident when we go out there each and every start.” Sign up for Inside the Yankees by Greg Joyce, exclusively on Sports+. Please provide a valid email address.

Of course, it doesn’t hurt when the Yankees offense has been rolling the way it has lately, usually giving its pitchers an early lead to work with. “Really, the stretch we’ve been on with those guys [the starters], we’ve just been riding their high,” Alex Verdugo said. “They’re out there dominating, getting us in the dugout to hit that much quicker.” But what makes the run the starters are on even more impressive is that they are doing it without the reigning AL Cy Young winner throwing a pitch — though Cole has played a role in this as an extra pitching coach in the dugout, bullpen sessions and clubhouse. Cole is making good progress in his return from the elbow nerve inflammation that shut him down in March, as he is expected to face hitters again this week (likely on Thursday) before potentially starting a rehab assignment on June 4. That puts him on track to return possibly by the end of June or beginning of July if all goes well. In the meantime, the current five starters have put their heads down, stayed healthy and given the Yankees a chance to win on just about every night. “It’s almost like they all kind of sensed that we’ve got to step up with Cole not there and they’ve all risen to the occasion,” Blake said. “I think they’re just every day putting one step forward and not worrying about when Cole is going to be back and what that even indicates for any of them. Just keep doing their job on a nightly basis throwing up zeroes an inning at a time.”",

United overcame favourites City 2-1 at Wembley , with Ten Hag putting uncertainty over his future behind him to guide his team to a famous win. Following the game, Ten Hag insisted in his press conference that United were exactly where he wanted them to be, but Ladyman pushed back on this after the Red Devils recorded their worst-ever Premier League finish this season. Ladyman suggested the Dutchman should have been able to get more out of his players despite a high number of injuries, but Ten Hag refused to accept this, arguing that Ladyman must have 'no knowledge' of the game if he held this view. Reacting to Ten Hag's terse response, Sutton told Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off podcast that it was nothing more than a 'cheap shot' from the United manager, and insisted Ladyman had every right to pull him up on his disappointing campaign at Old Trafford.

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Lewis Browning Published: 20:00, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 20:02, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments The curtain came down on another Premier League season last weekend, and it was once again one that will last long in the memory. Though most of the league's outcomes were already decided going into the final weekend, the title race went down to the wire as Pep Guardiola and Manchester City made history. The champions became the first side ever to win the Premier League title for a fourth consecutive season, pipping Arsenal to success, largely in thanks to a final day win over West Ham at the Etihad. Throughout the season, the 20 teams and hundreds of players battled it out to earn success for their sides, causing plenty of drama, excitement, and unexpected thrills. Throughout every gameweek, Mail Sport provided a Power Rankings list that judged the best 10 players in the Premier League and, here, we've tallied it up to find out the outright winner. Manchester City made history in winning their fourth-consecutive Premier League title They were crowned champions again on the final day of another eventful top-flight campaign LAST WEEK'S TOP 10 RANKINGS 10.

William Saliba, James Ward-Prowse , Trent Alexander-Arnold (43 points) Read More Arsenal miss out on Premier League title but this is no false dawn... Mikel Arteta's side will be challenging for major honours for years to come, writes SAMI MOKBEL Though no trophy came his or Arsenal's way, it was a season of success for William Saliba, who played every minute of the Premier League campaign for the Gunners on the back of last season's injury woes. The defender has instated himself as one of the best in the league in his position, and was the core of the division's best defence, helping secure 18 league clean sheets and concede just 29 goals. James Ward-Prowse, meanwhile, started well for West Ham, before his form dipped and he found himself battling just to get in the Hammers' team. He picked up just two Power Rankings points after gameweek seven. On the other hand, Trent Alexander-Arnold, meanwhile, started slowly before excelling in a hybrid midfield role. He struggled with injuries and wasn't at his usual best, but incoming manager Arne Slot may help him return to the form that had him regarded as one of the world's best. William Saliba played every game for Arsenal as they took the title race down to the final day James Ward-Prowse (L) had a mixed season in his first year with West Ham, while Trent Alexander-Arnold (R) enjoyed spells in midfield 9. Alexander Isak (61 points) Alexander Isak didn't really break through in Power Rankings until the season run-in, which saw him score 11 Premier League goals in the final 12 matches of the campaign. It wasn't the perfect year for Eddie Howe's men, but Isak was certainly a bright spark and has established himself as one of the best around in his position. The Magpies may face a battle to keep him next season, with the likes of Arsenal said to be circling, but any consideration of an exit would demand a hefty fee due to his form, age and the four years still remaining on his current deal. Due to Manchester United's FA Cup win, Newcastle won't be competing in Europe next season, which may provide the opportunity for Isak to excel even further in league action. Alexander Isak hit the ground running towards the end of the season, scoring goals for fun 8. Declan Rice (74 points) Signing of the season? Maybe. Arsenal won the race to secure Declan Rice's signature last summer when it became clear he would be leaving West Ham, paying a stern £105million for his services. The England star has repaid every penny, though, and almost proved he was the missing piece the Gunners needed to win the Premier League title. Whether he played in defensive midfield or a bit further forward, Rice proved reliable as ever every week (apart from the one time he booted Ben Davies in the north London derby). Like Saliba, Rice played every Premier League game for the Gunners, scoring seven times and notching nine assists. It's possible Arsenal will sign another defensive midfielder in the summer so he can kick on further. Declan Rice has proven a raging success since his £105m move to Arsenal from West Ham 7. Ollie Watkins (76 points) A breakthrough season of sorts for Ollie Watkins has almost definitely earned him a place on the plane for the European Championships with England this summer. He scored 27 goals in all competitions for Aston Villa, playing the role of talisman as his side secured Champions League qualification under Unai Emery, who seems to have unlocked Watkins. Though goals are the name of the game - 19 of them in the Premier League without taking penalties - the 28-year-old picked up the Playmaker award for his 13 league assists. Not bad at all. His reward will be a major international championships and a run in the Champions League. Ollie Watkins had the most successful season of his career, helping Aston Villa back to the Champions League 6. Cole Palmer (86 points) Finishing sixth in Mail Sport's Power Rankings is pretty cold. Leaving your boyhood club for £42.5m, scoring 27 goals in your first season and picking up the Young Player of the Year award is also pretty cold. Now-ex-Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino was forced to deny his side were not 'Cole Palmer FC' during the campaign, but he was by far and away the Blues' best player . He had 42 goal involvements from Chelsea's 77 goals scored and Pochettino truly got the best out of him. Palmer too will be on the plane to the Euros, and his job next season will be to ensure he can replicate the form under a different manager . Beaten to the Golden Boot only by Erling Haaland, it would be a shock if he didn't. Cole Palmer's gamble in leaving Manchester City for Chelsea last year paid off in a major way 5. Phil Foden (88 points) Perhaps the biggest surprise on this list is that Foden is so far down. Winning the Premier League Player of the Year award , he enjoyed the best individual season of his career. Though it reaped just the one trophy in the form of the Premier League, he netted 27 goals as he became City's key and go-to man, finding a home as a wide player drifting centrally. At 23, he already has six Premier League titles to his name and he will likely add many more. Over to you, Gareth Southgate... Phil Foden enjoyed the most successful personal season of his career as he lifted his sixth Premier League title 4. Son Heung-min (90 points) The season was always going to be tough for Tottenham, not only with Harry Kane leaving, meaning there were a fair few goals that needed replacing, but also Hugo Lloris. Two big dressing room voices were no more, by Son Heung-min stepped up as the new club captain to help steer the transition in squad and management. He enjoyed spells both up front and out wide under Ange Postecoglou as the Australian looked to implement a more attacking style of play and, though his form dipped towards the end of the season, his presence was vital. His miss against Manchester City in the penultimate game of the season will live long in the memory of some more than others, but the 31-year-old remains one of the most devastating finishers in the league. The need for adaptation in his game remains, but Son will once again be vital for Spurs next season as they look to go one further and qualify for the Champions League. It was a year of transition for Tottenham, but they were able to rely on Son Heung-min 3. Bukayo Saka (93 points) It was a season of what could have been for Arsenal as a whole, but for Bukayo Saka it was once again business as usual. It is easy to forget he's still only 22. It feels as though he has ben around forever and seems to be the only attacker that is rarely rested or rotated. There were a couple of occasions in the season when that caught up with him - he missed the final game through injury - but it seems Mikel Arteta is leaning how to manage his workload more efficiently. Still Arsenal's key man, still important to England, he will just want to start adding those trophies to his cabinet now. Arsenal didn't win the league, but Bukayo Saka had another successful year for the Gunners 2. Erling Haaland (119 points) Last season's Power Rankings winner can only manage second on this occasion. It was another Golden Boot and Premier League title for Erling Haaland, but he faced criticism in what was a much tougher season than the last. Who could forget his infamous war of words with Roy Keane ? Or his injury-hit spell over Christmas, keeping him out the Club World Cup, that left Fantasy Premier League players reeling? Nonetheless, when he was available, Haaland was more often than not as ruthless as ever, netting 38 goals in 45 appearances. Missing out on top spot by only nine points, he surely would have retained his crown had it not been for injury. Erling Haaland won the Golden Boot and Premier League once again with Manchester City Liverpool's Mohamed Salah takes Mail Sport's Power Rankings crown for the 2023-23 season 1. Mohamed Salah (128 points) The Egyptian King is the Mail Sport Power Rankings king for the 2023-24 season. He didn't feature in the top 10 in the last seven weeks of the season, but his earlier work was enough for Mohamed Salah to cling onto top spot, having spent four weeks at the top throughout the campaign. Post-African Cup of Nations life was tough, as it often has been, but a return of 25 goals and 14 assists in all competitions is no mean feat. Unfortunately he was unable to steer Liverpool to a goodbye Premier League title under Jurgen Klopp, and his future remains unclear , but, for now, he can celebrate another successful personal year in Red.

        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": ": The Andhra Pradesh High Court has reserved its verdict for Tuesday on Macherla MLA Pinnellii Ramakrishna Reddy’s plea for anticipatory bail. A single judge bench headed by Justice Venkata Jyothirmai Pratapa held the hearing here on Monday on an implead- petition filed by advocate Posani Venkateswarlu on behalf of petitioners/complainants Namburi Seshagiri Rao and Cherukuri Siromani. He argued that the legislator’s criminal history must be taken into consideration and allowing the accused to enter the counting centre on the counting would not be good. If the legislator was granted anticipatory bail, he would threaten the witnesses and even tamper with the evidence, the court was told on behalf of the petitioners. Public prosecutor for the police argued that there was a chance the legislator would resort to violence at the time of counting of votes as he broke the EVMs on the day of polling. The legislator was involved in nine cases and even flouted the court directions and evaded the police vigil, the court heard. He added, “The police filed a memo in the court at 8pm on May 23, stating that the legislator was an accused in the attack on CI Narayana Swamy.” Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy’s counsel Niranjan Reddy submitted to the court that his client was supposed to appoint agents for counting of votes on June 4 and sought temporary relief from his arrest. He argued that though the HC had given protection to the legislator from arrest in a case of breaking the EVMs, the police subsequently booked several cases against him “in order to arrest him.” He urged the court to give an interim order providing the legislator protection from the arrest up to June 6. After hearing both the parties, the court decided to deliver its order on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology could offer companionship to lonely people amid an international epidemic of loneliness, says a robotics expert. Tony Prescott, a professor of cognitive robotics at the University of Sheffield, argues in his new book \" The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence \" that \"relationships with AIs could support people\" with forms of social interaction. Loneliness has been found to seriously impair human health , and Professor Prescott makes a case that advances in AI technology could offer a partial solution. He argues that people can spiral into loneliness, becoming increasingly disconnected as their confidence plummets, and that AI might help people to \"break the cycle\" by giving them a way to practice and improve their social skills. Loneliness—or social disconnection—is more harmful to human health than obesity, according to a 2023 report . A 2015 study showed it can increase the risk of premature death by 26% and is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, depression and anxiety. The extent of the problem is striking: In the U.K. 3.8 million people are experiencing chronic loneliness. A Harvard study in the U.S. found that 36% of US adults—and 61% of young adults—experience serious loneliness. Professor Prescott says, \"In an age when many people describe their lives as lonely, there may be value in having AI companionship as a form of reciprocal social interaction that is stimulating and personalized. Human loneliness is often characterized by a downward spiral in which isolation leads to lower self-esteem , which discourages further interaction with people. \"There may be ways in which AI companionship could help break this cycle by scaffolding feelings of self-worth and helping maintain or improve social skills. If so, relationships with AIs could support people to find companionship with both human and artificial others.\" He does suggest this is not without risk, however, as it could be \"designed to encourage users to interact for longer and longer periods and to keep them coming back,\" and suggests regulation may be needed. Prescott is a leading expert on the relationship between the human brain and AI, combining expertise in robotics and AI with psychology and philosophy. He contributes to the scientific understanding of the human condition by researching the re-creation of perception, memory, and emotion in synthetic entities. As well as researching and teaching cognitive robotics at the University of Sheffield, Prescott is also the co-founder of Sheffield Robotics, which is a hub for robotics research . In \"The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence,\" Prescott explores the nature of the human mind and its cognitive processes and compares and contrasts this with the way AI is developing. The book explores questions including: He concludes, \"As psychology and AI proceed, this partnership should unlock further insights into both natural and artificial intelligence . This could help answer some key questions about what it means to be human and for humans to live alongside AI.\" More information: Tony Prescott, The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence (2024).

        "content": "Revealed: American TV presenter whose flirty interview with Rory McIlroy sent tongues wagging gushed over football coach husband in engagement announcement two years ago READ Rory McIlroy and sports journalist Amanda Balionis spark romance rumors By Alison Boshoff and Daniel Bates Published: 19:43 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 20:08 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail 14 View comments Almost exactly two years ago, rising TV star Amanda Balionis could not possibly have looked any happier. Showing off an impressive diamond engagement ring, and with her arms wrapped around her long time boyfriend, she wrote: 'Hey @BrynRenner. Forever sounds kinda perfect.' She and Renner, a sports star turned football coach, had a beautiful beach wedding on December 3, 2022 in La Jolla – San Diego's 'jewel by the sea.' At the lavish wedding they posed in front of a neon sign reading 'The Renners' and the bride and groom wore matching Nike hi-top sneakers in the colours of his football team. She even used their hashtag 'Go Heels' in honour of her groom. Spool forward 14 months, though, and quite surprisingly given those recent romantic declarations her wedding ring was off. Her hyphenated family name – 'Balionis-Renner' – was also no longer being used. Plain Amanda Balionis went on a girls trip to Las Vegas and then two skiing trips in quick succession, again in an all-girls gaggle both times. Almost exactly two years ago, rising TV star Amanda Balionis could not possibly have looked any happier in her engagement photo Rory McIlroy and CBS reporter Amanda Balionis are pictured together And then on May 12, beneath an Instagram picture of her interviewing golf superstar Rory McIlroy on CBS, a friend, Camille Stroud, wrote: 'You two' alongside a heart emoji. It was at this point, that suspicions started to take root about just what was going on between sparkly Balionis, who has worked across CBS' golf input since 2017, and the just-divorcing Rory McIlroy, a £225 million sportsman. He announced on Monday May 13, quite unexpectedly, that his seven year marriage to pretty Erica Stoll had irretrievably broken down. They have a three-year-old daughter, Poppy. But it seems that while he and Stoll were on the outs – while he and Amanda Balionis were apparently drawing ever closer. So who is the woman who has caught Rory's eye? Balionis is the daughter of Tony, who died in 2019, and Dana, both avid golf players. She used to take her father on in putting games – playing for quarters. Mother Dana told Fore magazine a year ago: 'She'd say, 'I like it, but volleyball is more exciting. She was just so active. Golf was never active enough for her.' She added: 'She's never loved golf more than she does now.' She made her debut for CBS Sports show The 19th Hole at the 2017 Genesis Open at Riviera CC, and now she does interviews and analysis at all of the tour events for the network. She has also done NFL and college football sideline reporting, and was CBS's first-ever social media reporter for the Superbowl. The flirty banter was evident during the Wells Fargo Championship on Mother's Day, May 12 She has a degree in broadcasting from Hofstra University in New York and worked her way up to the big leagues by covering high school sports on digital platforms and on cable. Her big break came when she was working in the media department of the sporting goods manufacturers Callaway and was asked to present a slot on CBS. She said: 'The nerves were insane, but there was also this feeling that I had worked so hard for this. I had kind of given up on the dream, and I thought, 'I'm going to be live on CBS for at least one time, so, technically, I achieved my dream.' The chairman of CBS Sports Sean McManus believes she is a breath of fresh air who adds a 'different perspective.' He went on: 'She has a lot of credibility with golfers, and they respond well to her.' Read More EXCLUSIVE Rory McIlroy and CBS sports journalist Amanda Balionis spark romance rumors in wake of his divorce from wife Erica Stoll with flirty TV interviews after married reporter ditches her ring The job is to interview live without a prompter or notes, and to strike a friendly enough tone to put the golf stars at their ease. A source at CBS who knows Amanda well said: 'Amanda has always wanted to be on television. It's her dream. She's very likeable but one of the most ambitious people I've met. I've known her for a long time. She won't mind having her name linked to the story because of the profile it's giving her. I know she'll be loving it. I don't mean that cruelly. She's a nice girl, but she's ambitious. This will give her a leg up.' The source added: 'Before all this, I wouldn't have said they were any closer than she is with other players. She's got a flirty nature, which works well on television. She has chats with the players. I guess she and Rory get on well, but I don't know whether they're in a relationship or not.' Her mum Dana told Fore: 'It's really been amazing. Just all of the twists and turns to get to where she is. It's been one crazy thing after another. The stars just kept lining up.' In April this year, two months after Balionis apparently split from her husband, McIlroy took time out of his busy schedule to film a short video supporting Puppies & Golf, the non-profit founded by Balionis in 2020 and aimed at advocating for rescue dogs, rehousing and in some instances retraining them as support animals for veterans. Then on Sunday May 12th, the two seemed warmly at ease in each other's company, even flirtatious. Balionis asked him in a TV interview: 'What gear did you have to find to assert your dominance once more over Quail Hollow?' Later, she asked him to tell her: 'Physically how good your game feels.' It was an account on Twitter which first made explicit the inference of coupledom hinted at by Balionis' pal Camille Stroud. On May 16th a post ran: 'So Rory was possibly getting with Amanda Balionis from CBS. It's a rumour I heard from the divorce. That would be a spicy meatball if true. I like both of them. Maybe I made it up.' This was followed the next day by a blind item on the gossip site DeuxMoi which then started circulating widely on Twitter including via the anonymous' LIV insider' account. The anonymous DeuxMoi item said that the golfer had been spotted: 'all around San Diego. More specifically...the Crown Point neighborhood of Pacific Beach.'The neighborhood, more than 2,500 miles from McIlroy's home in Jupiter, Florida, is where Balionis lives in a two-bed home she bought for $789,000 in 2020. According to the source: 'My sister was at a restaurant, and he came in to pick up a 'to go' and used the name 'Amanda' as the pick-up. He paid cash – only a few people noticed him, and he was out!' Initially, people couldn't quite believe that it was true. However as time passes, without any comment from McIlroy's management or Ms Balionis' flack at 42 West, the rumours have started to be treated as fact. McIlroy, pictured with his now estranged wife Erica Stoll at the Rider Cup in September, recently announced he has filed divorce after seven years of marriage It would be normal for untrue reports to be denied. This week Dottie Pepper, a pro golfer who now works alongside Balionis covering the sport, said: 'No! Absolutely not! No!' when asked if she had any comment on her colleague being an item with Rory McIlroy. Darren Heitner, a lawyer who plays golf with Balionis estranged husband Bryn Renner similarly declined to comment rather than issue any denial. One senior source on the golf tour says: 'It was totally news to the TV crowd if it has been going on. Her co workers are as surprised as anyone else. Clearly they have kept it extremely discreet.' He added: 'It's not one of those affairs where everyone knows about it and you are just waiting for it to come out. 'The first anyone was really aware was from a Tweet. It was from an anonymous source so nobody really was sure how much notice to pay to it, but then it got bigger and bigger online until it came out as a story in the end. 'That's not to say that nothing was going on, but just that this was no Tiger Woods type situation. Everyone was actually quite surprised that the marriage had broken down in the first place. He is not one of the golfers who has a reputation for womanising at all.' You might think that's a curious thing to say as McIlroy famously broke tennis player Caroline Wozniaki's heart when he dumped her just after she had sent out wedding invitations. Balionis was last pictured wearing her wedding ring on Instagram in early February He also had a high profile romance with model Nadia Forde, and was linked even to Meghan Markle, pre Prince Harry. But in the context of the bunkers and bunk ups world of international golf, that makes him pretty much one of the innocents. Take Tiger Woods. The golfer reportedly confessed to sleeping with 120 women during his marriage to former nanny Elin Nordgren. Apparently she only decided that she was going to leave him almost a year after the first scandal erupted ...when the daughter of their neighbours was named as his 15th mistress. A veteran writer said: 'I could name you three players who have been the best players in the world who had that exactly the same lifestyle, the same numbers and everything as Tiger Woods. Actually, two of them used to compete with each other to see how many women they could sleep with. It's nothing new in golf. They are young rich good looking and on the road for months, and many of the golf wives just turn a blind eye.' As the late golf commentator Peter Alliss sardonically put it: 'Tiger failed the eleventh commandment 'Thou shalt not be found out'. During golf tournaments, there is a lively social scene. The players and their entourages can be found in hotel bars or local restaurants as the tour moves internationally. Organisations like the PGA habitually employ pretty young golf fans to do administrative roles. Sponsors similarly send teams of attractive women who orbit the players. Some wives insist on coming with their husbands so that they can keep an eye on what goes on at the bar, but often once there are children who need to be in school, this falls away – meaning that the husbands spend most of the year separated from their wives and families. No wonder that the sport is such a matrimonial graveyard. Rory McIlroy met New York born wife Erica Stoll through the game. He overslept during the 2012 Ryder Cup and nearly missed his tee time. Erica, who was working on PGA transportation, arranged a police escort to get him to the course in Medinah, Illinois, in time. They kept on bumping into each other as Stoll continued to work for the PGA and the couple started dating at the end of 2014, after his split from Wozniacki. They got engaged in Paris a year later and were married in 2017 at the 13th-century Ashford Castle in County Ma y o , with guests including actor Jamie Dornan, who grew up in the same town as McIlroy, One Direction's Niall Horan and Coldplay musician Chris Martin. Ed Sheeran and Stevie Wonder provided the entertainment. The celebrations were said to have cost £400,000. Home was a £7 million nine-bedroom, ten-bathroom mansion in Florida's exclusive Bear's Club gated community, founded by golf legend Jack Nicklaus, where basketball star Michael Jordan and tennis sisters Venus and Serena Williams are neighbours. There was also property in Wentworth, Surrey, the home of European golf, where he and Erica were said to have spent £10million on renovations. The thinking was that the family would take up full-time residence there when Poppy was ready for secondary school. Sadly, it has all fallen apart long before she reached that milestone. A source told US Weekly magazine said that Stoll felt 'lonely' in the marriage as they were effectively leading separate lives. The source said: 'She knew what she was getting into with his profession, but once they had Poppy, things really changed, and she had a new perspective. Erica was usually absent for most of his tournaments and was really focused on Poppy.' Another potential factor in the end of the marriage - other than the constant travelling and temptations – is McIlroy's role in the schism which split the game, when the Saudi-backed LIV golf set up as a rival to the PGA tour in 2022. McIlroy was the figurehead for the PGA, and strongly backed the tour. In the second series of the Netflix documentary Full Swing, filmed last summer, you see McIlroy sacrificing his own game in order to stand up for what he believes in. He muses on how 'off' his game is, confessing: ': 'I s**t myself with left pins. My technique isn't anywhere near where it used to be.' And he tells the documentary: 'It's all consuming. It's a full time job playing golf and having all the other stuff. You get fatigued. I had to ask myself a lot of questions. It's so difficult.' Just before the US Open he discovers that the warring sides have come to an agreement – and he didn't even know that the announcement was coming. 'Why did I waste 12 months of my life to fight for something that was always going to come back together again?' he says. There was widespread sympathy for Rory McIlroy on the circuit – and its no surprise that some of it came from Amanda Balionis. She tells the doc: 'It's so rare that PGA tour players take on the responsibility that we've seen Rory McIlroy take on. 'How can he be so invested into what's going on between LIV and the PGA Tour and go out there and beat the other 150 best players in the world? That's not a sustainable place to live of an already full plate and putting the PGA Tour on your back.' Did this sympathy blossom into love? Certainly there are signs that they started to become more closely aligned. Another source who is close to McIlroy said: 'No one will be surprised that Rory has someone else lined up. It's textbook behaviour. Look back at his love life. This isn't a guy who likes to be alone. The next conquest ALWAYS appears before the current one goes. I've known the guy a long time, and there is always an overlap. He added: 'I think he and Amanda are close, and there are lots of rumours circulating, but I've not seen them together. I tell you what, though, I wouldn't be surprised – she's his type. 'She's blonde which is his preference. I was very close to Rory when his relationship with Caroline ended, and we were telling him not to be rash. But he was desperate to move on once he'd made the decision. He'd decided he wanted someone who was homely and not dashing around all over the place at sports events. Now he's bored with homely and is bound to go for someone dashing around all over the place and going to sports events. It's funny, really. Caroline must be laughing her socks off.'

        "content": "White Sox manager Pedro Grifol didn’t back down. His players held their position, too. Grifol on Sunday said his team was ‘F—ing flat in a loss to the Orioles. On Monday, he was asked to revisit his take when told his players didn’t agree. “I’m doubling down on what I said yesterday,” Grifol said. “I thought we were flat. And that’s where I’m going to leave it. We have to make adjustments today, OK. And go out there and play the game as hard as we can.” The Sox took a 15-39 record into their Memorial Day game against the Blue Jays Monday, a history-making won-lost subjecting Grifol to critics even though injuries to Luis Robert Jr., Yoan Moncada and Eloy Jimenez have depleted his ranks. Those three comprised the core of a lineup that wasn’t expected to push the Sox out of 100-loss territory even if healthy. Grifol’s calling out players is a reversal of the second-year skipper’s normal tactics, though, especially when it comes to veteran players. This holiday weekend back-and-forth and the questions of player-manager dynamics is testing the sturdiness of the Sox’ on-field operation. Players say they’re unified. Grifol said there is unity between his office and the players’ room. “This is a close clubhouse,” second baseman Nicky Lopez said. “They have their opinions. I have mine,” Grifol said. \"[But] this is not divided by any means. This is not them against Pedro, Pedro against them. It’s just a situation. I thought we were flat. They didn’t think we were flat. It’s over.” After Korey Lee and Garrett Crochet echoed the prevailing feeling in the room, however – that the Sox ran into a buzzsaw in Orioles right-hander Kyle Brandish, who tossed seven innings of no-hit ball at them – Gavin Sheets and Lopez suggested it wasn’t completely over by saying the same thing. “I thought we ran into a pretty good pitcher yesterday with really good stuff,” Sheets said Monday. “[Orioles catcher James] McCann was like ‘he was as good as I’ve seen him.’ I thought we attacked. We had a game plan.” Grifol’s take did not go over well in the clubhouse. “I just know that I’ve been fortunate enough to be in this league for five years now, I’ve had four different managers and all of them are different,” Lopez said. “The way they handle things is obviously going to be different. “Obviously it’s been a tough year for all of us, so some people handle that differently, as players do, as managers do, as coaches do. I think that’s just one of the things. We’ve battling and grinding, busting our butt, and yesterday we didn’t have much going. He’s the manager, he’s entitled to do what he wants to do. It’s our job to go out there and play.” Grifol said he has extreme patience when it comes to development, improvement and adjustments, “but I don’t have any patience for not cherishing every single day you get to put on a major-league uniform. Zero.” Asked to be more precise about what he meant by flat, Grifol wouldn’t get into specifics. “Look, I’m not going to get into what flat looks like and it doesn’t look like,” he said. “Everybody who saw the game yesterday is going to have their own opinion. I had mine. Ok. That’s pretty simple. I’m done with the flat. I’m done with the energy. I’ve already addressed it. They’ve addressed it. I’m not going to continue to address that. “You can’t take days off. You can’t do it. Mentally and physically. “We’ve had games where we started off a little slow and then we just pick it up. I’m OK with that, because that’s part of the grind. And I’m OK with maybe an individual going through something and it takes him a little bit and then OK, we pick it up. But you’re playing one of the best teams in baseball [the Orioles], and you’ve got a guy on the mound that’s really damn good [Garrett Crochet] for us. And he’s giving us an opportunity to win. And it’s not about losing the game, it’s about doing whatever it takes to try to win the baseball game, energy-wise, and I didn’t feel we had it. That’s it.”",

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "When Balu Natarajan became the first Indian American champion of the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1985, a headline on an Associated Press article read, “Immigrants’ son wins National Spelling Bee,” with the first paragraph noting the champion “speaks his parents’ native Indian language at home.” Those details would hardly be newsworthy today after a quarter-century of Indian American spelling champs, most of them the offspring of parents who arrived in the United States on student or work visas. This year’s bee is scheduled to begin Tuesday at a convention center outside Washington and, as usual, many of the expected contenders are Indian American, including Shradha Rachamreddy, Aryan Khedkar, Bruhat Soma and Ishika Varipilli. Nearly 70% of Indian-born US residents arrived after 2000, according to census data, and that dovetails with the surge in Indian American spelling bee champions. There were two Indian American Scripps winners before 1999. Of the 34 since, 28 have been Indian American, including three straight years of Indian American co-champions and one year (2019) when eight champions were declared, seven of Indian ancestry. The experiences of first-generation Indian Americans and their spelling bee champion children illustrate the economic success and cultural impact of the nation’s second-largest immigrant group. As of 2022, there were 3.1 million Indian-born people living in the US, and Indian American households had a median income of $147,000, more than twice the median income of all US households, according to census data. Indian Americans also were more than twice as likely to have college degrees. Indians received 74% of the H-1B visas for specialised occupations approved in fiscal 2021, and a record total of nearly 269,000 students from India were enrolled at US colleges and universities in 2022-23, according to the Institute of International Education. Those numbers paint a picture of a high-achieving demographic that is well-suited for success in academic competitions. Ganesh Dasari, whose daughter and son each made multiple appearances at the Scripps bee, holds a doctorate in civil engineering from the University of Cambridge and was recruited to the US to work for ExxonMobil on an H-1B visa. He quickly obtained a green card. “Me and my wife, we came from a similar background. We both benefited from having the education ... so we put a lot of emphasis on educating our kids,” Dasari said. “We basically introduced them to anything academic, and a couple of sports, but clearly there was a bias in our thinking that education is a higher priority than sports.” In his 2016 address to Congress, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned “spelling bee champions” among his country’s contributions to the US while that year’s co-champs, Nihar Janga and Jairam Hathwar, watched from the gallery. Even among Indian American spellers, a particular subgroup is overrepresented: families from the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where Telugu is the primary language. Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, is India’s information-technology hub and the region supplies many H-1B visa recipients. “Whenever we go to the spelling bee events, everybody speaks that language,” Dasari said. “We realised there are so many people from the same state.” Deval Shah, the father of last year’s champion, Dev Shah, grew up in the northwestern state of Gujarat and proudly noted Dev was the first spelling bee champion of Gujarati descent. The parents of the 2022 winner, Harini Logan, are from Chennai in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Shah is an engineer, his wife is a physician, and both of Harini’s parents were trained as software engineers. Indian-born parents of kids with an affinity for spelling have a network of similar families to provide guidance and support, as well as access to organisations like the North South Foundation, which offers academic competitions aimed at the Indian diaspora. “The reason Indian American immigrants really dominate, the main reason is the North South Foundation,” Shah said. When Harini won her first NSF spelling competition, Ganesh Dasari was one of the judges, and “he was literally chasing us down” to tell them “Harini has tremendous potential to be on the national stage,” said Rampriya Logan, Harini’s mother. Ishika, a 13-year-old from Spring, Texas, who will be competing at Scripps this year for the third time, woke her parents at 6 am the day after she lost a third-grade classroom spelling bee, saying she wanted to participate in more bees. Her mother, an IT manager who immigrated to the US in 2006, then reached out to ask advice from other families from the Houston area whose children were high-level spellers. The relative wealth and stability of Indian American households could lead observers to conclude their children are benefiting primarily from a privileged upbringing. The truth is more nuanced, said Devesh Kapur, a professor of South Asian Studies at Johns Hopkins University and a co-author of The Other One Percent: Indians in America. “It is important to note that the children participating in the spelling bee competition come from striving middle-class immigrant families, often in occupations like IT, and not from wealthier Indian American households in finance or tech start-ups or consulting,” Kapur said. Natarajan, a Chicago-based physician and health care executive, now serves as the volunteer president of the NSF, and he experienced the spelling bee as a parent when his son, Atman Balakrishnan, competed. He said he sometimes feels out of place because he was born in the US and he admires the grit of Indian-born parents and their children. “It’s hard to describe, but it’s a very specific mindset that just drives effort and in many ways drives outcomes and sustainable success,” Natarajan said.",

        "content": "The National Information Technology Development Agency has vowed to implement its Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan 2.0, to transform Nigeria into a digital innovation powerhouse. The agency said on its X platform on Sunday that it held a 2-day retreat for top management staff to facilitate the implementation of the strategic roadmap. It noted that the primary objective of the retreat was to digitally empower Nigeria and promote inclusive economic growth, aligning with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda. The Director General of NTDA, Kashifu Inuwa, and top and middle management staff were in attendance, brainstorming innovative ideas to drive the country’s digital transformation. “This endeavour aligns with the agency’s overarching mission to spearhead Nigeria’s digital transformation agenda, which is closely tied to the eight priority areas outlined in President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda,” part of the statement read. According to the agency, its efforts are expected to have a positive impact on the country’s digital landscape, promoting economic growth and empowerment for all Nigerians. The NITDA Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan (SRAP 2021–2024) is a comprehensive strategy developed on seven key elements to drive digital transformation and innovation within the country. It focused on areas such as digitisation, capacity building, and the promotion of a digital economy. The SRAP 2021–2024 was designed to align with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for a Digital Nigeria, which includes pillars like developmental regulation, solid infrastructure, digital literacy, and the promotion of indigenous content. According to the NTDA, one of the primary goals of the plan is to achieve 95 per cent digital literacy by 2030 and to build the capacity of one million technology developers over the next eighteen months.",

        "content": "High-income earners have a 32% lower risk of dying after a stroke compared to low-income earners. The equivalent for high education is 26% lower risk. The differences in stroke survival linked to socioeconomics are striking, according to a study at the University of Gothenburg. The results will be presented on Wednesday at the European Stroke Conference ESOC 2024 in Basel, Switzerland. Katharina Stibrant Sunnerhagen, Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, and the lead researcher behind the study, will be present. The register-based study analyzed data from 6,901 stroke patients at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg. The aim was to investigate the influence of what are called social determinants of health on stroke survival. Four factors were in focus: place of residence, country of birth, education and income. Disadvantageous factors included living in an area classified by the authorities as a vulnerable area, risk area or particularly vulnerable area, being born outside Sweden or Europe, having a short education and low income. In addition to the association between income, education and stroke survival, the study shows a worrying trend in the combined effect of various factors. With one disadvantageous factor, the risk of death after a stroke was 18% higher, and with two to four disadvantageous factors it was 24% higher, compared with no disadvantageous factors. \"This shows the reality that an individual's socio-economic situation can be a matter of life and death within the context of stroke, especially when several disadvantageous factors come into play,\" says Sunnerhagen. The study also found an association between increased risk of death after stroke and additional risk factors such as physical inactivity, diabetes, alcohol abuse and atrial fibrillation. Clear gender differences also emerged when the characteristics of patients were studied. Among those with no disadvantageous social determinants of health, 41% were women, while women made up 59% of the group with two to four disadvantageous factors. In the latter group, smokers and former smokers were also overrepresented. \"The number of people suffering from stroke in Europe is expected to increase, making the need for effective interventions more important than ever. Targeted strategies are crucial, policy makers need to tailor legislation and consider specific circumstances and needs in different parts of society, while health care providers should consider identifying patients at higher risk of fatality from stroke,\" says Sunnerhagen. \"By addressing disparities, we will not only support the principles of health equity, but also have the opportunity to significantly improve overall public health,\" she concludes.

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May.

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left and dozens injured. Storms earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday. For more information on recent tornado reports, see The Associated Press . Schreiner reported from Louisville, Kentucky. Associated Press reporters Acacia Coronado in Austin, Texas, and Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.",

As the daughter of one of Hollywood's most famous former couples , Shiloh has lived much of her life in the spotlight, but her longtime choreographer has now spoken out to insist that the budding dancer could not be further from the stereotypical Hollywood ' nepo baby .' Shiloh, or 'Shi' to her friends and family, first wowed the world with her dance skills in 2021, when a video of her performing went viral. Now three years later - as the teenager celebrates her milestone birthday - her choreographer, Keelan Carter, has now revealed an exclusive glimpse into her life inside the dance studio. Despite boasting famous parents, dance pro Keelan tells DailyMail.com that Shiloh is determined to achieve her goals without relying on her famous name. 'Shiloh is an exceptionally talented dancer, demonstrating dedication and hard work,' the accomplished choreographer, actor and fashion designer continued. 'She is a sincere and straightforward person who never uses her celebrity status to her advantage.' Shiloh Jolie-Pitt turned 18 years old today and has become an 'exceptionally talented dancer,' her choreographer Keelan Carter (pictured together dancing) told DailyMail.com Shiloh (seen with mom Angelina Jolie, 48, on a red carpet in 2021) 'does not rely on her famous last name to achieve her goals,' Keelan - who goes by Lil Keelan Carter - said Read More Angelina Jolie is ordered to turn over every NDA she signed with a third party from 2014 to 2022 after she claimed she walked out of Miraval sale due to Brad Pitt's 'cruel' gag order 'Shi does not rely on her famous name to achieve her goals. Honestly, I didn't even know who she was at first and I don't think this matters, especially in a dance studio. 'I understand that it can be difficult to see the person beyond her celebrity status, but I urge you to make an effort for her. Believe me, it is worth it.' Keelan told DailyMail.com that his recent dance videos featuring Shiloh 'were made in the same way I post any dancer who comes to my sessions or classes and whom I believe deserves to be featured.' In a video shared to his Instagram account on Wednesday featuring Shiloh and three other dancers, Keelan wrote: 'Can't wait to be back in the studio with these talented people. 'In the last period of my life, LA feels like home and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to meet so many hardworking and wonderful people. I'm glad every time to have you next to me in the studio, so thank you guys.' In the clip, the four danced to the song Tanzania by Uncle Waffles and Tony Duardo featuring Sino Msolo and Boibizza. The routine was choreographed by Keelan. Shiloh wore sweats and an oversized tee as she showcased her swift moves with Keelan writing: 'Her movement is crazy. Thank you for your energy.' Keelan has posted numerous videos featuring Shiloh, as have several of her other dance class colleagues, but the famous daughter is rarely tagged in any of the videos, as they all respect her privacy, DailyMail.com was told. Although Angelina - who worked with the the UN Refugee Agency for more than two decades, visiting camps in Cambodia, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, and Pakistan with all of her kids in tow at times - has not commented specifically on Shiloh's dance, she has spoken out about fostering the unique talents of all of her children. Keelan - an accomplished choreographer, dancer, actor, and fashion designer - has shared several video of Shiloh on his social media pages Keelan (on the left dancing to a routine he choreographed) said, 'Honestly, I didn't even know who she was at first and I don't think this matters, especially in a dance studio' In a clip on Keelan's Instagram, Shiloh danced to the song Tanzania by Uncle Waffles and Tony Duardo featuring Sino Msolo and Boibizza 'I understand that it can be difficult to see the person beyond her celebrity status, but I urge you to make an effort for her,' Keelan said of Shiloh (showing off her moves in a recent clip) 'Children should be allowed to express themselves in whatever way they wish without anybody judging them because it is an important part of their growth,' she once said in an interview with Reuters . Shiloh's dad Brad gushed about his daughter's dance ability in a 2022 i nterview with Entertainment Tonight . While promoting his film Bullet Train, he called Shiloh 'very beautiful' and said that her talent 'brings a tear the eye.' 'I don't know where she got it from. I'm Mr. Two-Left-Feet here,' Brad, now 60, told ET at time. Shiloh's parents tied the knot in August 2014 during a secret ceremony in the south of France, and welcomed three children together during their romance - Shiloh in 2006, and twins Vivienne and Knox, now 15, in 2008. They also adopted two more kids - Zahara, now 18, and Pax, now 20 - and Brad also legally adopted son Maddox, now 22, who became part of Angelina's brood before they got together. But in 2016, it came to an explosive end after the pair got into an alleged physical altercation while on a private flight with their six kids. In 2022, Shiloh showed off her skills while dancing to Doja Cat's song Vegas in a video with her instructor, Hamilton Evans (seen here) 'Shiloh loves dancing. She's seriously talented and has been going to these classes for a few years now,' a source told Us Weekly about Shiloh (seen at Millennium Dance complex) Angelina claimed that Brad 'choked' one of the children during the horrifying dispute and 'struck' another in the face, leaving her and the kids feeling like 'hostages.' Brad's rep called Angelina's account 'completely untrue' to CNN at first, but then released an amended statement to the publication that read: 'Angelina's story continues to evolve each time she tells it. 'Brad has accepted responsibility for what he did but will not for things he didn't do. He has been on the receiving end of every type of personal attack and misrepresentation. 'Thankfully, the various public authorities she has tried to use against him over the past six years have made their own independent decisions. Brad will continue to respond in court as he has consistently done.' Despite all six kids growing up as Hollywood royalty, the Jolie-Pitt brood are all very unique. In a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair , Angelina said, 'Mad's a real intellectual, which I can take no credit for genetically. He's great at school, great at history. He feels like he could be a writer or travel the world and learn about places and things. 'Zahara's got an extraordinary voice and is just so elegant and well spoken. Shiloh's hysterically funny, one of the goofiest, most playful people you'll ever meet.' 'Knox and Viv are classic boy and girl. She's really female. And he's really a little dude,' the actress added. She continued: 'Shiloh dresses like a little dude. She likes to dress like a boy. She wants to be a boy. So we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boys' everything. She thinks she's one of the brothers.' The past several years have been incredibly transformative for Shiloh. In 2021, Shiloh ditched the tomboy look when she walked the red carpet with her mom and siblings for several international premieres of Angelina's Eternals film. Looking glamorous and donning designer dresses, Shiloh set the internet ablaze at the premieres in London, Rome and Los Angeles. Since then, Shiloh has opted for a constant casual look - often being spotted in hoodies and sweatpants. She has been photographed numerous times arriving to - and leaving - dance lessons. She has since cut her hair short into a short pixie cut. Shiloh's parents Brad and Angelina married in August 2014 after 10 years together, but Angelina filed for divorce in September 2016 (seen in 2006) Shiloh (second right) is pictured in 2021 with mom Angelina and siblings Maddox, Vivienne, Knox and Zahara. She he also has older brother, Pax, who did not attend the event In a 2022 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Brad (seen with his family two years before divorce) gushed about Shiloh's dancing skills and added: 'I don't know where she got it from' Shiloh's dance talent has been recognized since 2021 when a video of her dancing to Vegas by Rihanna was shared on YouTube by LA-based choreographer Hamilton Evans. She took center stage at Millennium Dance Complex in Studio City to perform an energetic one-minute routine while flanked by two other girls. Another video saw Shiloh busting her best moves to Lizzo's About Damn Time, while the rest of her dance troupe watched on from behind. 'Shiloh loves dancing. She's seriously talented and has been going to these classes for a few years now,' an insider told Us Weekly at the time. 'She's made some good friends through the dancing community too, and they're all in chat groups and share their favorite playlists and that type of stuff. 'The teachers are all very impressed with her and say the sky's the limit if she wants to take it to the next level, and Shiloh may just do that.' The source added: 'Brad and Angie are both very proud. They'd have no issue if she wants to turn pro, but they're not pushing it on her by any means.' Shiloh first made her acting debut in her father's 2008 hit film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. In 2016, the talented teen lent her voice to the character Shuai Shuai in Kung Fu Panda 3. Last week DailyMail.com revealed, Shiloh's mom Angelina was hit with another legal blow in her bitter battle with Brad over their Chateau Miraval estate. The Tomb Raider actress, 48, was ordered by a judge in LA Superior Court to produce every NDA agreement that she signed with a third-party over an eight-year period from 2014 - the year they married - to 2022. Documents detailing the judge's decision were made public as part of the ongoing 'War of the Roses,' with the A-list couple stuck in an acrimonious battle over her rights to sell their French vineyard and home.

        "content": "Israeli and Egyptian forces have exchanged fire near Rafah amid growing tensions between the two sides over the Tel Aviv regime’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip. Citing military sources, Israeli media said Egyptian troops fired at Israeli soldiers who returned fire. An Egyptian soldier was killed in the exchange of fire. The Egyptian Armed Forces said they are conducting an investigation into the shooting. Daily News Egypt, an independent English-language Egyptian newspaper, cited unnamed sources as saying Egyptian soldiers were \"affected\" by the Rafah massacre on Sunday. Israeli forces seized the Rafah border crossing earlier this month as they launched an offensive in Rafah. The occupation of the crossing has increased tensions between Egypt and Israel, threatening a peace treaty between the two sides, which had previously fought four wars.",

        "content": "The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) minister, Barrister Nyesom Wike, took a final lap of inspection of the facilities of the Abuja light rail project on Monday evening, preparatory to President Tinubu’s flag-off of commercial activities to mark his one year in office. It would be recalled that Wike, in an earlier inspection of the rail project, observed some minor things he said needed to be corrected. Speaking after the inspection, Wike said, “We are good to go; for the president, it’s a promise made and a promise kept. First of all, we are very happy that all our efforts have come to fruition. It’s no longer a story, but a reality.” However, he protested that he shouldn’t rate himself when asked about Tinubu’s performance in one year. He said one year is too short for any meaningful contribution, but he narrated the achievements so far. “So you are asking me to rate myself, however, if you say so. You can see that Mr President has done very well, not only in physical infrastructure but also in human capital development. “Nothing in this world is better than a career prospect. I am sure the civil servants in the FCT are very happy that their hopes have been rekindled. Their hopes have been restored. “Mr President has done very well. He is reassuring Nigerians that he is committed to delivering the dividends of democracy. “There are so many areas of attention; one year is really not enough for you to expect 100 per cent, but what you’ve seen on the ground shows there is hope for Nigerians.” With the dressed rehearsal on Monday, all is set and prepared for Mr President to take a ride on the Abuja light rail billed for Wednesday.

        "content": "The crazed firebug who allegedly torched a straphanger on a subway train over the weekend gave a vacant grimace in Manhattan court Monday as a judge set his bail at $250,000 — and prosecutors revealed he’s an ex-con with a lengthy rap sheet. Nile Taylor, 49 — who’s accused of tossing a flaming can of alcohol at Petrit Alijaj, 23, Saturday — has previously done prison time for gun and forgery busts, prosecutors said in Manhattan Criminal Court. Evidence in the case of his latest fiery attack is overwhelming, assistant District Attorney Aryan Ahmadian said. “This is a strong case,” Ahmadian told Judge Cori Weston. “The defendant was arrested shortly after the incident on Saturday afternoon, and he was in possession of multiple lighters, a bottle containing rubbing alcohol.” During the wild assault , Taylor allegedly set the floor of a No. 1 train ablaze when he tossed the flaming liquid at Alijaj — leaving him with severe burns on his face and chest, authorities said. Wearing a gray sweatshirt and sneakers, Taylor didn’t say a word as Weston set his bail. He stared straight ahead blankly and, at times, down at the floor during the brief hearing. “Considering the defendant’s activities and history of charges here, his criminal-conviction history... I’m going to set what the people asked, which is $250,000 cash,” Weston said. Taylor was previously convicted of criminal possession of a loaded firearm and forgery and was sentenced to two more than years in state prison, Ahmadian said. In a separate case, Taylor was allegedly captured on surveillance camera footage hurling two cans of flammable liquid at a group of people at the West 28th Street subway on Feb. 5. Taylor allegedly “identified himself” in the video footage and the police investigation is ongoing, Ahmadian said. Sign up for our Metro Daily newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Alijaj and his fiancee were riding a No. 1 train at the West Houston and Varick streets station at 2:45 p.m. Saturday when Taylor allegedly chucked the flaming liquid at him, setting his shirt on fire and burning up to 30% of his body. The victim later told The Post that he used his body to block his fiance from the flames. In total, Taylor was hit with two assault charges and a menacing charge in the subway fire attack case. “Without warning...[He] attacked two strangers inside of that subway train by throwing the burning liquid onto them,” Ahmadian said in court Monday. “Burning liquid lands on the floor of the subway station, causing the floor of the subway station to catch on fire.” He was also arraigned on a petit larceny charge for allegedly stealing an iPhone inside of the subway station. Taylor’s lawyer, Gretchen Resser, was silent in court aside from asking the judge about the date of the next hearing. She didn’t return The Post’s request for comment Monday. Taylor is due back in court on May 31.",

        "content": "The net is finally closing in on Lauren Bolton ’s ( Cait Fitton ) killer, as Nathan Curtis ( Christopher Harper ) was arrested in Coronation Street. The vile paedophile has been tormenting victim Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) for weeks, with her mum Sarah (Tina O’Brien) adamant for revenge. As viewers of the ITV soap will remember, Bethany was groomed by Nathan and later pimped out to his disgusting mates in 2017. After finally recognising his behaviour, she bravely reported him to the police and he was locked up. She got a huge shock earlier this month when he was spotted at the Weatherfield Precinct, watching on as a reconstruction of Lauren’s final movements were recorded for television. Adamant that he had something to do with the girl’s disappearance , she stole his phone and discovered that he’d subscribed to her O-Vidz account. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video In a further twist, Gary Windass (Mikey North) attacked him , and coughed up £10k to ensure he stayed away from Bethany. In tonight’s (27th May) episode, which is the first in a special week of instalments that will see Lauren’s killer unmasked, Bethany was horrified to see her rapist drive past her on Victoria Street and smirk. Charging down to the police station, she broke down and demanded PC Craig Tinker (Colson Smith) arrest him, but he admitted there was nothing he could do. Nathan’s not allowed within 250 metres of No. 8 Coronation Street, but as he was around the corner, he wasn’t breaching the terms of his release. Sarah was furious with the situation and vowed to be the one who got rid of him. Following an off the cuff comment made by her brother David (Jack P. Shepherd), she was given food for thought and tracked down one of Lauren’s hair bobbles that had been left at the Platt residence whilst she was staying with them.

Her botched plan was to plant the crucial DNA in the back of Nathan’s van, but it wasn’t long before he discovered her lurking around the building site and their altercation was stumbled upon by detective Kit Green (Jacob Roberts).

They were spotted walking on level B1 through the parking garage as they did their best to sneak out of the oceanside resort. They both got into the back of the same car as a security guard kept watch.

The rapper had on bright yellow shorts with a white top that had yellow embroidery. He added slide-in Birkenstock style light brown sandals as he flashed a gold bracelet and carried a black bag.

Following the 30-year-old Puerto Rican rapper's show at the Kaseya Center, the former couple were spotted grabbing a late-night meal together. The pair, who were escorted to a VIP room, reportedly dined for 'about an hour and 20 minutes before leaving after midnight,' an eyewitness told TMZ . Although the eyewitnesses noted that the stars did not engage in any 'outward signs of affection' that they 'still seemed to be a couple.' While leaving the restaurant, Jenner followed the three-time Grammy winner out, who turned around to make sure she was behind him, before leaving in the same SUV. This marks the second time the supermodel, 28, and singer have been seen together in a week, following their cozy reunion at Met Gala afterparty earlier this month.

        "content": "NFL star Brandon McManus 'accused of sexually assaulting two women on team flight to London' Two female flight attendants are seeking in excess of $1million and a jury trial McManus was released by the Jaguars but has since signed for Washington READ MORE: NFL's 2024 International Games schedule REVEALED By Ben Nagle Published: 14:35 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 15:26 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail Two women are suing the Jacksonville Jaguars and its former kicker Brandon McManus after alleging that he sexually assaulted them on a team flight to London last year. ESPN report that the women - who have not been identified - are seeking in excess of $1million and are demanding a jury trial. They allege McManus, 32, rubbed himself against them and grinded against them, and also claim the Jaguars failed to supervise their player and failed to create a safe environment for staff serving the team. The Jags played two games in London in the 2023 season, against the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley on October 1, and then against the Buffalo Bills at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on October 8. McManus played in both. The kicker was not re-signed by the team at the end of last season and has since signed a one-year, $3.6million contract with the Washington Commanders . Brandon McManus has been accused of sexually assaulting two female flight attendants McManus is pictured playing for the Jags in London, days after the alleged assault took place ESPN report that McManus, or his attorney, is set to release a statement later on Monday, and the Jaguars refused to comment when approached by the media. According to the lawsuit, the Jaguars flew to the UK on an Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings charter flight on September 28, 2023, and the two women were working as flight attendants for the team. They allege the journey 'quickly turned into a party' and that McManus and several other players 'disregarded the flight attendants' personal space, air travel safety, and federal law'. One of the women - identified only as Jane Doe I - accuses McManus of trying to kiss her while she was seated during a period of turbulence and twice grinding up against her while she was serving meals to passengers. The second woman - Jane Doe II - claims that McManus grinded against her while she was serving the second of the flight's two meals, before confronting him - only for him to 'smirk and walk away'. Jaguars players board the chartered flight to London, shortly before the allegations took place The Jaguars - who are owned by Shad Khan - are also being sued by the women for failing to supervise McManus and failing to create a safe environment for staff serving the team Doe I also claims that during the first alleged assault, she made eye contact with a different Jaguars player, who 'looked ashamed of McManus' behavior'. Doe II also alleges that when the team returned back to the USA from London after the double-header of games, she 'remained on the second story of the aircraft to avoid McManus'. The lawsuit says that the two women have experienced severe mental anguish, anxiety, psychological and emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation. Last season, the NFL star earned $2m in his one-year contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars, following his release by the Denver Broncos. He made 30 of his 37 field-goal attempts in 2023, and all 35 of his extra-point attempts.

It is what you would hear about or read about what would be happening in Europe maybe 300, 400 years ago,\" Dr Khaled Dawas, head of gastrointestinal surgery at University College London Hospitals, told AFP in an interview. Dawas described dire conditions in Gaza, with medical staff operating virtually without supplies, power supplies intermittent and patients lying on the floor. He returned at the end of April from his two-week stint to help overstretched Palestinian hospital surgeons -- his second wartime stay there, following one in January. \"By April they were seeing this constant, constant volume of dying and dead bodies coming into the hospitals and any human wouldn't be able to tolerate it,\" he said. \"They carry on working, but you can see the effect of that. They're all extremely burdened by what they're doing.\"",

The Republican presidential contender confidently told the crowd at the Washington Hilton on Saturday night that \"the Libertarian Party should nominate Trump for president,\" only for howls of derision to ring out. \"That's nice,\" Mr Trump retaliated sarcastically, with a rictus grin. \"Maybe you don't want to win. Only do that if you want to win. If you want to lose, don't do that. Keep getting three per cent every four years.\" Apparently seeing a need for damage-limitation operations, Mr Trump took to Truth Social to insist that his appearance was a resounding success.

        "content": "From his eccentric rants to his trademark “Conference of Champions” quote, not to mention the zany attires and his four championships spanning college and the pros, Bill Walton left an indelible mark on the sports world. A Hall of Fame player who won two titles with the Trail Blazers, Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced. Shortly after the league released its statement, many flocked to social media to honor one of the sport’s most unique personalities, who became a staple of ESPN’s Pac-12 broadcasts. “I’m heartbroken,” ESPN colleague Jay Bilas said on SportsCenter . “Just a genuine, beautiful person that always asked about you and as much as he could talk endlessly and captivate everyone around the table with experience from his life, that’s not what he was about. He was about asking you about yours and he was genuinely interested. One of the most generous souls I’ve ever been around. “Incredibly intelligent, well-read. I think a lot of people later in his career were captivated by his showmanship ... He may have been the greatest college basketball player of all-time. ... He was an absolutely magnificent, beautiful person that you loved to be around at all times.” . @JayBilas remembers Bill Walton ❤️ \"He may have been the greatest college basketball player of all time. He was an all-time great pro as well. ... But more than that ... He was an absolutely magnificent, beautiful person that you just loved to be around at all times.\" pic.twitter.com/oolIQZxrbu The influx of positive statements about Walton on Monday showed his legacy spanned many spheres, including college, the NBA, the media industry and humanitarian efforts. Walton first established himself as a household name by winning back-to-back championships with UCLA from 1972-73 before being selected by the Trail Blazers as the No. 1 pick in the 1974 draft. The center won two NBA titles in his career — in 1977 with Portland and in 1986 with Boston — while averaging 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. Despite battling injuries that limited him throughout his career, Walton earned MVP honors for the 1977-78 season and made two All-Star teams. “Have just heard the devastating news of Bill Walton’s passing. Broken-hearted for Lori, the Walton boys & Bill’s many friends,” ESPN colleague Fran Fraschilla posted . “One of the greatest college players ever, a great humanitarian & a lover of life. ⁦I will miss you, Bill. @UCLAMBB @espn @NBA.” Julius Erving, whose 76ers lost to the Trail Blazers in the 1977 NBA Finals, called it a “blessing” to have competed against him. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed,” Erving tweeted . “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc.” I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc pic.twitter.com/GAEt1DRH8N Following his playing career, Walton became an iconic broadcaster, most notably for ESPN. He became a staple of Pac-12 broadcasts alongside Dave Pasch, telling stories after midnight on the East Coast that you would not be hearing anywhere else. Perhaps nobody in sports could convince a listener that a 5-23 Oregon State team from the “Conference of Champions” could do damage in the NCAA Tournament like Walton could. His zaniness earned him a cult following and beloved status in the sport. Sign up for Starting Lineup for the biggest stories. Please provide a valid email address.

Never miss a story. “Absolutely crushed to hear of the passing of the legendary Bill Walton, whose intellect, sense of humor, and zest for life were even bigger than he was,” ESPN colleague Mike Greenberg tweeted Monday . He was also, when healthy, every bit as good a big man as there ever was, with a game that was decades ahead of his time – he’d have been perfect in today’s NBA. Sending love and condolences to his family, I will cherish the memories of our many conversations for the rest of my life.” So many good Bill Walton memories but none can top the time he devoured a cupcake with a lit candle One of one pic.twitter.com/iZ9HOL0PJE Pablo Torre of Meadowlark shared a sweet message above a funny clip from the two involving teepees. “Bill Walton laughed at himself; cared deeply about people history ignored; and was one of the greatest athletes to ever walk the Earth,” Torre posted . “A planet he both adored and transcended. RIP 💔.” Bill Walton laughed at himself; cared deeply about people history ignored; and was one of the greatest athletes to ever walk the Earth. A planet he both adored and transcended. RIP 💔 pic.twitter.com/9rCWruhGUs 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey reflected on Walton’s humanitarian efforts in a post honoring the late big man. “RIP Bill Walton – my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992,” Morey posted Monday.",

        "content": "A new report finds that Canadians feel both \"optimism and concern\" over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks. Top science and technology headlines, all in one place Top headlines on electric vehicles, and all the latest automotive news The Léger study commissioned by Transport Canada says residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft — drones' larger, human-piloted cousins. The survey found that despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility's potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services. However, the study says concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impacts and privacy tempered enthusiasm for aerial vehicles. Air taxis, long hyped as the next giant leap in short-haul passenger transport, are coming closer to being a public reality — even as skepticism lingers over their ability to change commuter behaviour and emissions output. In the U.S., electric air taxis can start flying through the skies by 2028, according to a regulatory timeline laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration last July. Léger says its report was based on two studies carried out between November and January, with a survey sample size of 2,717 participants as well as four focus groups. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024",

        "content": "GATINEAU, Que. - The Competition Bureau says market concentration, prices and a rising tally of customer complaints are fuelling its study into Canada's airline industry. The regulator says two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. Top business headlines, all in one place The bureau also says domestic fares appear relatively high and that more and more passengers are filing complaints. The regulator says its market study, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, will pave the way for recommendations to government that would improve competition and make it easier for consumers to make informed choices. The market study announced May 9 is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines, with the latter two making up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau.",

        "description": "An emphatic victory over Kent was inspired by Essex’s outstanding bowling display,",
        "content": "Kent were skittled for just 101 in their second innings as Simon Harmer and Shane Snater led Essex’s victory charge. Harmer took four for 32 and Snater finished with three for 15 as Essex triumphed by an innings and 96 runs. Kent were 197 behind going into the final day and they lost England opener Zak Crawley early when Snater trapped him lbw. Harmer then began to inflict damage – dismissing Ben Compton and Marcus O’Riordan – and it was a steady fall of wickets after that as Kent fell away. Hopes of an exciting climax to the final day between Lancashire and Warwickshire at Emirates Old Trafford were dashed by rain, with only 75 minutes’ play possible. Warwickshire declared their second innings on 96 for three – a lead of 231 – and Lancashire finished on 89 for four from the 15 overs that were possible. Nottinghamshire’s hopes of pushing for a last-day victory over Worcestershire also were wrecked by the weather as they too had to settle for a draw at New Road. Despite two of the first three days being washed out, Nottinghamshire were strongly placed at 234 for three and leading by 154 runs, but heavy overnight rain and a steady stream of morning showers dashed any chance of play, with the visitors taking 11 points and Worcestershire nine. In Division Two, promotion front-runners Middlesex and Sussex saw their match at Lord’s peter out into a draw. A stalemate looked inevitable once the home side had avoided the follow-on early on the final day and they went on to post 613 for nine declared in reply to Sussex’s total of 554 for nine. Nathan Fernandes missed out on a century by nine runs, while Jack Davies struck a career-best 68 and Henry Brookes registered his first half-century as a Middlesex player, with off-spinner Jack Carson taking four for 166. Ricardo Vasconcelos hit an unbeaten 129 not out as he spearheaded Northamptonshire’s bid for an unlikely victory over Yorkshire, but the visitors’ bowling attack dug deep to ensure the Wantage Road clash ended in a draw. Northamptonshire had been set a challenging target of 326 in a little over two sessions and when Vasconcelos warmed up for the T20 Blast with 17 boundaries all around the ground, a home triumph looked a possibility. But a dramatic clatter of wickets as the Yorkshire attack – featuring Adam Lyth’s career-best figures of four for 56 – staged a late fightback to set nerves jangling in the home dressing room, meant Vasconcelos had to switch gears to ensure his side held out for the draw, eight wickets down. Leicestershire made it seven draws from seven championship matches this season with a stalemate against visitors Glamorgan, who ended the day on 157 for four in the second innings, 201 runs ahead. And Beau Webster completed a Gloucestershire home debut to remember against Derbyshire in another drawn encounter. The Australian all-rounder followed up his six-wicket haul in Derbyshire’s first innings of 526 by smashing 76 off just 79 balls as Gloucestershire extended their reply from an overnight 399 for four to 530 all out, with Zak Chappell claiming five for 58. Too much time had been lost to the weather, though, and the players shook hands when Derbyshire declared their second innings on 166 for four.",

        "content": "Kent were skittled for just 101 in their second innings as Simon Harmer and Shane Snater led Essex’s victory charge. Harmer took four for 32 and Snater finished with three for 15 as Essex triumphed by an innings and 96 runs. 🔐 21 more points in the bank. That's the end of a successful first block of @CountyChamp cricket. 🦅 #FlyLikeAnEagle pic.twitter.com/187sffN2e4 — Essex Cricket (@EssexCricket) May 27, 2024 Kent were 197 behind going into the final day and they lost England opener Zak Crawley early when Snater trapped him lbw. Harmer then began to inflict damage – dismissing Ben Compton and Marcus O’Riordan – and it was a steady fall of wickets after that as Kent fell away. Hopes of an exciting climax to the final day between Lancashire and Warwickshire at Emirates Old Trafford were dashed by rain, with only 75 minutes’ play possible. Warwickshire declared their second innings on 96 for three – a lead of 231 – and Lancashire finished on 89 for four from the 15 overs that were possible.

Despite two of the first three days being washed out, Nottinghamshire were strongly placed at 234 for three and leading by 154 runs, but heavy overnight rain and a steady stream of morning showers dashed any chance of play, with the visitors taking 11 points and Worcestershire nine. In Division Two, promotion front-runners Middlesex and Sussex saw their match at Lord’s peter out into a draw. A stalemate looked inevitable once the home side had avoided the follow-on early on the final day and they went on to post 613 for nine declared in reply to Sussex’s total of 554 for nine. Vasconcelos finishes unbeaten on 129 and it ends as a draw. 🤝 pic.twitter.com/7laONsTdL1 — Northamptonshire CCC (@NorthantsCCC) May 27, 2024 Nathan Fernandes missed out on a century by nine runs, while Jack Davies struck a career-best 68 and Henry Brookes registered his first half-century as a Middlesex player, with off-spinner Jack Carson taking four for 166. Ricardo Vasconcelos hit an unbeaten 129 not out as he spearheaded Northamptonshire’s bid for an unlikely victory over Yorkshire, but the visitors’ bowling attack dug deep to ensure the Wantage Road clash ended in a draw. Northamptonshire had been set a challenging target of 326 in a little over two sessions and when Vasconcelos warmed up for the T20 Blast with 17 boundaries all around the ground, a home triumph looked a possibility. But a dramatic clatter of wickets as the Yorkshire attack – featuring Adam Lyth’s career-best figures of four for 56 – staged a late fightback to set nerves jangling in the home dressing room, meant Vasconcelos had to switch gears to ensure his side held out for the draw, eight wickets down. Leicestershire made it seven draws from seven championship matches this season with a stalemate against visitors Glamorgan, who ended the day on 157 for four in the second innings, 201 runs ahead.

The Australian all-rounder followed up his six-wicket haul in Derbyshire’s first innings of 526 by smashing 76 off just 79 balls as Gloucestershire extended their reply from an overnight 399 for four to 530 all out, with Zak Chappell claiming five for 58. Too much time had been lost to the weather, though, and the players shook hands when Derbyshire declared their second innings on 166 for four.",

        "content": "[Source: Reuters] An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said. Prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel’s assault. Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel’s military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties. “In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,” he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel’s military said Sunday’s strike, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza’s southern tip. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The U.S. urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said. NO SAFE ZONE More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Egypt also condemned Israel’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt’s military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters in Beirut on Monday that there were no plans for ceasefire talks and the group’s demands to achieve an accord, which include a permanent ceasefire, remain unchanged.",

The 28-year-old joined the club from Monaco nine years ago in a deal worth an initial £36million in 2015, making him at the time the most expensive teenager in world football. The forward will now leave Old Trafford when his contract officially expires on 1 July after making 317 appearances for United, scoring 90 goals for the club. Martial confirmed his departure in an emotional post on Instagram , thanking supporters and the club for an ‘incredibly opportunity’. ‘After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career,’ he wrote. ‘Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. ‘Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. ‘I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. ‘I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my 9 years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. ‘Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. ‘I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion. ‘Thank you again for everything, and see you soon.’ While enjoying some superb seasons at the club, Martial persistently struggled with injury problems, particularly in recent years. He managed just seven starting appearances in his final season at the club, scoring two goals with a groin injury ended his season back in December. He becomes the second star to confirm he is leaving United this summer with Raphael Varane also moving on.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AFP): The United States said Monday Israel must make every possible effort to avoid civilian casualties, following a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Rafah, which Gaza’s health ministry said killed 45 people. Israel is facing a wave of international condemnation over the strike, both across the region and from the European Union, France and the United Nations. “As we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians,” a US National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened,” the spokesperson added. Gaza’s civil defense agency said the strike ignited a fire that tore through a displacement center in northwestern Rafah near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” the NSC spokesperson said. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on “precise intelligence information” about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It launched the attack on Rafah hours after Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets towards the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. The NSC spokesperson said that “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” before imploring more caution. The Gaza war broke out after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.

        "content": "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other top officials have accused NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg of escalating tensions with Moscow over comments he made on use of Western arms by Kiev. Stoltenberg claimed last week that the “time has come” for members of the US-led military bloc to reconsider their policies and let Ukraine use Western weapons to launch strikes deep into Russian territory, RT reported. “I don’t know why Stoltenberg said such a thing, I think we have to be very careful,” Meloni told Italy’s Rai 3 TV channel on Sunday. The Italian prime minister stressed that “NATO must remain firm, not give the signal that it is giving in,” but advised “greater caution.” “There are many questionable statements,” Meloni added, recalling how she rebuked French President Emmanuel Macron over his remarks on potentially sending troops to Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini told an election rally on Sunday that Stoltenberg “cannot speak on behalf of the Italian people.” “NATO cannot force us to kill in Russia, nor can anyone force us to send Italian soldiers to fight or die in Ukraine,” Salvini said.",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Rugby Canada, Mike Lee, *MANDATORY CREDIT* Assistant coach Jocelyn Barrieau will take charge of Canada’s women’s rugby sevens team following the Paris 2024 Olympics, Rugby Canada announced Monday.

While the women take part in a \"winner-takes-all\" eight-team competition in Madrid to decide the series champion, the Canadian men will be fighting to remain in the world sevens series.

The statement citing their work commitments taking their marriage 'in different directions ’ was in fact arranged by Ruth, with Eamonn refusing to play a part in its release. Sources told Mail+ that Eamonn is devastated about the split and that the break-up has ‘very much been orchestrated by Ruth’. Eamonn reportedly told friends that he ‘didn’t want to get involved’ and that ‘Ruth can do what she wants but keep me out of it’.

The caption said: 'My God, what a Cup Final, what a result! European football next season too . The Magic of The Cup. Congratulations to the whole squad.' Eamonn, who is a trustee of Manchester United Foundation, saw his post flooded with comments from concerned fans, asking him about his split from Ruth. The former This Morning hosts revealed they had split on Saturday after work commitments 'took their marriage in different directions'. A representative said: 'Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.'

Eamonn has had a tough two years, losing the ITV show, as well as battling health conditions and grieving the death of his mother.

They started moving in different directions in their careers and their priorities started to change.' 'Eamonn was desperate to return to Belfast, which he thinks of as home, but Ruth would never move. It became a bone of contention. 'As her ITV career continued, Eamonn went down another path and they became ships in the night. For the past two years they had led separate lives, professionally and personally.' Eamonn spoke about his desire to return to Belfast last year, revealing how his wife was always 'very irritated' when he called it home. He said last year, when asked where he thinks of as home: 'Well, it's not Surrey. When people ask me what I'm doing at the weekend, I tell them I'm going home.

        "description": "The future of the city's three Catholic primary schools is being considered.",
        "content": "Parents of pupils from an Aberdeen Catholic school have raised fears it will be shut down. Last month, Aberdeen City Council launched a feasibility study on the future of denominational schools in the city. Those who attend Holy Family RC Primary School on Summerhill Terrace are encouraging others to share their views to “save” their school. It is one of three Roman Catholic primary schools in Aberdeen alongside St Peter’s and St Joseph’s. Their catchment area covers the whole city, as well as some of Aberdeenshire. The council has said there are more spaces than needed across the three schools, which also need improvements to their buildings. The study will be used to help determine what actions the council should take with the denominational schools to avoid them “having too much unused capacity”. It is until Friday, June 7. Worries about potential school closures The current “challenges” at each primary school have been identified with Holy Family described as “one of the smallest primary schools in the city”. It adds the building may not be suitable to deliver the modern curriculum. “Significant” issues with the condition of the St Joseph’s and St Peter’s building were also raised, however, plans are already in place to refurbish and extend the latter. Once these works are completed, the three schools will have capacity for 1,085 places but a school roll of only 771 pupils. As these , any proposed options from the study will focus on reducing numbers at the other two schools. Parents from Holy Family, which 168 pupils attend, have raised fears they could be facing the closure of their school. Those who attend the school have shared a plea online for Aberdeen residents to share their views. A “Save our School” poster shared on social media states: “Every view counts. With enough responses we’ll tell Aberdeen City Council how important Holy Family is to us pupils.” Views sought on Aberdeen Catholic schools Options highlighted in the study include merging two schools into one building or changing the catchment areas to reduce capacity, as well as looking at refurbishing or rebuilding schools. The council has stated any proposals to close schools will require a formal public consultation before a decision is made. Information supporting the study states: “As the feasibility study is carried out, we are inviting pupils, parents, school staff, community groups and other stakeholders to comment on the likely options for long term Roman Catholic primary school provision, and how these options might impact on them if they were taken forwards. “Feedback received from stakeholders will be included in the feasibility study and will be considered when identifying a preferred option.” While the study focuses on the city’s primary schools, it also asks if there should be a dedicated Roman Catholic secondary school in the city. The findings will be presented to the education committee later this year. Aberdeen City Council has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "GENEVA (AFP): Planned talks between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog aimed at breaking the impasse over Tehran’s nuclear programme have been put on hold after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, an agency report said Monday. The temporary suspension of talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) comes as its chief Rafael Grossi reiterated his concern over public statements made in Iran regarding its nuclear weapons capability. In the report, Grossi said that “further public statements made in Iran... regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran’s nuclear doctrine only increase... concerns about the correctness and completeness of Iran’s safeguards declarations.” Iran has always denied any ambition to develop nuclear weapon capability, insisting its activities are entirely for peaceful purposes. Earlier this month, Grossi visited Iran in a bid to improve cooperation with Tehran, urging leaders to adopt “concrete” measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme. After returning from his trip, Grossi decried “completely unsatisfactory” cooperation with Tehran, saying he would like to see “results soon”. – Breaching deal limits – But in the meantime, the deaths of Iran’s president Raisi, his foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and six others in a helicopter crash on 19 May have further complicated the situation. One day after the helicopter crash, “Iran indicated that due to the ‘special circumstances’, it was no longer appropriate to hold substantive discussions” and a new date would be set, a confidential report seen by AFP on Monday said. With presidential elections scheduled for the end of June, Grossi “reiterated... his call for, and disposition to continue” the negotiations. At the same time, Iran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme and now has enough material to build several atomic bombs. In a separate confidential report seen by AFP ahead of an IAEA board of governors’ meeting next week, the agency said Iran’s estimated stockpile of enriched uranium had reached more than 30 times the limit set out in the 2015 accord between Tehran and world powers. According to the report, Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was estimated at 6,201.3 kilogrammes as of May 11, up by 675.8 kilogrammes from the last quarterly report in February. Tensions between Iran and the IAEA have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanction relief fell apart. EU-mediated efforts to revive the deal — bringing the US back on board and Iran back into compliance — have so far been fruitless. Nuclear weapons require uranium enriched to 90 percent, while 3.67 percent set out in the deal is enough for nuclear power stations. Iran has continued to breach further limits set out in the 2015 nuclear deal. According to the report, Iran has 751.3 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to up to 20 percent and 142.1 kilogrammes enriched to up to 60 percent. At the same time, Iran has gradually decreased its cooperation with the IAEA by deactivating surveillance devices needed to monitor the nuclear programme and barring inspectors among other measures. London, Paris and Berlin have been trying to push for a resolution condemning Iran at the IAEA Board of Governors. But the United States has been reluctant to join their efforts for fear of exacerbating the current geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, especially in the run-up to the presidential election in November. “Action by the IAEA board is long overdue,” Kelsey Davenport, an expert with the Arms Control Association, told AFP. “Waiting another six months until after the US election will only further exacerbate the challenges,” she said, by “sending the message that Tehran can flout its international obligations with impunity”. According to Davenport, the United States should put an offer on the table to “reduce the risk of conflict in the region and the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran”.",

        "description": "An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city, officials said, prompting an outcry from global leaders.",
        "content": "Cairo/Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that officials say killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip. Credit: AP “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel’s military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. A screenshot of footage from southern Israel that shows flames and smoke rising from what Palestinian medics say is an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. Credit: AP “We were praying ... and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel’s military said Sunday’s strike, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza’s southern tip. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The US urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” a National Security Council spokesperson said. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. Palestinians react next to the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip. Credit: AP The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Egypt also condemned Israel’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt’s military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area, but it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters in Beirut on Monday that there were no plans for ceasefire talks and the group’s demands to achieve an accord, which include a permanent ceasefire, remain unchanged.

        "content": "The Skokie Fire Department’s honor guard marched up an aisle between rows of spectators, their ceremonial axes glistening silver, to start Skokie’s Memorial Day ceremony Monday. Skokie Fire Chief Jeff Hoeflich welcomed speakers including Dan Ryan, a U.S. Navy veteran who had worked as the village’s finance director from 1980 to 1990 and later served on the police pension board. When Ryan’s father, who had served in World War II, was alive the two traveled to the National World War II museum in New Orleans, which in 2014 had a special exhibit on Higgins boats, Ryan said, describing the vessels as those in which the front half opens up to let troops storm out. The Skokie Fire Department honor guard stood during the singing of “God Bless America” at the village’s Memorial Day ceremony Monday. (Pam DeFiglio, Chicago Tribune/Pioneer Press) “They had a book where veterans could write their remembrances of Higgins boats,” Ryan said, adding he was surprised to see his father writing in it, since he had never previously mentioned anything about the subject. He later peeked at what his father’s entry. It described how one day in April 1945 in Okinawa, his father’s ship released its Higgins boats, watched the troops inside them successfully make it onshore and said the boatswains brought the Higgins boats back to the ship. The Skokie police honor guard performed a Memorial Day ceremony rifle salute Monday. (Pam DeFiglio, Chicago Tribune/Pioneer Press) “As we pulled away, we passed and gave honors to the ship that was taking our place (to deposit more Higgins boats and sailors). At that moment, the other vessel was hit catastrophically by a kamikaze pilot. We spent the next hours assisting the ship, caring for the wounded and recovering and respecting the dead,” Ryan’s father wrote, according to Ryan’s recollection. The moment of solemnity continued as a Niles North High School student sang the national anthem and the Skokie Police honor guard marched to a grassy area behind the speakers and performed a rifle salute. Rabbi Moshe Wolf gave a benediction, thanking honored heroes and their families and praying that first responders arrive home safely after their tours of duty.

RSF said it was asking the ICC's prosecutor to investigate war crimes committed by the Israeli army against at least nine Palestinian reporters since December 15, AFP reported. The ICC said in January it was probing potential crimes against journalists since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Gaza, which has cost the lives of more than 100 reporters. RSF said it had \"reasonable grounds for thinking that some of these journalists were deliberately killed and that the others were the victims of deliberate IDF attacks against civilians.\" This specific complaint -- the third the RSF has made -- concerns eight Palestinian journalists killed between December 20 and May 20, and one other who sustained injuries. \"All concerned journalists were killed (or injured) in the course of their work,\" RSF said in a statement.",

        "content": "PYONGYANG (AFP): North Korea’s latest attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit ended in a mid-air explosion, Pyongyang said late Monday, hours after its announcement of a planned launch was criticised by Seoul and Tokyo. Putting a spy satellite into orbit has long been a top priority for Kim Jong Un’s regime, and it claimed to have succeeded in November, after two failed attempts last year. Seoul claims Kim received Russian technical assistance for that launch, in return for sending containers of weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine. But its attempt Monday to launch the “Malligyong-1-1” reconnaissance satellite ended in failure after it “exploded in the air during the first flight stage and failed to launch,” the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a statement. An “expert review concluded that the cause of the accident was the operational reliability of the newly developed liquid oxygen and oil engine,” the statement, carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, added. Japanese broadcaster NHK ran footage of what appeared to be a flaming projectile in the night sky, which then exploded into a fireball, saying it had filmed it from northeast China at the same time as the attempted launch. Pyongyang had notified Japan earlier Monday that it was planning to put another satellite into orbit, prompting criticism from both Seoul and Tokyo, which urged Kim to call it off. South Korea’s military said it had detected the launch but that the satellite “is presumed to have exploded in the air”. “The South Korean and US intelligence authorities are analysing it in detail in close cooperation,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Nuclear-armed North Korea is barred by multiple UN resolutions from tests using ballistic technology, and analysts say there is significant technological overlap between space launch capabilities and the development of ballistic missiles. The launch “is a provocative act that clearly violates the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the use of ballistic missile technology,” South Korea’s military said. Japan briefly issued an alert warning residents of southern Okinawa prefecture to take cover in shelters, but it was lifted minutes later. Hours after trilateral The attempted launch came just hours after Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo wrapped up their first trilateral summit since 2019. South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol said Monday that another satellite launch — North Korea’s fourth attempt — would “undermine regional and global peace and stability”. The South Korean military conducted attack formation flight and strike training on Monday to demonstrate “the strong capabilities and will of our military” after North Korea notified Japan of its plans to launch a satellite by June 4. Experts say that spy satellites could improve North Korea’s intelligence-gathering capabilities, particularly over South Korea, and provide crucial data in any military conflict. Kim met President Vladimir Putin in Russia last September, and Putin suggested afterwards that his nation could help Pyongyang build satellites. Seoul and Washington have both subsequently accused Pyongyang of shipping weapons to Moscow, with South Korea saying earlier this year that Pyongyang had sent thousands of containers of weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. A group of Russian engineers entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. North Korea claims the “Malligyong-1” satellite it put into orbit in November is successfully functioning, but Seoul’s intelligence agency has cast down on this claim. The North’s two failed attempts last year included one in May which failed due to the “abnormal” startup of its second-stage engine, Pyongyang state media said at the time, and one in August which was attributed to an error in the “emergency blasting system”. Seoul’s National Intelligence Service collected and analysed debris from one of Pyongyang’s failed launches earlier last year, finding it had no military utility.",

        "content": "This is a series of three articles that try to assess the state of superpower rivalry between the US and China. Part 1 looked at the economic and technology warfare; Part 2 looks at balance sheet of geopolitical influence; and Part 3 will be the general assessment of changing global situation following years of intense US-China superpower rivalry. Current balance sheet of geopolitical influence Looking at Asia, where China calls home, the general news are not favorable for China. China is losing ground in Asia in terms of US-China superpower rivalry. According to western media narratives, China has made almost every Asian country surrounding it uneasy, uncomfortable, if not a clear-cut enemy. Many countries in Southeast Asia are having problems with China partially due to their own territorial contest and partially due to immense pressure from the US. There is not much positive news about China in Asia. And in this current environment, even if some countries wish to build closer and stronger relations with China, they are facing an extremely heavy peer pressure, and even reputational attacks from the Western-aligned media. Cambodia is the case in point. Cambodia is a footnote in hyping China’s fear in Asia. It does not matter how much Cambodia explains about its agency, Cambodia will continue to be a target of smearing campaigns because attacking Cambodia means attacking China. Whether Cambodia can cut its ties with China, this is an indecent proposal for any country that puts their national security first. What we can say from this general situation is that Asia is probably not ready for China’s leadership. China needs to reconsider why it has made many countries in Asia feel uncomfortable. A superpower is always a superpower. A superpower can be arrogant, over-confident and a bully, and no one can do anything about it. China needs to make sure that it does not have such characteristic traits in its dealing with smaller Asian nations. The US has played well in Asia, dominating the narrative of China’s danger, bringing Vietnam, India, Japan, Philippines, altogether to counter China. Australia also decided to buy nuclear submarines through an AUKUS secret deal in contravention of non-proliferation regime, and without a guarantee to safeguard nuclear proliferation in the Asia-Pacific region. Current China’s alienation in Asia also tells that many countries fear the US even if they want close relations with China. In a sense, Asian countries fear both the US and China. They want a stronger China, but they are not comfortable with its unchecked rising. They want the US to help balance power with China, but they don’t want the US to create any mess such as armed conflicts in the region. When China is not welcomed in many parts of Asia, it is being warmly welcomed in other parts of the world. That is Europe. When countries in Asia fear of China, countries in Europe fear of the US. Despite news attacking China in Europe or European governments’ unfriendly statements against China, we need to look much deeper beyond official statements to clearly see how much some major European statesmen really need China. In France, President Xi Jinping and his wife were welcomed by President Macron and his wife, in a way that the world has never seen before both in terms of personal attention and state’s honoring and splendor. The more than a hundred cavalry troops surrounding the motorcade of President Xi Jinping made us wonder when was the last time that France had received a foreign statesman in such an elaborated and gigantic manner. France’s rationale is that it wants to play a distinctive role and carve a diplomatic space for Europe within a multipolar world. It does not want France and Europe to become a follower or little brother of the US. Another important rationale is that France is viewing the US as part of the European problem, especially through the Russo-Ukrainian war. France does not see that the US is willing to stop the war that continues to weaken both Russia and the whole of Europe. In such circumstance, France views China as a strategic partner that can talk to Russia, specifically President (Vladimir) Putin, to find a way to end the war. It is not by chance that Xi Jinping was visiting France on 6-7 May and later receiving Putin in Beijing on 16-17 May. To end the Russo-Ukrainian war, to create more space for Europe to play in the global order, and to create a multipolar world that could limit the US’ hegemony, are the important goals where France and China’s interest merges. France is not alone. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also shares similar view about China’s role in the current world order. He visited China for the second times, from 14 to 16 April. When China and Europe are exchanging top leaders’ visit, people seem to lose track when was the last time that major European top leaders were visiting the White House. This manifests a clear lack of trust, confidence and lack of warmth within the traditional ties between the US and Europe. China has played well in Europe. Europe doesn’t trust the US in finding peace for them through their continued provision of weapons to Ukraine at an extraordinary debt level. US foreign aid has prolonged the crisis in Ukraine. As of January 2023, the US commitment to Ukraine amounted to $76.8 billion, of which military aid accounted for the largest share, $46.5 billion, or 61 percent. 40 percent of US military aid to Ukraine is used for the mandatory purchase of US equipment and training services, known as “tied aid.” Part of the military aid is a financial loan that will become a long-term liability for Ukraine. Thus far, the US has succeeded in bleeding Russia. It will take a long time to heal. President Putin cannot be popular with such a prolonged war. Despite that, President Putin was assuming his fifth term in power, his reputation as a wartime president is bad for history especially when the war lingers into the third year. He used to walk into the Kremlin in the most spectacular and powerful way. In his inauguration, although with much fanfare, the applause seems soundless. For any nation’s people, a president with a losing cause is not to be respected or loved by history. The applause was not because of people’s respect to his presidency. There is no light for his presidency until he can find a concluding point, like what the US did in Vietnam War. No president can sustain popularity with a prolonged war. So, what we can say is that the multipolar world is irresistible even if the US tries to stop it because other major powers in Europe always harbor the ambition to play an influential role on their own instead of following the orders from Washington. The US is winning the war of influence and perception in Asia, at China’s backyard; while China is gaining more influence in Europe, making more friends with the US’ allies or cultural cousins. And Russia is losing its role within superpower competition. The author is a Phnom Penh based analyst. The views expressed here are the author’s own.",

        "content": "BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) — An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were “civilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.” Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks “conducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel “will not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.” “The only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,” he said. Western countries, in particular the U.S. and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a cease-fire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. Associated Press staff writer Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report.",

        "content": "As many as 2,000 people are feared to have been buried by last week’s massive landslide in Papua New Guinea, according to the country’s National Disaster Centre, as survivors recounted the horror of losing so many loved ones. The landslide occurred in the mountainous Enga region in northern Papua New Guinea on Friday and the latest missing figure is a sharp rise from earlier estimates, CNN reported. Locals have been left reeling after tons of rock and mud smashed into their homes as they slept. Rescuers have struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia’s poorest nations leaving locals with little choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they have.",

        "content": "GAZA (AFP): Men cleared away the charred debris of shelters and children salvaged food in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah on Monday after an Israeli strike torched a camp for displaced Palestinians. “People were not just injured or killed, but charred,” 24-year-old Mohammed Hamad told AFP in the aftermath of the strike that killed at least 45 people. The death toll came from the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which also said that 249 people were wounded in the strike. “My cousin’s daughter, a child no more than 13, was among the martyrs. She had no features at all because shrapnel tore off her face,” Hamad said. Israel’s military said its aircraft “struck a Hamas compound in Rafah” on Sunday night, killing two senior officials for the Palestinian militant group in the occupied West Bank. The strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate’s Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes. Footage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. As Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated. “When these rockets fall on a tower block there are dozens of martyrs, so what about when they are tents?” lamented a man called Hamad. “When we heard the sound (of the explosion), the sky suddenly lit up,” displaced Palestinian Muhannad, an eyewitness, told AFP. “We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs as a result of the use of (...) missiles that caused a massive fire,” the director of Gaza’s civil defence agency, Mohammad al-Mughayyir, said. ‘Ground shook violently’ Mughayyir, who oversaw the response to the fire, said on Monday “rescue and retrieval operations concluded last night, while efforts to extinguish the fire continued for 45 minutes”. He said battling the inferno was made even more difficult because of fuel and water shortages. “We also saw cases of amputations, injured children, women, and elderly among the dead,” he added. Displaced Palestinians who had sought shelter in the area after being told by the Israelis to evacuate their homes were shocked when the camp was targeted. “They dropped leaflets asking us to go to the humanitarian zone in Tal al-Sultan, so we complied and came here,” Abu Muhammad, who was displaced from north Gaza five months ago, told AFP. “But yesterday when I was having dinner at sunset, suddenly it felt like there was an earthquake — the ground shook violently,” he said. Mohammed Abu Qamar, 27, said he was equally baffled by the strikes, after he too moved from north Gaza to the camp that had been labelled a “safe zone” by the Israeli authorities. “Yesterday evening, to our surprise, the camp was bombarded with rockets in this supposedly safe place,” he told AFP on Monday. “A fire broke out, and children, women, and old people were burned.” At the Tel Al-Sultan Clinic, body bags of white sheeting lay on the floor of a room before the dead were taken away for burial in pickup trucks. “She was seven months pregnant ... her room was bombed,” Ahmad Miqdad told AFP in tears at the clinic. His only sister, Yasmine, was killed in the strike and her body could not be recovered because it was blown to pieces in the explosion, he said. “She was preparing to welcome her new baby. What did this innocent child do to deserve this?”. Israel’s government said on Monday it was looking into the “grave and awful” impact on Palestinian civilians of the previous night’s strike. The military said it had launched an investigation. The Gaza war began after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.",

        "content": "Birmingham [UK], May 27 (ANI): Researchers found that a particular brain region--which they identified through a study of patients who had brain damage to that region--controls our willingness to assist others. Understanding the areas of the brain associated with \"helping\" decisions is crucial to comprehending how people could be inspired to take on major global issues like infectious diseases, climate change, and international conflict. It is also necessary to discover novel treatments for social interaction difficulties. Researchers from the Universities of Birmingham and Oxford conducted the study, which was published in Nature Human Behaviour. It demonstrates for the first time how the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a brain region, plays a crucial role in helpful, or \"prosocial,\" activities. Lead author Professor Patricia Lockwood said: \"Prosocial behaviours are essential for addressing global challenges. Yet helping others is often effortful and humans are averse to effort. Understanding how effortful helping decisions are processed in the brain is extremely important.\" In the study, the researchers focused on the vmPFC, a region located right at the front of the brain, which is known to be important for decision-making and other executive functions. Previous studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scanning) have linked the vmPFC to choices that involve a trade-off between the rewards available and the effort required to obtain rewards. However, these techniques cannot show whether a part of the brain is essential for these functions. Three groups of participants were recruited for the study. 25 patients had vmPFC damage, 15 patients had damage elsewhere in the brain, and 40 people were healthy age and gender-matched control participants. These groups allowed the researchers to test the impact of damage to vmPFC specifically. Each participant attended an experiment where they met another person anonymously. They then completed a decision-making task that measured how willing they were to exert physical effort (squeezing a grip force device) to earn rewards (bonus money) for themselves and for the other person. By enabling participants to meet - but not see - the person they were 'working' for in advance, researchers were able to convey the sense that participants' efforts would have real consequences, but hide any information about the other person that could affect decision-making. Each choice the participants made varied in how much bonus money for them or the other person was available, and how much force they would have to exert to obtain the reward. This allowed the researchers to measure the impact of reward and effort separately, and to use advanced mathematical modelling to precisely quantify people's motivation. The results of the study clearly showed that the vmPFC was necessary for motivation to help others. Patients with vmPFC damage were less willing to choose to help others, exerted less force on even after they did decide to help, and earned less money to help others compared to the control groups. In a further step, the researchers used a technique called lesion symptom mapping which enabled them to identify even more specific subregions of the vmPFC where damage made people particularly antisocial and unwilling to exert effort for the other person. Surprisingly, damage to a nearby but different subregion made people relatively more willing to help. Co-lead author Dr Jo Cutler said: \"As well as better understanding prosocial motivation, this study could also help us to develop new treatments for clinical disorders such as psychopathy, where understanding the underlying neural mechanisms can give us new insights into how to treat these conditions.\" \"This region of the brain is particularly interesting because we know that it undergoes late development in teenagers, and also changes as we get older,\" added Professor Lockwood. \"It will be really interesting to see whether this area of the brain can also be influenced by education - can we learn to be better at helping others?\" (ANI)",

        "content": "TEHRAN - In a note, the Iran newspaper pointed out the discredit of the opposition in the eye of the Iranian people and said: The false illusion of the anti-Iranian opposition has once again appeared with the epic of the Iranian people and the world's respect for the martyred president of the Islamic Republic. This can be seen from the nervous reaction of the anti-revolution movement to the expression of sympathy and condolence of the heads of the countries regarding the martyrdom of our country's president. The Iranian opposition is angrier than ever. Recently, the employees of Zionist International TV criticized and expressed dissatisfaction with the expressions of sympathy and respect, especially from international organizations and even NATO, towards the president of Iran. They said: \"It is a joke that we could not stop this global solidarity with Iran. We should have stopped world leaders from condoling and expressing sympathy with Iran. Why did the countries fly their flags at half-mast?! Why did NATO offer condolences?!\" These are questions that not only the Persian employees of the Zionist regime but also the entire opposition movement neither have an answer for nor can accept. In an analysis, Donya-e-Eqtesad discussed Biden's words about the expansion of NATO's actions in the Middle East and wrote: The thought of NATO expansion should be considered a threat to Iran. Iran believes that the expansion of NATO means the expansion of threats, and the role of the United States alongside the countries of the Persian Gulf creates a new form of hybrid threat. This event will lead to establishing the regional security structure through the actors who are considered among America's allies in the region. Another point is that collective security will have more widespread validity and effectiveness. Naturally, the military presence of extra-regional powers in the Middle East limits the freedom of action of other countries and increases the level of monitoring of Iran's military power at the regional level and political sensitivities towards Iran's behavior. Also, such a presence will cause the regional competitors of the Islamic Republic of Iran to have more motivation to take risks. Hamshahri talked with Abdolreza Farjirad, an expert on geopolitical issues, and wrote about Iran-U.S. negotiations: Iran and the U.S. should negotiate with each other secretly. Whether we like it or not, America has interests in the region and Iran is also a regional power. Therefore, the two countries must interact so that tension and conflict in the region do not increase. Second, concessions are exchanged, which is common in diplomacy, and based on this exchange of concessions, the national and political interests of the two countries are provided to the best of their ability. America has a challenging election ahead, and Biden is looking for the tensions in the Middle East to be finished by the time of the election, or to be reduced to a point where it will not have much impact on the election. On the other hand, Iran is a regional power. America realized that it could not do anything without interaction with Iran. Therefore, America postponed the nuclear negotiations and JCPOA until after the elections. Iran and the United States have entered the next phase of negotiations, which is to reduce tension, and both countries have chosen the right way to proceed with secret negotiations in order to secure the interests of both sides by reducing tension. In an article, Farhikhtegan addressed Biden's confession about the operation of True Promise and said: After this operation, the West tried to make achievements by speaking for the Zionist regime, but they are forced to make confessions that they refused to express before. Recently, Biden said that 99% of the drones that Iran fired at Israel did not reach their targets with the help of American defense, otherwise this attack would have been devastating. In this speech, Biden tried to magnify America's power in this operation. According to the radio of the Zionist regime, the American defense systems fired 8 missiles from the sea to counter the Iranian ballistic missiles. Except for two missiles, the American defense system did not succeed in destroying most of the Iranian ballistic missiles and failed. Biden tried to show American power and hide the failure in an operation that cost more than a billion dollars for the United States and the Zionist regime. It should be noted that this attempt is related to the growth in demand for the purchase of weapons especially Iranian drones as Iranian drones are very efficient for many countries. And this is not pleasant for America.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnleash Wall Street's long-term potential with the top three growth stocks set to skyrocket your portfolio in June.The post 3 Growth Stocks Poised to Deliver Mind-Blowing Gains appeared first on InvestorPlace.More From InvestorPlaceThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard OfMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires. Here’s How to Get In.Legendary Investor Predicts: “Forget A.I. THIS Technology Is the Future”",
        "content": "Identifying the next set of growth stocks to buy can be a game-changer for Wall Street portfolios. Investors who buy a growth stock expect the company to grow its revenues and earnings significantly faster than an average industry peer or the overall market. For instance, the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEARCA: VUG ) fund has returned over 38% since January. By comparison, the S&P 500 index has advanced shy of 29%. We should note that investing in growth stocks isn’t without risks. These companies usually have valuations that can seem stretched by traditional metrics. They’re also more vulnerable to market volatility and economic downturns than their more established counterparts. Some of them are young companies with unproven products or services. However, growth shares can be a potent tool for investors willing to take on a bit more risk in pursuit of outsized returns. With that information, here are three growth stocks to watch in June. Nutanix (NTNX) First up on our list of growth stocks to buy is Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX ). The company sells data center software that merges virtualization, storage and networking into a single integrated solution. Nutanix’s innovative software solutions are well-positioned to capture significant market share as they help businesses simplify their data center operations. Second quarter fiscal 2024 metrics for Nutanix surpassed analyst estimates with strong revenue and billing growth and margin expansion. Revenues grew 16% year-over-year (YOY) to $565 million. The company posted an adjusted earnings per share ( EPS ) of $0.46, up from $0.12 in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, free cash flow skyrocketed 158% to $163 million. Investors have been following the news that Nutanix has signed AI-related deals with Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Hugging Face and others. Understandably, these deals could cause strong tailwinds in Nutanix’s pipeline. Annual contract value billings jumped 23% YOY to $330 million, driven by strong renewal performance that illustrates the stickiness of Nutanix’s offerings. Year-to-date, NTNX stock has gained 52%. As a result, Nutanix shares command a premium valuation at 67.6 times adjusted forward earnings and 8.6 times trailing sales. Therefore, interested readers may wait for a pullback below the $70 level. Sensata Technologies (ST) Industrial technology company Sensata Technologies (NYSE: ST ) is the next name among our growth stocks for today. Sensata specializes in sensors and sensor-rich solutions. These critical components are vital in the automotive, aerospace, energy, agriculture and construction industries. In the first quarter of 2024 , Sensata Technologies reported revenue of over $1.006 billion, marking a 1% increase YOY. Adjusted EPS was $0.89, down $0.03 from the first quarter of 2023 but $0.01 above guidance. Meanwhile, management highlighted the company’s strategic focus on electrification, which has shown impressive growth and positions the company well for future opportunities in the electric vehicle (EV) market. However, the mixed performance across different business segments and challenges posed by industrial destocking are important considerations for investors. Year-to-date (YTD), ST stock is up 11% with a dividend yield of 1.2%. Meanwhile, the shares potentially offer fundamental value at 11.3 times future earnings and 1.5 times sales . Despite the recent gains in ST stock, the 12-month median price forecast is $47. Such an advance in Sensata shares would suggest an upside potential of 12% from current price levels. ServiceNow (NOW) We conclude our discussion of growth stocks with cloud-based solutions provider ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW ). The company’s innovative workflow platform employs AI to streamline enterprise workflows and enhance enterprise productivity. ServiceNow exceeded guidance across all topline growth and profitability metrics in its first quarter earnings. The company reported revenue of $2.6 billion, marking a 24% YOY increase. Adjusted EPS surged 44% YOY to $3.41. Generative AI has helped ServiceNow enhance its existing product offerings and increase its addressable use cases. The company boasts an almost perfect renewal rate and an impressive track record of upselling and cross-selling its customers. In the first quarter, subscription revenue grew 25% YOY to $2.5 billion, with generative AI solutions playing a key role in securing deals with other companies. The global market for workflow automation is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.6% from 2022 to 2030. Management sees yearly subscription revenue growth of at least 20% through 2026, exceeding $15 billion by 2026. Additionally, analysts are forecasting incremental margin improvements in the coming quarters as operational leverage continues to reduce costs. Year-to-date, NOW stock has advanced 11%. Shares are valued at a premium with a forward P/E ratio of 55.6 and a trailing sales ratio of 16.4. Finally, Wall Street’s 12-month price target implies an upside potential of 10% .

        "content": "and Slovakia coach Francesco Calzona has opted to include five Serie A players in his 32-man provisional ahead of this summer. Calzona is in an interesting position as he is still technically head coach of Napoli, but he did not stop working in his role as Slovakia head coach in February. He is out of contract at the Stadio Maradona at the end of June, and it is reported that Antonio Conte is set to be his successor. Calzona is still expected to lead Slovakia into the Euros this summer. Five Serie A players have made his national team squad, including one he will know particularly well from his time with Napoli. That is because Stanislav Lobotka is included among the midfielders. He is effectively a guaranteed starter for Slovakia, so it is expected that he will still be included when the 32-man squad gets cut down to 26. There are also inclusions for and defenders Norbert Gyomber and Adam Obert. have two inclusions in the squad, namely midfielder Ondrej Duda and forward Tomas Suslov.",

Low’s body was found on a track in Pitilie, near Aberfeldy, Perth and Kinross, on February 17. It was not realised until a post-mortem examination six days later, however, that he had been shot. The BBC reported that Low's death certificate states that he had suffered a shotgun wound to the neck and chest. Low had retired from his job as a groundsman at the Edradynate Estate in 2023. Campbell, of Perth and Kinross, was charged with murder and with attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He made no plea in court and was committed for further examination. He remains in custody.

        "content": "How employers behave toward workers experiencing thyroid dysfunction could play a critical part in addressing the UK's labor market challenges. With long-term sickness on the rise in the UK, researchers at the University of Aberdeen Business School have marked World Thyroid Day (May 25) by releasing new findings which, for the first time, explore the relationship between employer sympathy and the labor market prospects of people with thyroid conditions. One in 20 people in the UK have a thyroid problem, with a significant majority of sufferers being women . Posing serious implications for the physical, mental and emotional life of those affected, thyroid patients are at greater risk of experiencing long-term sick leave and impaired working ability. \"Long-term sickness has emerged as the predominant reason for withdrawal from the workforce in the UK, accounting for 28% of total economic inactivity. This trend has been further highlighted by a rise in long-term health issues driving more women than men out of work,\" said Professor Catia Montagna of the Business School's Centre for Labor Market Research. \"A recent TUC report indicates that long-term sickness is the primary cause for women's absence from the labor force, which has resulted in over half a million more women leaving the workforce due to sickness in the past five years. \"This reflects a wider challenge in health-related economic inactivity that disproportionately affects women compared to men. In this context it is clear that renewed efforts are desperately needed to address these disparities and facilitate a more inclusive and supportive work environment.\" The study found that patients who were dissatisfied with their thyroid treatment they were receiving were more likely to have a discussion with their employer about their condition. The detrimental effects of their condition on their engagement levels at work were mitigated, however, when employers were sympathetic towards the challenges they faced. Where an employer lacked sympathy, the likelihood of the thyroid condition having a minimal impact on employees' work engagement decreased by around 13%. In contrast, for those whose thyroid conditions have little impact on their ability to work, the likelihood of them receiving a pay rise is around 18% higher, a promotion 17% higher and the probability of moving to a better job also increases by around 8%. Workers are also found to have a higher probability of working more hours, with the probability increasing by around 12%. \"Thyroid dysfunctions represent a significant challenge to women's overall well-being and can exert adverse effects on their labor market outcomes and labor productivity, from pay rises, promotion and working hours to job mobility\" added Centre director, Professor Alexandros Zangelidis \"Understanding the influence of employer sympathy on women's productivity and labor market prospects is crucial for promoting inclusive and supportive work environments. \"Our results highlight the importance of enabling employees to openly discuss their thyroid condition and its impact on their work with employers. This is crucial, as a key result of this research is that when employers are made aware of their workers' thyroid condition and respond with sympathy, the condition's adverse impact on employee engagement is diminished, leading to improved labor market prospects for affected individuals.\" The team, along with the Thyroid Trust and other stakeholders, are developing a thyroid workplace toolkit, the first of its kind in the UK. Designed to raise awareness of how the condition affects individuals, provide a framework that empowers staff to have an open discussion with their employer and provide guidance to businesses on the support that could be offered, it will shortly be piloted.

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. Meanwhile, an animal park in northern Mexico confirmed it has received reports that at least a hundred parrots, bats and other animals have died, apparently of dehydration. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a heat stroke, noting a “synergy” of factors — including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat — appeared to be to blame, while saying a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. But with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. In the northern state of San Luis Potosi, Ena Buenfil, the director of the Selva Teenek eco-park, told The Associated Press on Monday that her facility has been overwhelmed as parrots, bats, toucans have died due to the heat. Buenfil said when the heat wave began in mid-May their clinic to help animals quickly filled up with sick birds and they received a wave of reports by locals finding dead or suffering birds. Because of scarce resources by authorities, Buenfil said the number is likely only a small percentage of the animals affected, but added that their organization has worked with Civil Protection to aid some birds. Buenfil said birds mainly die of dehydration in the heat, and are often disproportionately affected because they don't have anywhere to store water. Meanwhile, bats would become dehydrated sleeping in the beating afternoon heat. She recommended that locals put out bowls of water for animals. “We’ve never seen a situation like what’s happening right now,” she said, adding if they see more heat peaks like this one “there is not going to be much we can do for the animals.” “There are going to be a lot of casualties to the ecosystem if we continue this trend of heat waves in the region,” said Buenfil. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "description": "The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently...",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. Meanwhile, an animal park in northern Mexico confirmed it has received reports that at least a hundred parrots, bats and other animals have died, apparently of dehydration. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a heat stroke, noting a “synergy” of factors — including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat — appeared to be to blame, while saying a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. But with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. In the northern state of San Luis Potosi, Ena Buenfil, the director of the Selva Teenek eco-park, told The Associated Press on Monday that her facility has been overwhelmed as parrots, bats, toucans have died due to the heat. Buenfil said when the heat wave began in mid-May their clinic to help animals quickly filled up with sick birds and they received a wave of reports by locals finding dead or suffering birds. Because of scarce resources by authorities, Buenfil said the number is likely only a small percentage of the animals affected, but added that their organization has worked with Civil Protection to aid some birds. Buenfil said birds mainly die of dehydration in the heat, and are often disproportionately affected because they don't have anywhere to store water. Meanwhile, bats would become dehydrated sleeping in the beating afternoon heat. She recommended that locals put out bowls of water for animals. “We’ve never seen a situation like what’s happening right now,” she said, adding if they see more heat peaks like this one “there is not going to be much we can do for the animals.” “There are going to be a lot of casualties to the ecosystem if we continue this trend of heat waves in the region,” said Buenfil. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "Plans for a heat network using the Glasgow Recycling and Renewable Energy Centre on Polmadie Road could make “substantial inroads” into reducing carbon emissions in the area. A feasibility study found a network is “technically and economically viable”, council officials have reported. They added the proposal is “commercially attractive enough to engage the private sector’s interest”. It could cost around £24m to build out the network. The report added carbon emissions analysis suggests a 81% reduction is achievable through development of the network, relative to “the continued operation of existing heating systems”. “These savings are estimated with gas boiler back-up over a 40-year assessment period.” A council spokesman said: “How we heat our homes and other buildings is one of the big challenges we face as the city tackles the causes of climate change. “But this study shows conclusively that heat produced by the GRREC can be used to warm buildings across a wide area on Glasgow’s southside. “The heat that comes from household waste processed at the GRREC is fully renewable and would make substantial inroads on the carbon emissions from the buildings in this heat zone area.” The study on a Polmadie district heat network was carried out by consulting engineering firm Buro Happold. It was hoped it would build “confidence that district heat networks are technically and economically viable in locations across the city”. A council report added: “A potential benefit to the GRREC is that heat generation from the waste resource is significantly more efficient than electrical generation, therefore heat supply to a network could significantly improve the overall energy efficiency of the facility.” An image included in the report shows a pipe network linked to Hampden Park, the New Victoria Hospital, Langside Library, Holyrood Secondary School and Cathcart Police Station. It also displays Toryglen Regional Football Centre, Glasgow Clyde College, Mount Florida Primary School and two blocks of flats. The feasibility report proposed that “heat exchange equipment for the EfW supply be sited on the GRREC site, with an energy centre building, housing back-up boilers and thermal storage, on adjacent GCC land”. Council officials added there is “good alignment between the specific heat source at GRREC considered and the demand identified within the core cluster”. A council spokesman said: “The possibility of a district heating network sourced from the GRREC can also help to attract inward investment and create the infrastructure that can support the push for net zero. “The GRREC produces reliable heat and this study shows investors should be confident of a return on any investment. “We are at an early stage with this initiative but we have grounds for optimism that using energy from waste to heat homes and other buildings is realistic and achievable.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "description": "According to the Department of Military Affairs, the tradition stretches back to the Roman Empire.",
        "content": "SHREVEPORT, La. ( KTAL/KMSS ) – Why do people leave coins on top of military gravestones? Similar practices exist in many cultures and have a history stretching back centuries. In modern times, this tradition is a way for service members to honor those who are no longer with us. It also shows the families that someone came to pay their respects and remember their loved ones. According to the Department of Military Affairs , the tradition stretches back to the Roman Empire, where soldiers would insert coins into the mouths of fallen soldiers. The coins enabled them to pay the mythical boatman Charon to take them across the River Styx into the afterlife. The U.S. military adopted the tradition of placing coins on service members’ graves during the Vietnam War. According to the DMA, anti-war sentiment created a charged political climate that could make it difficult to speak with the family members of their fallen comrades. Using the coins provided them a way to pay their respects peacefully. But there’s a deeper meaning behind each coin, depending on which was left at the gravesite. These coins are usually collected from gravesites periodically and used to maintain cemeteries. They can also go toward burial costs for homeless veterans. Another coin often left on the graves of military members is a “challenge coin.” These are small coins or medallions with the insignia of an organization or unit. They’re presented to service members by their commanders to recognize them for their achievements. Although there are traditions and rules on how to use the coins in a challenge, they are also given as mementos. A service member might leave one on the grave of a person who served in their unit. A similar tradition is also practiced in Judaism . Although the origins of the ancient practice are unknown, placing small stones and pebbles on a Jewish gravesite signifies a desire to remember and honor loved ones.",

CM Arvind Kejriwal held a roadshow in Jalandhar on Monday. He was campaigning for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Lok Sabha candidate from Jalandhar Pawan Kumar Tinu. CM Arvind Kejriwal said, \"Home Minister Amit Shah has challenged 3 crore people of Punjab yesterday. He said after June 4 they are going dismiss the elected government of Punjab. This is dictatorship. People of the country will not accept it. I have come to ask all 13 seats from you. I assure that only the voice of Punjab will echo inside Lok Sabha. In the last 10 years whoever you elected has not raised your concerns. We will raise issues of Punjab in Lok Sabha and find out solution to all the issues which are pending with the centre.\" He further said that there is no use voting for BJP, Akali Dal or the Congress. \"If you vote for the BJP or Akali Dal then it is of no use. If you vote for Congress they will start quarrelling against us. Give all the 13 seats to AAP we will work together,\" he added. AAP's Pawan Kumar Tinu, INDIA alliance's Charanjit Singh Channi, NDA's Sushil Kumar Rinku, and Akali Dal's Mohinder Singh Kaypee will contest elections from Jalandhar Lok Sabha seat. Earlier Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday targeted the AAP for not living up to the promises assured to Punjab and criticised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for making the state a hub of corruption. Slamming the government of AAP, Amit Shah claimed that AAP is a government that is known for breaking promises. \"This is the government of the AAP party, it is a government which breaks promises. Rs 1000 were not given to every mother and sister, Punjab was not made drug-free in a month, and 16 medical colleges were not opened up in the state,\" Shah said. All 13 Lok Sabha seats of Punjab to go for polls in the 7th phase of the Lok Sabha elections on June 1.

        "content": "Alina Muller kept Boston's season alive on Sunday, scoring at 18:36 of double overtime for a 1-0 victory over Minnesota in Game 4 of the first-ever PWHL finals in Saint Paul, Minn. Top sports headlines, all in one place Boston now has a chance to take the best-of-five series -- and the Walter Cup, awarded to the league champion -- on home ice. The teams will meet for Game 5 on Wednesday in Lowell, Mass. Aerin Frankel was on the ice for 98:36 and made 33 saves to record the shutout for Boston. Nicole Hensley also faced 33 shots but stopped just 32, preventing Minnesota from closing out the series. It looked like Boston was going to extend the series earlier than it actually did when Minnesota's Emma Greco was whistled for tripping at 12:31 of the second extra session. But the visitors came up empty on the power play, and they finished 0-for-4 on the woman advantage. Heartbreak also struck Minnesota in the form of a disallowed goal in the second overtime. The hosts failed to convert on five power plays for the game. Grace Zumwinkle led Minnesota with five shots on goal. Field Level Media",

        "content": "A Severe Thunderstorm Watch continues until 10 p.m. ET, (9 CT) for much of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are increasingly favorable for damaging thunderstorms during Sunday afternoon and early evening. Specifically, a severe thunderstorm produces winds in excess of 58 miles per hour and/or hail at least the size of quarters (one inch in diameter). Typically, tree damage and power outages occur in severe thunderstorms. If a Severe Thunderstorm Warning is issued, stay inside and away from windows until the Warning expires. Most Severe Thunderstorm Warnings last 30-45 minutes. Especially dangerous or damaging severe thunderstorms may come with additional specific wording in their Warning: If a Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) is activated on your phone (white screen, black text), it indicates the Destructive criteria. Meteorologist Sean Sublette explains the difference between a regular severe thunderstorm warning and ones that are more urgent. Although the Watch does not include Florence, an additional Watch may come later this evening. Additionally, storms can and do develop outside of the immediate area of the Watch. Meteorologist Sean Sublette explains why microburst damage might look like tornado damage — at first glance. On occasion, a tornado can form within a severe thunderstorm, and if that happens, a Tornado Warning will be issued. In that case, a basement is the best shelter option. However, if one is not available, go to an interior room on the lowest floor of whatever building you are in. Put as many walls between you and outside as possible and stay away from windows.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Prince Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) has urged both chambers of the National Assembly to halt the move to expeditiously pass a bill for an Act on National Anthem with the major aim of replacing the current one with the old. The AGF offered words of caution on Monday in his submission to the public hearing on the bill organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights, and Legal Matters. While he acknowledged that the move to initiate a new National Assembly was laudable, Fagbemi maintained that it should not be treated with legislative fiat. He said replacing the current with the old must enjoy the “buy-in of most Nigerians. He said, “In some cases, the national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to a plebiscite or referendum before its eventual adoption or declaration. “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions. “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat or presidential proclamation alone. “Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National anthem, whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians”. Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, who was represented by the Director-General of the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, who also agreed with the AGF on wider consultations, also suggested discussion around national identity rather than limiting it to the change of the national anthem. Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu identified certain lines in the old national anthem, which he noted do not have a complete meaning. “The issue of the national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not value national identity, of which the national anthem is one. It is not about singing in schools; it is about learning it and imbibing it.” A legal practitioner, who also expressed strong reservations about the expeditious passage of the bill, called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever national anthem is proposed and buy into it. According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an act for general acceptability. He, however, supported the move to replace the current “Arise, O Compatriots” national anthem with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee” the country started with in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current national anthem adopted in 1978 does not have the required gravitas and is not inspirational enough to ignite the passion and zeal for nationhood among Nigerians. Other stakeholders in their submissions preferred the old national anthem to the current one. ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "content": "A former manager target for Celtic is set for a mega-money move to Chelsea. Enzo Maresca is set to join the Premier League giants from Leicester City. The Athletic reports that the Championship title winners have given formal permission to the Stamford Bridge side to talk to their head coach. An approach was made by Chelsea on Monday afternoon, with the Italian - Pep Guardiola's former assistant at Manchester City - identified as the top candidate to replace Mauricio Pochettino. And it's said the 44-year-old is expected to agree a bumper five-year contract with the Blues. Maresca only joined the Foxes last summer after deciding to go it alone in the dugout after breaking ties with City. He had been heavily linked with the vacant post in the east end of Glasgow after Ange Postecoglou's departure for Tottenham Hotspur last June. A formal approach was expected to be made by the Hoops for the coach. However, Dermot Desmond instead opted to go after former manager Brendan Rodgers and well, the rest is history. Maresca guided Leicester to an impressive season in the Championship, earning promotion back to the Premier League at the first time of asking. Kieran McKenna - who won promotion with Ipswich Town - was also under consideration by Chelsea chiefs, but Marseca appears to have won that race.

        "content": "TEHRAN - Iran's ambassador to Pakistan has highlighted the profound impact of the late Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, underscoring his fervent dedication to matters relating to the Palestinian cause. In an interview with IRNA's foreign policy correspondent, Reza Amiri Moghadam, the Iranian ambassador to Islamabad, reflected on the personal attributes and professional achievements of the late Amir Abdollahian, emphasizing his pivotal role in advancing Iran's foreign policy goals. He began by expressing condolences for the tragic loss of several prominent figures, whose passing deeply saddened not only Iran but also the global Muslim and freedom-loving communities. Amiri Moghadam highlighted, \"One of the significant achievements of the thirteenth administration and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been its unwavering support for Palestine and staunch opposition to Zionist occupation, with Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian playing a vital role in this regard.\" Addressing the ongoing crisis in Gaza, he remarked, \"The Zionist regime's atrocities against innocent civilians have drawn global condemnation, with the International Court of Justice confirming its genocidal actions. American political elites face domestic backlash for their support of the Zionist regime.\" The ambassador emphasized, \"Amir Abdollahian remained unwavering in his commitment to the Palestinian cause, even amidst criticism. His contributions, including speeches at international forums and domestic meetings, underscored his unparalleled dedication.\" Regarding international engagement, Amiri Moghadam stated, \"Both the President and the Minister of Foreign Affairs actively represented Iran's interests in international forums, thanks to coordinated efforts among governmental branches, the military, and adherence to top-level directives, enabling significant strides in foreign policy.\" He continued, \"The collective efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amir Abdollahian, and the administration have been quite impactful, resulting in notable accomplishments such as improved regional relations and Iran's participation in key international bodies like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS.\" Concluding, Moghadam praised the late Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian's personal integrity and diplomatic prowess, noting his significant influence within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has become a cornerstone of Iran's national diplomacy. President Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian and six others died on May 19, when their helicopter crashed in foggy weather in the mountains near the northwestern border with Azerbaijan. The charred wreckage of the aircraft was found the following day. Following the death of Foreign Minister, Iran's cabinet appointed Ali Bagheri Kani as acting Foreign Minister.",

And thousands of Britons were stuck in queues for hours at Birmingham Airport amid 'shambolic' and 'terrible' scenes while families fly away on half-term holidays . Avanti West Coast said today: 'Due to a severe signalling failure in the Cheddington area, we are advising customers not to travel to or from London Euston.' But one angry passenger tweeted the operator to say: 'Thanks again for another disastrous journey from the North to London - I don't how know you manage it!' Another said: 'Avanti West Coast cancelling a load of trains again last minute. Absolute shambles of a company, not fit for purpose.' ⚠️ #MiltonKeynesCentral - Avanti West Coast are advising customers not to travel to or from London Euston today.

While they have since reopened, travellers were still being warned of cancellations this afternoon. Passengers were told tickets dated for today could be used tomorrow - with travel on different routes between London, the Midlands and North West also encouraged after ticket acceptance was put in place with other operators. But there were also problems on Thameslink trains due to a signalling fault between St Albans and West Hampstead; and on Transport for Wales between Shrewsbury and Wrexham due to an emergency incident. Further north on ScotRail, there was disruption between Edinburgh and Helensburgh Central and between Airdrie and Balloch due to a fault on a train at Airdrie. The Met Office said low pressure would remain slow-moving across the British Isles today, maintaining a changeable theme that was also seen over the weekend. However it was cooler today than over the weekend - which saw highs of 21.6C (70.9F) in London - with a brisk breeze in the South and West. The Met Office has issued a yellow thunderstorm warning for northern and eastern areas of mainland Scotland from 11am until 10pm today.

By Wednesday, low pressure will continue to dominate the weather with many areas seeing a mix of sunshine and showers, which could be heavy and thundery in places. The Environment Agency has issued 22 flood alerts for England, all in southern areas This low pressure will then begin to move away to the east on Thursday, but it will again be sunny and wet for many areas – although western areas could turn drier. Eastern areas will still be under the influence of low pressure by Friday which will continue the showery theme, but western parts will likely see a drier day. The Outer Hebrides and the Isle of Skye had a separate warning for rain in place from midnight to 9am this morning but it is not expected to be as heavy.

        "content": "In recent months, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and others have pointed to an increase in food insecurity and “hunger hotspots” in various parts of Asia and the Pacific. While conflicts and climate crises can carry some blame, we must acknowledge that the slow but steady erosion of our region’s biodiversity is an equal or even more significant threat to our future food security. FAO’s most recent outlook report on Asia-Pacific’s forest sector found that biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in natural forests are declining along with the capacity of these forests to deliver water and soil protection, climate regulation, amenity and cultural values, and wood, foods, and medicines. Reversing this trend must be a priority for all countries in the region now and in the next decade to ensure our survival, especially in the face of dangerous climate change. While this biodiversity loss is a crisis for Asia and the Pacific in many ways, the impact it can have on our ability to achieve future food security poses a severe threat. FAO’s recent reports show that the Asia-Pacific region is home to half of the world’s undernourished people and that nearly 45% cannot afford a sustainable and healthy diet. At the heart of some of these nutrition challenges is a food system currently founded on a narrow genetic base of 10-15 crops. We have lost much of the diversity that was, historically, commonplace in our diets, and increasing dietary diversity is a key part of the solution to ending malnutrition. According to the ‘The State of the World’s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture,’ published by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture Assessments, biodiversity for food and agriculture (BFA) contributes to food security and nutrition in many ways. This includes enabling food to be produced in a wide range of environments, helping to maintain the stability of food supplies throughout the year and resilience to shocks such as droughts and pest outbreaks, and supplying a wide variety of nutritionally diverse foods. Indeed, wild biodiversity is an essential food source for many people, particularly in poorer parts of our region. It also provides raw materials for crop breeding programmes and contributes to the supply of many ecosystem services that support food production. So we all need to wake up to this urgent need to protect Asia-Pacific’s biodiversity better for the good of ourselves, our food security and nutritional health, and our environment, as well as to safeguard those of our future generations. This month, we observe the International Day for Biological Diversity. Its slogan, indeed its call to action, is that we must all “Be part of the Plan” to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by supporting actions called for in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. At FAO, we are working to that end to help our member nations enhance biodiversity and sustainability in agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry, mainly through updating action plans to reach the 2030 biodiversity targets. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure a sustainable food systems transformation across the region to achieve food security, nutrition, and livelihoods – especially for local communities and indigenous people who rely on the existing biodiversity. Given the importance and the increased demand for aquatic foods in our region and worldwide, FAO has committed to a vision for aquaculture transformation for Asia and the Pacific. This will enable the sustainable intensification of aquaculture by improving sustainability and reducing the environmental impacts of production. It also aims to harness the rich and diverse cultural foundation of aquaculture in this region by strengthening its contribution to food security and improved nutrition while securing livelihoods, socioeconomic development, and environmental recovery. Halting deforestation and forest degradation while enabling forest and landscape restoration are also vital components of addressing the challenge of biodiversity loss and climate change. 15 years ago, FAO and its partners UNDP and UN Environment launched the REDD+ Programme. ‘REDD+’ is the abbreviation for ‘Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries.’ As co-lead for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and host of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, FAO is working to support countries in upscaling restoration with an aim for better livelihoods and the environment. FAO also provides technical expertise directly linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). With food security as our mandate, ending poverty and reducing inequalities, FAO in Asia and the Pacific is responding to help shape national pathways for a transformation of food systems. As part of these transformative efforts at country and regional levels, it is imperative to promote sustainable natural resources management and protect critical ecosystems to conserve biodiversity and protect land, soil, and water – while reducing food loss and energy use. All of these approaches complement FAO’s overarching global framework to help our members achieve better production, better nutrition, better environment, and better lives for all—leaving no one behind. I believe that, together with many stakeholders, we can ‘walk the talk’ necessary to achieve this. That’s if everyone, including every woman and man in this region, steps forward to ‘Be part of the Plan’.

        "content": "SHREVEPORT, La. ( ) – Why do people leave coins on top of military gravestones? Similar practices exist in many cultures and have a history stretching back centuries. In modern times, this tradition is a way for service members to honor those who are no longer with us. It also shows the families that someone came to pay their respects and remember their loved ones. According to the , the tradition stretches back to the Roman Empire, where soldiers would insert coins into the mouths of fallen soldiers. The coins enabled them to pay the mythical boatman to take them across the River Styx into the afterlife. The U.S. military adopted the tradition of placing coins on service members’ graves during the Vietnam War. According to the DMA, anti-war sentiment created a charged political climate that could make it difficult to speak with the family members of their fallen comrades. Using the coins provided them a way to pay their respects peacefully. But there’s a deeper meaning behind each coin, depending on which was left at the gravesite. These coins are usually collected from gravesites periodically and used to maintain cemeteries. They can also go toward burial costs for homeless veterans. Another coin often left on the graves of military members is a “challenge coin.” These are small coins or medallions with the insignia of an organization or unit. They’re by their commanders to recognize them for their achievements. Although there are on how to use the coins in a challenge, they are also given as mementos. A service member might leave one on the grave of a person who served in their unit. A similar tradition is also . Although the origins of the ancient practice are unknown, placing small stones and pebbles on a Jewish gravesite signifies a desire to remember and honor loved ones.",

        "content": "TASHKENT - In the vast expanse of Asia, among the myriad of ancient cities, two stand out for their striking similarities and rich cultural heritage: Yazd in Iran and Khiva in Uzbekistan. Though separated by miles of desert and mountains, Yazd and Khiva each offer their own unique glimpses into the past, with architectural wonders that tell stories of resilience, faith, and artistry. Whether it’s the ingenious wind-catchers of Yazd or the stunning minarets of Khiva, these cities captivate the imagination and offer a deep connection to the distant past. Reading travelogues, we see that many sightseers have said visiting these cities is like stepping into a different era, where the echoes of history resonate through every alley and courtyard. For instance, the Jameh Mosque of Yazd, with its towering minarets and intricate tilework, stands as a testament to the city's Islamic heritage. The Zoroastrian Fire Temple, with a flame said to have been burning for over a thousand years, highlights the city’s diverse religious history. And in Khiva, the Djuma Mosque, with its forest of 212 wooden columns, offers a unique architectural experience. Here, madrasahs, such as those of Alla-Kulli-Khan and Muhammad Aminkhon, not only served as educational centers but also as hubs of social activity, reflecting the city's role as a center of learning and culture. When in comes to cultural festivals and traditions, both are vibrant with cultural practices and festivals. Yazd is renowned for its Nowruz (Persian New Year) celebrations and the unique Muharram rituals of Ashura, which attract visitors from around the world. These events offer a deep insight into the spiritual and social fabric of Iranian culture. Khiva, on the other hand, hosts the annual Khorezm Dance Festival, celebrating traditional Uzbek dance and music. This festival brings the city's streets to life with color and rhythm, offering visitors an immersive cultural experience. In February 2021, these two ancient cities were officially twinned through an online Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the mayors of Yazd and Khiva. This agreement underscored their cultural and historical connections and laid the groundwork for collaboration in cultural preservation and tourism development. The historical cores of Yazd and Khiva (Itchan Kala, which is the inner fortress of Khiva), have been recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage sites. This recognition is due to their well-preserved mosques, historic schools (madrasahs), caravanserais, rising minarets, and traditional houses. Yazd and Khiva have the potential to create a powerful partnership that enhances cultural exchange and boosts tourism. Here are soem proposals to enrich links between the two: cultural exchange programs, joint tourism packages, combined cultural festivals, collaborative digital platforms such as virtual tours and digital archives, joint social media campaigns, educational and research collaborations, enhanced transportation links, and joint restoration projects. And more significantly, producing films, documentaries, or series about Yazd and Khiva can significantly raise public awareness about their cultural, touristic, and historical significance. In fact, films and documentaries vigorously help bring the unique cultural heritage of Yazd and Khiva to life through compelling visuals and storytelling. By highlighting the intricate details of their architecture, traditions, and daily life, audiences can gain a deeper appreciation of these cities' rich histories. For example, a documentary featuring the wind-catchers of Yazd and the minarets of Khiva can visually demonstrate the ingenuity and aesthetic beauty of these architectural marvels. In addition, travel documentaries and feature films can inspire viewers to visit Yazd and Khiva by showcasing their stunning landscapes, historical sites, and vibrant cultures. All and all, creating a robust partnership between Yazd and Khiva helps promote sustainable tourism and ensures the preservation of their invaluable heritage for future generations. AFM",

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

        "content": "Dublin [Ireland], May 27 (ANI): Heinrich Malan extended his role as Ireland's head coach for two years until mid-2027. The decision to keep him in the top spot has been taken with an eye towards the 2027 Cricket World Cup. The focus during Malan's extended time as the head coach will be to ensure Ireland's qualification in the marquee tournament that is scheduled to be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The 43-year-old took charge of the Ireland men's team in March 2022 on a three-year contract. During his tenure, Ireland managed to qualify for the 2022 and 2024 T20 World Cup. But they missed out on a spot in the 2023 Cricket World Cup in India after suffering defeat in the World Cup qualifiers. Before departing with his team for the T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the USA, Malan expressed his excitement for the coming three years as he aims to develop the Ireland team across all three formats. \"I am delighted with the extension as it provides the squad and coaching staff a great deal more certainty as we build upon the foundations we have put in place over the last two years,\" Malan said in a statement released by Cricket Ireland. \"We are now a three-format squad and - despite our smaller talent pool to draw from compared to other Full Members - we have been gradually building a sustainable structure that ensures we can continue to compete and improve on all three fronts,\" he added. Malan talked about his aim to cultivate a better game sense in the team and create an environment where his players can play freely with confidence. \"One area I have been keen on developing is our players being able to better read the game situation and then, where they judge it appropriate, to have the freedom and confidence to try and impose their style and instincts on the game. Some of our younger players are literally learning this ability on the job, which means there are days they will fail, but failure is a key part of the learning process,\" Malan said. \"What we as coaches are looking for is evidence that those unsuccessful experiences are analysed and understood by the player and become part of the experience they can draw upon in future matches. This work has borne fruit in two successful T20 World Cup qualifying campaigns and our recent Test success. But we are all conscious that we've missed out on playing in the last two 50-over world cups, and qualification for the 2027 tournament will be one of the focus areas across the next three years,\" added Malan.

        "content": "With regard to the apparent ecological harm caused by homelessness (“Spring reveals a mess on Anchorage’s trails, and a vexing conversation about homelessness,” ADN, May 19): Contrary to repulsive depictions, homeless people historically leave the smallest ecological footprint. First and foremost, the majority of homeless don’t drive vehicles but walk or take public transportation. The “homeless shuffle” merely consists of cutting a path through the grass leading up to a soup kitchen. Wherein the homeless sit down, eat, get up and walk out empty-handed and with empty pockets. Where’s all the consumerism and trash coming from? There’s a deliberate illustrative demonization of the homeless afoot; organized sabotage of people living outdoors. Actual sabotage coupled with ad hominem attacks against the homeless resulting from too much burning of incense to Herbert Spencer and Ayn Rand is the problem; hence there is no political will to bring about sufficient affordable housing and other services. — Christopher Deile Anchorage Have something on your mind?

        "content": "TEHRAN - The commander of the Iranian Army's Ground Force has hailed Iran’s ability in managing to maintain order after the passing of President Ebrahim Raisi on May 19, contributing the success to the wise conduct of Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. “Thanks to the existence of a system based on the guardianship, divine favors, and wise presence of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, no disruption occurred in the work and assigned affairs of the country after this tragic incident,” Brigadier General Kioumars Heidari said during his speech at a military gathering. President Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, and six other officials perished during a helicopter crash in Iran’s mountainous northwestern region. Iran’s Leader appointed Vice President Mohammad Mokhber as the caretaker president a day after the tragic news and called for snap elections. In his meetings with the families of the martyrs, Ayatollah Khamenei expressed great sorrow over the passing of President Raisi and his companions but emphasized that their legacy would persist. “You lost one of the best humans that ever graced the face of the earth. There is, however, no option but to endure this [sadness] for almighty God,” he was filmed saying while talking to the family of the late Raisi after leading the funeral prayer for the martyr. Elections are set to take place on June 28.",

        "description": "Netanyahu pushed back at accusations that he has not empowered the negotiating team and that he has preferred to wage an un-winnable war rather than make a deal to return the hostages",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the IDF strike that killed 45 Palestinian civilians in Gaza a “tragic mistake” as he vowed never to wave the white flag of defeat as he rejected domestic and international calls to end the war. “Those who say they are exhausted that they are not ready or can not withstand the pressure,” Netanyahu told the Knesset plenum on Monday, “should hold up the white flag of defeat. I will not wave that kind of flag. I will continue to fight until we wave the flag of victory,” he stated. In a brief but rousing speech delivered as the international community increasingly believes that Hamas can not be defeated militarily, Netanyahu vowed to battle on. Opposition leader MK Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) called on Netanyahu to resign, due to his failed policies, primarily the Hamas-led invasion of Israel on October 7, in which over 1,200 people were killed and another 252 were seized as hostages. “Mr. Prime Minister, why are you still here [in office]?” Lapid said during the 40-signature debate which he initiated. “In what world does the prime minister who is responsible for [October 7] the greatest disaster that has happened to the Jewish people since the Holocaust remain prime minister? In what world do you not come before the plenum, ask for forgiveness from the people of Israel... – and go home?” But when the plenum was asked to vote, 50 of the 120 Knesset members voted to support Netanyahu’s policies, while only 39 backed Lapid’s call for him to quit. Netanyahu defended his efforts to secure the release of the hostages. Although he was able to free 105 of the captives during a deal in November, a second deal has eluded him. A negotiation process, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, has dragged on, without any visible sign of a possible deal, even as high-level talks were held, including in Paris over the weekend between Mossad Chief David Barnea, CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammad Al-Thani. Netanyahu pushed back at accusations that he has not empowered the negotiating team and that he has preferred to wage an unwinnable war rather than make a deal to return the hostages. \"I completely reject the abominable lie, that I do not give the negotiating team the mandate when asked, and do not respond to its requests,” he said. “From the end of December and until now, I received five requests from the negotiating team to expand the mandate, to allow flexible terms, and I authorized all of them,” Netanyahu explained. He blamed the absence of a deal on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, stressing that he was the “obstacle” to a deal. Night after night television studies repeat false claims and spin about the talks that only harm the families and give Sinwar an excuse not to make a deal, Netanyahu explained. The pressure that should be directed to Sinwar “in whose basements the hostages are kept” is instead being leveled at “the Israeli government.” “Israel is repeatedly asked to make more concessions and more concessions So why should Sinwar get stressed? He is sitting in his bunker, rubbing his hands with pleasure, and is happy that others are doing the work for him,” Netanyahu said. “The pressure directed from home and abroad towards the Israeli government, which is fighting with all its might to return the hostages, only hardens the positions of Sinwar, who demands from Israel surrender conditions that endanger its existence, and therefore we cannot agree to them,” Netanyahu said. The prime minister also spoke of the importance of continuing the Rafah operation, a military campaign that has drawn global condemnation, with the International Court of Justice ordering Israel to halt any military campaign that would destroy the Palestinian group, in whole or in part. The IDF has focused on targeted strikes, killing two high-level Hamas operatives on Sunday night, Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. The strike, however, set off an explosion into a nearby safe zone for civilians, in which 45 civilians were killed and scores of others were wounded. Netanyahu in describing the incident said, “Despite our best effort not to harm those not involved, unfortunately, a tragic mistake happened last night. We are investigating the incident, we will draw conclusions because this is our policy.” He stressed that separately the IDF had managed to safely evacuate over a million civilians from Gaza.He urged the Israeli public not to listen to the pundits, former politicians, and generals, who painted a false picture of defeat “I hear in the studio the voices of despondency... that say it’s impossible to win.” These voices note the pressure against Israel from the “international community [and] America,” Netanyahu said, as he stressed that he did not plan to be constrained by the global community. “Citizens of Israel, if you want weakness, despondency, surrender – listen to the studios. But if you want power, spirit, and victory – listen to the warriors.,” Netanyahu stated. “The goals of the war, have not changed,” Netanyahu said. “To be victorious over Hamas, return all the hostages, ensure that Gaza won’t pose a threat to Israel, and return the residents of the North safely to their homes.” “These remain our objectives,” he added. “If we surrender, we won’t get all our hostages back. If we surrender, we will give a great victory to terrorism, a great victory to Iran, to its axis of evil, and to all those seeking our destruction,” Netanyahu said. “I am not ready to surrender and fold. I am not ready to end the war before all its objectives are completed. Our heroes did not die in vain.”",

        "description": "The Portland Trail Blazers legend and Hall of Famer died of cancer at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday.",
        "content": "PORTLAND, Ore. — People across the basketball world are sharing their memories of Portland Trail Blazers and NBA legend Bill Walton, who died of cancer at the age of 71. Walton, considered one of the best players in Trail Blazers history, led Portland to its lone NBA championship in 1977 and was named Finals MVP. He won a second championship in 1986 with the Boston Celtics, his final full season in the league. Walton was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. He was also beloved for his work as a sportscaster after his playing career and his life-long work as an advocate for social and political issues (and the Pac-12). Here are some of the reactions from the NBA world: Adam Silver , NBA commissioner: \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know him and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many colleagues and friends.\" Julius Erving , NBA legend and Hall of Famer: \"I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc\" I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed. Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc pic.twitter.com/GAEt1DRH8N Magic Johnson , NBA legend and Hall of Famer: \"Rest in peace to a friend, 2X NBA Champion, Hall of Famer, and one of the most skilled centers we’ve ever seen Bill Walton! His NCAA Championship performance as a UCLA Bruin against Memphis is by far the most dominate NCAA Championship performance ever - he shot 21 for 22 and had us all mesmerized! That’s when I first fell in love with his basketball game. They talk about Jokic being the most skilled center but Bill Walton was first! From shooting jump shots to making incredible passes, he was one of the smartest basketball players to ever live. Bill was a great ambassador for college basketball and the NBA, and he will be sorely missed. Cookie and I send our condolences and prayers to his wife Lori, kids Luke, Nathan, Chris, and Adam, and all of his loved ones.\" Ron Wyden , Oregon senator: \"Bill Walton brought Rip City our greatest on-the-court thrills by leading the Trail Blazers on a magical run to the title in 1977. And for decades after his playing days, he brought an entire nation his good nature on life and basketball. I will miss my friend Bill dearly.\" Daryl Morey , Philadelphia 76ers executive: \"RIP Bill Walton - my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992.\" RIP Bill Walton - my favorite example of his endless commitment to helping others is when he stepped in to assist the Lithuanian national basketball team as they broke away from the Soviet Union before facing the original Dream Team in 1992 pic.twitter.com/eZVtBZMOBX Los Angeles Clippers : \"We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd. The Clippers organization extends our deepest condolences to the Walton family, as well as our utmost gratitude. Bill was a singular force, and we were privileged to know him.\" Pac-12 Conference : \"The Pac-12 is and will forever be the Conference of Champions not because of trophies or medals, but because of the amazing individuals, champions in life, who compete in this league and cement legacies of excellence. There is no better example of this 'Conference of Champions' spirit than Bill Walton. We are heartbroken and devastated to learn of Bill's untimely passing. We offer our sincere condolences and thoughts of love to Bill's family and the entire Pac-12, UCLA Bruins and basketball communities. Bill's list of accomplishments on the court, as massive as they are, are only outweighed by the quality of his character and beauty of his one-of-a-kind loving spirit.\" Sam Amick , longtime NBA reporter: \"Thoughts and prayers to the Walton family and legions of friends that the legendary Bill Walton made in his 71 years. He was larger than life in every sense, and sharing his positive energy and humor until the end.\" Marc Stein , longtime NBA reporter: \"Such incredibly sad news. Bill Walton was one of the most magnetic, engaging, basketball-loving personalities I ever encountered covering this game. He will be so, so, SO missed. Most heartfelt wishes to his son Luke, their whole family and everyone who knew and loved Bill.\" Kevin O'Connor , longtime NBA reporter: \"RIP Bill Walton. Legendary player, incredible broadcaster, and authentic human.\" RIP Bill Walton.

Bill was just a joy to be around, one of the most passionate, engaging, fascinating people I've had the honor of knowing. Always generous with his time and insights. Condolences to his family.\" John Hollinger , former NBA team executive, current NBA reporter: \"Bill Walton was 1 of 1. Always passionate about the game, always had a warm greeting for everyone he saw in the arena - even people like me that he barely knew. What a sad day for basketball.\" Chris Vernon , NBA podcast host: \"RIP Bill Walton. One of my absolute favs. He wrote this letter to my son. Will treasure it forever.\" RIP Bill Walton. One of my absolute favs. He wrote this letter to my son. Will treasure it forever. pic.twitter.com/m8LY3psZnx Mike Barrett , former Trail Blazers broadcaster: \"Had an intense love for life. Happy and peaceful, seemingly always. Always made you feel important and honored. What a gift he was, and what a legacy he leaves.\" Casey Holdahl , longtime Trail Blazers team reporter: \"I wrote a dumb story (my specialty) about players wearing shorter shorts, so I figured I'd reach out to Bill not expecting I'd hear back. Bill ended up talking for an hour (his specialty) with complete sincerity about the virtues of short shorts. And that really encapsulates Bill. Never too big or serious to make you feel silly or small. Always made you feel important because of the time he was willing to give you. Willing to be vulnerable in ways most people avoid at all costs.\" Danny Marang , Portland radio host, host of Jacked Ramsays podcast: \"I remember in my earliest years not liking Walton on game calls. Then, I grew to love his love and appreciation for the people and the game. 'Throw it down, big man!' become one of my favorite calls. Man, this sucks. RIP to a true 1 of 1. No one will ever do it like he did.\" Orlando Sanchez , KGW sports anchor and reporter: \"Heartbreaking to hear the passing of the legendary Bill Walton. One of a kind. Got the opportunity to chat with him a few times over the years. My favorite line of his was, \"I'm the luckiest guy in the world.\" Condolences to his family and loved ones. RIP to a legend.\" Jay Allen , former on-air TV and radio host/reporter for the Trail Blazers: \"Devastated to hear the news of Bill Walton's passing. Through my work with KXL and the Blazers, I had the honor of dining in and broadcasting from his San Diego home. One of my cherished memories of Bill was picking him up at PDX before a Fred Meyer remote. We had some extra time so he asked me to take him to Multnomah Falls. As we walked the trail up to the bridge, people stopped us every few moments to thank him, ask for a picture or autograph, or just say hello. He was patient and gracious with each fan. I will never forget the kindness and generosity he showed me over the years. My condolences to his wife, Lori, and his family. #RIPbigredhead\" Ian Karmel , famous comedian and Blazers fan: \"I'm not sure who is the greatest Blazer of all time, but Bill Walton is the most Blazer of all time. ... This is of course very sad, and especially sad for the people who knew him and aren't just fans from afar like me... but imagine being on your death bed looking back at THAT life. He really went out and did it.\" Dave McMenamin , ESPN NBA reporter: \"We get caught up in 'greatness' conversations about NBA players ad nauseam - Who’s the GOAT? Is this guy better than that guy? Would that guy's game translate to this era? Take some time to read the tributes pouring in about Bill Walton today. That's true greatness.\" Chris Vannini , The Athletic senior writer: The best of Bill Walton on commentary: pic.twitter.com/MqwNQZj2dg This story will be updated with more reactions as they continue to come in.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA:",

        "content": "In today’s digital age, the convenience and speed of electronic payment methods have significantly reduced the reliance on physical currency. Cambodia, like many countries, has gradually transitioned towards digital payments. However, despite this shift, physical currencies remain relevant in various situations where electronic payment methods may not be accessible or convenient. Driving Factors for Digital Payments in Cambodia Over the years, Cambodia has witnessed changes in consumer preferences and technological advancements, leading to the growing adoption of digital payment methods. Factors driving this shift include: 1.Technological Advancements: The growth of mobile banking services and the widespread availability of smartphones have facilitated the advancement of digital payments in Cambodia. With a significant portion of the population owning smartphones, accessing digital payment platforms has become more accessible. 2. Government Initiatives: The Cambodian government has actively promoted digital payments and financial inclusion. The introduction of platforms like Bakong, a centralized digital payment system, has supported the transition from cash-based to cashless transactions. Bakong has seen a substantial increase in transactions, indicating the acceptance and adoption of digital payments in Cambodia’s financial ecosystem. 3. Changing Consumer Preferences: With the increasing digitization of services, Cambodian consumers have grown acceptance of digital payment methods. Electronic transactions’ convenience, efficiency, and security have resonated with many individuals, driving the shift toward digital payments. The Continual Relevance of Physical Currency While digital payment methods offer convenience and efficiency, there are several reasons why physical currency remains relevant in the digital age, especially in the Cambodian context. 1. Accessibility: Despite the growing adoption of digital payment platforms, not everyone can access smartphones or electronic devices required for digital transactions. In rural areas and among elderly populations, cash is still prevalent as it remains the only means of conducting transactions. According to the Visa Consumer Payment Attitudes Study in 2023, money continues to be a predominant form of payment across various demographics in Cambodia, particularly in less urbanized areas with limited access to digital infrastructure. 2. Security and Privacy: Electronic transactions offer convenience but pose cybersecurity risks such as hacking, identity theft, and fraud. Physical currency provides a level of anonymity that electronic payments do not offer. Cash transactions do not leave a trail of purchases, offering individuals greater privacy in their financial dealings. Furthermore, cash transactions are not susceptible to technical glitches or connectivity issues that may hinder digital payment methods. 3. Emergency Situations and Disruptions: Electronic payment systems may become inaccessible during emergencies such as natural disasters, power outages, or system failures. Physical currency ensures that individuals can still make essential purchases when digital infrastructure is interrupted. With its high exposure to climate-related hazards like floods, Cambodia faces the risk of disrupted digital transactions due to infrastructure damage. Cash becomes a vital medium of exchange during such periods. 4. Merchant Acceptance: Merchants may not accept electronic payments in certain situations due to technical issues or connectivity problems. In these cases, cash remains a reliable form of payment that guarantees transaction completion. It eliminates any uncertainties associated with accepting electronic payment methods, ensuring smooth and immediate transactions. The Ongoing Relevance of Physical Currency While digital payment methods gain popularity, physical currencies play an essential role in the global economy and daily life. Their universal acceptance, instant settlement, anonymity, security, and promotion of financial inclusion make cash a crucial component of the payment system. Even with the rapid growth of digital payments, physical currency will likely remain relevant for the foreseeable future.

        "content": "The Nigerian Army Headquarters said security agencies have finally resolved to reopen the Banex plaza after one week of closure, following a brutal attack on soldiers. Disclosing the new development, spokesman of the army, Major General Onyema Nwachukwu noted that the decision was taken after a high-level meeting convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser including the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, Commissioner of Police FCT, the FCT Director of the Department of State Services, the Leadership and Management of Banex Plaza. The meeting also had a representative from the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the National Chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders association. Nwachukwu said “the primary objective of this meeting was to identify and apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the continued security of the Federal Capital Territory. “The following resolutions were agreed upon: Immediate reopening of Banex Plaza: Banex Plaza will be reopened immediately to the public, closure of Shop C93: The leadership of Banex Plaza is instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect.” The Army spokesman said the owners of the shop who orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers will be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. He urged market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. “Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action,” Nwachukwu said. He stated that the Army will investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack. “It must be reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel are not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order,” Nwachukwu said. “We therefore urge members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. “There are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities. It is imperative that these channels are utilized to maintain order and respect for those who serve and protect our nation. “The Nigerian Army remains committed to ensuring the safety and security of all citizens and will continue to work diligently to prevent such incidents in the future.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "content": "TEHRAN – A prominent member of Russia's State Duma has praised the late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi for strengthening Iran-Russia relations and enabling collaborative solutions to global issues. Alexander Babakov, a deputy of the State Duma (Russian parliament), emphasized that Raisi's leadership facilitated significant progress not only on regional matters but also on a global scale. In an interview with Iranian news outlet IRNA, Babakov shared his thoughts after signing the memorial book for the President Raisi and his companions, who tragically died in a helicopter crash on May 19. This signing took place at the Iranian Embassy's ceremonial hall in Moscow. Babakov noted, \"Raisi's contributions to advancing Iran-Russia relations were highly valuable. His presidency occurred during a very challenging period filled with various events, and he navigated through these times admirably.\" Babakov commended Raisi's unwavering commitment to his ideals. \"Mr. Raisi's steadfast belief and insistence on moving towards his goals are worthy of great respect and recognition,\" he said. Highlighting Raisi's achievements, Babakov pointed to Iran's membership in the BRICS group and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. \"This achievement underscores the late president's sense of responsibility towards the Iranian people,\" he added. Expressing his condolences, Babakov described Raisi's passing as a significant loss. \"While his death is a great loss, we believe that not only will the historical memory and recollections persist, but more importantly, the actions taken by President Raisi will continue to inspire future endeavors.\" Prior to this, condolences were offered by various high-ranking Russian officials, including the President, Prime Minister, heads of both parliamentary chambers (the Federation Council and the State Duma), the Secretary of the Security Council, the Foreign Minister, the head of the Duma's International Committee, the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church, the head of the Muslim Religious Affairs Department, media managers, activists, and several other Russian personalities. The head of the Russian State Duma also traveled to Iran to attend the funeral of the martyred president on behalf of Russia. The helicopter carrying Raisi and his entourage crashed around afternoon on Sunday as it was on its way to Tabriz, the capital of East Azerbaijan, from a location on the border with the Republic of Azerbaijan where the Iranian president had opened a major dam project. Rescuers found the wreckage of the helicopter early on Monday after hours of extensive search which involved more than 70 teams. Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian and two senior provincial officials along with crew members and bodyguards also died as a result of the crash. Vice-President Mohammad Mokhber has been appointed to assume interim duties after the death of the president. In the wake of the passing of the Iranian President, the country’s constitutional mandate outlined in Article 131 necessitates the swift organization of presidential elections in a timeframe of 50 days. A council comprising representatives from the judiciary, legislative, and the First Vice President is tasked with overseeing this transition. Following the council's deliberations and the subsequent approval by the Guardian Council, plans have been set in motion for early nationwide presidential elections scheduled for June 28, 2024.",

UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Walton, a legend in college basketball at UCLA and in the NBA, carved out a post-NBA career as a college basketball announcer at ESPN. His offbeat and often humorous commentary during games arguably made him more famous than he was as a player. Here’s some of the social media reaction to his death. Rachel Nichols, then host of ESPN’s “The Jump” show, recalls when Walton came on took a framed photo of Bill Russell, and “ .” Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey wrote of Walton’s “ “Absolutely crushed to hear of the passing of the legendary Bill Walton, whose intellect, sense of humor, and zest for life were even bigger than he was,” ESPN host Mike Greenberg wrote on X. “He was also, , with a game that was decades ahead of his time - he’d have been perfect in today’s NBA.” Former NFL star Julian Edelman called Walton “ .”",

        "content": "Google has announced a $1 million grant to support the development of the \"Auschwitz in Front of Your Eyes\" project through its philanthropic arm, Google.org. The initiative aims to deepen awareness and knowledge about , reaching additional audiences worldwide through a live-streamed virtual tour. The project enables people unable to physically visit the camp, including those in remote locations, to engage with the history of Auschwitz. The virtual tour, conducted by a guide, includes , multimedia materials, and interactive opportunities for participants to ask questions. \"The funding will help develop the technological platform and its accessibility, including real-time subtitles, AI-based translation into multiple languages, and the digitization of survivor testimonies,\" said Rowan Barnett, for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. \"This support will also provide comprehensive training for guides and enhance the capacity to bring such visits to large communities worldwide, including partnerships with schools to educate more students about the Holocaust.\" The online guided tour program, \"Auschwitz in Front of Your Eyes,\" was recently launched by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum. This innovative initiative provides a virtual visit to the former German Nazi concentration and extermination camp. The two-hour tour is divided into two parts: Auschwitz I and Birkenau. Educators conduct the tours live, utilizing multimedia materials, archival photographs, artistic works, documents, and testimonies of survivors. Group tours are available in seven languages: English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Polish, and Spanish. Individual tours are offered in English, German, and Polish. Bookings can be made through visit.auschwitz.org. \"This form of visit differs from on-site tours primarily because, in the online version, we do not present the museum exhibitions,\" said Tomasz Michaldo, project coordinator at the Museum. \"Technology allows us to somewhat transfer the content of the exhibition to the historical site, as many things can be additionally shown on the screen. During the online tour, it will be possible, thanks to video recordings, to enter several spaces that are either not accessible to visitors, such as Block 10 in the former Auschwitz I camp, or are located too far from the regular tour route, such as the Sauna building in the former Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp.\" Dr. Piotr M. A. Cywiński, the director of the Auschwitz Museum, emphasized the importance of making the Memorial and its resources accessible globally to confront issues related to antisemitism, racial hatred, and societal threats. \"Our mission is to commemorate the victims and preserve this universal memory, on which we have built and continue to build our post-war identity. Although thousands of people visit the authentic site every day, this unique technology will enable us to reach people in the most remote corners of the world,\" he said. \"We hope that this will strengthen the memory that actually gives us the power to act responsibly for the repair of the world, making it a better place for our children and grandchildren.\" The online platform is a collaborative effort between the Museum, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, and companies such as AppsFlyer and DISKIN. Wojciech Soczewica, director general of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, noted the project's responsibility to preserve the authenticity of the historical site while making educational content accessible worldwide.

Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah.",
        "content": "Brussels, May 27 (AP) Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu's government does not like,\" Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it's too heavy. It's too important.” Spain, Ireland and Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. While dozens of countries have recognised a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by Ireland, Spain and non-EU member Norway might make on the ground. The recognition, however, is a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Angry words abounded, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognising a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence. Those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares slammed the comments, and said his colleagues from Ireland and Norway were “also receiving absolutely unjustified and absolutely reprehensible provocations from our Israeli colleague” because of their plans to recognise Palestine. \"In the face of those who want to divide us with any type of intimidating propaganda, the unity of Europeans is essential to send a very powerful message,\" he said. Also on Monday, Slovenia's Prime Minister Robert Golob said his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. Slovenia launched the recognition procedure earlier this month, and Golob has been under pressure to speed up the process since Spain, Norway and Ireland announced they would go ahead with recognition. Borrell said the actions of the Israeli government, including plans to stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, could no longer be reconciled with the idea he had about the state of Israel. “From now on, I will never again say Israel,' (but) will say Netanyahu government' because it is this government who is taking these decisions,\" Borrell said. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the October 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel's ensuing offensive that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The latest attacks have centred on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 45 people Sunday, hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said such strikes will have long-standing repercussions. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,? he told SKY TG24. The strikes came after the UN's top court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. Albares said Spain and other countries asked Borrell “to provide a list of what measures the European Union could apply\" to make Israel heed the ICJ's ruling and explain what the EU has done in the past in similar circumstances \"\"when there has been a flagrant violation of international law.” The joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries' ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the October 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Albares criticised the treatment of the European ambassadors in Israel. “We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” he said. “But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall for any provocation that distances us from our goal,” he added. “Our aim is to recognise the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.” (AP)",

In a message conveyed on Sunday, Ayatollah Khamenei expressed his deep sympathy over the departure of Nasrallah's mother, Nahdiya Safieddine. The Leader commended the deceased for raising the “tireless Seyyed of resistance”, Hassan Nasrallah. Furthermore, Ayatollah Khamenei invoked divine mercy and forgiveness upon her soul, while also wishing success to Nasrallah and his comrades in their steadfast stance within the vast front of resistance. On May 25, Hezbollah announced with profound sorrow the passing of Umm Hassan after a prolonged battle with illness. The Lebanese group lauded Umm Hassan as a devoted and virtuous mother who nurtured a devout, diligent, and honorable family. \"The loss is grievous and the sorrow is great, but we are consoled by the decree of Allah and His will, accepting His judgment and His wisdom,\" the statement read. Resistance groups across West Asia have also offered condolences to Hezbollah’s secretary general over the passing. “With great sorrow, we received the news of the passing of your honorable mother. We extend our condolences and sympathy to Your Eminence, at a time when our people in Lebanon are standing in solidarity with their brothers in Palestine,” said Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political chief, in a Sunday statement. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance movement also expressed “sincere condolences and sympathy” towards the Hezbollah chief.",
