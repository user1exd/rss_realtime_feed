        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. Meanwhile, an animal park in northern Mexico confirmed it has received reports that at least a hundred parrots, bats and other animals have died, apparently of dehydration. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a heat stroke, noting a “synergy” of factors — including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat — appeared to be to blame, while saying a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. But with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. In the northern state of San Luis Potosi, Ena Buenfil, the director of the Selva Teenek eco-park, told The Associated Press on Monday that her facility has been overwhelmed as parrots, bats, toucans have died due to the heat. Buenfil said when the heat wave began in mid-May their clinic to help animals quickly filled up with sick birds and they received a wave of reports by locals finding dead or suffering birds. Because of scarce resources by authorities, Buenfil said the number is likely only a small percentage of the animals affected, but added that their organization has worked with Civil Protection to aid some birds. Buenfil said birds mainly die of dehydration in the heat, and are often disproportionately affected because they don't have anywhere to store water. Meanwhile, bats would become dehydrated sleeping in the beating afternoon heat. She recommended that locals put out bowls of water for animals. “We’ve never seen a situation like what’s happening right now,” she said, adding if they see more heat peaks like this one “there is not going to be much we can do for the animals.” “There are going to be a lot of casualties to the ecosystem if we continue this trend of heat waves in the region,” said Buenfil. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out .

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA:",

        "content": "SAN JOSE — San Jose police are investigating the city’s 15th homicide of this year, a man who was found dead from a gunshot wound in an apartment complex near a busy shopping mall. The killing occurred at about 2:45 p.m. on Sunday at an apartment in the 1000 block of Blossom River Way, a street that’s adjacent to the bustling Westfield Oakridge shopping center in South San Jose. “When officers arrived, they located an adult male victim who was neither conscious nor breathing and was suffering from at least one gunshot wound,” the San Jose Police Department stated in a prepared release. Police officers immediately began to administer life-saving measures to the victim and at the same time called emergency medical responders to the apartment. But the man died in the apartment, police said. The victim, described as an adult male, wasn’t immediately identified. “The suspect is unknown and fled the scene prior to police arrival,” the police department said. “The motive and circumstances surrounding the event are under investigation.” The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office will release the man’s name once he is identified and his next of kin are notified. Anyone with information is asked to email Detective Sgt. Julien Taylor at 4257@sanjoseca.gov or Detective Mike Harrington 4365@sanjoseca.gov, or call 408-277-5283.",

According to the Monetary Policy Report of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) released on Monday, forecasters surveyed said they expect “within-target inflation over the policy horizon, although settling at the upper end of the target range as uncertainty lingers.” “Upside risks continue to dominate due mainly to supply disruptions,” the BSP said. This is why the BSP is being “very careful” not to cut rates too early to avoid stoking inflation. READ: BSP unlikely to cut interest rates too soon this year, says think tank While average price growth is expected to return to the target band in 2024 after settling above that range in the last two years, BSP Senior Assistant Governor Iluminada Sicat said the central bank was treading lightly when it comes to the timing of easing. “Indeed, we are anticipating that higher inflation rate will be observed from May to July but thereafter, we are projecting that inflation will revert to the target range,” Sicat said at an economic forum on Monday. “We foresee inflation to be within the target, but on the upper end of the target range. That is precisely the reason why the BSP has been very careful not to bring down interest rates too early, or else we may not be able to address some of the upside risks that we are seeing in the future,” she added. The peso became more volatile last week after Governor Eli Remolona Jr. struck a less hawkish tone and floated the possibility of two 25-basis point rate cuts this year, with the first one possibly in August and ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s own easing. READ: BSP chief unfazed by U.S. Fed’s hawkish signals The central bank chief said he was not worried about such a move’s impact on the peso, which may come under pressure if local yields become less attractive to capital inflows while interest rates are still high elsewhere. This month, the BSP’s policy rate was kept at a 17-year high of 6.5 percent for the fifth straight meeting. READ: BSP keeps key rate at 17-year high as inflation risk remains Remolona assured the market that the BSP has “ample reserves” to defend the peso against speculative attacks. A weak currency—which breached the 58-per-dollar level last week—can fan inflation by making imports more expensive. For his part, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, who also joined the same economic briefing, said a rate cut in the third quarter was “very much possible.” “It all depends on the inflation outlook and I suppose what the Fed does. Those spreads should not be too different between the US and the Philippines or else you might have a flight to safety,” said Recto, who represents President Marcos’ Cabinet in the Monetary Board.

Surely, I don’t expect interest rates to go any higher. If not, there’s time they’ll start going down. Maybe 150 basis points in the next two years,” he added. INQ",

        "description": "\"If you believe in yourself, then layoff can be a blessing in disguise,\" says Pakistan's right-arm fast",
        "content": "Pakistan paceman Haris Rauf believes that the three months he spent on the sidelines injured with a dislocated shoulder could yet prove a \"blessing in disguise\", as he gears up for the Twenty20 World Cup. The 30-year-old fast bowler made an encouraging return to competitive cricket, taking 2-34, in the second match of Pakistan's warm-up series against T20 world champions England in Birmingham on Saturday. \"I was injured [for] the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,\" he told a pre-match press conference in Cardiff on Monday ahead of the third T20. \"Because you have time to recover and reassess your game-plans. I felt good coming back to cricket. When you play for your country, it makes you very proud.\" As for the mental and physical strain of returning from injury for a fast bowler, Rauf said: \"It's hard. It's a struggle during your rehab, and it's difficult when you come back to maintain that pace and accuracy. But if you believe in yourself, it makes things easier. When I wasn't in the team and rehabbing, I had a lot of time to think about my game and work on myself. \"Thankfully I'm back now, and the World Cup is coming up.\" Rauf's return at Edgbaston could not prevent Pakistan suffering a 23-run defeat by England as they fell 1-0 behind in the four-match series with two to play following a washed-out opener. But Rauf insisted Pakistan, the 2009 T20 world champions, remained in optimistic mood ahead of their opening match at this year's global showpiece against co-hosts the United States in Dallas on June 6. \"When you lose a game it hurts, but as a team, we are confident,\" he said. \"We feel we can beat any opposition on any day. We've done it in the past, too. When you make mistakes you learn and try not to repeat those mistakes. We're looking to play better in the next few games and make a comeback. \"The camp is relaxed. We're enjoying ourselves. We're trying to follow our game-plans and execute them well. The results haven't often been in our favour recently but if you stick to your plans they can sometimes follow.\" England will lock horns against Pakistan in the T20I at the Sophia Gardens in Cardiff on Tuesday, May 28. The hosts are 1-0 up in the four-match series after defeating Babar Azam and his men in the second T20Is courtesy of standout performances from captain Jos Buttler, Will Jacks, Moeen Ali, and Jofra Archer. Pakistan: Usman Khan, Mohammad Rizwan, Babar Azam (c), Fakhar Zaman, Azam Khan (wk), Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Amir, Abrar Ahmed England: Jonny Bairstow, Phil Salt (wk), Will Jacks, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali (c), Sam Curran, Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, Chris Jordan, Reece Topley",

The SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise)-beggary scheme has been launched by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. At the outset, the DC took a detailed assessment of the proposals received from various NGOs under SMILE-Beggary Scheme.

On the occasion, the DC stressed on coordinated efforts by all stakeholders for effective implementation of SMILE (Support for Marginalized Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprises) scheme.

        "content": "MOHENJO DARO: Sindh on Monday recorded over 52°C (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) temperature, making it the highest reading of the sizzling summer and close to the country’s record high amid the ongoing heatwave, said the Met Office. Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, temperatures rose as high as 52.2°C (126 °F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Shahid Abbas told Reuters . The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 °C (128.3 °F) and 54 °C (129.2 °F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers. But with the current heatwave, shops are seeing almost no footfall. \"The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,\" Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town. \"I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.\" Close to Ali's shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop's shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water. The highest temperature recorded in the country was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54°C (129.2 °F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said PMD Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz. The heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in the province, including Karachi.",

Ridley and Boyd will join Pro Bowl WR in an effort to improve an offense that averaged just 180.4 passing yards per game, 29th in the . Boyd, who spent the past five seasons with new Titans head coach Brian Callahan in Cincinnati, is excited to reunite with his former offensive coordinator, . Obviously Callahan is here and that's my guy. He's a heckuva coach, and I've been a part of his offense for a while now, so I just felt like it was a good fit. It just felt right. Tyler Boyd Is One of the League's Best Slot WRs Since Boyd entered the league in 2016, he's been uber-productive out of the slot. Tyler Boyd Career Stats In The Slot Receptions 390 1st Receiving Yards 4,813 1st First Downs 233 1st Titans' starting QB Will Levis struggled mightily throughout his rookie season, primarily due to the lack of receiving talent around him. Boyd can provide that safe underneath option when plays break down, making life easier for both Levis and Brian Callahan. Tennessee's about his relationship with the Titans' new offensive weapon: He's definitely got an advantage over any normal free agent because he's been in quite a bit of the offense in terms of names, expectations, route details, and coaching points he's heard over the last five years. Boyd took his time finding a new destination after playing eight seasons with the Bengals, ultimately landing in Tennessee on a one-year deal worth $4.5 million. While the Titans are still suffering the effects of the A.J. Brown trade, they're hopeful Hopkins, Ridley, and Boyd's committee approach can keep them competitive in the .

        "description": "The programme has unlocked Sh11.4 billion in education aid since 2004.",
        "content": "The Kenya Scholar Access Programme (KenSAP) has ridden on an average annual budget of $300,000 (Sh39.3 million) to unlock more than $87 million (Sh11.4 billion) in financial aid to close to 300 bright students in Kenya. Last week, 22 students were offered American university scholarships worth $7.5 Million (Sh980 million) for 2024 entrance to top Ivy League universities and colleges. They have been admitted to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Amherst, Brown, Claremont McKenna, Colgate, Dartmouth, Davidson, Hamilton, Middlebury, Northwestern, Smith, Tufts, University of Pennsylvania, University of Toronto, Wellesley, and Williams. The scholars comprise the top performers from the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education(KCSE) Class of 2023, selected from all 47 counties in Kenya, and come from underprivileged backgrounds. KenSAP pays for students to participate in its free residential university access programme for nearly six months, guiding them through the American university application process and teaching them the skills they will need to excel in American universities. The universities provide scholarship packages that cover a comprehensive range of expenses, including tuition fees, accommodations, meals, travel costs, and other costs of attendance. The programme continues to provide students with guidance, mentorship, and support while they are studying at university. This financial assistance ensures that the scholars can focus on their academic pursuits without the burden of financial constraints, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in their new educational environments. Speaking during the dinner gala to celebrate the scholars, the principal benefactor and chairman of KenSAP’s Board of Directors, Charles Field-Marsham said it is their commitment to nurture the brightest minds in Kenya from disadvantaged backgrounds. \"By providing these exceptional students with the resources they need, we are not only investing in their futures but also the future of the country and bringing bright Kenyan minds to places all across the world,'' Field-Marsham said. “This achievement shows the potential of a true global citizen within you but there is still much hard work ahead of you to achieve your potential.\" Each year, KenSAP selects 20 students from more than 1,000 highly qualified applicants. Just to apply, candidates must rank among the top 1⁄10 of one per cent of all test takers on the KCSE. KenSAP’s selection process, like that of the universities to which its students apply, is holistic, taking into consideration a range of criteria beyond the purely academic, such as family background, extracurricular accomplishments, commitment to community development, and leadership potential. The selected students spend 20 weeks in residential training free of charge, with KenSAP covering all of their costs of attendance. In this training programme, they prepare for university entrance Since 2006, every student taken into the programme has earned admission, with full financial aid, to a distinguished American college or university. Since its inception in 2004, more than 80 KenSAP beneficiary students have returned to Kenya to work at leading companies and institutions. The programme was launched when Kenyatta University Professor Mike Boit and American journalist friend John Manners initiated a successful pilot scheme with a group of five students which was a year later scaled to 12-15 students. The founding sponsor Charles Field-Marsham stepped in to ensure management stability and financial sustainability for the programme, providing 95 per cent of its funding until 2017, when he and Alan Davidson, KenSAP’s current executive director, led the programme to a more sustainable fundraising approach. Nowadays, the programe relies on alumni to fundraise almost 20 per cent of the annual budget, and in the past few years, they have given more than $350,000 of their own money back to KenSAP. The team has also been finding other sources of sustainable financial support through Kenyan corporates such as those in attendance at the Annual Charity Dinner Gala. The organisation's vision aligns with a time when private and public stakeholders are being called up to embrace sustainable practices by adopting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guide to assist in the attainment of inclusive and equitable quality education.",

        "content": "WARSAW, May 27: Defense officials in NATO member Poland on Monday presented a plan to strengthen anti-drone surveillance and on-ground military defense through a system of fortifications and barriers along about 700 kilometers (430 miles) of its eastern border with Russia and Russian ally Belarus. The government says Poland, which supports neighboring Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s aggression, is being targeted by hostile actions from Russia and Belarus. They include cyberattacks, attempted arson and migrants being pushed illegally across the border, which officials describe as intended to destabilize the European Union, of which Poland is a member. The government is also making preparations in the case of a military attack, while stressing the primary role of deterrence. The government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk has planned a range of security measures including in cyberspace, as well as a more than $2.5 billion investment in strengthening surveillance, deterrence and defense along the eastern border, a system known as Shield-East that is to be completed in 2028. Work on it has started, officials said. “The goal of the shield is to protect the territory of Poland, hamper the mobility of our adversary’s troops while making such mobility easier for our own troops and to protect civilians,” Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz said at a news conference, adding that local communities understand the need for such steps. The shield will include “all kinds of fortifications, barriers, monitoring of the air space on every level and upgrading the existing systems,” and will be integrated with the defense system across the country, Kosiniak-Kamysz said. He stressed it was the biggest program to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank since 1945, when World War II ended. Chief of Staff Gen. Wiesław Kukuła said it will include a network of state-of-the-art anti-drone monitoring and defense towers, anti-tank barriers and ditches, bunkers and shelters, as well as space for potential mine fields. He stressed their primary role is to deter any potential aggressor. The officials said the system will be part of a regional defense infrastructure built jointly with the Baltic states — Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — that are also on NATO’s eastern flank. The funding will come from the government, as Poland spends over 4% of its GDP on defense, but help will also be sought from the EU because the system will also strengthen the eastern border of the 27-member bloc, they said. Some observers noted that the much-publicized presentation came two weeks ahead of elections to the European Parliament, where Poland, a nation of some 38 million, holds 52 seats, and could be partly seen as a campaign element for the government that took office in December. The opposition also supports strengthening Poland’s defense. Poland’s previous right-wing government built a $400 million wall on the border with Belarus to halt a massive inflow of migrants that began to be pushed from that direction in 2021. The current pro-EU government says that needs to be strengthened, but will be a separate project from Shield-East. The three Baltic states were once part of the Soviet Union, while Poland was a satellite state before the 1990s. Moscow still regards the area as within its sphere of interest. To its east, Poland borders Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad, as well as NATO ally Lithiania, Moscow’s ally Belarus, and Ukraine. (AP)",

        "content": "Photo: Ian Usher on Unsplash The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Industry has ordered the shuttering of two B.C. based technology companies, one of which makes drones with military applications. In a brief statement posted Friday (May 24), Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said two companies must be dissolved, following a national security review. The companies in question are Bluvec Technologies Inc. and Pegauni Technology Inc. “The government’s decisions are based on facts and evidence and on the advice ofCanada’s security and intelligence community, and other governmentpartners,” Champagne said in the news release. “While Canada continues to welcome foreign direct investment, we will act decisively when investments threaten our national security.” Bluvec, based in Burnaby, makes a drone detection system, which has potential military applications. As reported by Glacier Media last year, Bluvec was successfully sued by another Burnaby drone detection company , Skycope Technologies for stealing proprietary source code. The founders of both Bluevec and Skycope were friends who originally worked for the same cybersecurity company in China, according B.C. Supreme Court documents. The principals of Bluvec identified in the lawsuit are Junfeng Jia (aka Jack Jia), Leyuan Pan (aka Michael Pan), Kunyu Zhang (aka Eric Zhang) and Qianqi Zhuang (aka Tim Zhuang). Also listed as defendants in the case were Xiaoqian Wu (aka Karl Wu) and Jiawei Li. The principal of Skyscope Technologies is Zhenhua (Eric) Liu, according to the court ruling. The court case notes that both Bluvec and Skyscope developed technology that “enables users to detect and block or ‘jam’ unwanted drones.” Bluvec and two of its principals – Junfeng Jia and Leyuan Pan – were ordered to pay Skycope Technologies $800,000 for breaching employment agreements with Skycope. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Bluvec said Jack Jia was unavailable.",

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – The National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) has declared persona non grata at the general manager of Turkish airlines, Mr Lookman Balkan, refuting claims seven Nigerian staff sacked by the airline were involved in $600,000 ticket racketeering. In a statement signed by Ochene Aba, General Secretary of NUATE, on Monday, the union said the “accusations are blatant and poorly formulated lies.” The airline had claimed last week that it dismissed seven Nigerian staff because they violated various ticketing reservation rules, costing the airline significant economic loss to the tune of over $600,000. But the union explained that the “claim that the airline lost $600,000 is mere phantom.” NUATE explained further that sometime in April 2023, Turkish Airlines’ headquarters issued a sales restriction circular which allowed sales of only two premium classes of tickets, as a response to foreign airlines’ difficulty in repatriating their proceeds to home countries due to foreign exchange constraints in Nigeria. It added that, however, “In a contradicting manner, the Airline had an advertised fare on the website which was much lower than the permitted fares. Therefore, intending passengers who accessed such fare, but could not pay online were directed by the global call centre to approach the Nigerian offices, adding that as the workers could not attend to the customers due to the sales restriction, the passengers resorted to creating ugly scenes at the sales offices which became riotous at times. “As an image saving measure, the then sales manager asked the sales staff to use the PNR obtained online by the customers to process the tickets if the Airline’s booking system could route the tickets. The sales staff simply complied. As a matter of fact, the then sales manager, a Turkish national, sold these tickets too to confirm that this was the local management’s approved approach to resolving the problem created by the website. “The Airline’s accountants received all due monies from all tickets sold and all sales report were daily submitted to sales manager, signed by him and accounts department and scanned to Headquarters. If monies were not fully received, the account would not have balanced, and sales could not have been concluded. Therefore, no monies belonging to Turkish Airlines is missing. And no staff has taken any monies belonging to Turkish Airlines. Importantly, no staff had any pecuniary benefit from the so called internet sales. “It is, therefore, disingenuous for the General Manager to hold the workers to the charge of failure to comply with the sales restrictions when it is clear that shortcomings on the part of the Airlines ICT (on the website) combined with Local Management’s decisions on managing an otherwise ugly situation were responsible for the sales in question”, it said. The Union also said it did not agree with the Management’s positions or its findings, adding that “at the so-called disciplinary hearing, the union made it absolutely clear that the committee could only be used as a fact finding means as it was not formed in conformity with the negotiated Conditions of Service.” It added that the coercive actions on the part of the General Manager has seriously and negatively impacted the mental health of all staff of the Airline, causing a number of them to resign without any benefit whatsoever and forfeiting over ten years of service. “We wish to use this medium to inform the general public and relevant stakeholders that the real reason for the sack of the seven out of eleven employees under these trump up charges is the continued determination to exterminate the union from the Airline which it started in 2020 when it sacked all the members of the Airline’s Branch Executive Council of the Union, a matter that it has refused to rectify till date. “Finally, NUATE wishes to state that the high-handedness, plain wickedness and undiluted arrogance of Mr. Lookman Balkan, the General Manager of Turkish Airlines in Lagos makes him totally unfit to hold such important position as to manage people. He has demonstrated total disdain for Nigerians and Nigerian laws – even aviation laws. “On our part, however, NUATE has declared Lookman Balkan persona non grata. We shall instruct all aviation workers not to handle him at any Nigerian airport, except at his exit from Nigeria. And if compelled, NUATE shall internationalise his ostracising from the global aviation family”, it concluded Anthony Awunor, is a business correspondent who holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Linguistics (UNILAG). He is also an alumnus of the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria Kaduna State. He lives in Lagos.",

Chief Conservator of Forest Alex Lemarkoko said seedlings in Samburu county were flooded by water from the heavy rainfall. He, however, said the trees regained life after the rain flood waters receded. Lemarkoko encouraged people take advantage of the rains and plant more trees in support of President William Ruto's vision of achieving 30 per cent tree cover by 2032. \"Forests and areas where rain waters were not stagnating, seedlings survived well,\" he said. Lemarkoko noted that over 150 million trees have been planted this year by KFS and their partners, stakeholders and environmentalists. He spoke at KFS headquarters at Karura on Monday when the service unveiled the revised copies of the Code of Ethics, 2024. Lemarkoko was accompanied by Regional Coordinator for Africa Environment Team Giovanni Borussard and other KFS senior staff. \"We need to do the activities we conduct in the best way. We shall guide our staff,\" he said. The chief conservator said the document will help officers serve with more accountability and transparency. He applauded the KFS staff and workers for the notable decrease in corruption-related cases, attributing it to the collective goodwill of the staff. Lemarkoko further called on the leadership of the KFS to embark on blocking corruption risks, threats of illegal activities and infringement of rights. The CCF also noted that they will continue safeguarding planted seedlings and forest vegetation adding that the newly added staffs have been of great assistance in patrols and surveillance.",

The competent authority in NBA has decided accreditation of two programs on the basis of compliance reports for the academic years 2024-2025 to 2026-2027,” it said. In his message, Director NIT Srinagar, Prof. A. Ravinder Nath, congratulated the faculty, staff, and students on this achievement. “NIT Srinagar has a long-standing tradition of excellence, and this milestone reaffirms our position as a premier institution. We are committed to fostering an environment that nurtures innovation and excellence in engineering education,” he added. Director NIT attributed this achievement to the contributions of all faculty members, especially Dr. Gausia Qazi, Head of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Prof. Adnan Qayaom, Head of Mechanical Engineering, Chairman NBA, Prof. Manzoor Ahmad Ahanger, Coordinator Dr. Harveer Singh Pali alongwith their entire team, for their exemplary work. “It was a team effort, and all stakeholders performed their roles professionally,” he added. Institute’s Registrar, Prof. Atikur Rahman said that NBA accreditation serves as a hallmark of excellence, signifying that our institution upholds superior standards in both infrastructure and faculty expertise. “It opens doors to a plethora of opportunities for our students and faculty alike, ensuring that they are well-prepared to excel in their chosen careers and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields,” he said. NBA Accreditation implies that the Higher Education Institution has high-quality infrastructure and teachers. It provides better recognition from organizations for employment and research purposes. Graduating from a Tier 1 NBA Accredited program increases the chance of placements and acceptance in the higher education institutions around the globe many-folds. According to NBA, the purpose of the accreditation is to promote and recognize excellence in technical education in colleges and universities – at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. They also benefit from the process of continuous quality improvement that is encouraged by the NBA’s developmental approach to promote excellence in technical education. “It supports and advises technical institutions in the maintenance and enhancement of their quality of provision,” it added.",

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled NDP legislature member Shannon Phillips. Phillips speaks as Rachel Notley looks on at an announcement in Calgary, Monday, March 15, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says there are reasonable grounds to believe two Lethbridge police officers committed offences when they did a criminal record check on local New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips. But it says the Alberta Prosecution Service determined the circumstances didn't meet its test to go to court. The information is contained in a letter from the agency to the politician's lawyer, Michael Bates. The issue began in 2017, when an officer overheard Phillips discussing environmental issues in a coffee shop. He texted a fellow officer and the two subsequently searched Phillips in police databases and photographed and followed her. The two officers received temporary demotions.",

This week: The impacts of climate misinformation and disinformation campaigns have never been more present. Between late April and early May, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil’s southernmost state, was hit by unprecedented floods. More than 70 percent of the state’s almost 500 municipalities were affected, and nearly 70,000 people are still in temporary shelters. In addition to the natural impacts of the tragedy, authorities, volunteers, and the population are having to deal with a wave of disinformation and misinformation campaigns on social media. State of play. In the first weeks of the tragedy, several false reports claimed that bureaucracy was holding up food, water, and clothing donations. Most came from civilians in or near the flooded areas (the majority of them supporters of the former president in one way or another) and right-wing social influencers. Yes, but ... Elected officials also spread some of them, as is the case with Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former President Jair Bolsonaro and a representative of Steve Bannon’s far-far-right movement in Brazil. By the numbers. As the catastrophe evolved and the situation became more serious, false narratives proliferated. A study by NetLab, an internet and social media research laboratory at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, identified at least eight fake news narratives on social media posts and ads.

During the meeting, an in-depth discussion was held regarding the progress of works pertaining to various departments, including Jal Shakti, KPDCL, I&FC, RDD and other departments. The meeting was attended by SSP Ganderbal, Sandeep Gupta; ADDC Ganderbal, Mushtaq Ahmad Simnani; SDM Kangan, Executive Engineers of various engineering wings, and other district and sectoral officers. The concerned departments briefed the DC on the status of ongoing works and assured timely completion of all tasks.

Shyambir issued clear instructions to department heads to ensure that all preparations are completed within fixed timelines, guaranteeing the provision of the best possible services to the pilgrims. Earlier, the DC, accompanied by the SSP and other officers, conducted an inspection of the yatra track from Domail to the Holy Cave.

        "content": "ENG vs PAK 3rd T20I Final Match Free Live Streaming: When, Where and How To Watch England vs Pakistan 3rd T20I Live Telecast On Mobile APPS, TV And Laptop? Check Details. Anticipation builds as England and Pakistan gear up for their third encounter in the four-match T20I series at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff on Tuesday (May 28). The first match was canceled due to adverse weather, but England dominated the second, securing a 23-run victory. Both teams view this match as crucial for fine-tuning their strategies ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024, set to captivate audiences in the USA and the West Indies. Sophia Gardens has hosted 10 T20I matches, with a trend favoring teams bowling first, which have won seven times compared to three wins for teams batting first. The average first innings score is 145, while the second innings average is 138. Notable records at this venue include the highest total of 207/3 by South Africa against England and the lowest total of 89 by Pakistan against England. The highest successful chase is 175/3 by England against Pakistan, and the lowest score defended is 182/5 by England against Australia. The pitch at Sophia Gardens offers lively pace and bounce initially, benefiting fast bowlers. As the match progresses, the pitch becomes more batting-friendly, although spinners gain some advantage in the second innings as it dries out. Teams frequently opt to bat first upon winning the toss due to these conditions. Tuesday’s weather forecast for Cardiff poses a challenge, with a 90% chance of rain, temperatures around 17°C, high humidity at 89%, and winds reaching up to 26 kmph. These conditions could disrupt play and create a damp, clammy atmosphere, potentially impacting the match dynamics significantly.

        "content": ": At least six people have died in West Bengal after Cyclone Remal made landfall in the Sundarbans delta between Sagar Island of South 24 Parganas and Khepupara in Bangladesh on Sunday night and brought heavy rains that destroyed properties and crops in the plains of the eastern state. Most of the deaths were due to electrocution. Two among them, Phorey Singh and his young son Tarun, were from Memari in Burdwan East. They came in contact with a live wire while removing an uprooted banana tree after the cyclone and died. At Panihati in North 24 Parganas, Gopal Burman (47) lost his life after he touched an electric wire that was illegally routed from a pole to a shop but got snapped and was lying on the road. At Maheshtala in South 24 Parganas, a woman, Tapasi Das (53), was electrocuted after she stepped onto a live wire lying in a waterlogged road. Meanwhile another woman, Renuka Mondal (80), died at Mousuni Island in South 24 Parganas after a tree fell on her house. At Entally in central Kolkata, a man, Mohammad Sajid (51), died after a concrete chunk got dislodged from the balcony of a house and fell on him. In Kolkata, a nightlong downpour left many roads from North to South either waterlogged or blocked by uprooted trees. This led to cancellation of the Lok Sabha election campaign rallies of many ruling and Opposition party leaders for the second day, ahead of the final phase of polls on June 1. The rain is likely to continue Tuesday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lead a roadshow in Kolkata North parliamentary constituency in support of BJP candidate Tapas Roy after addressing a rally in Barasat in North 24 Parganas. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee posted on X: “West Bengal is a riverine state, on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. So we have to face various natural disasters every year. This time also, massive damage has occurred and is taking place in our state due to the impact of Cyclone Remale.” She said: “But human life comes above everything. Fortunately and certainly due to the steps of the state administration, the loss of life this time is relatively less. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased. Financial assistance will be reached to their loved ones immediately.” The CM said: “The administration will now look into the distribution of compensation for the damage to crops and houses as per the law and we will consider these issues more seriously once the model code of conduct ends. Our administration was prepared this time at all levels for disaster management despite the business of election arrangement.” She added: “From the chief secretary to the entire secretariat of my state to the district administration to the block administration -- all unitedly stand by the people and will continue to do so in disaster management in future. Our municipalities panchayats also have the credit of moving two lakh people to 1,400 camps in safe places. For this, I express my sincere thanks to all in the state and local administration. I firmly believe that with the cooperation of all we shall overcome this storm too. I know you are worried over this disaster. We are worried also. But don't be afraid, don't worry. We will do everything necessary to deal with the situation.”",

        "content": "Brussels, May 27 (AP) Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid suggesting sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, a Spaniard, threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leaders of Hamas. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism,” Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it’s too heavy. It’s too important.” Angry words abounded Monday, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognising a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence – those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The latest attacks have centred on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 people Sunday, hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. The UN’s top court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. “Israel has to stop its offensive in Rafah,” Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said. Spain, Ireland and non-EU member Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. Their joint announcement last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct 7 Hamas attack and kidnapping. Albares criticised the treatment of the ambassadors. “We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” he said. “But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall into any provocation that distances us from our goal,” he added. “Our aim is to recognise the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.” (AP)",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Overcame Stutter to Become Emmy Winning Broadcaster Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” A ‘Deadhead’ With a Zest for Life And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "description": "Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community.",
        "content": "VIENNA — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country’s controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week’s helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA’s previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday’s report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran’s decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran “on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA’s years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations” under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "OTTAWA — A new report finds that Canadians feel both \"optimism and concern\" over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks. The Léger study commissioned by Transport Canada says residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft — drones' larger, human-piloted cousins. The survey found that despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility's potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services. However, the study says concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impacts and privacy tempered enthusiasm for aerial vehicles. Air taxis, long hyped as the next giant leap in short-haul passenger transport, are coming closer to being a public reality — even as skepticism lingers over their ability to change commuter behaviour and emissions output. In the U.S., electric air taxis can start flying through the skies by 2028, according to a regulatory timeline laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration last July. Léger says its report was based on two studies carried out between November and January, with a survey sample size of 2,717 participants as well as four focus groups.

        "description": "Armacost, a retired Air Force brigadier general, spoke during the VFW’s Memorial Day ceremony, which occurred as another one was canceled due to the weather.",
        "content": "GRAND FORKS – Memorial Day isn’t just about remembering military personnel who have died, but also to acknowledge the unseen scars that tours of duty can leave behind, UND President and and retired Air Force Brigadier Gen. Andrew Armacost said during his speech at the VFW’s Memorial Day Ceremony. As an example, Armacost told the story of UND alumnus Sgt. Brandt Bennett, who served in Afghanistan. “In his retirement speech, he focused all his attention not on himself, but on his six platoon-mates who had survived the war, but came home only to not survive the mental and behavioral trauma that existed,” Armacost said. “Each of those six took their own lives and so today, Brandt’s example and the recognition he gave to his six comrades is indicative of the attention we pay on Memorial Day.” Monday's ceremony occurred at the Gregory J. Norman Funeral Chapel at the Norman Funeral Home, adjacent to the Memorial Park South Cemetery in south Grand Forks. It was was hosted by the VFW Post 1874, DAV Chapter 2 and Auxiliaries. The crowd was large — so large they ran out of programs. An event earlier in the day hosted by American Legion Post 6 at the Memorial Park North Cemetery was canceled due to rainy weather. The master of ceremonies was Robert Beauchamp, with music by Michael Marcotte, who sang renditions of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" and \"America the Beautiful.\" The event began with a prayer from DAV Chaplain Robert Howard calling for not only the remembrance of those who have died but also those who struggle “in body and in mind because of what they have experienced.” ADVERTISEMENT Armacost was the keynote speaker and recounted his time working at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. Armacost was in the Air Force for 30 years and spent two decades working at the academy before becoming president of UND in 2020. “Nearly four years ago I arrived here in Grand Forks to serve as the president at the University of North Dakota, and people had asked what the connection between the two?” Armacost said. “When I look at UND, I look at the leaders that we create, the wonder students, the sense of hard work and commitment, that sense of service, and there’s no better example than the four ROTC cadets that we see as part of our honor guard today.” He also thanked the many support groups for veterans in Grand Forks. He noted how the groups help veterans transition and navigate the world, and paperwork, after their time served. “You do so much for the Grand Forks community and all veterans,” Armacost said. “On days like today where we memorialize those who have left us, I also want to acknowledge the DAV national and VFW national organization. ... I know I personally benefited from the support and guidance from members of the DAV and VFW.” UND has nearly 1,500 people on campus who are veterans, dependents of veterans, ROTC members or on active duty, according to Armacost. Armacost said UND will be dedicating new veterans' memorials this Veterans Day. One will be near Columbia Road and Second Avenue North to remember World War I veterans. It will replace the memorial at the demolished Memorial Stadium. Another will be in the new Memorial Union to honor the UND community membrers who have died in wars dating back to World War I. Armacost closed his speech by saying Memorial Day is there to keep memories alive. \"Days like today cause us to reflect upon the meaning of all their service and the memories brought into our lives and Memorial Day is a day to say you are not forgotten and your loved ones are not forgotten, either,” said Armacost. Taps was then played, just after a rifle salute. ADVERTISEMENT U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, said in a statement sent to the media that Memorial Day is a time to remember the North Dakotans who died serving in the military. “We can never fully repay our veterans for their dedicated service, but there are many ways we can work to honor their sacrifices and those of their families and loved ones,” he said. “We have secured and continue to work to secure investments in our outstanding state and federal veterans cemeteries, that come as part of our broader efforts to ensure veterans receive the health care, benefits and recognition they have earned.” Gov. Doug Burgum also issued a statement. “On Memorial Day – and every day – we are eternally grateful for those brave and selfless Americans who dedicated their lives to defending our country and our freedoms, securing peace through strength. We must never forget or take for granted these fallen heroes who fought and died for the liberty we enjoy today as United States citizens,” Burgum said. “We also pay tribute and reaffirm our commitment to the veterans of the U.S. armed forces who need our ongoing support, the men and women in uniform defending our nation and freedoms at home and abroad, and the Gold Star families still enduring the loss of loved ones.” And U.S. Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minnesota, said \"to all those who have lost a loved one in service to this country, know that their commitment and courage inspire countless people across this nation. And to those of you currently serving, thank you for standing in defense of America's freedom. The citizens of this country are forever grateful.\"",

        "content": "A WOMAN has come under fire for admitting she hates her engagement ring, even though her boyfriend hasn't even popped the question yet. Taking to social media, the woman confessed she found the ring and wasn't too pleased with what she saw, since she'd already discussed what kinds of rings she'd like with her husband-to-be. 2 The woman admitted she found the pricey ring and instantly hated it Credit: Getty 2 The ring was the total opposite of what she wanted Credit: Getty \"I found my engagement ring. I hate it,\" she said. She explained that when they first started talking about tying the knot she told him she would never want anything worth over £500, since wearing something so pricey would stress her out. The woman said she even recommended that her boyfriend should get the ring from Etsy, to help keep costs low. But much to her surprise, he ignored their chat and forked out £8,000 on the bling from a posh jeweller. But the disappointment didn't end there for the woman, who said he even got the style of the ring totally wrong. \"I like yellow gold. As in I ONLY wear yellow gold. All of my jewellery is yellow gold,\" she said. But the posh ring she found was platinum. The stone wasn't to her taste either, since she had her heart set on a colourless stone, and not even necessarily a diamond.

Whose taste was he bothering to consider?\" \"My engagement ring was like $200 custom made from Etsy and EXACTLY my style. \"I'd be heartbroken about this too as it's much deeper than just the price, it's a complete lack of understanding.\" But some pointed out that she had no real way of knowing if the ring was even for her.

        "description": "Soaring plains temperatures have driven millions to overcrowded hill stations in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, causing massive traffic jams and environmental strain.",
        "content": "Soaring plains temperatures have driven millions to overcrowded hill stations in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, causing massive traffic jams and environmental strain. Usually, the hill stations of North India remain pleasant from March to the end of May. However, these months have alternated between severe cold and scorching heat this year. In 2024, the spring season was essentially lost between winter and summer. The number of tourists and locals in Kashmir has far exceeded its capacity. The increasing number of concrete buildings to accommodate them and the huge crowd of vehicles have disrupted nature, resulting in variable weather conditions. Kashmir, which has always been a top choice for tourists, is now disappointing them due to uncertain weather conditions. March and April, which mark the beginning of spring, had unexpected snowfall, rain, and severe cold until the third week of April. Suddenly, it became scorching hot with temperatures 5-7 degrees above normal. April was the coldest month in the last 20 years, and now May is the hottest month in the last 35 years. In recent years, whenever temperatures in the plains have soared and there has been no respite from the scorching sun, millions of tourists have flocked to the hill stations of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. This has led to massive traffic jams and tourist footfall far beyond the capacity of these ecologically sensitive areas. Experts say this can irreversibly damage the fragile ecosystem of these areas. The same is happening with Kashmir, where famous hill stations like Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Sonmarg, and many other places are overcrowded. The rapid construction of hotels, huts, and resorts is leading to the felling of green trees for new developments. As a result, the scorching heat in Kashmir has made life miserable. The Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department said there will be no respite from the heatwave in Jammu and Kashmir for at least the next 15 days. He further stated that the region is facing variable weather, with sudden heat and heavy rains, and these conditions will increase. He noted that humans will have to adapt to this variability, which is largely due to large-scale urbanization. Mukhtar Ahmed, Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department, said that the temperature in Jammu and Kashmir has been dry for the last few weeks, and the heat is continuously increasing. Even in the hilly areas, the mercury has risen to 30 degrees Celsius. In the hilly areas of Jammu, temperatures are around 35 degrees, and in the plains of Jammu, they have reached 43 degrees. The heat is expected to continue in the coming days. He added, \"Of course, the uncontrolled temperature of the Earth is increasing globally, and this is true for Jammu and Kashmir as well. Rapid urbanization is contributing to higher daytime temperatures. Our infrastructure, urbanization, massive transportation, and increased factory activities all impact the temperature. Infrastructure development at tourist spots, and increased tourism in recent years, also contribute to rising temperatures.\" The number of tourists in Kashmir has increased by 200 percent in the last five years. COVID-19 restrictions have changed people's mindsets, making them more willing to spend money on domestic travel. They are prioritizing domestic travel over international travel. Air travel to Kashmir is more expensive than to Delhi-Dubai, yet people choose Kashmir. Tourists now spend large amounts on domestic travel, a trend not seen earlier, and they visit Kashmir even in the off-season. Last year, Jammu and Kashmir received the highest number of tourists since independence, with 21.1 million tourists, including pilgrims. There was a 700 percent increase in foreign tourists in the valley. In 2024, more than 1.1 million tourists have reached Kashmir so far, excluding pilgrims to Mata Vaishno Devi. Eight more flights are operating compared to last year, with an average of 18,000 tourists arriving in Kashmir daily, and more than 5,000 arriving by road. According to available data, Kashmir has 100 percent occupancy until July. The sharp rise in tourism is not limited to Kashmir alone. Tourist places in North India like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Shimla, Manali, Mussoorie, Nainital, and Dalhousie are also packed with tourists. The increasing rush from the plains to the mountains has further aggravated environmental problems, such as damage to the fragile hill ecosystem, plastic pollution, air pollution, unpredictable traffic jams, and the construction of new concrete buildings to host tourists. Many in the tourism industry are concerned about these changes and want Kashmir to become a sustainable tourist destination for future generations. They warn that if the current trend continues unchecked, it will destroy the glory of Kashmir. Manzoor Pakhtoon, General Secretary of the Kashmir Houseboat Association, said, \"Kashmir is a famous place in summers. It is hot during the day, but not unbearably so. Our virgin destinations are crowded with tourists. We should take care of them. Whether it is the government or the common man, we should see how we can make it a sustainable place and save our wetlands and glaciers.\" Pakhtoon added, \"When it comes to the environment, it is not just about tourism. We also live here and need to take good care of our forests and mountains. A pressure group should be formed to protect the environment and our future. New destinations should be built with an eco-friendly approach, not as concrete jungles. This is just the beginning. If we take care today, maybe things can improve.\" Nowadays, tourists visiting Kashmir already feel the change in its climate and say they did not expect such heat in hill stations like Kashmir. Many compare it with their previous visits and note significant changes. They report heavy traffic jams and widespread pollution as reasons for the change. A tourist, Sharda Jain from Gwalior, said, \"We came to Kashmir for the cold and thought the weather would be pleasant, but we encountered scorching heat. Global warming and a lot of tourist traffic could be reasons.\" A tourist from Mumbai, Ashok, said, \"Globalization is also having a significant impact. Many hotels are being built, affecting the environment. Nature is getting destroyed. It is everyone's responsibility, whether common people or the government, to work for a better future.\" Ashok's daughter, Aayushi, added, \"I visited Kashmir in 2006. The Kashmir I saw then is not the same as today. There is much more population, pollution, and crowding. The weather was cold then, but now it is hot.\" A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that sudden floods, cloudbursts, and intense rains will become more likely in mountainous regions. The report states that rising temperatures and melting glaciers will seriously impact plant and animal species already struggling with heatwaves, droughts, forest fires, and floods. It further states that climate change will cause temperatures to rise in all regions in the coming decades, especially in South Asia. Heatwaves will increase, the hot season will become longer, and the cold season shorter. Mukhtar Ahmad, Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department, said, \"This temperature increase is what we call variable climate. It is going to increase over time. For every 1-degree increase in temperature, the moisture-holding capacity of the air increases by around 7 percent. This will result in sudden heavy rains and prolonged dry weather. We must be prepared for this variability.\" A climate scientist from Kashmir University said that the current temperatures align with predictions made about climate change impacts. What India is experiencing is due to the warming of the Earth. He warned that the worst is yet to come, saying, \"As the Earth gets hotter, we will see more extreme heat conditions. This year, we have seen hotter weather than ever before. The kind of heat we saw in April-May was expected in June-July.\" Climate experts say that the ever-increasing influx of tourists to the mountains of North India has made the current situation very difficult. A long-term strategy is urgently needed to mitigate the impending disasters of climate change and over-tourism.",

        "content": "BAY VILLAGE, Ohio -- BAYarts is not just a place where art meets beauty; it is a vibrant community anchor, fostering creativity across all ages. Established on the foundation laid by a visionary group of women in 1948, BAYarts has grown into a cornerstone of arts education and cultural engagement in Cleveland’s western suburbs. Now, BAYarts is embarking on a new project that promises to blend artistic expression with the tranquility of nature through the creation of a sensory garden. This garden is designed to be a nurturing retreat for the senses and the spirit, providing a safe, sensory-friendly environment where visitors can enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of nature interwoven with the arts. BAYarts is embarking on a new project that promises to blend artistic expression with the tranquility of nature through the creation of a sensory garden. The initiative will take a significant step forward with the hosting of “A Night in Bloom” June 15, an evening dedicated to raising funds for the garden. The event, set against the picturesque backdrop of the Sullivan Family Gallery at 28795 Lake Road, will offer a blend of fine dining, live entertainment and the thrill of casino games. Nancy Heaton, director of BAYarts, highlights the collaboration with Ground Works Land Design to make the sensory garden a reality. The garden will not only be a place of beauty, but will also serve as a dynamic classroom for art instruction and inclusive programming. Heaton’s vision is reflective of BAYarts’ commitment to community and inclusivity, emphasizing that the garden will be accessible to people of all abilities. The fundraising event will feature heavy appetizers, dinner stations and a variety of drinks, along with a casino room with popular games of chance like blackjack and roulette. A raffle with “amazing prizes” will be drawn toward the evening’s end, providing yet another way for guests to support the garden while potentially winning something special. For those interested in contributing more significantly, BAYarts offers various sponsorship opportunities, appealing to the local business community. The event is adult-only, with a ticket price of $100 per person. Heaton advises securing tickets by June 1, although donations toward the sensory garden will be welcomed beyond this date. The sensory garden is not just an addition to the BAYarts campus, but a new way to experience art, nature and community -- all in one place. For more details on the event or to make a donation, visit the BAYarts’ official or call 440-871-6543.",

        "content": "The Canadian Grief Alliance (CGA) received nearly 4,000 responses on a survey asking Canadians how they are handling grief in their life, highlighting the need for more resources and public education. “A lot of people who are grieving don’t have the kinds of outlets that they might want to talk to other people, to share their experience,” CGA co-chair Paul Adams told Global News. Around 50 per cent of survey respondents said they felt unsupported in their grief and over 80 per cent of respondents also said they would like to be asked about their loss. “There’s a big gap between the way we operate in the world, many of us, and what the people suffering from grief experience,” Adams said. He added that there is a common misconception that sorrow is the main emotion that stems from grief. Story continues below advertisement “Many people feel guilt, they feel angry, they may be irritable or have their appetite affected, sleep affected,” Adams said. “A lot of people seem to think that grief is over within a few weeks or sometimes people think a year is a deadline for grief being over.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. Recommendations from the grief survey will be presented to Health Canada in 2025 and Adams said he is hoping for more public education, education for professionals and more resources for counselling services. “People who don’t find adequate support in their family and friends look to other resources and those resources are there and sometimes they are not there,” he said.

Maria Fiala, communications manager for the Canadian Grief Alliance, said she lost her grandmother at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and her grandfather just last year. “There was just a domino effect of losses,” she said. “There was my grandma during that time, my marriage broke down, so that was a huge source of grief.” Story continues below advertisement She noted that unprocessed and unsupported grief can be a precursor to mental illness. “The grief associated with mental health and mental illness is something that’s not really talked about and it can be very significant,” Fiala said. “Mental illness can really rob you of some of your favourite things.” She said supporting someone who is grieving is simple. “What people need is to feel seen, empathy and validation. That’s really it. Don’t try to make it better and don’t try to put a silver lining on it.”",

Wahab Tunio, who is a resident of Qureshi Goth in Sukkur and running a small business, started using solar panels to get the required power. He is getting solar power to charge mobile phones and power his desktop computer to run the business which has become a lifeline for him and others in the community. Speaking to ARY News, Wahab Tunio said that he had to rely on solar panels to run his business due to the lack of electricity in the locality. The area people, who are also deprived of electricity, get their mobile phones charged for Rs 20-30 which has become a source of income for Wahab Tunio He said that due to the lack of electricity, the use of solar panel has become a necessity for him. A post shared by ARY News (@arynewstv) Wahab Tunio asked the government not to impose a tax on solar panels, saying that it would become unaffordable for him and others like him.

        "description": "The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority could fix these problems by halting the fake traffic enforcement.",
        "content": "Southern California drivers who roll through stop signs in mountain parks can receive letters that look like traffic tickets. The citations come from a government agency, demand $100, and threaten penalties for nonpayment. But the notices are not what they seem. The fine print clarifies that the mailed citations are “not issued for any violation of any provision of the California Vehicle Code.” This means people who ignore the lookalike traffic tickets face no legal consequences. The Department of Motor Vehicles will not assess points and insurance companies will not raise rates. The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, which launched the automated stop sign enforcement program in 2007, can only report scofflaws to debt collection agencies, potentially affecting credit scores. Most vehicle owners pay to avoid the hassle—even if they do not realize the true situation. The agency issues about 17,000 citations annually—nearly 47 per day—using seven cameras in four Los Angeles County parks along the Santa Monica Mountains: Temescal Gateway, Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway, Top of Topanga, and Franklin Canyon. About 11,000 vehicle owners pay each year, generating $1.1 million in annual revenue. The numbers have been higher in the past. During one 18-month stretch, the agency cranked out 35,000 citations —nearly 64 per day—and pulled in $2 million. Pseudo traffic enforcement can be big business. And nobody can stop it. State lawmakers give the agency permission to collect fines and fees in the California Public Resources Code. And when a California Court of Appeal reviewed the automated enforcement program in 2015, it upheld the scheme. Since then, the agency has posted yellow warning signs, alerting drivers to nearby “video monitoring.” Everything now runs on cruise control. Santa Monica resident Andrew Rice wants to put the brakes on the scheme, which he says is motivated by profit. “It’s set up like a turnstile to generate money,” he told KTLA 5 News. “It’s a money machine for the park.” The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority disagrees. It insists it only cares about safety, and the seven-figure income it receives from the cameras is just a convenient byproduct. Bloggers and online commenters see through this lie. Setting up cameras to record petty violations is about revenue, they argue. Redflex Traffic Systems, the for-profit vendor that runs the program, exists for no other purpose. And governments around the world are happy to split the proceeds. Once agencies start abusing fines and fees, they often have few restraints. The result can be “taxation by citation,” which occurs when governments use police power to raise revenue rather than solely to protect the public. Research from our public interest law firm, the Institute for Justice, shows hidden costs when agencies give in to this temptation. The first casualty can be goodwill. Residents with recent citations report lower levels of trust in public officials and institutions than residents without, suggesting agencies that use code enforcement for revenue can undermine cooperation in their communities. Hikers who visit Southern California parks might be less inclined to return after receiving a citation in the mail. And they might be less inclined to support park programs. “I’m the kind of person who might have donated money to them,” Rice told KTLA 5 News. “And I never would now.” Related Articles Opinion | California’s legal war on affordable energy Opinion | Biden’s tariffs are another nail in the dollar’s coffin Opinion | Assault weapons bans are only justified if they outweigh the value of freedom Opinion | California’s leaders can’t turn their back on crime survivors Opinion | Honor all who defend our liberties Additional problems surface if vehicle owners try to contest their citations. Not being in the vehicle at the time of the alleged infraction is not a defense. Tickets go to the registered owner, not the driver. People who want a hearing anyway must request it within 21 days and make an advance deposit of the full amount of the citation or get a hardship waiver. If they clear these hurdles, they do not appear before a neutral judge. They face a hearing officer appointed by their accuser. Traditional court rules do not apply. The ranger who issued the ticket does not have to appear. And the video evidence is presumed infallible. Vehicle owners can appeal to state court, but legal costs can quickly outweigh a $100 fine. The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority could fix these problems by halting the fake traffic enforcement. More broadly, all California agencies should end taxation by citation. Policing should be about safety, not money. Diana Simpson is an attorney and Daryl James is a writer at the Institute for Justice in Arlington, Va.",

        "description": "Walton was a dominant force in college, leading UCLA to two national championships, a two-time NBA champion and a Hall of Famer. He died Monday after a long battle with cancer, the NBA announced.",
        "content": "Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke - a former NBA player and now a coach. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. Walton was an Emmy winner. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a \"Deadhead.\" And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the \"Conference of Champions\" and loved it all the way to the end. \"It doesn't get any better than this,\" he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" ---",

        "content": "An appraiser working with a bank fled with 2.17 kg of gold ornaments worth `1.44 crore that was mortgaged by customers. The incident came to light when the bank audited its branch at Rajupet of Mangapet mandal in Mulugu district earlier this week. Sub-inspector Ravi Kumar identified the accused as Sammeta Prashanth of Palaigudem of the mandal and a native of Narsampet in Warangal district. During their audit, bank officials found that there was a mismatch between the gold on record and in the vaults. The officials took the issue to the notice of branch manager Kiran Kumar who in turn tried to contact appraiser Prashanth. That is when they learnt that Prashanth along with his family had left the village without informing anyone. The bank officials then lodged a complaint with the police. After registering a case, police found during their investigation that Prashanth had opened a gold shop in Rajupet and had also borrowed money from several persons from the surrounding villages. Police have formed special teams to search and arrest Prashanth. Regional deputy general manager Srinivas Rao of the bank who visited the Rajupet branch to enquire about the theft assured that those who had mortgaged their jewellery need not worry. The bank would return an equal amount of gold or money at market value as preferred by the customers, he said.",

        "content": "A new study shows that hyperandrogenism—a key characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—affects immune cell populations in reproductive, metabolic and immunological tissues in a PCOS-like mouse model. These findings are of great importance as it is known that immune dysfunction is an essential part of reproductive complications and metabolic disease, which are very common among women with PCOS. However, as the study shows that hyperandrogenism affects different tissues in unique ways, any possible treatments would have to be carefully tailored to target specific tissue dysfunctions. Since concurrent treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevented many changes in the mouse model used in the study, combination therapies that include both anti-androgens and other drugs that target specific altered immune pathways could be explored. The study is published in the journal Advanced Science . One of the most fascinating findings was the clear alterations of immune cells in adipose tissue , despite an unaltered fat mass of the androgen exposed mice. It is well known that immune cells in adipose tissue contribute to insulin resistance in overweight and obese individuals, but here the researchers produced an insulin resistant mouse model that mimics normal weight women with PCOS. The impact of androgens on immune cells in adipose tissue is therefore very interesting considering the high prevalence of insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes among normal weight women with PCOS. Another rather surprising finding was the drastic decrease of eosinophils in the uterus, as these don't express the androgen receptor. This shows that androgens play a broader and more complex role in modulating the immune environment than only through direct androgen receptor activation on immune cells. The next step will be to dissect the underlying mechanisms of the immune alterations, and to assess if these do contribute to the reproductive complications and metabolic comorbidities of PCOS. This will include further characterization of immune cell changes to understand how their function could be affected and link these to reproductive and metabolic mechanisms. The researchers also want to understand how the effect of androgens on eosinophils and mature NK cells is mediated, since neither of them expresses the androgen receptor .

        "content": "SALT LAKE CITY ( ABC4 ) — The mother of a young southern Utah boy who nearly drowned last week provided another update over the weekend on her son’s condition and the decisions her family will have to make moving forward. Kallie Wright posted to Facebook on Sunday that the days since her son, Levi, was pulled unresponsive from a swift-moving creek have been a “rollercoaster” experience. “We are taking it day by day,” she said in the most recent post. On the evening of May 21, Levi was playing on his toy tractor when he fell into a creek in Beaver County. Emergency crews found the child in the water roughly a mile downstream. Levi, the son of rodeo star Spencer Wright , is currently receiving care at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City. Days after the accident, Levi briefly woke up , bringing hope for a recovery. Yet, his mother noted in a follow-up social media post that the child wasn’t fully coherent or talking in that moment, only that he opened his eyes for a short period of time and “wiggled with purpose.” On Friday, an MRI brought more difficult news for the family. Still, Kallie wrote that they were trying to get as many neurologists as possible to view her son’s brain scan. In her most recent post on Sunday, the mother noted that the term “brain injury” is broad, with different ranges and severities, and that recovery varies depending on the specific injury. “We are exploring the therapies that have been mentioned, engaging with those we feel can be of support for us and getting as many professional eyes on this as possible,” Kallie Wright wrote. She added: “We still just need the prayers. We will need them for years to come as I fear we haven’t even reached the hardest part of this.”",

        "content": "The will face some major decisions this summer, as veteran stars , , and could all hit the open market. After struggling with playmaking early in the \"213\" era, Harden and Westbrook have provided the Clippers with two talented lead guards. Last season, Harden averaged 8.5 assists per game, becoming only to hit that single-season milestone. Meanwhile, Westbrook chipped in 5.0 assists per game off the bench. With Kawhi Leonard under contract and limited draft capital, the Clippers are locked into win-now mode. Obviously, keeping Harden and Westbrook would be ideal, as the franchise attempts to contend for the title next season. However, if they lose either player, they will have to find a quality replacement. With limited assets, that could prove to be difficult. According to , the Clippers are expected to show interest in veteran free agents Chris Paul and Kyle Lowry: \"I nonetheless heard this week that Paul and Kyle Lowry, whose free agency is looming after finishing last season in Philadelphia, are veteran guards said to interest the Clippers ... with a further variable to factor in stemming from Russell Westbrook's still-to-be determined status. Westbrook has a $4 million player option for next season that he must decide on by June 29.\" Both players are talented playmakers. In addition, they have plenty of big-game experience, appearing in a combined 285 total playoff games. Can Paul or Lowry Move the Needle for the Clippers? Paul and Lowry are potential future Hall of Famers, but neither player is in their prime. Last season, Paul posted career lows in points per game (9.2), box plus/minus (+1.0), and PER (14.7). Still, he averaged an impressive 6.8 assists per game in a reduced role, while shooting a respectable 37.1 percent from deep. Offensively, he would be a seamless fit in LA. There are concerns on the defensive end. At his peak, Paul was an elite defender, but at this stage of his career, he is no longer an intimidating force. Last season, opponents . Conversely, Westbrook was excellent on the defensive side of the floor for the Clippers last season. He routinely took on the toughest assignments, and his combination of athleticism and energy elevated the unit as a whole. Kyle Lowry vs Chris Paul - 2023 Advanced Stats Category Kyle Lowry Chris Paul ORTG 111.4 113.7 DRTG 111.6 111.0 NRTG -0.2 2.8 Last season, Lowry averaged 8.1 points and 4.2 assists per game. He shot a blistering 39.2 percent from three-point range. Lowry would thrive as a catch-and-shoot option, playing alongside Leonard and George. Like Paul, Lowry is not a great defender. Last season, opponents . Paul and Lowry are quality role players. Given the Clippers' lack of assets, either player would be a quality pickup if Harden or Westbrook departed. They could provide an offensive spark off the bench. However, neither player would significantly boost the team's title odds.",

        "description": "The District Court of Noord-Holland handed down convictions against six men who were involved in a series of extremely violent robberies in 2020 and 2021.",
        "content": "The District Court of Noord-Holland handed down convictions against six men who were involved in a series of extremely violent robberies in 2020 and 2021. One person was killed in the violence, and two others suffered life-threatening injuries due to the use of a gun. The harshest sentence was nearly 30 years in prison, and the lowest sentence was closer to four years. The verdict and sentences were read by the court at the Schiphol judicial complex in Haarlemmermeer on Monday. Seven of the robberies took place in Noord-Holland, and the other was in Dreumel, Gelderland. The most severe sentence was given to 31-year-old Glenn V. from Noord-Scharwoude. Prosecutors had called for a life sentence against him, but the court said that was \"not appropriate\" in his case. The court took into consideration that he was not out to kill people, and that he is still relatively young. V., who has a long criminal record, received the maximum prison sentence allowable short of a life sentence. After his imprisonment, he will be placed under supervision due to the risk of recurrence. Just as the Public Prosecution Service did, the court holds him responsible for the violence committed with firearms. According to the court, he shot 72-year-old Sjaak Groot during a robbery in Berkhou. He was also convicted of shooting two victims in the neck and chest during robberies in Avenhorn and Noord-Scharwoude. His co-defendants include Rotterdam resident Ruviëni M., 39, who was handed a 27-year prison sentence. Deniz R., a 28-year-old from Obdam, was ordered to serve 25 years in prison. Mark V., 31 and from Opmeer, was handed 20 years in prison. M. and R. were given sentences slightly lower than what prosecutors demanded, partly because the court did not believe the evidence they were involved in the shootings was strong enough. Mark V. had a permanent role as the crew's driver. The court spoke of a sustained and structured collaboration between the four men, who were also guilty of participation in a criminal organization. The four, previously described by the Public Prosecution Service as a core group, were involved in almost all robberies. Two men who each participated in one home robbery, former Alkmaar resident Dut M. (30) and Martijn G. (28) from Heerhugowaard, received prison sentences of 6.5 years and three years and nine months respectively. The Public Prosecution Service had also demanded that M. spend time in mandatory psychiatric treatment at a TBS facility, but the court did not see justification in imposing the measure. All suspects except M. were present at the verdict reading, in which the court paid separate attention to the enormous impact the robberies had. Many victims still suffer from physical and psychological complaints, and suffer from nightmares and flashbacks. Some have even moved away. With the exception of G., the men have denied or remained silent about involvement in the crimes.",

        "content": "No spectators will be allowed in the stands at FC Utrecht's next home football match in the Eredivisie. Mayor Sharon Dijksma decided to impose the measure in response to rioting by the team's supporters on Sunday when the FC Utrecht was lost out on the chance to play in European football next season. \"I am aware that this is unique, but given the situation last Sunday, this is an appropriate measure. Also, I will not hesitate to disallow an audience at other matches if this situation repeats itself,\" Dijksma wrote on Monday in a letter to the City Council. According to the mayor, FC Utrecht understands the reason for the decision. Additionally, nets must be hung on the sides of the away section in the FC Utrecht stadium. These should prevent them from throwing fireworks and other items back and forth. Dijksma is considering measures against a café near the stadium where a group of rioters are said to have gathered. Just outside the stadium is a slate plateau. Those stones will be removed because the rioters took them from the street to throw as weapons. The municipality wants to recover the costs. FC Utrecht lost to Go Ahead Eagles on Sunday, and therefore did not qualify for the preliminary round of the Conference League. There was unrest in the stadium during the match, and riots broke out outside afterwards. According to the mayor, Utrecht supporters threw a variety of objects at riot police, like \"large rocks, manhole covers, gutters, bicycles, fireworks and all the material that was available on the street.\" Two people from the Utrecht region have been arrested. One officer ended up in a hospital after losing consciousness, according to Dijksma. The mayor says she met with officers on Sunday. \"The pressure on our officers has been enormous for weeks and the sum of the physical and verbal violence they constantly have to deal with is taking a very heavy toll on them.\" Dijksma has therefore appealed for calm. \"It is really essential to find calmer waters together, because this situation is no longer sustainable. We can no longer sustain this together.\" It is not yet known when FC Utrecht will play its first home match and who the opponent will be. The first round of the Eredivisie will take place on August 9, 10 and 11, with the second round a week later.",

The regulator has also noticed that scammers find new ways to take people's money. The AFM now wants to use a website to better educate the Dutch about how fraudsters and scammers work. The AFM receives reports via the Financial Markets Complaint Desk. This often involves investment fraud, where people are tricked into investing money. Fraudsters also place fake advertisements that look like Dutch celebrities are giving investment advice. According to the AFM, the hotline has also recently received signals about new scamming methods. These include fraudsters posing as AFM employees and scamming their victims again. Due to the increasing number of reports, the supervisory authority has set up the website . There, Dutch people can learn more about the different types of fraud and how they can protect themselves against them. They can also check whether a company they are contacting is known to the AFM.",

        "description": "The family-friendly pizza restaurant has had its first major refurbishment since opening in 1994, adding a new ice cream and churro bar.",
        "content": "I introduced the third generation of the family to Di Maggio’s East Kilbride when we took the kids for dinner at the revamped restaurant. I’m old enough to remember being taken here by my parents when the pizza and pasta restaurant opened here in 1994. The first Di Maggio’s restaurant was established when Mario Gizzi went into partnership with his uncle Giuseppe “Joe” Conetta, opening in 1984 in the West End. Themed around American baseball legend Joe Di Maggio, there was an American Italian menu of pizza, pasta, burgers and ribs. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to GlasgowWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. It was during the 1990s that Joe’s son, Tony, joined his cousin in the family business. They went on to launch Cafe Andaluz, Amarone and turned Glasgow’s oldest Italian restaurant, La Ariosto, into the Barolo Grill. The group now has 19 restaurants of various hues and plans for expansion. What's the Story? The East Kilbride restaurant has had a major reimagining, kitted out with a churro bar and gelateria, Churissimo. Tony Conetta said: “We’ve been serving the community of East Kilbride for more than 30 years and this is a huge moment in our history in the town. A tremendous amount of love and care has gone into the refurbishment, and we’re sure the introduction of EK’s first authentic churro bar will go down a treat. “We love being a part of East Kilbride, we’ve welcomed thousands of families through our doors, and we look forward to thousands more. It’s also about playing a part in bringing new people to the town, and we hope the new-look Di Maggio’s East Kilbride and Churissimo will achieve that for the next 30 years.” On the Menu Churros and ice cream If you grew up in and around Glasgow then you are probably familiar with Di Maggio’s Glaswegian approximation of a New York pizza. What’s new here is the steady supply of freshly made churros - there’s bite sized portions for the kits, churros dusted with sugar and cinnamon for the adults or filled with white chocolate, Nutella or salted caramel. Advertisement Advertisement Dips include Belgian chocolate or biscoff bueno flavour. There’s 12 ice cream flavours like chocolate fudge brownie, strawberry cheesecake or raspberry ripple. It’s a modern take on the classic Italian cafe with some Iberian sweet treats on top, a nod to the group’s success with Spanish tapas at Cafe Andaluz. Atmosphere There’s space for 220 customers here, it’s a big dining room but there’s plenty of space between tables which helps when wee ones are going back and forth to the compact soft play area tucked away in the corner. The renovation has created a smart space with plenty of tables and booths to suit different sizes of parties, some allusions to art deco and vintage prints on the wall. We went early on a Thursday night and the place was busy with other families and couples meeting up after work. Verdict Our seven-year-old, an expert on pizza Margherita was impressed with his cheese-laden main course which disappeared quickly. It was really a prelude to the main event and he gave a 10/10 review for the chocolate fudge brownie ice cream topped with mini marshmallows and churros bites with Nutella dipping sauce that we shared. Our toddler chewed on chunks of garlic bread and ate individual bits of macaroni cheese before trying a couple of spoonfuls of ice cream. Battered fish goujons, grilled chicken with mashed potato and spaghetti with tomato sauce are popular on the kids menu. Advertisement Advertisement After starters of bruschetta and mozzarella cubes, I had pepperoni pizza that reminded me of takeaways from here in my student days. It’s comfort food that arrives promptly, a quality that’s treasured when dining out with the whole family. My wife had pizza diavola with melted mozzarella, red chilli and smoked paprika chicken fillets. I hadn’t been back since I moved away from East Kilbride 20 years ago, not for any reason other than there were more convenient options when I lived in Dublin, Edinburgh, Dennistoun and Partick. The revamped restaurant has the added attraction of the dessert bar and has been kitted out to continue to cater to the next generation of EK families. It will continue to be a local favourite.",

        "content": "The Sensex crossed 76,000 mark for the first time and Nifty-50 also went past 23,100 mark in tandem led by rally in frontline stocks but in the last hour of trading benchmark indices fell sharply on profit taking. BSE’s benchmark index had hit the 75,000 mark last month on April 9. After climbing to 76,009 intra-day, the Sensex closed at 75,390.5 down by 19.89 points or 0.03 per cent. The Nifty-50 index too made a new all time high of 23,110.8 but closed lower at 22,932.45 down by 24.65 points or 0.11 per cent. Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of equities worth Rs.541.22 crore while domestic institutions were net buyers by Rs.922.60 crore. “The bulls are facing stiff resistance at 23,000 levels as investors start booking profit at higher levels to avoid any knee jerk reaction in the market ahead of the election result. Better earnings growth, the expectation of a revival in private capex, and a moderation in FIIs selling intensity are the key positive triggers in the market,” said Vinod Nair, head-Research, Geojit Financial Services. Broader market closed mixed as the BSE Mid-cap index gained 0.63 per cent while the BSE Small-cap index closed flat losing 0.09 per cent. Volatility index NSE’s India VIX climbed 6.82 per cent to 23.19 and made a high of 26.20 intra-day which seem to have led to caution among the market participants. BSE’s IT (0.48 per cent), bank (0.63 per cent) and realty (0.76 per cent) sector indices gained while metal (-0.39 per cent) and power (0.49 per cent) were losers while all other sectoral indices closed flat. Stronger rupee at 83.13 per US dollar and Brent crude oil futures also in $81-82 per barrel range are providing strength to the Indian market as the selling by the foreign portfolio investors have moderated. Further Indian Meteoro-logical Department’s May 27 update on Monsoon rains said, “Quantitative-ly, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be above normal rainfall.” Market is likely to cheer IMD update despite election outcome related short term volatility that is likely to prevail till June 4 this year.",

        "content": "During the peak of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the health-care system's capacity was stretched and hospitals across Canada relied on each other to share resources and provide care. Experts from London Health Sciences Center (LHSC), Ivey Business School and King's University College developed a simulation model to help hospital leaders make decisions on resources and capacity , ensuring LHSC was ready to accept patient transfers from outside the hospital's catchment area, including Toronto and Manitoba. To enable the most efficient use of resources during a crucial time, LHSC leaders needed a solution. \"The tool allowed us to maintain optimal care for all LHSC units by making decisions grounded in real-time data ,\" said Tim Rice, senior director at LHSC's Victoria Hospital. The pandemic required collaboration across the health-care system to ensure hospital capacities were balanced while maintaining the ability to care for non-COVID patients. In addition to strategies like having field hospitals at the ready, patient transfers between hospitals were critical to managing the pandemic response. Hospital leadership partnered with researchers from Ivey Business School and King's University College, building on previous collaborations, to create the model. They developed a Monte Carlo simulation tool designed to predict whether the hospital would be over capacity when responding to COVID-19 related impacts, such as changes in hospital admission rates , managing the impact of outbreaks and balancing the pandemic response with planned hospital activity. The work was published in the open-access journal BMC Public Health . The tool, created in Excel so any hospital could use it, helped forecast the usage of critical care and medicine unit beds over a one-week period. It was based on data from the previous week, including admission rate and average length of stay for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. The spreadsheet-based simulation tool also factored in assumptions about future arrivals of patients from outside the region to predict capacity needs and whether additional beds dedicated for COVID-19 patients would be required. \"By inputting this data into the model, the impact to overall hospital bed capacity was better understood and provided LHSC leaders the information they needed to make objective decisions, including the resources required to meet the ongoing demands of the pandemic,\" Rice said. When Manitoba hospitals required support from LHSC, at a time when the hospital was already supporting both the London region and fielding requests from Toronto, the team was prepared and confident to make key decisions on how many patients LHSC had the capacity to accept from other hospitals and how to most effectively use hospital resources. \"The tool serves as a future resource for emergency preparedness and new iterations of the model are in development to help with ongoing capacity planning,\" Rice said. \"It is our hope that the legacy of this partnership will live on in the future work it supports.\" More information: Mehmet A.

        "description": "Rafael Nadal plans to retire after the 2024 season, but he said he may play the French Open again after losing in the first round Sunday.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know [if] it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “If it’s the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It’s such a great honor. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.”",

        "description": "Authorities continue to ask for help in gathering any information about what may have happened to Carla Beth Anderson, who disappeared in 1987",
        "content": "Editor's note: This is an archival Vault article first published on Jan. 4, 2022. If you have information on this case, If you have any the Minnesota BCA at 877-996-6222 or the Wadena Police Dept. at 218-631-7700. WADENA, Minn. — On the night of Friday the 13th in November 1987, deer hunters were gearing up for the opening weekend, a fire burned in a swamp on the edge of town, an unremarkable brown car was stolen and the employee of the month at the local Hardee's vanished without a trace. Those events are either coincidental, or the keys to solving a three-decadee mystery that has yielded many theories and tips, but no answers. 12-minute listen: Despite countless leads, sightings, psychic visions and rumors, Carla Beth Anderson, who became the subject of an intensive search in the Wadena, Minnesota area, has never been found. ADVERTISEMENT Local authorities, though several generations have now held the case in their hands, continue to say the case is at the forefront of their minds. Carla is a white female who was just 23 at the time of her disappearance. She had blonde hair, blue eyes, and a half inch scar above her right eye. She was petite, just under 5 foot tall and just 80 pounds. Last seen, she was wearing a brown and orange Hardee’s jacket, a white Pepsi and Mountain Dew sweatshirt with three bears on it, blue jeans and pink sneakers. Carla was mildly mentally disabled. Carla was well liked by her Hardee’s manager at the time, Wayne Wolden, who went on to become the mayor of Wadena. \"She was a fantastic employee. Wonderful personality, lighthearted, smiling a lot,\" Wolden said in a previous interview. \"I used to call her 'spud' because she was like a little potato ... She was probably 4-foot-10 inches tall, maybe, on a good day, on heels.\" He added that she was kind and hard working. She was known to volunteer to come work at her job on days she wasn’t assigned to work. She had an innocence about her that makes this case even more disheartening. The sweet memories of the girl remain as current investigators continue to search for her. Anderson's loved ones stated local people sometimes harassed her or attempted to take advantage of her. Although she's mildly mentally disabled, she tried to lead as normal a life as possible and was proud of being independent and having a job, her own home and a boyfriend. Anderson lived at Greenwood Apartments in Wadena, just a couple blocks from her place of work, so she was able to walk to work easily. She was expected to have her photo taken the following Monday for the Employee of the Month display. It was one of many things that would go unfulfilled with her disappearance. ADVERTISEMENT Looking back at that Friday, Nov. 13, Anderson just found out she had been named employee of the month at work. She and her mother and stepfather went out to eat at Taco John's that evening to celebrate the honor. After dinner, between 7:30 and 8 p.m., Anderson's mother and stepfather picked up some movies for her to watch, then dropped her off at her apartment at Greenwood Apartments. Anderson got safely inside her apartment that evening. She had been carrying a cup full of soda when her parents dropped her off. The empty cup was found in her apartment, and one of the videos she had gotten to watch was found in her VCR. Anderson did not show up for her morning work shift on Saturday, Nov. 14, which was uncharacteristic of her, as she was known as an exemplary employee. She has never been heard from again. Nothing appeared to be amiss in Anderson's apartment and the only thing missing were her keys and her light jacket, with the Hardee’s logo on it. Her purse remained on the table. The apartment door was locked from the outside. The building itself had a security door, but the door had been propped open that night by other tenants who were moving in. On the night of Anderson's disappearance, there was a fire burning in a swamp on the outskirts of Wadena. She would have been able to view the fire from her window, according to the investigator at the time, Lane Waldahl. Waldahl has his suspicions about who started the fire that night, but no evidence. Authorities theorized she left home to look at the fire up close, and someone attacked her. There is no evidence to support this theory, however. That same evening, a brown Plymouth Horizon was stolen a couple of blocks from Anderson's apartment building and was never recovered. It is unknown whether the stolen car has any connection to her case but many believe this to be too much of a coincidence. ADVERTISEMENT “They’ve got to be related, but we just can’t prove or disprove it, yet,” Wadena Chief of Police Naomi Plautz said. “The one thing that has always stuck with me, that vehicle has never been located,” Wadena County Sheriff Michael Carr Jr. said. “If you were to find that vehicle, you would probably find her.” Carr remembers Carla going missing while he was a sophomore in high school. \"Still in the back of my mind there is a connection between that car and Carla,\" Waldahl said. They searched for the car across the region and combed other states. Wadena Sgt. Brandon Pearson reflected on all the stolen vehicles that they deal with now. Eventually they are found. But decades later, this one has not been found. Waldahl suspects it's in a lake or buried in a gravel pit. Police searches, intense media coverage, state and federal investigations — nothing revealed what happened to Anderson. The police followed every tip. Four three ring binders are filled with the tips, the hunches and the interviews. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension also has a copy of all the details. A search committee went out looking to find Carla about five days after she went missing. A WCCO helicopter was used to search from the air. The Civil Air Patrol lent their eyes from the skies. It was deer hunting weekend when Carla disappeared, and hunters were alerted to be on the lookout for the girl. Carr said authorities acted fast as the ground was bare at the time of her disappearance. They knew snow would soon arrive and cover up any disturbed ground. Within days of their searches, it did snow, Carr said. ADVERTISEMENT Waldahl said the combined efforts of local, regional, state and federal law enforcement agencies was impressive and he feels they left no stone unturned. Years later he recalls speaking again with BCA and FBI profilers interested in taking a fresh look at the cold case. That again turned up no solid evidence to follow. Suspected serial killer Floyd Todd Tapson was considered a possible suspect in Anderson's disappearance for a time, but he was cleared from that case after being interviewed by investigators. He apparently had a solid alibi putting him elsewhere that night. All the members of Anderson's family have been ruled out as suspects in her case, as was her boyfriend. They were given a polygraph test and passed. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance, but little evidence is available as to her fate. A psychic who said she knew where Carla was came to town but brought up another dead end. Anderson was placed on playing cards in 2008 among a list of the top 52 cold cases in the state. The card decks have been distributed to all 515 Minnesota police departments and sheriff offices, plus 75 county jail and annex facilities. In addition, over 10,000 decks have been supplied to Minnesota state prison inmates. While the cards have been effective in some of those cold cases, no solid tips in Carla's case have come from that effort. In the days after the disappearance, volunteers including the Wadena Pioneer Journal newspaper staff worked to create 5,000 posters with Carla Beth Anderson on them, pleading with people to call if they had seen her. The posters were plastered all over north and central Minnesota. They even made it to the Metrodome as the local Verndale Pirates football team were playing at the Prep Bowl. Much has changed over the last three decades The former Hardee's is a Burger King, the Taco John's location is a parking lot, and all the police working at the time of Anderson's disappearance have moved on, retired or died. Anderson’s parents died months apart in 2008: Verne Wells on Feb. 9, and Roberta Wells on June 3. ADVERTISEMENT What hasn't changed is a concerted effort to solve this bizarre case. “Anytime we get a lead or tip, we look into it,” Plautz said. There’s been about a half dozen tips in Plautz’ 23 years working in Wadena. They continue to search and most of all are looking for honesty from those involved. “We’re still diligently working on it, she has not been forgotten,” Sgt. Pearson said. At this time, they are running down a tip which they believe may be valuable in finding Carla. “We’re still very much in investigation mode.” The police department puts out a reminder of the disappearance every November hoping someone will talk. They know that someone knows. “The reminders ... it just gets people talking,” Plautz said. “If someone is just too afraid to say something, maybe the next year they’ll get enough courage to say something.” “The guilty conscience weighs heavily on people as the years go on,” Pearson said. “We’re hoping to appeal to that, to anyone who knows something,” Plautz said. Plautz promises anonymity for those looking to share information. Police say Carla has extended family in the Brainerd area that would very much like to see this resolved. Anyone that knew Carla would like to see her found. The community of Wadena has been hanging on to hope. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s one of Minnesota’s most predominant cold cases just because of how she vanished and was never heard of again,” Pearson said. Plautz shared one difference with this cold case is that Anderson was such an innocent girl. “The most innocent among us, and to not be able to come up with the answers that everybody wants ...” Pearson said, talking about the difficult case. Carla was that picture of innocence. Her child-like 23-year-old face is one the community cannot forget. Waldahl, who had just been named investigator about two months before this all began, regrets that he was unable to solve the case while Carla’s parents were still alive. He continued the search until his retirement in 2002. Beyond that, he keeps an interest in the case and still gets people asking him if he followed this lead or that. \"It's never gone away. It's always there,\" Waldahl said. \"I hope someone finds her before I go.\" Details about Anderson's case are posted to various missing person sites including: The Wadena Police Department is the investigating agency.

        "description": "Authorities continue to ask for help in gathering any information about what may have happened to Carla Beth Anderson, who disappeared in 1987",
        "content": "Editor's note: This is an archival Vault article first published on Jan. 4, 2022. If you have information on this case, If you have any the Minnesota BCA at 877-996-6222 or the Wadena Police Dept. at 218-631-7700. WADENA, Minn. — On the night of Friday the 13th in November 1987, deer hunters were gearing up for the opening weekend, a fire burned in a swamp on the edge of town, an unremarkable brown car was stolen and the employee of the month at the local Hardee's vanished without a trace. Those events are either coincidental, or the keys to solving a three-decadee mystery that has yielded many theories and tips, but no answers. 12-minute listen: Despite countless leads, sightings, psychic visions and rumors, Carla Beth Anderson, who became the subject of an intensive search in the Wadena, Minnesota area, has never been found. ADVERTISEMENT Local authorities, though several generations have now held the case in their hands, continue to say the case is at the forefront of their minds. About Carla Carla is a white female who was just 23 at the time of her disappearance. She had blonde hair, blue eyes, and a half inch scar above her right eye. She was petite, just under 5 foot tall and just 80 pounds. Last seen, she was wearing a brown and orange Hardee’s jacket, a white Pepsi and Mountain Dew sweatshirt with three bears on it, blue jeans and pink sneakers. Carla was mildly mentally disabled. Carla was well liked by her Hardee’s manager at the time, Wayne Wolden, who went on to become the mayor of Wadena. \"She was a fantastic employee. Wonderful personality, lighthearted, smiling a lot,\" Wolden said in a previous interview. \"I used to call her 'spud' because she was like a little potato ... She was probably 4-foot-10 inches tall, maybe, on a good day, on heels.\" He added that she was kind and hard working. She was known to volunteer to come work at her job on days she wasn’t assigned to work. She had an innocence about her that makes this case even more disheartening. The sweet memories of the girl remain as current investigators continue to search for her. Anderson's loved ones stated local people sometimes harassed her or attempted to take advantage of her. Although she's mildly mentally disabled, she tried to lead as normal a life as possible and was proud of being independent and having a job, her own home and a boyfriend. Anderson lived at Greenwood Apartments in Wadena, just a couple blocks from her place of work, so she was able to walk to work easily. She was expected to have her photo taken the following Monday for the Employee of the Month display. It was one of many things that would go unfulfilled with her disappearance. ADVERTISEMENT Last seen Looking back at that Friday, Nov. 13, Anderson just found out she had been named employee of the month at work. She and her mother and stepfather went out to eat at Taco John's that evening to celebrate the honor. After dinner, between 7:30 and 8 p.m., Anderson's mother and stepfather picked up some movies for her to watch, then dropped her off at her apartment at Greenwood Apartments. Anderson got safely inside her apartment that evening. She had been carrying a cup full of soda when her parents dropped her off. The empty cup was found in her apartment, and one of the videos she had gotten to watch was found in her VCR. Anderson did not show up for her morning work shift on Saturday, Nov. 14, which was uncharacteristic of her, as she was known as an exemplary employee. She has never been heard from again. Nothing appeared to be amiss in Anderson's apartment and the only thing missing were her keys and her light jacket, with the Hardee’s logo on it. Her purse remained on the table. The apartment door was locked from the outside. The building itself had a security door, but the door had been propped open that night by other tenants who were moving in. On the night of Anderson's disappearance, there was a fire burning in a swamp on the outskirts of Wadena. She would have been able to view the fire from her window, according to the investigator at the time, Lane Waldahl. Waldahl has his suspicions about who started the fire that night, but no evidence. Authorities theorized she left home to look at the fire up close, and someone attacked her. There is no evidence to support this theory, however. That same evening, a brown Plymouth Horizon was stolen a couple of blocks from Anderson's apartment building and was never recovered. It is unknown whether the stolen car has any connection to her case but many believe this to be too much of a coincidence. ADVERTISEMENT “They’ve got to be related, but we just can’t prove or disprove it, yet,” Wadena Chief of Police Naomi Plautz said. “The one thing that has always stuck with me, that vehicle has never been located,” Wadena County Sheriff Michael Carr Jr. said. “If you were to find that vehicle, you would probably find her.” Carr remembers Carla going missing while he was a sophomore in high school. \"Still in the back of my mind there is a connection between that car and Carla,\" Waldahl said. They searched for the car across the region and combed other states. Wadena Sgt. Brandon Pearson reflected on all the stolen vehicles that they deal with now. Eventually they are found. But decades later, this one has not been found. Waldahl suspects it's in a lake or buried in a gravel pit. What’s been done Police searches, intense media coverage, state and federal investigations — nothing revealed what happened to Anderson. The police followed every tip. Four three ring binders are filled with the tips, the hunches and the interviews. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension also has a copy of all the details. A search committee went out looking to find Carla about five days after she went missing. A WCCO helicopter was used to search from the air. The Civil Air Patrol lent their eyes from the skies. It was deer hunting weekend when Carla disappeared, and hunters were alerted to be on the lookout for the girl. Carr said authorities acted fast as the ground was bare at the time of her disappearance. They knew snow would soon arrive and cover up any disturbed ground. Within days of their searches, it did snow, Carr said. ADVERTISEMENT Waldahl said the combined efforts of local, regional, state and federal law enforcement agencies was impressive and he feels they left no stone unturned. Years later he recalls speaking again with BCA and FBI profilers interested in taking a fresh look at the cold case. That again turned up no solid evidence to follow. Suspected serial killer Floyd Todd Tapson was considered a possible suspect in Anderson's disappearance for a time, but he was cleared from that case after being interviewed by investigators. He apparently had a solid alibi putting him elsewhere that night. All the members of Anderson's family have been ruled out as suspects in her case, as was her boyfriend. They were given a polygraph test and passed. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance, but little evidence is available as to her fate. A psychic who said she knew where Carla was came to town but brought up another dead end. Anderson was placed on playing cards in 2008 among a list of the top 52 cold cases in the state. The card decks have been distributed to all 515 Minnesota police departments and sheriff offices, plus 75 county jail and annex facilities. In addition, over 10,000 decks have been supplied to Minnesota state prison inmates. While the cards have been effective in some of those cold cases, no solid tips in Carla's case have come from that effort. In the days after the disappearance, volunteers including the Wadena Pioneer Journal newspaper staff worked to create 5,000 posters with Carla Beth Anderson on them, pleading with people to call if they had seen her. The posters were plastered all over north and central Minnesota. They even made it to the Metrodome as the local Verndale Pirates football team were playing at the Prep Bowl. Still searching Much has changed over the last three decades The former Hardee's is a Burger King, the Taco John's location is a parking lot, and all the police working at the time of Anderson's disappearance have moved on, retired or died. Anderson’s parents died months apart in 2008: Verne Wells on Feb. 9, and Roberta Wells on June 3. ADVERTISEMENT What hasn't changed is a concerted effort to solve this bizarre case. “Anytime we get a lead or tip, we look into it,” Plautz said. There’s been about a half dozen tips in Plautz’ 23 years working in Wadena. They continue to search and most of all are looking for honesty from those involved. “We’re still diligently working on it, she has not been forgotten,” Sgt. Pearson said. At this time, they are running down a tip which they believe may be valuable in finding Carla. “We’re still very much in investigation mode.” The police department puts out a reminder of the disappearance every November hoping someone will talk. They know that someone knows. “The reminders ... it just gets people talking,” Plautz said. “If someone is just too afraid to say something, maybe the next year they’ll get enough courage to say something.” “The guilty conscience weighs heavily on people as the years go on,” Pearson said. “We’re hoping to appeal to that, to anyone who knows something,” Plautz said. Plautz promises anonymity for those looking to share information. Police say Carla has extended family in the Brainerd area that would very much like to see this resolved. Anyone that knew Carla would like to see her found. The community of Wadena has been hanging on to hope. ADVERTISEMENT “It’s one of Minnesota’s most predominant cold cases just because of how she vanished and was never heard of again,” Pearson said. Plautz shared one difference with this cold case is that Anderson was such an innocent girl. “The most innocent among us, and to not be able to come up with the answers that everybody wants ...” Pearson said, talking about the difficult case. Carla was that picture of innocence. Her child-like 23-year-old face is one the community cannot forget. Waldahl, who had just been named investigator about two months before this all began, regrets that he was unable to solve the case while Carla’s parents were still alive. He continued the search until his retirement in 2002. Beyond that, he keeps an interest in the case and still gets people asking him if he followed this lead or that. \"It's never gone away. It's always there,\" Waldahl said. \"I hope someone finds her before I go.\" Details about Anderson's case are posted to various missing person sites including: The Wadena Police Department is the investigating agency. If you know any additional information or can provide tips regarding Anderson contact the Wadena Police Department at 218-631-7700. The BCA can be contacted at 1-877-996-6222, email bca.coldcase@state.mn.us, or submit information via the tip form (can be done anonymously).",

        "description": "Authorities continue to ask for help in gathering any information about what may have happened to Carla Beth Anderson, who disappeared in 1987",
        "content": "WADENA, Minn. — On the night of Friday the 13th in November 1987, deer hunters were gearing up for the opening weekend, a fire burned in a swamp on the edge of town, an unremarkable brown car was stolen and the employee of the month at the local Hardee's vanished without a trace. Those events are either coincidental, or the keys to solving a three-decadee mystery that has yielded many theories and tips, but no answers. Despite countless leads, sightings, psychic visions and rumors, Carla Beth Anderson, who became the subject of an intensive search in the Wadena, Minnesota area, has never been found. Local authorities, though several generations have now held the case in their hands, continue to say the case is at the forefront of their minds. Carla is a white female who was just 23 at the time of her disappearance. She had blonde hair, blue eyes, and a half inch scar above her right eye. She was petite, just under 5 foot tall and just 80 pounds. Last seen, she was wearing a brown and orange Hardee’s jacket, a white Pepsi and Mountain Dew sweatshirt with three bears on it, blue jeans and pink sneakers. Carla was mildly mentally disabled. Carla was well liked by her Hardee’s manager at the time, Wayne Wolden, who went on to become the mayor of Wadena. \"She was a fantastic employee. Wonderful personality, lighthearted, smiling a lot,\" Wolden said in a previous interview. \"I used to call her 'spud' because she was like a little potato ... She was probably 4-foot-10 inches tall, maybe, on a good day, on heels.\" He added that she was kind and hard working. She was known to volunteer to come work at her job on days she wasn’t assigned to work. She had an innocence about her that makes this case even more disheartening. The sweet memories of the girl remain as current investigators continue to search for her. Anderson's loved ones stated local people sometimes harassed her or attempted to take advantage of her. Although she's mildly mentally disabled, she tried to lead as normal a life as possible and was proud of being independent and having a job, her own home and a boyfriend. Anderson lived at Greenwood Apartments in Wadena, just a couple blocks from her place of work, so she was able to walk to work easily. She was expected to have her photo taken the following Monday for the Employee of the Month display. It was one of many things that would go unfulfilled with her disappearance. Looking back at that Friday, Nov. 13, Anderson just found out she had been named employee of the month at work. She and her mother and stepfather went out to eat at Taco John's that evening to celebrate the honor. After dinner, between 7:30 and 8 p.m., Anderson's mother and stepfather picked up some movies for her to watch, then dropped her off at her apartment at Greenwood Apartments. Anderson got safely inside her apartment that evening. She had been carrying a cup full of soda when her parents dropped her off. The empty cup was found in her apartment, and one of the videos she had gotten to watch was found in her VCR. Anderson did not show up for her morning work shift on Saturday, Nov. 14, which was uncharacteristic of her, as she was known as an exemplary employee. She has never been heard from again. Nothing appeared to be amiss in Anderson's apartment and the only thing missing were her keys and her light jacket, with the Hardee’s logo on it. Her purse remained on the table. The apartment door was locked from the outside. The building itself had a security door, but the door had been propped open that night by other tenants who were moving in. On the night of Anderson's disappearance, there was a fire burning in a swamp on the outskirts of Wadena. She would have been able to view the fire from her window, according to the investigator at the time, Lane Waldahl. Waldahl has his suspicions about who started the fire that night, but no evidence. Authorities theorized she left home to look at the fire up close, and someone attacked her. There is no evidence to support this theory, however. That same evening, a brown Plymouth Horizon was stolen a couple of blocks from Anderson's apartment building and was never recovered. It is unknown whether the stolen car has any connection to her case but many believe this to be too much of a coincidence. “They’ve got to be related, but we just can’t prove or disprove it, yet,” Wadena Chief of Police Naomi Plautz said. “The one thing that has always stuck with me, that vehicle has never been located,” Wadena County Sheriff Michael Carr Jr. said. “If you were to find that vehicle, you would probably find her.” Carr remembers Carla going missing while he was a sophomore in high school. \"Still in the back of my mind there is a connection between that car and Carla,\" Waldahl said. They searched for the car across the region and combed other states. Wadena Sgt. Brandon Pearson reflected on all the stolen vehicles that they deal with now. Eventually they are found. But decades later, this one has not been found. Waldahl suspects it's in a lake or buried in a gravel pit. Police searches, intense media coverage, state and federal investigations — nothing revealed what happened to Anderson. The police followed every tip. Four three ring binders are filled with the tips, the hunches and the interviews. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension also has a copy of all the details. A search committee went out looking to find Carla about five days after she went missing. A WCCO helicopter was used to search from the air. The Civil Air Patrol lent their eyes from the skies. It was deer hunting weekend when Carla disappeared, and hunters were alerted to be on the lookout for the girl. Carr said authorities acted fast as the ground was bare at the time of her disappearance. They knew snow would soon arrive and cover up any disturbed ground. Within days of their searches, it did snow, Carr said. Waldahl said the combined efforts of local, regional, state and federal law enforcement agencies was impressive and he feels they left no stone unturned. Years later he recalls speaking again with BCA and FBI profilers interested in taking a fresh look at the cold case. That again turned up no solid evidence to follow. Suspected serial killer Floyd Todd Tapson was considered a possible suspect in Anderson's disappearance for a time, but he was cleared from that case after being interviewed by investigators. He apparently had a solid alibi putting him elsewhere that night. All the members of Anderson's family have been ruled out as suspects in her case, as was her boyfriend. They were given a polygraph test and passed. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance, but little evidence is available as to her fate. A psychic who said she knew where Carla was came to town but brought up another dead end. Anderson was placed on playing cards in 2008 among a list of the top 52 cold cases in the state. The card decks have been distributed to all 515 Minnesota police departments and sheriff offices, plus 75 county jail and annex facilities. In addition, over 10,000 decks have been supplied to Minnesota state prison inmates. While the cards have been effective in some of those cold cases, no solid tips in Carla's case have come from that effort. In the days after the disappearance, volunteers including the Wadena Pioneer Journal newspaper staff worked to create 5,000 posters with Carla Beth Anderson on them, pleading with people to call if they had seen her. The posters were plastered all over north and central Minnesota. They even made it to the Metrodome as the local Verndale Pirates football team were playing at the Prep Bowl. Much has changed over the last three decades The former Hardee's is a Burger King, the Taco John's location is a parking lot, and all the police working at the time of Anderson's disappearance have moved on, retired or died. Anderson’s parents died months apart in 2008: Verne Wells on Feb. 9, and Roberta Wells on June 3. What hasn't changed is a concerted effort to solve this bizarre case. “Anytime we get a lead or tip, we look into it,” Plautz said. There’s been about a half dozen tips in Plautz’ 23 years working in Wadena. They continue to search and most of all are looking for honesty from those involved. “We’re still diligently working on it, she has not been forgotten,” Sgt. Pearson said. At this time, they are running down a tip which they believe may be valuable in finding Carla. “We’re still very much in investigation mode.” The police department puts out a reminder of the disappearance every November hoping someone will talk. They know that someone knows. “The reminders ... it just gets people talking,” Plautz said. “If someone is just too afraid to say something, maybe the next year they’ll get enough courage to say something.” “The guilty conscience weighs heavily on people as the years go on,” Pearson said. “We’re hoping to appeal to that, to anyone who knows something,” Plautz said. Plautz promises anonymity for those looking to share information. Police say Carla has extended family in the Brainerd area that would very much like to see this resolved. Anyone that knew Carla would like to see her found. The community of Wadena has been hanging on to hope. “It’s one of Minnesota’s most predominant cold cases just because of how she vanished and was never heard of again,” Pearson said. Plautz shared one difference with this cold case is that Anderson was such an innocent girl. “The most innocent among us, and to not be able to come up with the answers that everybody wants ...” Pearson said, talking about the difficult case. Carla was that picture of innocence. Her child-like 23-year-old face is one the community cannot forget. Waldahl, who had just been named investigator about two months before this all began, regrets that he was unable to solve the case while Carla’s parents were still alive. He continued the search until his retirement in 2002. Beyond that, he keeps an interest in the case and still gets people asking him if he followed this lead or that. \"It's never gone away. It's always there,\" Waldahl said. \"I hope someone finds her before I go.\" Details about Anderson's case are posted to various missing person sites including: The Wadena Police Department is the investigating agency.

        "description": "Amir Mir Cultivates Success with BOTANIQUEThe post From Passion to Profit appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "Amidst the picturesque landscapes of Gund Goushi, Kupwara in North Kashmir, a fragrant oasis has bloomed, offering a sustainable haven for nature enthusiasts. BOTANIQUE, an aromatic plant nursery founded by Amir Mir, an MSc Agronomy graduate from Panjab University, has become a beacon of hope and environmental consciousness in the region. Established in February 2022 with the seed of an idea and a heart full of passion, Amir’s venture was nurtured by the Floriculture Department’s subsidy, providing him with a greenhouse and expert guidance. With an initial investment of Rs 10 lakh, BOTANIQUE has flourished, boasting a reserve stock valued at Rs 20 lakh and a diverse collection of more than two thousand plants, ranging in price from Rs 10 to Rs 20,000. The nursery’s success is evident in its annual earnings of Rs 7 lakh, a testament to the growing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly practices in cultivating and distributing herbs, flowers, and other aromatic botanicals. BOTANIQUE’s vibrant hub emphasizes sustainable and environmentally conscious practices, nurturing a diverse array of fragrant plants amid the serene beauty of nature. Reflecting on his journey, Amir shares, “When I was studying outside, I would see different youth selling these plants in various markets of Chandigarh. I initially bought some plants for my garden at home. Over time, my collection grew. After completing my studies, I was confused about my future journey. Amidst this uncertainty, a few of my friends advised me to pursue my interest and understanding of aromatic plants, recognizing my passion and knowledge in this area”. Encouraged by his friends and driven by his love for aromatic plants, Amir established BOTANIQUE. What started as a small personal collection has now flourished into a thriving, sustainable business. His story is not just one of personal success but also of inspiration for the youth of the valley. Amir’s message to the educated unemployed youth of the valley is clear and empowering, “Instead of waiting and wasting time to get government jobs, the youth should come up with their own entrepreneurial ventures so that they can be job givers instead of job seekers”. “I don’t believe that unemployment has increased manifold, we should understand that government can’t provide jobs to every one. There are numerous financial assistance schemes being run by different government departments for the benefit of youth. The fact of the matter is that youth should come forward and take benefit of these schemes” Amir told this correspondent while sitting in his plant nursery. Amir who is firm believer of hardwork said that nothing can be achieved without handwork. “Initially my neighbours and relatives would talk ill of me but now with the growing success, I have earned respect in their eyes, in fact many take advice from me about starting their own venture,” he added.",

        "description": "Everyone is frantically looking for happiness all around, not knowing where it isThe post The Secret of Happiness appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "Once a group of 50 people was attending a seminar. Suddenly the speaker stopped and decided to do a group activity. He started giving each one a balloon. Each one was asked to write his/her name on it using a marker pen. Then all the balloons were collected and put in another room. Now these delegates were let in that room and asked to find the balloon which had their name written, within 5 minutes. Everyone was frantically searching for their name, colliding with each other, pushing around others and there was utter chaos. At the end of 5 minutes no one could find their own balloon. Now each one was asked to randomly collect a balloon and give it to the person whose name was written on it. Within minutes everyone had their own balloon. The speaker began – exactly this is happening in our lives. Everyone is frantically looking for happiness all around, not knowing where it is. Our happiness lies in the happiness of other people. Give them their happiness; you will get your own happiness doubled many times, the beauty is that it will come in an unexpected form with an element of surprise. This is what famously called as these days. And this is the purpose of human life. Happiness does not depend on what you have or who you are, it solely relies on what you think about them. Socialisation is one of the keys to happiness. People often think things like money or luxury lead to happiness, but research indicates some healthy life practices may actually be the key. Simple experiences like spending time with friends and family or practicing gratitude may promote a healthier outlook on life. Looking for ways to shift negative thinking? Want to increase positivity in your life? Ready to put that gratitude journal to good use? According to science, these five ways can boost your happiness on a daily basis. Expressing gratitude has been shown to do more than improve your mood. People who write down a few positive things about their day are healthier, more energetic, less stressed and anxious and get better sleep. The key is to make this a regular habit and do it with intention. Think about creating a small gratitude ritual. For example, every morning when you have your coffee you could think of three things that you appreciate about the day before. Or make it a habit to jot down three good things about your day before you go to bed at night. Your three good things can be really small – perhaps you saw something beautiful or just appreciate being healthy that day. In fact, science shows that it’s the small everyday experiences that make us happier, as compared to big life events. . Dr. Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler, researchers at Harvard and The University of San Diego, found that each additional happy friend increases a person’s probability of being happy by about nine percent. If you’re feeling down, reach out to a friend or colleague who generally has a more positive attitude. Our brains have mirror neurons that will literally mimic what the other person is expressing. So when you need a bit of positive infusion, connect with those who share it. Research has shown that spending money on others makes us happier than spending money on ourselves and doing small acts of kindness increases life satisfaction. Hold the door for the person behind you, say thank you and mean it when you get your drink from the coffee shop, pick up your colleague’s favourite snack and leave it on their desk for them. Even the smallest nice gesture can make someone’s day. Having friends can save your life. Low social interaction can be as bad for you as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and is twice as bad for your health as obesity. Even if you’re busy, you can find ways to connect with people you care about. Use your lunch break as an opportunity to call a friend or, if possible, take a walk together. If you’re busy during the week, how about inviting your friend to do some errands together on weekends? Research shows people report feeling happier when they spend their money on experiences rather than objects. We remember experiences for a longer period of time and our brains can re-live them, making our positive emotions last longer. So instead of that new pair of jeans consider trying a new yoga class or inviting a friend to the movies with you. Contentment at the personal level is one of the most potent causes contributing to happiness and lack of it, whatever the reason, leads to misery. One may have certain ambitions in life. Their non-attainment may lead him to discontent. A less qualified man than himself may lead a better life and this may cause discontent in the latter. Utter poverty may make one utterly discontented with life. There are two ways in which this discontent may develop. The right way, of course, will be the will and effort to set right the failure or defect in him by honest means. In this he may or may not succeed, depending upon the fruit of his past . But it is his duty to try. The second way is that discontent may turn as hate towards the other, or even the world for that matter. This hate, on its part, may shoot off into violence when frustrated, not excluding violence against one’s own self, or one may become demented.",

He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week’s election is turning his support to the man, , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a . That MK party, named after the ANC’s old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans’ support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn’t blunted Zuma’s influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the for Africa’s most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa’s presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma’s credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week’s Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn’t allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma’s new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping His party’s branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC’s irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK’s last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,” said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield. ___ AP Africa news: Farai Mutsaka, The Associated Press",

        "content": "Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth . George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades, excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.",

        "description": "A systemic failure to address the real issues plaguing our education system.The post Becoming a Scapegoat appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "In recent times, private schools in Jammu and Kashmir have increasingly become victims of misunderstanding, and mostly originating from shortcomings of government officials in the education department. This disturbing trend is manifested in several incidents that highlight a systemic failure to address the real issues plaguing our education system. One such incident occurred in north Kashmir, where a private school was issued a notice for stopping a child’s transport services due to non-payment of transport fees. The same parent had failed to pay tuition and transport fees for the past six months. Rather than verifying the parent’s claim, the education officer swiftly issued a notice to the school. This school, a beacon of learning with modern infrastructure and highly professional staff, clarified that it had only stopped transport services, not the child’s education, and had taken this step after numerous attempts to communicate with the parent. Shockingly, the parent in question is a government employee who receives child allowance and a substantial salary. Despite these facts, government officials did not investigate the matter and instead held the school accountable. Another troubling instance involves an education officer in Sopore who issued a statement against a school based on an unverified complaint about school buses allegedly speeding beyond the prescribed limit. The school, which uses governor meters to ensure buses do not exceed 40 km/h, invited the department to verify their compliance. Yet, without any investigation, the officer issued a notice to the school and disseminated it to all heads of government schools, causing undue embarrassment and disruption. These incidents are not isolated. Private schools in Jammu and Kashmir play a crucial role in shaping the educational landscape. Even children of government employees are mostly enrolled in top-ranking private schools, which speaks volumes about the trust placed in these institutions. Despite this, private schools are frequently targeted over issues like capitation fees, annual charges, fee hikes, and transport charges. And it seems that this misplaced focus diverts attention from the pressing need to improve the quality of education in government schools. Instead of scrutinizing private schools over minor issues, the government should prioritize enhancing the quality of education. This includes ensuring proper infrastructure, paying staff adequately and on time, maintaining HR standards, and fostering an environment that supports students’ mental health. Additionally, the government should address the problem of parents who default on payments and switch schools without settling dues, making the previous school suffer a monitory loss. The hypocrisy and corruption within the education department further aggravate the situation. Clerks and office assistants in government offices often delay paperwork until they receive bribes, under the guise of streamlining private school operations. This rampant corruption is a severe hindrance to the educational system’s smooth functioning. It is high time the government stops using private schools as scapegoats to mask its incompetence. By focusing on substantive issues and fostering a collaborative environment with private educational institutions, we can work towards a more equitable and high-quality education system for all. If we are to truly advance the cause of education in Jammu and Kashmir, we must address the root causes of these systemic issues and support all schools—both government and private—in their mission to provide the best possible education to our children.",

        "content": "TEHRAN, May 27: Iran’s acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country’s new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week’s helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran’s new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi’s time in office, noting that Iran’s crude oil production- a key source of hard currency for the country – climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the U.S.’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen’s Houthi rebels as Israel’s war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Analysts have suggested that Mokhber could be one of those to register. Meanwhile, on Monday marked the first day for Iran’s newly elected parliament, following a March election that saw the country’s lowest turnout since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Of those elected to the 290-seat body, hard-liners hold over 230 seats, according to an Associated Press survey. Iran’s parliament plays a secondary role in governing the country, though it can intensify pressure on a presidential administration when deciding on the annual budget and other important bills. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, has the final say in all important state matters. (AP)",

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu’s government does not like,\" Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it's too heavy. It's too important.” Spain, Ireland and Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by Ireland, Spain and non-EU member Norway might make on the ground. The recognition, however, is a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Angry words abounded, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognizing a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence. Those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares slammed the comments, and said his colleagues from Ireland and Norway were “also receiving absolutely unjustified and absolutely reprehensible provocations from our Israeli colleague” because of their plans to recognize Palestine. \"In the face of those who want to divide us with any type of intimidating propaganda, the unity of Europeans is essential to send a very powerful message,\" he said. Also on Monday, Slovenia’s Prime Minister Robert Golob said his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. Slovenia launched the recognition procedure earlier this month, and Golob has been under pressure to speed up the process since Spain, Norway and Ireland announced they would go ahead with recognition. Borrell said the actions of the Israeli government, including plans to stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, could no longer be reconciled with the idea he had about the state of Israel. “From now on, I will never again say ‘Israel,’ (but) will say ‘Netanyahu government’ because it is this government who is taking these decisions,\" Borrell said. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The latest attacks have centered on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 45 people Sunday , hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said such strikes will have long-standing repercussions. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. The strikes came after the U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice , on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. Albares said Spain and other countries asked Borrell “to provide a list of what measures the European Union could apply\" to make Israel heed the ICJ’s ruling and explain what the EU has done in the past in similar circumstances \"\"when there has been a flagrant violation of international law.” The joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries' ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Albares criticized the treatment of the European ambassadors in Israel. “We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” he said. “But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall for any provocation that distances us from our goal,” he added. “Our aim is to recognize the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.” Colleen Barry contributed from Milan and Aritz Parra from Madrid.

        "content": "The annual cleaning and fishing festival was held at Panzath spring in Qazigund of south Kashmir on Sunday. Hundreds of people from Panzath, adjoining areas and some other places took part in the festival. According to reports Panzath was declared a new tourist destination some time back and a park was also established there. Local people said that except for the park nothing was done to develop the place. They demand measures to bring Panzath on the tourist map in real sense. There is a need to develop the area so that it attracts tourists and generates employment for the local people. It is not only about Panzath, all such identified tourist destinations must get the adequate attention as far as the development is concerned. The required facilities must be kept available at such destinations. With tourism flourishing again for last several years there is a need to identify more tourist destinations and develop those. There is no shortage of such places. The only requirement is to bring such places on tourist map. For that, development of these places is important. The tourism must not remain confined to a few known and popular tourist destinations only. Those places are important and have been the backbone of Kashmir tourism. Besides these major spots the visitors must be facilitated to visit other such places also. The expansion of tourist places is equally important. Tourism has been helping the Kashmir economy and this economy has to be strengthened further. That can be done by creating necessary tourism related infrastructure in other areas as well. If tourism is promoted in other areas, it can provide employment opportunities to the unemployed youth. The tourism potential has to be tapped and must not remain untapped. Panzath spring is located at a distance of one km from Srinagar-Jammu National Highway. That way it can be a good tourist attraction. This spring is a source of water for around 25 adjoining villages. The water is not only used for drinking purpose but for irrigating the agriculture and horticulture land in the villages. It is good that the local people clean the spring during the festival every year. The concerned government departments too must take steps for safeguarding the spring from pollution and make plans to project the place as a tourist destination as well.",

        "description": "J&K's meat deficit stands at a staggering 290 lakh kgs annually, with local production meeting only 310 lakh kgs of the total demand of 600 lakh kgs.The post The centuries-old tradition becoming an entrepreneurial opportunity appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "Sheep rearing has been an integral part of the rural economy and cultural fabric of Jammu and Kashmir for centuries. J&K’s unique agro-climatic conditions, vast alpine pastures, and nomadic traditions have made it an ideal hub for sheep husbandry. However, with changing times and evolving market dynamics, sheep farming has now emerged as a promising entrepreneurial opportunity, offering multiple revenue streams and sustainable livelihood prospects. J&K’s meat deficit stands at a staggering 290 lakh kgs annually, with local production meeting only 310 lakh kgs of the total demand of 600 lakh kgs. This deficit is currently bridged through imports, but the demand for meat in the region is projected to continue growing at a rate of 5-7% per annum. Traditional suppliers like the Chopan, Gujjar, and Bakarwal communities cater to a significant portion of the local market, but there exists a substantial gap that can be addressed by commercial sheep farming ventures. Sheep farming is a multifaceted endeavor, offering entrepreneurs the opportunity to capitalize on various revenue streams. Beyond the obvious benefit of meat production, sheep also yield valuable wool, which commands a robust market both within and outside the state. Remarkably, 75% of the wool sheared locally is exported, highlighting the immense potential of this commodity. Additionally, sheep waste serves as an excellent organic fertilizer, highly sought after in the gardening and agricultural sectors. Furthermore, sheep farming aligns seamlessly with the state’s commitment to sustainable development and environmental preservation. Unlike intensive livestock farming practices, sheep rearing has a relatively low ecological footprint and can coexist harmoniously with the region’s fragile ecosystems. Vibrant sector for economic development Ready market for meat, addressing the existing demand-supply gap Multiple income sources from wool, meat, and manure Sheep waste as a valuable organic fertilizer Strong domestic and export demand for wool Rapid multiplication of foundation stock and flock Low construction cost for pens compared to other livestock activities Subsidized equipment and support from government agencies Sustainable and eco-friendly enterprise Alignment with the state’s cultural heritage and traditions While sheep farming presents lucrative opportunities, aspiring entrepreneurs should be prepared to navigate certain challenges. One of the primary concerns is the shrinking availability of pasture fields due to illegal encroachment. Additionally, procuring shearing machines and accessing skilled labor for wool extraction can pose difficulties. Furthermore, the harsh winters in certain regions of J&K may necessitate additional provisions and infrastructure to ensure the well-being of the flock. Conduct a thorough market analysis and feasibility study – Identify potential suppliers, buyers, and distribution channels – Assess the availability of land, water, and other resources – Develop a comprehensive business plan, including financial projections – Secure land through ownership or lease agreements – Obtain necessary permissions and clearances from relevant authorities – Construct appropriate housing and shelter for the flock – Ensure access to fresh water and electricity – Select the appropriate breed based on your objectives (meat, wool, or dual-purpose) – Acquire a foundation stock from reputable sources – Implement proper feeding, healthcare, and breeding programs – Invest in essential equipment, such as shearing machines and feeding troughs – Establish partnerships with local wool processors or explore setting up a small-scale processing unit – Identify potential buyers, including exporters and domestic textile industries – Explore value-added opportunities, such as yarn production or handicraft manufacturing – Establish relationships with local butchers, wholesalers, and retailers – Explore supplying to hotels, restaurants, and institutional buyers – Investigate the feasibility of setting up a small-scale processing facility – Collect and process sheep waste into organic fertilizer – Market the fertilizer to local farmers, nurseries, and gardening enthusiasts – Explore partnerships with organic certification bodies for premium pricing The government of Jammu and Kashmir, recognizing the potential of sheep farming, has implemented various schemes and initiatives to support aspiring entrepreneurs in this sector. Aspiring sheep farmers can approach the following departments for guidance, registration, and assistance: Department of Sheep Husbandry: Expert advice, training, and registration Department of Agriculture: Cultivation of green fodder and support for fodder availability Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Science and Technology: Access to improved livestock breeds and research State Pollution Control Board: Obtaining no-objection certificates and environmental clearances Power Development Department: Electricity connections Public Health Engineering Department: Water connections Revenue Department: Land rent, lease, and legal documentation Additionally, the Jammu and Kashmir Entrepreneurship Development Institute (JKEDI) offers comprehensive business assistance and support services, including access to financial schemes and training programs tailored for sheep farming ventures. As Jammu and Kashmir continues to embrace sustainable and inclusive economic development, sheep farming presents a promising opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs. By leveraging the state’s natural advantages, addressing market demands, and capitalizing on the multifaceted benefits of sheep rearing, this sector offers a pathway to financial independence and contributes to the preservation of the region’s cultural heritage. With careful planning, strategic implementation, and support from government agencies, sheep farming can emerge as a thriving industry, generating employment opportunities and contributing to the overall economic growth of Jammu and Kashmir.",

        "content": "Ras Al Khaimah (UAE), May 27: Fresh from competing on European tracks, India’s 9-year-old karting sensation, Atiqa Mir finished a commendable third overall, in a field of 19 drivers, in the Mini category and second in the Mini R category in the IAME Summer Series Cup Round 1, held at the RAK Track in UAE. After an impressive qualifying session in which she secured the second position overall, just missed out on pole position. Atiqa faced a challenging pre-final race, finishing in 6th place. However, she made a remarkable comeback in the Final race, quickly moving up the field. Despite the intense heat of 39 degrees, Atiqa set a blistering pace, culminating in a thrilling finish in which the top three cars crossed the line just 0.20 seconds apart. During the race, she set both the fastest lap time of the event and a new lap record for the RAK Track L Option layout. Reflecting on her performance, Atiqa said, “I had the pace to win, so I’m a bit disappointed, but it was a good race and I enjoyed it a lot. I had to adjust to the UAE weather and track conditions after driving in cooler European conditions for the last two months. I have another race in Dubai next weekend, so I will focus on that now. Big thanks to my team for all the support.” Atiqa’s performance at the IAME Summer Series Cup showcases her adaptability and competitive spirit, setting the stage for her continued success in the upcoming races for the fastest Indian behind four wheels. Atiqa Mir, a 9-year-old karting sensation from Kashmir, India, is the youngest and fastest Indian in four-wheel motorsports in her age group. Starting her journey at age five, inspired by her father, Asif Nazir Mir – India’s first National Karting Champion, Atiqa quickly rose to become the highest-ranked female driver globally under 10.",

        "content": "CHELSEA could decide to reject a spot in the Europa Conference League next season due to Financial Fair Play regulations, it has been claimed. The Blues were demoted to the Conference League following Manchester United 's FA Cup win. 2 Chelsea were demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League at the weekend Credit: Getty 2 Blues chief Todd Boehly could decide to withdraw from the competition Credit: Getty They had initially qualified for the Europa League by finishing sixth in the Premier League table, but that spot was taken by United at the weekend. A decision will now have to be made on whether or not they decide to accept a spot in the Conference League. Should they choose to take the opportunity, Chelsea will have to comply with stricter Financial Fair Play rules. However, football journalist Matt Law believes the Blues could withdraw from the competition for that reason. Back in April, he told the At The Bridge Podcast: \"Because UEFA FFP is stricter than Premier League PSR, Chelsea will not automatically accept an invitation to the Europa Conference League for risk of breaching financial rules and a subsequent European ban.\" There has been no further indication that the Blues could forfeit their spot. Chelsea have spent around £1billion on player transfers over the last two years, meaning they are now at risk of breaching the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules . If found guilty of a breach, they could receive a significant points deduction.

Born in Italy in 1980, he managed to guide Leicester to the Championship title in his first season as Foxes boss. His management career started at Italian minnows Ascoli before he was snapped up by Man City in 2020 to manage their Elite Development Squad. He guided the youth team to the Premier League 2 title in his one season working for the Citizens - with Cole Palmer in the side. His first senior job was with Parma but he was sacked after just a few months after failing to impress. Despite the team playing in Serie B and Maresca having an impressive squad he was unable to get them on course for promotion. He returned to Man City and worked as one of Pep Guardiola's assistants for the 2022/23 season as they won the Treble. He took over relegated Leicester last summer and made an immediate impact, with the Foxes winning the Championship title. Maresca showed his dedication to the job by living at the training ground for the first two months after his appointment. He's considered something of a Pep disciple and has said: \"For a coach, it’s important to have the mentality of a chess player.\" During his playing career he played under Carlo Ancelotti and Marcello Lippi - and alongside ex-Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi. The Blues are currently on the verge of appointing a new manager following Mauricio Pochettino's departure.

        "content": "The Bombay High Court on Monday asked CIDCO to stall its move to remove the hoarding concerned and instead suggested they come up with a policy or regime for hoardings located within their jurisdiction or area. The court was hearing a plea by advertisement agencies challenging the notices issued by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) to remove alleged illegal hoardings in Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area (NAINA). A vacation bench of Justices NR Borkar and Somasekhar Sundaresan also remarked that civic authorities said nothing to the advertising firms until the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse incident. Firms including Devangi Outdoor Advertising and Harmesh Dilip Tanna, proprietor of Gargee Graphics, had approached the High Court stating that CIDCO did not have the jurisdiction to send such notices. The petitioners claimed they had erected the hoardings legally after obtaining necessary permissions from authorities. Advertisement Despite this, they said they have received notices for removal of hoardings within 24 hours or face action under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (MRTP). As per petitioners, the authorities have warned them that if hoardings were not removed, they would dismantle them and recover costs from the owner. The notices by CIDCO come in wake of the collapse of a hoarding on a petrol pump in Ghatkopar on May 13, which killed 17 people. CIDCO purportedly issued notices to several hoarding owners after the unfortunate incident. Advocate for the petitioner firms, Mohsin Khan, argued that the notices were issued without a show-cause notice, which violated the principles of natural justice. Khan also claimed that authorities failed to verify the structural stability of the hoardings before issuing the notice, hence the action amounted to being arbitrary and ex-facie illegal. However, CIDCO’s lawyer submitted that the authority had issued notices to several owners of hoardings after discovering they had been installed without requisite permissions. The lawyer claimed that the same exercise was crucial as it was within the Navi Mumbai airport region. The corporation also claimed that the hoardings erected since 2018–19 had applied for permission in 2023, including those by the petitioners. Advertisement The bench sought to know if the authority had conducted any structural audit of all hoardings within its domain, and whether the authority was planning to bring a regime or policy in place for illegal hoardings within its area. These hoardings are not brought back to CIDCO, the bench said, and until the Ghatkopar incident, nobody said anything. In these circumstances, the bench asked if the corporation should at least not study whether the hoardings pose any danger, instead of bringing them down? “Have a reasonable policy view, otherwise case by case people will come. If you decide to demolish everything, that is also different. We are placing this on May 30. Till next date, if it is not pulled down, we are asking you to hold it,” the bench said.",

Tennessee, the consensus No. 1 team in the country for a month and the only team in the country to win 50 games three of the last four years, on Monday was named the top national seed for the NCAA Tournament. The 64-team tournament opens Friday in 16 double-elimination regionals. (AP Photo/Rebecca S. Gratz, File) OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Tennessee, the Southeastern Conference regular-season and conference tournament champion and the consensus No. 1 team in the country for a month, on Monday was awarded the top national seed for the NCAA Tournament. The 64-team tournament opens Friday with 16 double-elimination regionals. Winners advance to eight best-of-three super regionals. Those winners move on to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, beginning June 14. The Volunteers haven’t lost consecutive games since mid-March and are the only team in the country to win 50 games three of the past four years. They will try to become the first No. 1 national seed to win the championship since Miami in 1999, the year the NCAA went to the current tournament structure. Tennessee, which has reached two of the past three College World Series, come into regionals in the top 10 nationally in five offensive categories. The Vols’ 147 homers are most in the nation, and Christian Moore has 28 to lead five Vols players with at least 17. The pitching staff has a 3.83 ERA and ranks in the top five in four other categories. “If you look back to August when it started, the group has had good vibes up at the field every day,” Vols coach Tony Vitello said. “That’s a good start because when you win or lose, it’s going to be fun to come to work every day, and you can probably improve because you have guys who are willing to listen and willing to work together.” The national seeds following Tennessee (50-11) are Kentucky (40-14), Texas A&M (44-13), North Carolina (42-13), Arkansas (43-14), Clemson (41-14), Georgia (39-15) and Florida State (42-15). Seeds Nos. 9 through 16: Oklahoma (37-19), North Carolina State (33-20), Oklahoma State (40-17), Virginia (41-15), Arizona 36-21), UC Santa Barbara (42-12), Oregon State (42-14) and East Carolina (43-15). The last four teams to get at-large bids, in alphabetical order, were Coastal Carolina, Indiana, James Madison and UCF. The first four teams left out were California, Charleston, Cincinnati and TCU. The SEC set a record with 11 teams in regionals and five among the top eight national seeds. The Atlantic Coast Conference has eight teams in the tournament and the Big 12 has six. Selection committee decisions sure to be debated were having East Carolina host a regional over other contenders and Coastal Carolina, Kansas State, Indiana and Florida receiving at-large bids. All six of those schools have representatives on the committee, and all but East Carolina were thought to be on the bubble for bids. Chairman Matt Hogue, the athletic director at Coastal Carolina, said NCAA protocols ensure fairness by requiring committee members to leave the room when their schools are discussed and to not participate if their schools are subject of a vote. “One thing that you do want to have with a committee are folks who are tuned into the sport,” Hogue said, “so just as an inherent natural result, if you have quality people on the committee, it’s going to be likely in many years you’re going to have teams in that situation. So I think that’s important to note.” Other notes about the tournament: — Defending national champion LSU, in danger of missing the tournament six weeks ago after losing 12 of its first 15 SEC games, has won 18 of its past 24 overall and made a run to the conference tournament championship game to earn a No. 2 regional seed at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. — A total of 19 college players projected to be taken in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft, according to MLB.com, are in the tournament. The group is led by Georgia’s Charlie Condon, whose 35 homers and .443 batting average lead the nation. — Vanderbilt has the longest active streak with its 18th straight appearance. Texas is in the tournament for a record 63rd time. Florida State, which had its record-tying streak of regional appearances end at 44 in 2023, is back in the tournament and will be a host for a Division I-record 36th time. — UC Santa Barbara will be an intimidating regional host. The Gauchos have won all 25 of their home games this season, the only Division I team to do so, and have the nation’s longest overall active win streak at 14. — Oral Roberts (27-30-1), which made a surprise run to the CWS last year, won the Summit League Tournament title to make it back to the tournament and are the only team in the field with a losing record. — First-time participants are High Point, Niagara and Northern Kentucky. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",

        "description": "Cooking contributes to an estimated 1/3rd of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the world’s heat and electricity emissions combinedThe post Clean cooking in relation to climate crisis appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "Climate Change is threatening the world’s efforts to feed a growing population. But the way we produce and distribute our food is also part of the problem which contributes to an estimated 1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions. This estimate is more than the world’s heat and electricity emissions combined. Therefore, clean cooking assumes importance in the solutions leading to target climate crisis. On the world scenario 2.3 billion people are forced to depend on polluting open fires and inefficient stoves to cook their daily meals. Cooking with high-emitting fuels releases approximately 1 Giga Ton of CO equivalent every year which can be estimated to around 2.5% equal to global emissions. Cooking also emits climate pollutants like black carbon, which contribute to warming impact stronger than CO .Almost half of human-generated black carbon emissions come from household fuel combustion. It is also a driver of forest degradation, especially in Asian subcontinent, where over 50% of the wood fuel harvested is unsustainable. Unsustainable wood harvesting for fuel contributes to forest and environmental degradation and is also a major driver of climate change. In India only fifty-nine percent of households use clean fuel for cooking and forty-one percent of households use solid fuel for cooking, mainly wood or dung cakes, predominantly in the rural areas. Lack of access to clean cooking has dangerous consequences for public health, climate, the local environment, and gender equality. This was discussed in detail during United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28). The scale of the impact is significant. Cooking over polluting fires results in premature deaths and increases household energy’s contribution to ambient air pollution. The harmful health consequences from cooking, disproportionately affects women, children, and vulnerable populations, making household energy a global, environmental justice issue. It is known that access to clean household energy is a global crisis. In Jammu and Kashmir, we have not yet identified this issue neither any data has been compiled. Clean cooking requires attention from the policy makers, although PMUY has made some beginning in providing clean cooking options to some percentage of population but the challenges facing are enormous. Current state of Indian cooking necessitates LPG to be the primary cooking fuel to ensure the move from solid fuels to clean fuels, while directional efforts to transition to electricity and solar as cooking fuels could be taken up such that these sources gain prominence and wider usage as we move forward. But again J&K being a temperate zone with harsh winters is and has to face many hurdles if we do not understand the issue and plan as per our requirement. The electrification of cooking is a natural trend that has happened in several countries, especially in urban areas. This may be encouraged, as the share of renewable in the electricity mix increases and it will result in automatic decarbonization, focusing on generation and even distribution of green electricity which we can produce in abundance if climate change is kept at the planning level of each and every developmental project .This will help in the sustained use of the intended source and eventually migrating to access to reliable available electricity to ensure India meets its decarbonization targets and help address the aspirations encapsulated in Sustainable Development Goal-7. R&D is missing in our research scenario in all the universities and research organizations as more research is needed to discover other bio fuel substitutes to LPG that are derived from biomaterials available in India for blending. We lack Piped Natural gas supply even today and we need a serious look into our energy needs. Govt of India has devised various schemes in this direction. The proposed blending of Hydrogen with PNG and Stoves working on bio fuels like ethanol, methanol, etc., need to be piloted in J&K as well. The promise of clean cooking for climate, health, and social outcomes is clear. Yet, despite the proven benefits, the level of funding and investment in the sector has not matched the urgency of the clean cooking challenge. Here the climate finance can lead to the change in the entire landscape and it can play an important role in mitigating the harmful effects of polluting cooking methods, By harnessing the power of carbon finance in tandem with gender-responsive approaches, we can ensure that women and children, who today are disproportionately affected by energy poverty are not left behind in the energy transition. Addressing this climate challenge by increasing carbon finance for clean cooking projects, among other activities, is required to ensure that clean cooking is part of the broader climate crisis solution. For a sustainable world a strong requirement of bridging the gap between gender empowerment and environmental sustainability is required. There is a need to work together to prioritize programs that promote clean cooking while ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for everyone. Clean cooking is a proven and critical part of the climate solution. Today’s highly efficient biomass stoves can reduce fuel use by 30–60%, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas and black carbon emissions.. Rapidly accelerating clean cooking transitions to LPG and other cleaner-burning fuels will reduce climate emissions while simultaneously providing significant benefits for local and regional health, women’s empowerment, and local economies. Climate finance can play in mitigating the harmful effects of polluting cooking methods. The transformative and collaborative efforts underway across the clean cooking ecosystem will improve the conditions for clean cooking carbon projects and foster sustainable development. By harnessing the power of carbon finance in tandem with gender-responsive approaches, we can ensure that women and children, who today are disproportionately affected by energy poverty, are not left. The banks need to open up and start working in climate finance as well.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

        "content": "New York, May 27: The first batch of Indian players who left for the United States ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024 have reached New York to take part in the upcoming ICC event. Earlier on Saturday, the Indian cricketers including skipper Rohit Sharma, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and number one-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav left for the United States. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) took to their official social media handle and shared a clip of the players reaching the US for the upcoming T20 World Cup. In the video, the Indian cricketers were captured leaving the airport in New York and boarding the team bus. “Touchdown New York! #TeamIndia have arrived for the #T20WorldCup,” BCCI wrote on X. India’s T20 World Cup campaign begins on June 5 against Ireland at the newly constructed Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. India versus Pakistan clash will take place on June 9. They will later play tournament co-hosts USA (June 12) and Canada (June 15) to wrap up their Group A matches.",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) star Virat Kohli said he is happy with the way he performed for his side after bagging the Orange Cap for the IPL 2024 season. Kohli finished the tournament as the highest run-getter with 741 runs in 15 matches including a century and five fifties. He scored at an average of 61.75 and with a strike rate of 154.69 as an opener along with captain Faf du Plessis. “Extremely honoured to receive the orange cap for this season. It was a roller-coaster of a ride, I was really pleased with the way I performed for my team throughout the season but more importantly in the latter half where we needed to win every game to qualify,” Kohli said in a recorded message after the final as Shreyas Iyer collected the accolade on his behalf in Chennai on Sunday. The right-hand batter added that he is eager to replicate his form in the upcoming T20 World Cup for India in the USA and the West Indies. “Something that I hope to replicate in the 2025 season of the IPL as well. Thank you everyone for your support,” he said. The 35-year-old became the first Indian to win the Orange Cap twice in IPL history. Punjab Kings pacer Harshal Patel was awarded the Purple Cap for finishing the season with 24 wickets, the most in the tournament. “Deeply honoured to be presented with the purple cap. It’s been a very rewarding journey. I want to thank everyone who was part of my journey – my teammates, my coaches and especially my family, my wife and my son. Without their support, it wouldn’t have been possible. I look forward to the 2025 season,” he said.",

        "content": "Srinagar, May 27: Jammu and Kashmir Sports Council intends to open a professional gymnastics academy centre at Gindun Rajbagh Srinagar, following the pattern of the gymnastics academy centre in Jammu, to promote gymnastics as a major sport in the Kashmir region. At first, talent scouting and camps will be organised to impart gymnastics coaching in the Kashmir division followed by in-house competitions. Parents and kids are responding reasonably well to the coaching camp that is being organized currently. Over the next few months, more such camps will be conducted in both North and South Kashmir. According to Secretary JKSC Nuzhat Gul, the centre will feature world-class facilities for the athletes. “The aim is to attract the attention of aspiring athletes from the Kashmir region who want to pursue gymnastics professionally and take advantage of the Sports Policy benefits, which include financial awards, admissions in professional colleges under sports quotas, job prospects under SO12, and much more” she added. In an endeavour of this kind, JKSC, with the assistance of Manish Gupta, a well-known gymnastics coach, has organised a summer coaching camp at SKISC Srinagar. Over the years, notable accomplishments in gymnastics have been made possible by the Jammu and Kashmir Sports Council. Thanks to the Government of J&K for providing state-of-the-art gymnastics facilities established at M A Stadium. Gymnasts’ medal tallies have increased yearly at both the national and international levels. In 2018, the J&K Sports Council launched the Gymnastics Academy in Jammu. Based on J&K gymnasts’ achievements in the Khelo India Games and other national championships, this training center was chosen as a recognized Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy by the Sports Authority of India (the only Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy in India). Later in 2020, this academy was outfitted with world class gymnastics apparatuses and equipment, enabling J&K gymnasts to perform better in both national and international competitions and win various awards for J&K. With the help of these state-of-the-art facilities, J&K gymnasts have represented the country in major international competitions such as the Asian Championships, World Cups, and Commonwealth Games. Muskan Rana and Bavleen Kaur, both Academy trainees, have won gold for J&K and the Best Gymnasts of India titles in the Khelo India Games 2021 and 2022. The Junior National Team Championship was won by Muskan Rana, Manya, Vabhavi Sharma, and Jagriti Thakur. In both national and international competitions, such as the World and Asian Championships, J&K gymnasts have improved, won numerous medals, and displayed outstanding performance. Since 2021, J&K has yielded incredibly successful results in gymnastics. Over the last three years, 13 gymnasts have competed for their country in international competitions and have won almost 80 medals, including 25 Gold, 34 silver, and 21 bronze at national games and other major championships. These successes demonstrate the commitment of the athletes and their coaches supported by JKSC.",

        "description": "CARGOTEC CORPORATION, STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE, 27 MAY 2024 AT 9:30 PM EEST",
        "content": "CARGOTEC CORPORATION, STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE, 27 MAY 2024 AT 9:30 PM EEST Cargotec publishes new long term financial targets for Hiab business area and information on planned management for standalone Hiab Cargotec publishes new long term financial targets for its Hiab business area and information on planned management for Cargotec as a standalone Hiab company ahead of the capital markets day, which will be held on 28 May 2024 starting at 2:30 pm (EEST). As announced earlier, Cargotec is carrying out a structure change where there would be three separate businesses emerging from the current Cargotec group. Kalmar is planned to be demerged to form a separate listed company as from 1 July 2024, and Cargotec is looking for a solution for MacGregor during 2024. If the planned actions are completed, current Cargotec would comprise of Hiab as a standalone business. Cargotec announced in conjunction with its January–March 2024 interim report that due to the high certainty of standalone listing of its business area Kalmar by means of a partial demerger, the combined financial targets set in November 2022 for Kalmar and Hiab are no longer valid. Therefore, separate long term targets have been set for Hiab and Kalmar. Kalmar’s new long term targets were published on 22 May 2024 when the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority approved the prospectus concerning the proposed partial demerger of Cargotec and listing of Kalmar’s class B shares. Cargotec’s Board of Directors has set the following financial targets for Hiab to measure success by 2028: Annual sales growth over seven percent over the cycle Comparable operating profit 18 percent (1 Return on capital employed over 25 percent (2 1) as business area of Cargotec 2) as business area of Cargotec, defined as (Operating profit / Operative capital employed) In addition to the Hiab-specific long term targets, Cargotec’s climate target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all three emission scopes by at least 50 percent by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline remains valid. The target is validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In its planned standalone future after the solution for MacGregor has been found, Cargotec (future Hiab) is planning to publish a new climate target and applying its validation from SBTi. Cargotec also aims for a growing dividend of 30–50 percent of EPS and to keep gearing below 50 percent. “Hiab has a strong track record of profitable growth. We aim to reach even higher with our new strategy, which our new targets demonstrate. We continue to shape the essential industries we serve with our innovative lifting and delivery solutions and increase customer’s productivity, safety and sustainability. Setting our own financial targets is also a major milestone on our journey to become a standalone company,” says Scott Phillips, President Hiab. If the planned demerger of Kalmar is completed and a solution to MacGregor is found so that MacGregor would not thereafter be part of the Cargotec group, Cargotec’s Board of Directors is planning to propose to Cargotec’s General Meeting of shareholders that the company’s name would be changed from Cargotec to Hiab. Should such actions be carried out as planned in the leadership of the current President and CEO of Cargotec, Casimir Lindholm has announced his intention to step down as President and CEO at such point. The Board of Directors would then appoint the President of the Hiab business Scott Phillips as the President and CEO of the renamed company being the current Cargotec. Cargotec currently estimates that these changes to transform into standalone Hiab could take place during 2025. Current Cargotec CFO Mikko Puolakka would continue as CFO of standalone Hiab. More detailed information on the new financial targets will be provided at the Capital Markets Day which can be followed online at https://cargotec.videosync.fi/hiab-cmd-2024 , starting at 2:30 pm (EEST) on 28 May 2024.

        "description": "On social media platforms like TikTok, rumors are circulating that are causing fear around hormone therapies, such as the birth control pill, leading many women to reject these types of treatments",
        "content": "Eva Millet Experts are increasingly detecting women who reject hormonal contraceptives out of fear of alleged side effects. Misinformation on social media reinforces the notion that hormones are not natural and, in fact, harmful. This new phobia is also present among women who, during menopause, refuse hormone replacement therapy. The day a patient of Isabel Silva told her that she didn't want to take the contraceptive pill “because she was afraid that, by taking it, she would like 'less manly men'”, this gynecologist knew it was time to do something. “When I asked her what she meant by 'less manly men', she said she didn't know, but that she had heard it on TikTok...”, she recalls. It wasn't the first time that, in her practice, this social network was used as a source of information to reject hormonal contraception: such misinformation is becoming increasingly common on social media. This specialist explains how, through the internet, a discourse of fear and distrust has been built around hormonal contraceptives. This discourse has resonated among younger women, who seek information through social media. From the fear of “less manly men” to the appearance of body hair, weight gain, loss of libido, or the fear of infertility, misinformation about hormonal contraception spreads freely. “We live in a world where influencers have a lot of power and little information, and indeed, people without any kind of training make all kinds of assertions. It is a phenomenon that we have been observing among our colleagues,” notes the doctor, who works in the Sexual and Reproductive Health Unit in Villena, Alicante. Silva is also the vice president of the Spanish Contraception Society, which organized its annual congress last March. It was the seventeenth one, but the first to have a session dedicated to 'Hormonophobia': the fear of hormones. A phenomenon that, as the speakers concluded, is on the rise. “There are many influencers without qualifications, giving false information, offering profitable courses or products. The scientific societies are the target,” said Dr. Marian Obiol Saiz, a speaker on the panel. According to another participant, Dr. María Ángeles Gómez Martínez: “It's easier to scare than to remove the fear; the internet can be a cause of much misinformation. This rejection of hormonal contraceptives is part of the concept of 'salutism', coined by R. Crawford, which refers to the pursuit of 'naturalness'.” And the idea that hormones are “not natural” accompanies these false myths circulating on the internet. Misinformation that, experts warn, represents an obstacle to effective and safe contraception. In order to avoid using contraceptives such as the pill, the patch, or the hormonal ring, Dr. Silva says, “Some resort to things that make no sense. Remedies that, they tell us, they saw on some social network... And then they end up pregnant and don't want that pregnancy. That is a personal drama and a failure for us.” Other young women turn to methods such as the copper IUD (intrauterine device), which not all can use at these ages. Others, Silva adds, use condoms: “Which, when used properly, is very effective, but we always talk about double protection, which is a shared responsibility.” Whatever the case, before using a hormonal contraceptive like the pill. This rejection, Silva adds, also has social repercussions: “Because the contraceptive pill, by separating sexuality from reproduction, was extremely important for women's equality: a milestone in the history of medicine and health.” In such an important matter as sexual and reproductive health, this specialist insists that: “It is essential to get well informed, by going to specific units or to your gynecologist.” Her appeal makes sense, considering that, according to data from the Spanish Contraception Society, 44.7% of young women do not visit a healthcare professional for these types of consultations. With good information, adds Dr. Silva, not only are those myths that are currently associated with the pill and hormones in general debunked, but information about their beneficial effects (“which are many”) is also provided, starting with the significant fact that it prevents unwanted pregnancy. In the face of doubts, she insists: “You should always seek information from a professional source, not a friend who will give you information from a social network. Perhaps we are a bit to blame for not being more present on social media, but it's just that we can't keep up,” reflects the gynecologist. But these myths not only exist among the younger ones: misinformation also occurs during the menopause stage, where hormones (or rather, their sharp drop) play a leading role. Menopause is a biological process in which the ovary stops releasing eggs and a lower amount of estrogen and progesterone is produced, leading to various consequences: from classic hot flashes to insomnia, through memory loss and even depression. Although menopause impacts the quality of life of millions of women, the option of hormone replacement therapy raises many concerns. In line with this, the internet is abuzz with influencers advising to seek 'natural' solutions to alleviate symptoms of something that they insist is 'natural'. The message is to buy a fan and endure before (heaven forbid!) ingesting hormones to offset its drastic loss. “Hormonophobia may not be detected as much in the menopause setting, but it also emerges,” explains Dr. Clotilde Vázquez Martínez, director of the Endocrinology and Nutrition Service at the Jiménez Díaz Foundation in Madrid. This specialist has also heard the phrase in her consultations: “I don't want anything that is not natural,” which she attributes to the boom of this 'naturalistic' trend, which is almost like a religion, linked to natural childbirth without epidural, with pain, believing that there will be more attachment if a woman suffers during childbirth, and that I find hard to understand, truly, because you see women shattered.\" In recent years, professionals have been observing a 'naturalistic' trend that rejects any type of hormonal treatment for menstrual pain and menopausal symptoms This fervor for 'the natural,' she explains, is also present in menopause, where, in addition, hormone replacement therapy has had a very bad reputation, as it was associated with breast cancer by some (“very poorly done,” says Vázquez), but highly publicized studies. All this generated a great deal of distrust that, the doctor explains, persists in Spain: unlike other European countries, here the percentage of women who resort to hormone replacement therapy does not even reach 20%. Therefore, when in 2021 Vázquez published his popular science book With Hormones and Wildly (Vergara), he dedicated many pages to counteracting this mistrust: “Which, he explains, is due to there being a lot of misinformation and two biased studies that have done a lot of harm. But I have read the fine print of all these studies and I assure you that hormone therapy neither prevents nor increases the risk of breast cancer.” In fact, he points out: “After the age of 50, women primarily die from heart attacks: and that risk does increase significantly due to the estrogen deficit that occurs in menopause.” What is neither natural nor healthy, according to this specialist, is to stop producing these key hormones so quickly. “Because beyond the acute discomforts that menopause causes you, what actually happens is that in the long term it conditions the rest of your life, which today has almost doubled.” Vázquez always explains in consultation that the ovary has a life span “between 13-15 and 50 years”; a period that, until not long ago, was the life expectancy of a woman. “So the problem used to be excessive fertility, but now it turns out that there are many years in which a woman will live with an organ that, since it no longer needs to procreate, no longer synthesizes those hormones.” In short, there is a mismatch between biology and vital needs. And she says that estrogen is essential to fill this gap and provide a good quality of life: “Women have estrogen receptors throughout the body. If we only had them in the breasts and ovaries, I would say, 'since you don't need to procreate anymore, you don't need more,' but the fact is that we have estrogen receptors in the brain, blood vessels, bones, skin, hair, collagen, eyes, liver, heart... throughout the body!” Therefore, the endocrinologist says: “Being without this hormone has systemic repercussions of all kinds: emotionally, in the brain —lack of concentration, memory loss, are symptoms that many women mention during this period—, at a vascular level...”. “The natural thing -she summarizes- is to continue having estrogen. Of course, not in the quantities needed to ovulate, but enough to keep the tissues in which that hormone plays a role healthy.” “We are walking hormones,” adds Dr. Silva. “People don't realize it, but that's how it is: we have insulin that regulates glucose, we have a thyroid hormone that regulates our thyroid, and when someone has a thyroid hormone deficiency, no one questions giving a hormone to regulate it. However, when we have a deficiency, as in menopause, some people question compensating for it... What needs to be considered is that with hormonal treatment, whether for contraception or for menopause, we, as professionals, are regulating it.” In the field of menopause, another ubiquitous message on social media is that it can be managed by changing lifestyle: intense exercise, diet, and vitamin supplements before resorting to hormone replacement therapy. Dr. Vázquez recognizes this trend, but is very clear that “it's the other way around: hormonal treatment must be accompanied by a lifestyle change. It would be - for example - like saying: ‘I have diabetes’ and being told: ‘What you have to do is not eat or eat very little and spend all day exercising, but don't use insulin’... It doesn't make sense!”. Clotilde Vázquez reiterates that: “We are hormone beings,” and as long as we are alive, we have to have hormones. “For this reason, when an organ ends its function prematurely, as in the case of the ovary, it is not unnatural to replace this function, quite the opposite.” She gives the example of presbyopia: “Which is also something 'natural,' but if you don't wear glasses, then life becomes complicated for you...”. Just as cataracts and many phenomena that occur over time are also “natural”: “But if you don't take care of them, with the number of years we have left to live, your quality of life is greatly diminished,” Vázquez points out. The endocrinologist concludes that what is natural is to live in health, and to live in health we need hormones. Anything that is not health is unnatural.",

Bengaluru-based food blogger Vijayalakshmi Vikram says plant-based patties can be just as juicy, flavourful, and satisfying as their classic counterparts. “In addition, they’re healthier and great for the environment. It’s a win-win,” she said, as she whipped up some vegan burger patties with Bangalore Times for International Burger Day. When making vegan burgers, mushrooms and beans, are an excellent alternative, she tells us. “Honestly, there are plant-based alternatives for almost anything these days, so as a vegan I never feel like I'm missing out on anything in life.” “Being vegan for over seven years is more than just a diet for me, it's a lifestyle choice built on kindness to animals and a commitment to living compassionately.” BLACK BEAN AND MUSHROOM BURGER WITH THE MAGIC OF PEANUTS RECIPE INGREDIENTS: For the patty (makes six): 400 gms button mushroom 3 large potatoes 100 gms panko bread crumbs 100 gms tofu 1 full cup cooked black bean or kidney beans 3 tbsp chilli flakes, 1 tbsp soya sauce, 1 tbsp each of onion and garlic powder, salt to taste For the spicy burger spread: 2 red capsicum 1 tbsp garlic powder 400 gms of peanut curds (hung) Salt to taste 1 tbsp chilli flakes Veggies for the burger: Lettuce Siced onions Cucumber Tomato Jalapenos METHOD Prep work for patty: Wash and clean 350-400 gms of button mushrooms.

        "content": "In “No Pain,” the third episode of season two, Armand (Assad Zaman) shares the story of the Theatre des Vampires as Louis (Jacob Anderson) expresses reluctance to join—something that doesn’t stop Claudia (Delainey Hayles) from eagerly wanting to be a part of it. This week we bite into the history of and Lestat’s (Sam Reid) role in its founding, as well as , dark gifts, and more immortal romance. Levan Akin directs “No Pain” from a script by Heather Bellson in Anne Rice’s Immortal Universe of vampire lore, airing Sundays on AMC and AMC+. Taking a break from the isolating room at Louis and Armand’s penthouse, Molloy (Eric Bogosian) gets a real meal at a posh sushi restaurant in Dubai. There he’s accosted by a man who goes by Raglan James (Justin Kirk), who represents another mysterious party tracking vampires that knows more than Molloy is being told by Louis and Armand. Book fans definitely geeked out a bit here at the character’s introduction and little foreshadowing lines from James thoughout (if you know you know). Molloy thinks he’s not exposed, but after James advises him to be open to communication, he ends up getting hacked by the mysterious figure anyway when he gets back into the penthouse. Talk about a poor firewall, friend! Daniel is immediately sent files of more vampire information that he ever imagined in relation to his interview subjects and himself. Molloy tries to play it cool and hide James’ helpful info dump via chat box, as Armand arrives before Louis to share an on-the-record history lesson about the Paris Coven’s origins. The soft-spoken Armand is very old, despite his perpetually angelic-looking appearance: in 1556, the Roman Coven he was a part of sent him to Paris to head up its enclave, which lived in squalor deep in the shadows underground. They were run by sects driven through ancient religious laws and gods to keep them in eternal damnation mode under Satan. It got old very quickly for Armand; by the 18th century, when Lestat began to run amok in the city above, flaunting his alluring menace on the unsuspecting living, it drove most of the Paris Coven crazy to see such heretical behavior. But it intrigued Armand. In order to exert dominance as the Paris Coven’s , Armand reveals himself to the fledgling Lestat and informs him he’s his new master as he exists in their domain and must follow vampire law. So of course Lestat blows him off, with the swish of his cape and his blond bouncy hair, because he does not want to be an obedient, poor, peasant vampire. The rejection only makes the brat Frenchman more hot to Armand, who’s never faced a challenge. Naturally, the coven wants severe punishment for Lestat as they see him break so many more rules including taking a mortal lover. That’s the breaks for letting Lestat run his showman lifestyle—and Armand uses his ancient powers to literally drop his ass and drag him into cooperating with a show of power that switches Lestat’s view on Armand. The boy wants power and he immediately plans to get it, so he shows up to the coven’s hovel with Christ on a cross (literally) to dismantle the old ways, which is what Armand wanted but knew he couldn’t get away with. He pisses on their rules and old god worship, because to Lestat they’re not there to stop them from being gods themselves. The coven breaks loose into the night; some end up taking to the sun to escape meaningless existence, while others jump into power. Knowing they need to be reeled in, because careless killing endangers all of them, Lestat encourages Armand to begin the coven anew through the Theatre des Vampires, a show where they perform their true identity and take their prey while the living laugh at the fiction they think they’re seeing. Lestat’s reformation leads to a new age of the vampire, giving Armand the freedom he sought, and he tells Lestat he loves him while Lestat being Lestat only covets Armand’s dark gifts. As soon as he learns them from the , Lestat abandons him and the coven but leaves them the means to continue without him. Lestat’s ghosting and lover melodrama is something Louis is aware of and helps provide insight on when he sits with Armand and Molloy. It would take Armand 150 years to tell someone else he loved them, and you can deduce it’s Louis—oh, the piping hot tea! Molloy resumes Claudia’s Paris diaries, as she campaigns to join the coven that Louis wants no part of except to see her happy (and also he’s sweet on its ). She takes on the tasks of cleaning the theater house as she learns more about the coven, particularly Santiago. The acting troupe’s lead inspires her with his performances and dark gift of making people accept death before killing, and with her Daddy Lestat’s ambitious streak, she wants that power too. So Santiago takes her under his wing because he was also orphaned by a terrible maker, but of course he doesn’t know hers was Lestat—just some rando vamp named “Bruce.” Lestat’s presence is also felt in Louis’ motivations; like his former lover, there’s an independent streak that prevents him from having any interest in the coven, and that makes him attractive to Armand. The Paris Coven resents that even though all Louis does is enjoy Parisian culture and take up photography, with sporadic human meals, Armand begins to join him on his late-night wandering throughout the city. They fall in love over discourse about good vs. evil and enjoying music at jazz clubs—even with the occasional mental projection of Lestat showing up in Louis’ mind. Last season’s “Come to Me” song reappears in a fun scene as a diss track with Lestat on piano singing to Louis, “You little whore, you only want him because you’re feeling blue,” which disrupts the romantic evening—and Armand reveals he knows his maker is Lestat. Foolishly, Louis tells Armand everything and the reprimands him over breaking so many rules he needs to enforce punishments for. Honestly, the expectation that Lestat would even teach Louis any rules is ridiculous, so when he says Lestat told him “shit” the frustration is understandable. Thankfully, Armand is stupidly sprung on Louis too, so he doesn’t kill him or Claudia immediately as was probably expected. Louis, of course, does not tell Claudia that his new boyfriend knows the truth; he continues to build a fake story around their history with “Bruce” and bond with her over their shared Lestat trauma. It really mirrors the complex PTSD that survivors of emotional and physical abuse can carry on from loved ones—even after making it out of the situation, it can haunt you, and in Louis’ case this presents as that manifestation of Lestat always following him. In anger, Louis kills a random person imagining them as Lestat and carelessly leaves the body behind. Within the coven, Santiago points out that his own maker was killed for less. Tensions begin to rise as the coven wants Louis dealt with, even as they embrace Claudia. As they begin to induct her into the coven by reciting the rules every vampire should follow (not knowing she’s broken a few of them), Armand takes Louis through the sewers to finally kill him. Louis is ready for it and asks for Armand to take care of Claudia, but the reveals her being in such a young body will break her in time. Louis doesn’t accept that and begs for the coven to give her a chance, but Armand insists he’s seen it before; over the centuries, vampires in children’s bodies are not able to evolve past their physical limitations. Louis defends her, insisting she’s strong and it wouldn’t break her—perhaps blinded by her love for her. Seeing the damage Lestat has caused, Armand asks if Lestat broke him and Louis says no, but he carries him. The trauma bonding brings them together as do the life and death stakes here. The tension is too much and they kiss, starting a tryst and avoiding all the punishment talk for now. airs Sundays on AMC and AMC+.",

        "description": "It's raising awareness of research to protect the world's biodiversity against threats such as deforestation and climate change.",
        "content": "TRENTO, Italy — In a lush greenhouse high in the Alps, butterflies of various species and colors flutter freely while butterfly pupae are suspended in a structure as they grow into adult insects. This is the Butterfly Forest in the tropical mountain greenhouse in Trento, Italy, a project by the Museo delle Scienze, or MUSE, an Italian science museum. It's modeled on Udzungwa Mountains, a mountain range and rainforest area in south-central Tanzania that's one of the world's biodiversity hot spots. The Butterfly Forest features plant species endemic to the region, as well as birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates from different parts of the world, all inside about 6,400 square feet of forest with cliffs, inclinations and a waterfall. The Butterfly Forest was created this spring to create public awareness on some of the research MUSE is doing in Udzungwa Mountains to study and protect the world's biodiversity against threats such as deforestation and climate change. Ornithologist Francesca Rossi shows a female Papilio lowi chrysalis May 6 at a butterfly nursery rack at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze, or MUSE, a science museum in Trento, Italy. Deforestation leads to habitat loss, which causes declines in nectar sources for butterflies, changing the functioning of the ecosystem. It can also limit the movements of the insects, causing a decline in biodiversity and potential extinction of vulnerable butterfly species. Changes to soil and air temperatures are altering the life cycles of the insects, impacting their development rates, mating behaviors and migration patterns. Butterfly populations are declining in many areas, especially in places under intensive land use. \"Our aim is that of being able to study better, to understand better what is happening,\" said Lisa Angelini, a botanist and director of the MUSE greenhouse. \"Our work consists of monitoring and trying to develop projects in order to bring attention to biodiversity-related issues.\" Ornithologist Francesca Rossi holds a newborn female Attacus lorquinii May 6 at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze in Trento, Italy. Butterflies are pollinators that enable plants to reproduce and therefore facilitate food production and supply. They are also food for birds and other animals. Because of the multiple roles of butterflies in the ecosystem and their high sensitivity to environmental changes, scientists use them as indicators of biodiversity and a way to study the impact of habitat loss and other threats. \"Insects in general play a fundamental role in the proper functioning of ecosystems,\" said Mauro Gobbi, an entomologist and researcher at MUSE. Through a partnership with the Tanzania National Parks Authority, MUSE established the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Center in 2006 to support research as well as in development of environmental education programs for schools. \"Research on butterflies is essential for informing conservation efforts and ensuring the long-term survival of the insects,\" said Arafat Mtui, research coordinator at Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre. Conservation efforts such as habitat restoration and good land management practices, which address climate change impacts, are essential for protecting butterfly populations, he added. With at least 2,500 plant species, more than 120 mammals and thousands of invertebrate species, Udzungwa Mountains is rich in biological diversity. It's part of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Kenya and Tanzania that are a proposed UNESCO Heritage site. It has more than 40 endemic species of butterflies. MUSE's work here is vital because of this variety, said Sevgan Subramanian, principal scientist and head of environmental health at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi. \"If you want to have a monitoring of the health of the ecosystem, monitoring such indigenous or endemic insect population diversity is very critical, so that we have an idea whether the ecosystem is still healthy or not,\" he said. Gobbi, the entomologist, said high-altitude environments like Udzungwa Mountains National Park are suitable for studying the effects of climate change because they usually have no direct human impact. He and other scientists warned that failure to protect insects from climate change effects will drastically reduce the planet's ability to build a sustainable future. Scientists at MUSE said the main challenge in butterfly conservation is changing the current farming policies to increase the amount of low-intensity farmland, and promote diverse landscapes preserving the remaining patches of natural habitats. \"Often our grandparents used to say 'there are no longer as many butterflies as there used to be,'\" he said. This is \"absolutely supported by scientific research, which confirms that butterflies, like other insects, are in crisis. We are losing species, we're losing them forever, and this is going to break the balance of ecosystems.\" Heliconius Melpomene butterflies mate May 6 at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze in Trento, Italy.

Transcript Oscar Pulido: Welcome to The Bid, where we break down what's happening in the markets and explore the forces changing the economy and finance. I'm Oscar Pulido. The world remains a buzz over artificial intelligence, but rapid advancement and adoption of the technology is poised to drive a significant increase in power, demand, and this demand could redefine energy consumption as we know it today, we ask the critical question. Is the energy sector equipped for the AI power revolution? Today I'm joined by Will Sue from BlackRock's Fundamental Equities team. Will is one of BlackRock's leading voices on all things energy. He'll walk us through the sector's pivotal role in the build out and future of AI, as well as dig into the potential investment opportunities and challenges Will, thank you for joining us on The Bid. Will Su: Thank you, Oscar. Great to be here. Oscar Pulido: So, Will, we've talked about artificial intelligence on the podcast a lot, and it seems like there's no limits to the growth of this technology except the fact that it consumes a lot of energy and maybe that's the constraint. Tell us a little bit about why AI consumes so much power. Will Su: The simple answer to that extremely complicated question is that information processing is energy, and we are processing more information today than we've ever thought of, even from just a few years ago. At its most fundamental level, computations are just moving electrons around a semiconductor chip, but when you multiply that very small electric current by trillions of calculations, the energy demand adds up very, very quickly. I think Rob Goldstein mentioned this the concept of AI is not really anything new. The MIT AI lab was started in the late 1950s, we did have a breakthrough moment in 2017 when a team of researchers wrote a paper about the transformer, which then became the architecture for today's large language models or LLMs. Now, these models are being trained on trillions of parameters and tokens that make them high quality, high capacity, and able to contextualize the questions that they're being asked. And just to give you an idea of how big the computational power we're talking about is here. ChatGPT4 was trained on about 70,000 Zetta flops of compute power. That's 70 trillion trillion operations per second. Mind bending numbers. And as that number grows over time, that's why we're seeing this recent interest in meeting the power demand of AI. Oscar Pulido: Did you say Zetta flops? 'Cause I'm going to need a glossary. I think as we talk more about artificial intelligence, it feels like the terminology is new to a lot of people. And when you talk about power and the quantity, help us understand like, how much are we talking about on a global scale? Will Su: So as anyone who tried to model this out can tell you it's very hard to have a lot of confidence for 10, 20 years down the road when you're looking at something with such exponential growth. That being said, we did build our own model because as they say, all models are wrong, but some are useful. In building this model, it's helped us understand what the key variables are and maybe how the shape of that future power demand might look like. And the punchline is, we think there could be up to 1000 terrawatt hours of incremental electricity demand for AI by 2030, and that would be about 3% of global electricity. And keep in mind that the internet today already consumes 2 to 3% of global electricity for things like data centers, networking transmissions and increasingly for blockchains. In aggregate you could see total internet demand, including AI, make up 6 to 7% of global electricity demand by 2030. Oscar Pulido: And how is the world going to manage that power demand because it's incremental on top of what is already the demand for power, right? Will Su: Right. I think we can first dig a little bit into what is driving that AI demand. There's really three roughly equal buckets in our 2030 outlook. One is for training. So that's the power that it takes to train these very large models. And again, just to give you an idea of the scale in 2022 Chat GPT-3 came out. It was trained on 175 billion parameters and 300 billion tokens. And the amount of energy it took to train could power about 90,000 US homes for a year. Now you fast forward to 2023 when Chat GPT-4 came out, that model was reportedly trained on 1.8 trillion parameters and 13 trillion tokens. And the energy it took to train that could power 2.5 million U.S. homes for a year, and these models are getting bigger by the day. And the good news there is with each generation of semiconductors, each generation becomes about 50% more power efficient. So, it takes half the amount of power for one calculation. It's not enough to offset just how quickly the models are getting bigger, and then remember, more players are entering this game, globally, not just in the US but also in Europe and Asia. So, you add it all together and training really represents the bulk of the power growth that we see for AI in the coming few years. The second bucket for demand is something called querying. So that's when consumers, businesses, and other computers start to ask questions to these trained large language models. And in our model, we think you could see up to 30 billion AI queries per day by 2030. For comparison today, we make about 10 billion internet searches per day. But you have to remember that not all queries are created equally, right? A text-based query takes about the same amount of power as an internet search, but an AI generated photo takes up to 30 times more power, and a 60 second AI generated video takes up to 7,000 times more power than a text query. And video is big, it's 57% of all internet traffic today. So how the consumer adapts to AI video is really one of the key variables that'll determine just how much energy we're going to require to power AI. And then the third bucket is really for data center operations, mainly for cooling, because when you're doing trillions of calculations per second, these chips run really hot. So yes, 1000 terrawatt hours by 2030. That is a big number. I think it's a challenging task to meet that demand, but not an impossible one. Oscar Pulido: And maybe you can expand there because you shared a lot of numbers. you said the word trillions a couple times. the percentage increases that you've cited, particularly when you talked about how we use artificial intelligence to query, was quite large. So, what role do renewables play in this energy demand? I'm thinking about things like wind solar, are they the major component or are there other, sources of energy that we're going to rely on? Will Su: So, renewables are by far the fastest growing source of power generation. In the last 20 years. They've gone from almost nothing to 13% of global power generation. And they will continue to grow at a very fast pace. Without a doubt, renewables are going to play a big part, in powering AI, but also in powering this overall theme of electrification of our energy systems. Now renewables have one really big drawback when it comes to powering AI, which is intermittency. Right? Let's zoom into the Ercot grid in Texas, which is the largest wind market and the second largest solar market in the U.S. So, it has a lot of renewables, and if you just zoom in on a typical day, the solar power tends to peak out between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM when the sun's shining. And the wind peaks when the wind speeds are the highest, which is usually from midnight to 7:00 AM when you wake up. Peak demand really happens in the hours of 8:00 PM to midnight. That's when people are at home relaxing, watching TV, streaming, checking their social media. And you'll see that during that period, natural gas demand really increases to meet that gap that can't be met by wind and solar. And this is probably a good time to talk about nuclear, which people don't think of a lot, but it's actually today the largest source of carbon free power generation. It makes up about 9% of global power. But I think as governments around the world start to realize how much electricity growth there's going to be, there's starting to be a change in thinking. And in countries like South Korea, Japan, Italy, and here in the U.S. you're seeing regulators extending previously planned shutdowns of nuclear plans, and even in some cases, allowing them to restart after they've already been shut. So definitely don't count nuclear out in this low carbon way to power AI going forward. Oscar Pulido: So, it sounds like the, the demand is so significant that it is causing even some sources of energy that in the past that felt like, were becoming less of a priority to reenter the focus. Ultimately what you've said is there's a lot of different sources of energy that are going to help, power the AI demand. You mentioned nuclear gas, but also renewables. And if I could focus you on the US for just a second, artificial intelligence is not just the US topic, but it is the part of the world where the build out is really gaining a lot of momentum and therefore, how is the U.S. thinking about the power supply for artificial intelligence? Will Su: we really should talk about one of the biggest unsung triumphs in the energy transition so far, which is the U.S. Power grid has decarbonized itself by a third. Over the last 20 years, and about 60% of that came in the form of cheap and abundant natural gas as a result of the shale revolution that allowed us to substitute out much more polluting coal. You saw a coal share in the last 20 years drop from 50% to 16%. Natural gas went up from 19% of U.S. Power generation to 42. The other 60, the other 40% came from renewables. So, renewables, again, grew from almost nothing 20 years ago to 14% of the US power grid today. So, there's already a really strong track record of partnerships between natural gas and renewables to combine and help us decarbonize. Now, when you think about AI, and you think about data centers. The U.S. has about one third of the total data center capacity in the world, and I'm very confident that share will grow over time because we have the leading technology companies that are leading this AI revolution. And then we are also blessed with abundant resources, both traditional and renewable. If you look at a map of where these data centers are located in the U.S., you'll see that they're mostly in these big clusters that are located close to population centers. So almost half of all data centers in the U.S. are in Virginia. They're almost all in this six square mile tiny area called Data Center Alley near Arlington. There's other big clusters like Hillsborough, near Portland, Oregon. there's also growing clusters around Ohio, and you'll see a problem if you juxtapose that map onto one where the renewable resources are best in this country. The source of greatest solar radiation is in the southwest U.S., so that's places like Southern California, Nevada, New Mexico, and where the wind speeds are the highest are down the middle of the U.S. In the windy corridor that goes from the Dakotas down to Northern Texas. And they don't really overlap with where the data centers are located today and where the most growth is likely to happen in the coming years. And then to make matters worse, this country's really falling behind in making long distance transmission investments. We're making one eighth the mileage of new transmission lines than we did 10 years ago. That's a result of a number of regulatory and economic challenges with interstate infrastructure, and this is where natural gas is going to come in. It's a proven, mature technology. It's much cleaner than coal. It plugs easily into different grids, so it shapes my view that I think at least half, if not more of the incremental power for AI in the U.S. will come from natural gas and the balance will mostly be met by new renewable developments. Oscar Pulido: Data Center Alley doesn't sound as glamorous as like Silicon Valley, but it seems like it's also very important. Let's come back to your role as an investor. You spend your day thinking about companies to invest in, and if you follow the markets over the last couple years, it's been all about technology. But we're having a discussion about the energy space, and so presumably that means there's investment opportunities in the energy sector. Where are those? Will Su: Absolutely. So, as a value minded income investor, I have thought for a long time that energy is an undervalued sector because the market under appreciates both the volume and the duration for which the world needs oil and gas for the decades to come. And I think this recent focus on how do we power AI just shines yet another spotlight on how power hungry our world really is. And over time, I think that will help this sector rerate higher. Now, aside from that, I think the energy sector actually might be one of the most underappreciated beneficiaries for all the technological gangs that'll come with better generative AI. Some of the world's largest supercomputers are actually owned by large energy companies. Why? Because they perform a number of very computationally intensive tasks. Things like asset optimization, algorithmic trading, four D seismic imaging for new resource discoveries. And I'll give you one specific example, which is the industry is using more and more of what's called a digital twin. So, this is like a virtual replica of a real-world asset, something like a refinery or an offshore platform. It's just got so much data inside of it that you can do a lot of really interesting and exciting things. Things like predictive maintenance, fixing things before they break, things like stress, testing them for severe weather events or identifying methane leaks and reducing emissions that way. So, I think there's more than one way to win with energy when it comes to the theme of AI that's greatly underappreciated by the market today. I think the other sector that deserves some airtime here is utilities. So, utilities are a yield driven high dividend paying sector that's been somewhat out of favor in the last few years in a rising rate environment. But as the U.S. Grid goes from not having much growth for the last 20 years to needing to grow one to 2% per year going forward, there's a big opportunity for these utilities. It'll come after an initial period of heavy investments now, which utilities will win depends very strongly on what regulatory regime and what geography they operate in. Oscar Pulido: And it's interesting just to hear you talk about energy and utilities. I'm reminded we spoke to your colleague Carrie King, who reminded us that while it has been a very tech-driven market, in the last couple of years, there are opportunities that are starting to appear. And you're zooming in on the energy and utility sector as a function of artificial intelligence and power demand. But for an investor who is looking at this space, what should they be considering as they think about investing? Will Su: The energy sector contributes about 10% of the S&P 500's net income, but it makes up less than 4% of the index by market cap. And I think that valuation disconnect is driven by this persistent, and in my view, misplaced fear that this sector has no long-term growth. Because I think as we sit here talking about breakthrough technologies like generative AI, it is important for us to remember that there's many different poles for incremental energy demand in this world, and all or nothing approach to energy just isn't going to work. We have to find ways to help the traditional energy sources become cleaner and more responsibly sourced. At the same time, we scale up our renewables portfolio together, and only together will they be able to power the world forward in a pragmatic energy transition. Oscar Pulido: Right, the world is evolving, where the demand for energy will come from is changing. With the number of statistics that you've been able to cite about the energy sector and artificial intelligence, where does this passion come from? How did you get interested in this space? Will Su: Oscar, I'm having flashbacks to 16 years ago when I started my career at a large investment bank in the equity research department, and my recruiter said, you can either join the internet team or the energy team. And I had no hesitation. I said, energy, it's supply-demand driven. It's quantitative. The world needs this stuff. And you fast forward to today, and I think the internet index has outperformed energy by about 1,100%. But if you gave me a time machine to go back, I will make the same choice over again. This job has taken me to really exciting places all over the world. Offshore Norway, the Permian Basin in Texas, the Bakken in North Dakota, or deep into the Amazon jungle in Guyana. That's a country that's going to go from the second poorest in South America to having the same GDP per capita as Brazil in less than a decade because of their resource development. So, it's been a really thrilling ride so far, and I look forward to more of what's to come. Oscar Pulido: We're glad you made that decision 16 years ago and that you would make it again, if you went back in time. Thanks for sharing all this insight on the energy sector, on artificial intelligence, and thank you for doing it here on The Bid. Will Su: Thank you, Oscar, Oscar Pulido: Thanks for listening to this episode of The Bid. If you've enjoyed this episode, check out our episode with Rob Goldstein and Lance Bronstein.

        "description": "It's raising awareness of research to protect the world's biodiversity against threats such as deforestation and climate change.",
        "content": "TRENTO, Italy — In a lush greenhouse high in the Alps, butterflies of various species and colors flutter freely while butterfly pupae are suspended in a structure as they grow into adult insects. This is the Butterfly Forest in the tropical mountain greenhouse in Trento, Italy, a project by the Museo delle Scienze, or MUSE, an Italian science museum. It's modeled on Udzungwa Mountains, a mountain range and rainforest area in south-central Tanzania that's one of the world's biodiversity hot spots. The Butterfly Forest features plant species endemic to the region, as well as birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates from different parts of the world, all inside about 6,400 square feet of forest with cliffs, inclinations and a waterfall. The Butterfly Forest was created this spring to create public awareness on some of the research MUSE is doing in Udzungwa Mountains to study and protect the world's biodiversity against threats such as deforestation and climate change. Ornithologist Francesca Rossi shows a female Papilio lowi chrysalis May 6 at a butterfly nursery rack at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze, or MUSE, a science museum in Trento, Italy. Deforestation leads to habitat loss, which causes declines in nectar sources for butterflies, changing the functioning of the ecosystem. It can also limit the movements of the insects, causing a decline in biodiversity and potential extinction of vulnerable butterfly species. Changes to soil and air temperatures are altering the life cycles of the insects, impacting their development rates, mating behaviors and migration patterns. Butterfly populations are declining in many areas, especially in places under intensive land use. \"Our aim is that of being able to study better, to understand better what is happening,\" said Lisa Angelini, a botanist and director of the MUSE greenhouse. \"Our work consists of monitoring and trying to develop projects in order to bring attention to biodiversity-related issues.\" Ornithologist Francesca Rossi holds a newborn female Attacus lorquinii May 6 at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze in Trento, Italy. Butterflies are pollinators that enable plants to reproduce and therefore facilitate food production and supply. They are also food for birds and other animals. Because of the multiple roles of butterflies in the ecosystem and their high sensitivity to environmental changes, scientists use them as indicators of biodiversity and a way to study the impact of habitat loss and other threats. \"Insects in general play a fundamental role in the proper functioning of ecosystems,\" said Mauro Gobbi, an entomologist and researcher at MUSE. Through a partnership with the Tanzania National Parks Authority, MUSE established the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Center in 2006 to support research as well as in development of environmental education programs for schools. \"Research on butterflies is essential for informing conservation efforts and ensuring the long-term survival of the insects,\" said Arafat Mtui, research coordinator at Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre. Conservation efforts such as habitat restoration and good land management practices, which address climate change impacts, are essential for protecting butterfly populations, he added. With at least 2,500 plant species, more than 120 mammals and thousands of invertebrate species, Udzungwa Mountains is rich in biological diversity. It's part of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Kenya and Tanzania that are a proposed UNESCO Heritage site. It has more than 40 endemic species of butterflies. MUSE's work here is vital because of this variety, said Sevgan Subramanian, principal scientist and head of environmental health at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi. \"If you want to have a monitoring of the health of the ecosystem, monitoring such indigenous or endemic insect population diversity is very critical, so that we have an idea whether the ecosystem is still healthy or not,\" he said. Gobbi, the entomologist, said high-altitude environments like Udzungwa Mountains National Park are suitable for studying the effects of climate change because they usually have no direct human impact. He and other scientists warned that failure to protect insects from climate change effects will drastically reduce the planet's ability to build a sustainable future. Scientists at MUSE said the main challenge in butterfly conservation is changing the current farming policies to increase the amount of low-intensity farmland, and promote diverse landscapes preserving the remaining patches of natural habitats. \"Often our grandparents used to say 'there are no longer as many butterflies as there used to be,'\" he said. This is \"absolutely supported by scientific research, which confirms that butterflies, like other insects, are in crisis. We are losing species, we're losing them forever, and this is going to break the balance of ecosystems.\" A Papilio Rumanzovia butterfly flies through flowers May 6 at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze, a science museum in Trento, Italy.

(AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week’s election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC’s old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans’ support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn’t blunted Zuma’s influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa’s most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa’s presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma’s credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week’s Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn’t allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma’s new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party’s branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC’s irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK’s last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,” said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

        "content": "JOHN Swinney was today accused of “debasing the office of First Minister” by continuing to defend shamed ex-health secretary Michael Matheson over his £11,000 iPad roaming bill. The SNP leader insisted questions about the process that led MSPs to recommend a 27-day suspension for the disgraced ex-Nats minister had yet to be answered. 3 John Swinney has been accused of 'debasing the office of First Minister' Credit: Alamy 3 He has continued to defend Michael Matheson over his £11,000 iPad roaming bill Credit: Alamy 3 Douglas Ross has called it 'has shown that he will always put party before country' Credit: Alamy And admitting his friend and close ally should be punished, he repeatedly refused to say what he believed a fair punishment was, with political rivals labelling him “pathetic”. It came as the First Minister was embarrassingly caught on camera accidentally making what appeared to be a rude gesture in the direction of activists and watching bystanders as he campaigned in Cumnock for SNP MP Allan Dorans. And in Falkirk , Scots Tory leader Douglas Ross unveiled his own iPad calling for Mr Matheson to resign as he pushed for votes at a campaign stop in front of the Kelpies - inside the disgraced SNP MSP’s backyard. Mr Ross said: “By refusing to remove the SNP whip from Michael Matheson, refusing to back a cross-party committee’s sanctions and by suggesting the disgraced pal is the real victim, John Swinney has debased the office of First Minister.

This is something that John Swinney has staked his reputation on. He would rather support his good friend than defend the integrity of parliament Douglas Ross Scots Tory leader This included the seat of outgoing Scotland secretary, Alister Jack, who is set to retire from Westminster after the next election. But the visit was again overshadowed by the ongoing row over the First Minister’s handling of the Matheson scandal which began when his £11,000 iPad roaming bill first came to light last November.

Despite making a public apology in November, he hung on as Health Secretary until eventually quitting in February this year before the Swinney findings of the investigation could be published. Under fire Health Secretary Michael Matheson refuses to admit that he lied to media over iPad scandal Holyrood’s standards committee has recommended that he should be suspended for a period of 27 sitting days and not be paid his salary for 54 days - equal to a fine of around £10,000. And Mr Matheson is facing renewed calls to resign ahead of MSPs debating a Scots Tory motion calling for him to go - to be debated in Holyrood on Wednesday. But in Dumfries, Mr Swinney was asked if he was debasing the office of First Minister by continuing to defend the shamed ex-minister. He said: “I think our First Minister’s job is to make sure there’s fairness for everybody in Scotland, that everyone’s treated fairly whoever they are. “When I said I would be the First Minister for everyone in Scotland, that’s what I meant. “So what sort of First Minister would I be if I just ignored the fact that there’s a prejudicial process that’s going to be put to Parliament?” Every day that John Swinney spends defending his scandal-hit chum is another blow to his meagre credibility. This shameful debacle has shown once and for all that the SNP think the rules don’t apply to them Dame Jackie Baillie Scottish Labour deputy leader And despite accepting the disgraced Nats MSP should face a punishment, the SNP leader repeatedly refused to set out what an acceptable punishment would be. Asked for his personal view on what length of suspension from Holyrood or level of fine would be appropriate, Mr Swinney insisted that was for “parliament to decide”. Pushed on the issue, he said: “I’ll look to see what parliament puts forward and consider that point, but nobody yet has addressed the issue I’ve raised. “If this was you, your union would be going absolutely tonto about the prejudice that’s involved. None of you would put up with it. “And I don’t know why that issue that I’ve raised, which is a serious issue, is not being addressed.” Mr Swinney also denied he would face a “Swinney slump” with voters - as predicted by Scottish Labour - for backing Mr Matheson. The SNP leader insisted his defence was simply about pointing out “something that I think is wrong with a parliamentary process”. DAME Jackie Baillie, the Scottish Labour deputy leader, said the response from Mr Swinney was “another blow” to the First Minister. She said: “Every day that John Swinney spends defending his scandal-hit chum is another blow to his meagre credibility. “This shameful debacle has shown once and for all that the SNP think the rules don’t apply to them.” And the Scottish Lib Dem’s Willie Rennie said: “John Swinney is an increasingly isolated figure as his own SNP members of the standards committee agreed that Michael Matheson should be fined and sanctioned. “There was only a disagreement on the length of the suspension, yet John Swinney believes there should be no further penalty. “So, it’s wrong for the First Minister to seek to undermine the committee and overturn the decision even if Michael Matheson is his friend.” He said: “I don’t think it would say very much about me if I just turned a blind eye to something that, in any other walk of life, people would be raising deep concerns about. “In any other field, where somebody prejudiced the process, there would be enormous concern being raised.” But Scots Tory leader Mr Ross - who spent the day campaigning in Mr Matheson’s constituency - added that even SNP parliamentarians believed the First Minister’s decision to back his mate was “shameful” and “defending the indefensible”. He added: “They know the public believe Michael Matheson should lose his job and that their leader is desperately out of touch. “It’s pathetic that he can’t even say what he does consider to be an appropriate punishment for someone who billed the taxpayer for roaming charges racked up on a family holiday and then repeatedly lied when he was rumbled.” And he added that the First Minister had “staked his reputation” on defending Mr Matheson.

        "content": "President Biden recently raised taxes on American consumers and businesses and may have hastened the end of the dollar’s world reserve currency status. President Biden did this by increasing tariffs on Chinese imports. Specifically, President Biden raised tariffs on products including Chinese-produced steel and aluminum and many components imported from China for use in manufacturing electric vehicle batteries. Tariffs on Chinese-made semiconductors are rising from 25 to 50 percent while tariffs on Chinese-made electronic vehicles are rising from 25 percent to an astounding 100 percent. Of course, the costs of these tariffs will be borne by Americans wishing to purchase electric cars and American electric car manufacturers that use material imported from China. These new tariffs thus undercut Biden’s goal of getting more Americans to drive electric cars. The tariffs on Chinese goods give China even greater Inventive to challenge the dollar’s world reserve currency status. The same week Biden imposed these tariffs, China President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced they were strengthening their alliance in order to better challenge US military and economic hegemony. This is a reaction to US foreign policy of the post-Cold War era which has reversed the Richard Nixon-Henry Kissinger strategy of pursuing good relations with China. A part of the announcement recognized use of the Chinese yuan and Russian ruble for over 90 percent of the trade between the two countries. This is only the latest challenge to the dollar’s world reserve currency status. China’s share of the global economy has more than doubled in the last twenty years from 8.9 percent to 18.5 percent while the US share of the global economy has fallen from 20.1 percent to 15.5 percent. China’s rise is one reason why the US currency held by foreign central banks has dropped from over 70 percent in the early 2000s to under 60 percent today. Last year, China and Saudi Arabia agreed to expand their use of their own currencies in trade between the two countries. This is the first time the Saudis have agreed to use a currency other than the dollar for the oil trade since Henry Kissinger negotiated a deal where the Saudis would trade exclusively in dollars in return for US support for the Saudi regime. The “petrodollar” is a major reason why the dollar retained the world reserve currency status after President Nixon severed the last link between the dollar and gold.

It would also reduce other countries’ interest in purchasing US debt instruments. This would increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt, creating more price inflation and leading to a major economic crisis. This will not just end the US military and financial empire abroad. It will also end the welfare state at home. Since both major presidential candidates and most Congress members are not serious about making the changes in foreign, domestic, and monetary policy necessary to avoid the crisis, America will likely face hard times in the near future.

        "description": "Chinese regime is making efforts to strengthen relationships with Tokyo and Seoul as the two major trade partners move closer to Washington",
        "content": "China, Japan, and South Korea have agreed to increase cooperation, after leaders of the three Asian neighbors held their first summit in more than four years in Seoul. Speaking at a joint conference following the meeting, Mr. Yoon expressed his hope of swiftly resuming free trade agreement negotiations between the three countries, which have been suspended since 2019. Mr. Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral leaders’ meeting. In 2008, leaders of the three economies, which account for about a quarter of the world’s gross domestic product, agreed to convene a meeting annually. However, the meetings stalled after the last one in December 2019 in the southern Chinese city of Chengdu because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the complex ties between the three countries. As for China’s side, Mr. Li said the regime wants to cooperate with South Korea and Japan in economic and technological areas, especially on supply chains and cutting-edge areas such as artificial intelligence. The summit was also overshadowed by the nuclear threat from North Korea. Just hours ahead of the three-way meetings, the regime led by Kim Jong Un notified Japan of its plan to fire a rocket to send a second military spy satellite into orbit. Against this backdrop, analysts signaled low expectations for any significant improvement in the relationship among the three Asian neighbors, despite Bejing’s efforts to bring Seoul and Tokyo closer. “China is seeking to mend diplomatic ties with South Korea and Japan, and the summit provides a good opportunity. However, the eventual results of the engagements will be heavily influenced by China’s overarching strategy,” Chen Ping-Kuei, an expert in international relationships at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, told The Epoch Times. Mr. Chen said he maintains a “pessimistic outlook” regarding the potential outcomes of the CCP’s diplomatic efforts, given that the Chinese premier still complained about the two countries’ expanding partnership with Washington while calling for cooperation. Meanwhile, there is little indication that Mr. Yoon and Mr. Kishida responded to Mr. Li’s calls, according to Chen Shih-min (not related to Chen Ping-Kuei), an international security expert at the National Taiwan University in Taipei. He believes it’s unsurprising that Japan and South Korea agreed to explore economic cooperation with China because all three countries are grappling with economic challenges. However, when it comes to crucial matters such as security and supply chains, both Tokyo and Seoul are expected to bolster their ties with Washington. “For Japan and South Korea, they will continue to prioritize and focus on enhancing their cooperation with the United States, and this trajectory, I believe, remains unchanged,” Mr. Chen Shih-min told The Epoch Times. Mr. Kishida also raised “serious concerns” about the situations in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and the South China Sea, according to a readout issued by Mr. Kishida’s office. Regarding Taiwan, Mr. Kishida told Mr. Li that Japan is “closely monitoring relevant developments, including military activities.”",

        "content": "(ANNews) – Paula Bailey, a primary care nurse practitioner, proudly embraces her European and Indigenous heritage. As part of a growing demographic celebrating their rich histories, she stands as a role model, both in her professional career and in the beauty industry. Through her journey, Paula uplifts others and demonstrates the possibilities that lie ahead. “I grew up in Fort McMurray, Alberta, with a mixture of Indigenous and Caucasian heritage,” Bailey shared. “My family roots are European and Indigenous, with my dad’s side hailing from Newfoundland and my late mother from the Northwest Territories, specifically the hamlet of Fort Resolution.” Bailey’s upbringing fueled her passion for promoting health and wellness within Indigenous communities. “My late grandmother, Elizabeth Giroux, worked as a community health representative in Fort Resolution,” she explained. “Her dedication inspired me to pursue nursing.” After graduating from the University of Alberta in 2005, Bailey began her registered nursing career with Health Canada, serving First Nations communities in the Edmonton area. Over the years she worked in other capacities but always circled back to her passion of Indigenous health. Paula’s experiences with Indigenous populations ultimately motivated her to further her education. “Witnessing the unique needs and challenges drove me to pursue a master’s in nursing, specializing as a Nurse Practitioner,” Bailey noted. In 2023, Bailey obtained her master’s degree from the University of Saskatchewan and began providing primary care services in the Rocky Mountain House area. In her youth and alongside her nursing career, Bailey pursued modeling as a means of personal growth and empowerment. “Modeling allowed me to step out of my shell and gain confidence,” she stated. “It’s been a journey of self-discovery and connection with fellow Indigenous artists and models like Michelle Houle and Lauren Bellerose.” Paula graced the pages of local fashion publications in Alberta, with features in the Edmonton Journal and having television appearances during Western Canada Fashion Week. Paula was also a top 20 contestant in the Miss Universe Canada pageant in 2009. Paula’s interest in the beauty and fashion sector also transpired into obtaining certification in cosmetic injections in 2019, which has since evolved as another passion in her career. “The cosmetic injection industry has become mainstream with its purposes in self-care and aging gracefully,” she affirmed. This transition marks a rare instance of an Indigenous nurse with a master’s degree offering services that focus on empowering others in a way that contrasts her work in Indigenous communities. “I enjoy the balance of both passions; they are each unique and rewarding in their own ways,” she noted. “As a licensed medical professional, my priority is to ensure safety and build trust through the quality of care I deliver, regardless of the setting I am in.” When Paula is not working as a nurse practitioner in Indigenous communities, she is occupied with advancing her skills in medical aesthetics from her home base of Calgary. Bailey acknowledges the significance of government investment in Aboriginal health careers programs and encourages Indigenous youth to pursue these opportunities in post-secondary education. “Education is key to success and empowerment,” she emphasizes. “I aim to inspire Indigenous youth to explore their passions and contribute to their communities.” Advocating for education and cultural competence within healthcare, Bailey maintains her dedication to serving Indigenous communities and fostering holistic well-being. By investing in local talent and empowering Indigenous individuals to enter healthcare professions, both Indigenous communities and the broader Canadian population stand to benefit and thrive.",

        "content": "Mike Tyson is doing well after suffering a brief medical emergency mid-flight on Sunday. In a statement, per the 57-year-old boxer's rep, Tyson's medical incident stemmed from an ulcer flare up. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" the rep tells ET. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Tyson's rep clarified information that he flight was delayed due to his emergency. \"However, it’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,\" the rep added. \"This two hour delay was due to air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" According to In Touch , who was the first to report the news, the former heavyweight champion became ill on a flight from Miami, Florida to Los Angeles, California. Approximately 30 minutes before landing, the outlet reports that passengers got a message asking if there were medical professionals onboard the plane. After arriving at LAX, paramedics helped the decorated athlete. Tyson is scheduled to get back in the ring in July for a heavyweight flight against social media star-turned boxer, Jake Paul. The event is scheduled to be held July 20 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Earlier this month, ET spoke to Tyson during a press conference who said he doesn't see Paul as a \"formidable opponent.\" When asked if he considers the 27-year-old a threat, Tyson didn't hold back. \"Anybody [is a] threat [when] there's two men in the ring, everybody's a threat,\" Tyson said. Tyson -- who will mark his return to the ring after 19 years -- also revealed what he told Paul ahead of the match. \"I don't think so, but we'll see,\" he stated when asked if he thinks Paul will pose a challenge. \"I gave him his warning: Fight like your life depends on it because it does. [But] I'm not concerned about anything. If I was concerned, I wouldn't be here talking to you.\" Tyson hasn't boxed publicly since his 2020 exhibition against fellow legend Roy Jones Jr. ended in a draw. The Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson heavyweight bout will be streamed globally by Netflix from an exhibition boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on July 20.

        "description": "He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Story continues below advertisement Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. More on Sports Goalie Stuart Skinner goes from pulled to praised as Oilers seek 2-0 lead over Stars Hintz, Henrique both game-time decisions with Oilers looking to take 2-0 lead in WCF Travis Kelce doesn’t want to ‘judge’ Harrison Butker for ‘homemaker’ speech How a TV show led to a Brazilian man’s love of the Edmonton Oilers Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candour that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Story continues below advertisement Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Story continues below advertisement “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

Now, here are the matchups for all 16 regionals, plus a reminder that each region is seeded one through four and is hosted by one of the 16 national seeds.

        "content": "Daley Blind is far from a household name, but at 34 years old he has been a driving force in Girona's first Champions League qualification. Alex Caparros/Getty Images On the penultimate weekend of the season, Deportivo Alaves played Getafe on Saturday night while everyone else played on Sunday. Why? Because they could. In the final two rounds, LaLiga schedules all the games that have anything riding on them at the same time on the same day, an act of competitive integrity designed to ensure that no one with objectives to fulfil or their life on the line has an unfair advantage or disadvantage. Only those with nothing to play for are put on different days. In week 37, that meant Alaves, and that meant a lot. In fact, them playing there, Mendizorroza packed but unnoticed by the rest, was almost the perfect portrait of the perfect season. Perfect?! Yep, pretty much. Irrelevance might not sound very exciting, but this is massive. Midtable mediocrity? That's not mediocre at all, not here. And the fact that few have talked about Alaves? Well, that's a good thing: a reflection of a lack of drama, just a job very well done. That they could get here safe with weeks to spare is a success. The lack of the epic kind of storylines that occupy everyone -- from managerial changes to desperate fights for survival, from wild swings in form to last-minute flukes, jeopardy or glory in every game -- gave Alaves a kind of anonymity. Justice, though, says that it is time to say their name. El Glorioso, their fans call them. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) They're not alone, either, so here's ESPN's guide to the unsung stars of the season -- some of whom you might not have heard much of, and no one could really blame you for that. It's time to give something back to those getting on with just being very good, a little love to LaLiga's best, pound for pound. THE CLUB: Alaves Alaves have Hagi, but not that one (Gheorghe). They have Simeone, but not that one (Diego) either. Instead, these are Ianis and Giuliano, the sons of illustrious footballers. And in Simeone's case, he spent much of the season injured, coming back just in time to help Alaves beat Atletico Madrid, which prompted their coach and his dad, Diego, to admiringly say: \"On the pitch, he has no mother or father.\" Alaves have the lowest budget in the whole league, their salary limit set at â¬31.28m, which is 10 times smaller than Atletico's. And 24 times smaller than Real Madrid's. More to the point, it is less than half the size of Granada's and Almeria's, both of whom went down. Alaves didn't, and it was clear pretty early that they weren't going to. The late loan signing of Samu Omorodion helped, but this was all of them, the work done by Luis GarcÃ­a and his players hugely impressive. Alaves are top in only one stat this season: penalties conceded. They're third in own goals and handballs committed. Not exactly beneficiaries of luck, then. But they do get a lot of crosses in -- only two teams have more -- and they have competed weekend after weekend. Except that they, more than anyone else, have repeatedly been dumped in the Monday and Friday slots no one wants. Until, as the end was close, they played on Saturday. Because they could, which was a lot more than many others could say. At the start of the season, Luis Garcia warned his players that unlike last year, when they came up from the second division, they were going to lose a lot of games, a new reality they would have to get used to and know how to manage. They did so superbly. And they won a lot of games too. Alaves have been fun, entertaining and free-wheeling all season long. Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty ImagesTHE COACH: Jagoba Arrasate, Osasuna There's also Luis Garcia, obviously, but, well ... that's covered by Alaves' team award. There's Ruben Baraja, the Valencia manager, who has surprised everyone and who put it neatly: \"Don't forget where we came from last year, how hard it was. This time we have achieved our objectives [survival] ahead of time. We would all like Valencia to be in a privileged position; I could want a Ferrari, but if I have to drive a Skoda.\" Javier Aguirre, the coach if not the character, possibly deserves a little more attention too ... and then there's Jagoba Arrasate. When he announced that he was stepping down as Osasuna manager, Arrasate said that he wanted to go at the right moment: he didn't want things to \"end badly\" -- \"I couldn't forgive myself,\" he insisted. As it turned out, this is a pretty flat end to the season, but that's at least in part because of how he has altered expectations in Pamplona. \"We haven't been able to continue what we did last year,\" he confessed, which said much. Yet Osasuna, who he took over in the second division, took to a Copa del Rey final and a European place, have secured their primera status very early for a fifth season in a row, despite having the fifth-smallest budget in Spain, and he departs with them in a good place, a job well done. Arrasate also departs having dignified football, one of the most genuine, least presumptuous men in the game. As a coach sometimes you suffer, but sometimes it's worthwhile. \"That beer just after a game [you win], when you say 'wow, how good was that?' is the best moment of the week,\" Arrasate says. Maybe at the end of week 38, the last game of the season and his final match after six superb years at Osasuna, he can have another. After all, Jagoba, you've earned it. Arrasate leaves Osasuna on great terms, having taken the minnows far on a shoestring budget. Irina R. Hipolito/Europa Press via Getty ImagesTHE SIGNING: Daley Blind, Girona OK, so Daley Blind isn't unknown, exactly. In fact, one of the measures of just how extraordinary this season has been for Girona is that for much of it they chased a league title when, if you go through their squad, their players had 37 relegations between them and only 14 league titles. And it's a bit of a push to truly include a lot of those titles: three for Eric GarcÃ­a, two at Manchester City when he played zero and six games, and one at Barcelona after which they decided they didn't want him anymore; one for Pablo Torre at Barcelona; one for Cristhian Stuani at Danubio some 20 years ago; one for Artem Dovbyk at Midtjylland; one for Savinho at Atletico Mineiro when he played only four games. As for Blind, he alone was responsible for more than half of them: seven at Ajax and one at Bayern. He had also played at Manchester United of course, and got over a hundred caps for the Netherlands. So, unknown? Nah, but largely overlooked this year? Yep. Blind came aged 34, having departed United five years earlier, seemingly coming toward the end, and wasn't wanted by Bayern anymore. As Girona flew, few really talked about him. There is a parallel here, by the way, to Girona midfielder IvÃ¡n MartÃ­n, who is a candidate for inclusion in this season's best unsung players. Instead, the focus fell on Aleix and Savinho and Dovbyk. Portu had his moment. Stuani has his status, a true superstar. Yan Couto flew. Eric Garcia had that redemptive narrative arc. But without Blind, it doesn't happen. Only four players in the entire league had more touches. And all that for free. THE PLAYERS There are plenty who deserve their moment. Diego Rico (on loan at Getafe from Real Sociedad), say. And Mika MÃ¡rmol at Las Palmas. Or Nemanja Maksimovic, playing all over the place at Getafe. Ante Budimir (Osasuna), certainly -- although it's hard to make a case for top scorers, quite honestly, even quiet ones like him. Or Gorka Guruzeta, and not so much for the goals as his role as the Basque Benzema, making better players of the other forwards at Athletic Club. But here are our three suggestions. LIVE ON ESPN+ (SELECTED GAMES) The beautiful game lives here. Stream top leagues, tournaments and teams.

Even on the day of his unveiling, he spoke for barely 15 seconds. It takes some doing to be a Real Madrid player and be this anonymous, to go so unnoticed. Here, the gaze is so intense, the coverage so voluminous, that everyone gets talked about. Everyone gets their moment in the sun. Or, alternatively, kicked when they are down (which is a key point). Not Mendy. An example: one major newspaper in Spain has a search engine where you can look up articles by player names. When it comes to the French full-back, there is one piece about him in the past two years. He, it sometimes seems, is the meh in a megateam, the guy who's just not that good. But no one who is not that good plays for Real Madrid. Still less for this long, let alone constantly winning things. Not long ago, talking to Goal, Antonio RÃ1⁄4diger was asked to build his perfect player: this guy's speed, this guy's skill, this guy's technique, this guy's intelligence. When it came to strength, he said Mendy. If the answer was telling, the response to it was even more telling. \"Really?!\" his interviewer said, as if it was madness that anyone should even mention Mendy, let alone praise him. \"That guy is strong like ox, man,\" Rudiger insisted. Strong, silent and successful, too. And if that was a rare mention, if no one's talking about him, that's because he's not giving them reason to, which is also a good thing -- because as a defender that means errors as well. At Madrid, sure, being a left back tends to mean more and people tend to want more too: this is the place that had Roberto Carlos and Marcelo, that brought back flying Fran GarcÃ­a and is after Alphonso Davies. But there's Mendy still, appreciated by those who matter. \"Ferland is the best defensive defender in the world,\" Carlo Ancelotti said. play1:29How Real Madrid's mentality won them LaLiga Sebastian Salazar and Luis Garcia break down the reasons behind Real Madrid's dominance in winning their 36th LaLiga title. Ayoze PÃ©rez, Real Betis Isco has been man of the match so many times this season it sometimes seems like he's the only one playing. Real Betis teammate HÃ©ctor BellerÃ­n joked that he wins the awards even when he doesn't play, and, while he has been truly brilliant, a joy to watch, while he deserves the attention he has had, while he was worthy of many of the 18 MVPs he has taken and his redemption is one of the great stories of the season, there was something in that remark. Isco's dominance has served to obscure what others have done. Beyond the brilliant glow of the man they call \"Magic,\" there is talent, too. Just ask Isco himself, in fact: he's loving playing these days, and he's particularly loving playing with Ayoze Perez. The feeling is mutual. Watching these two in recent weeks, football is just better and so much fun. Watch Ayoze up close: keep an eye on the touch, the little darting runs, the positioning, and there's a technical quality and intelligence that sets him apart. There's also an ambition and a seriousness about his career: a commitment that is striking even in this hyper-professionalised world, a refusal to settle for what others accept, an analytical mind and that flash of anger when things don't come off. Which is less often now because above all, there's a decisiveness too -- and just when it mattered most. \"Fundamental,\" Manuel Pellegrini calls him. Ayoze has had to deal with a groin injury, but Betis' resurgence, heading toward a European place again, has had Ayoze as a central player. He has 11 goals and two assists this season and has scored five in his past five games. One of his celebrations has him drinking a nice cup of tea too, which will do for us. Pepelu, ValenciaPepelu is a playful, creative talent who has been one of Valencia's rare bright spots this season. Manuel Queimadelos/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images \"I don't feel like a traitor,\" Pepelu said in the summer. He had just joined Valencia from city rivals Levante, the club where he had spent his entire career, where he said he always dreamed of playing and where he had said he would continue even after they were relegated. Where, in fairness, he had continued, playing a season in segunda . He had come for â¬5.1m too, which is a lot of money for Valencia, the club that just doesn't spend money anymore. And there was attention and anger, all right -- even if Pepelu said he felt better because the transfer had been \"done the right way\" in a deal that was \"good for all three parties.\" So under the radar might not be the obvious description. Only, he has been. Jose Luis Garcia Vaya -- \"Pepelu\" to his pals -- came from the second division after all. And although he crossed the city, this is not a rivalry that dominates the media. The noise soon died down, and then came the actual season, which has been fantastic. But it has been quietly, undemonstratively so. It has come at a team that has not fought for survival this time, attention drawn to it, and that has never been much more than an outside bet for Europe either. That is underwhelming for a club like Valencia (in historic terms) but a success for a club like Valencia (as they are now), a lot of it down to him. Yet there has been no flash, just football. Ask them at Mestalla, and they know his level. Ask in Madrid or Barcelona or Seville or Bilbao, and it might be a push for many to know him at all. Sometimes the stats say it, so here are some stats: no outfield player in LaLiga has started more games (all bar one) or played more minutes (3,215) than Pepelu. He has played just short of 1,854 passes and had 2,432 interventions, which is more than Koke, Jude Bellingham, Frenkie de Jong, MartÃ­n Zubimendi, Mikel Merino or Dani Parejo. No one has made more recoveries than him. Only two have won more tackles. Only five have made more interceptions, and only six have created more chances. He has scored six goals, Valencia's second-top scorer. In a team built on academy kids -- whose extraordinary success story in saving them last season and their identification with the club now has brought deserved attention -- Pepelu has been the veteran, at 25 for goodness' sake, the man making sense of it all. \"A silent leader,\" Ruben Baraja said, when too few others have said anything at all.

        "description": "Baltimore Ravens WR Zay Flowers became known for a pair of crucial mistakes in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game.",
        "content": "The sting of losing to the in the AFC Championship Game may have dissipated for some of the players four months after the loss. Just not for second-year wide receiver Zay Flowers, and for good reason. That's because it was Flowers who drew an unbelievably ill-timed taunting penalty on Chiefs' cornerback after a 54-yard catch-and-run by Flowers to the Chiefs' 10-yard line with Baltimore trailing 17-7 late in the third quarter. That's because it was Flowers, four plays later, who fumbled the ball on a hit from Sneed as he was going into the end zone. Then it was Flowers who, in the view of every football fan in the world, slammed his helmet and cut his finger in frustration after the disastrous chain of events. For the 2023 first-round pick out of Boston College, it's been an offseason of regret ( ) Honestly, I still (haven't) gotten over it. Still think about it, but I know next year, we have a chance to get back there and try to make it to the Super Bowl, so that's why I'm working every day and going hard every day to get back to that moment. The playoff meltdown marred an otherwise brilliant rookie season for Flowers, who set a pair of Ravens' rookie records in 2023. Zay Flowers Could Ascend to NFL's Elite Wide Receivers in '24 Flowers had more receptions as a rookie (77) and more receiving yards (858) than any player in Ravens' history. Flowers, a three-time All-ACC pick at Boston College, led the Ravens in receiving as quarterback won his second Most Valuable Player award despite not having a receiver pass the 1,000-yard mark. Ravens WR Depth Chart Zay Flowers Rashod Bateman Nelson Agholor Tylan Wallace Devontez Walker Deonte Harty Flowers actually led the Ravens in receiving by quite a large margin — was second with 565 receiving yards and tight end was third with 545 receiving yards. Zay Flowers set rookie franchise records in catches (77) and receiving yards (858) to go along with five touchdowns. The truly tragic thing about Flowers' AFC Championship Game meltdown was that it marred arguably the best game of his rookie season. Flowers had 5 receptions for 115 yards and one touchdown in the 17-10 loss. It was Flowers' second 100-yard receiving game in a three-game stretch following three receptions for 106 yards and one touchdown in a win over the in the regular-season finale. Flowers was also at his best down the stretch in 2023 — he scored four of his five touchdowns in the last five games of the regular season. Source:",

Justus Henke has analyzed the situation of German realities about six months after the launch of ChatGPT 3. \"The research was conducted about a year ago when enthusiasm was high, but it was still early for people to understand the potential of the medium,\" he explains. This initial early monitoring showed that usage was already widespread at that point. Henke distributed a questionnaire to all press/communication offices of the country's universities, receiving 101 responses, about a third of the total. Practically all those who responded declared that they make some use of generative AIs. Translations, text corrections and text generation are the main uses recorded by Henke. The other functions suggested in the questionnaire—image creation, slide production, or document analysis—are instead marginal. \"What we observe in this initial work is that as far as communication is concerned, artificial intelligence is adopted by universities mainly to increase process efficiency, for example, to speed them up, doing more things in less time,\" explains Henke. What also emerges, especially in some open answers, is a certain caution and growing awareness towards ethical aspects. An example is data protection. \"For instance, one wonders whether it is wise, or right, to feed these intelligences—owned by private companies—with university data. The issue of privacy is also important,\" says the researcher. In this sense, \"more and more universities in Germany are releasing their own instances of generative AI chatbots, on dedicated servers,\" precisely to try to maintain control over these delicate aspects. \"There is not only a technological shift underway but also a cultural one,\" adds Henke. \"Usually the early adopters tend to be younger and fresher in the profession, more open to change.\" The problem highlighted, however, is that there is no policy that works for everyone. Many are also worried by the possibility that these technologies could replace jobs. \"You need the social aspect of technology adoption to be taken seriously,\" Henke says. Henke, who is now working on a new survey to assess the situation a year after the first, believes he will observe further evolution of the situation: \"I know that the use of generative AI tools is bound to increase,\" he says. \"Last year people were experimenting, but in the comments, they also explained that sometimes they were not satisfied with the results. It was probably a matter of competence. They didn't know, for example, how to make an effective prompt for their goals. \"Probably today this aspect will have improved. We have to now turn our head and focus on a more strategic and integrated AI approach,\" especially in light of the continuous updates and advancements of these tools (ChatGPT-4o was launched recently, sparking new controversies regarding security, even among the staff of Open AI, the company that owns Chat GPT). Henke believes it is important that universities learn to use these new instruments without calling into question the work they have done so far and the future goals they have already planned. \"Communication is about building relationships and trust. In particular, one of the main purposes of science communication (of which university communication is a particular case) serves to build trust and relationships between the public and scientific research. \"If you compromise these relationships using 'automated' press releases or mainly use bots to talk to the public, the latter will end up losing interest or worse, start having doubts about the institution itself. \"It's important that humans remain part of the process. Artificial intelligence should enhance communication, not replace it,\" says Henke. The findings are published in the Journal of Science Communication .

        "content": "The Colorado Rockies placed right-hander Justin Lawrence on the 15-day injured list Monday with a shoulder strain. The Rockies also called up left-hander Josh Rogers and right-hander Peter Lambert from Triple-A Albuquerque, designated right-hander John Curtiss for assignment and outrighted right-hander Matt Koch to Albuquerque. Lawrence, 29, is 1-3 with a 5.91 ERA and two saves in 20 relief appearances this season. Rogers, 29, last appeared in the majors with the Washington Nationals in 2022. He is 1-4 with a 5.44 ERA through nine starts this season in Triple-A. Lambert, 27, is 2-3 with a 7.24 ERA in 13 games (three starts) this season with the Rockies. Curtiss, 31, made his season debut for Colorado on Saturday and allowed two runs in the ninth inning of an 8-4 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. Koch, 33, was designated for assignment on Friday. He appeared in two games for the Rockies this season, allowing three earned runs and retiring only one batter. This article first appeared on Field Level Media and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "Find out how to customize your Google Chrome homepage, startup page, and new tab page. Set a default homepage, change startup pages, activate the home button, and customize the new tab page with wallpapers and shortcuts.",
        "content": "A browser homepage is the website that appears when you open your browser and when you click the home button. Most browsers, including the popular Google Chrome, allow users to set up separate home pages. In Google Chrome 's default settings, there is no homepage. Instead, the browser opens a startup page, and you won’t see a home button next to the omnibox unless you adjust the settings. However, you can change the startup page in Chrome and set a default homepage. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it: Google Chrome has the same user interface on both Windows and Mac. Both Mac and Windows users can follow the same steps to change the startup page in Google Chrome: 1. Launch Google Chrome on the desktop 2. Click the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner to open the drop-down menu. 3. Select Settings from the drop-down menu. A new tab displaying the settings menu in Google Chrome will open. 4. Select On Startup from the left sidebar. 5. Choose the third option which says: “Open a specific page or set of pages” 6. Select add a new page. 7. Enter the URL for the desired startup page, then click “Add”. 8. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to add more startup pages. This will help you to successfully change the pages that Google Chrome opens every time. When you close and reopen Chrome, each page you listed will open in a separate tab. Unlike the desktop version, the Android version of Google Chrome treats the homepage and the startup page as the same. Changing the homepage setting changes the website you visit by tapping the home button, and it changes the page that opens every time you launch the app. Here’s how to set it: 1. “Open Google Chrome” and tap the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner to open the drop-down menu. 2. \"Select Settings\" from the drop-down menu. 3. Scroll down to \"Advanced settings\", then select \"Homepage\". 4. If the homepage button is turned off, tap it to turn it on. 5. Select \"Chrome's homepage\" or enter a custom web address. Select \"Enter custom web address\". This may be filled in with another web address. Either way, select the second option. 6. \"Type or paste the desired web address\" into the field. Your new custom homepage will load when you start the Chrome app or tap the home button.",

A news release by the Gatineau fire service says crews were called to a two-storey townhome at 73 rue De la Vaudaire, north of Chemin Pink in the northwest end of the city, shortly before 8:50 a.m. The fire service says they were alerted to the fire by nearby neighbours after a lightning strike. While no one was hurt, there was severe damage to the primary residence. In total, thirteen people were evacuated and seven people have been displaced. The fire caused an estimated $560,000 in damage. There was minimal damage to nearby residences, the statement reads. A severe storm moved through the Ottawa-Gatineau region on Monday. A tornado watch remains in effect in the afternoon, with about 30 to 40 mm of rain and heavy winds expected.",

Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. \"It's more nerve-racking watching than playing,\" the 34-year-old centre said Thursday morning. \"But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. \"You're just itching to be a part of that.\" Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. Hintz, the Stars' No. 1 centre, hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Thursday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. \"He's just an awesome player,\" Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. \"He's one of the best players in the in the world.

        "description": "A planned logging operation in the upper Highwood River watershed threatens critical habitat for at-risk trout species, raising concerns over increased erosion, sedimentation and altered stream flows that could harm sensitive fish populations.",
        "content": "A planned logging operation in the upper Highwood River watershed threatens critical habitat for at-risk trout species, raising concerns over increased erosion, sedimentation and altered stream flows that could harm sensitive fish populations. A new report from the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) and Freshwater Research Ltd. found lumber company West Fraser’s 1,100-hectare logging plan poses a high risk of significant changes to watercourses, riparian zones, and hillslopes in the Loomis Creek watershed – a tributary of the Highwood River – due to increased peak flows and surface erosion. “We looked at how logging was affected by the requirements under the Species at Risk Act, and not surprisingly found that, effectively, the main conclusion there is that there’s no way that they can do this logging without impacting critical habitat and residences – which are actually the egg nests of the redds, and also the fish themselves,” said Dave Mayhood, president and principal consultant of Freshwater Research Ltd. “All of those factors are not allowed very clearly under the Species at Risk Act.” Redd refers to the spawning bed of trout in a watercourse. They are formed by trout beating the rocks with their tail-fin and can be identified by a bowl-shaped indentation of clean bright rocks. Trout do this to remove moss, dirt, bigger rocks, and debris. Bull and westslope cutthroat trout are listed as threatened in the federal Species at Risk Act and the Highwood River is identified as a high value watershed with important aquatic habitat for both species. However, sediment delivery due to logging road erosion and expected increases in peak flows from removing forest from parts of sub-watersheds threatens to smother species recovery. Mayhood, an independent aquatic ecologist who holds degrees in zoology and the ecology of inland waters, has more than 50 years experience in the field and has conducted more than 130 assessments of small watersheds on southern Alberta’s Rocky Mountain eastern slopes. He warns that logging roads, water crossings and inadequate tree cover as a result of clearcutting next to streams and higher peak flows will add sediment to the many small tributaries in the area that feed into the Highwood River. “Sediment increases tend to be chronic once something like a logging road system is developed into an area,” said Mayhood. Less tree coverage also increases the likelihood of increasing stream temperatures. Loomis Creek waters measure around 13 Celcius in the summertime and bull trout need clean, cold water to survive and compete with other fish species. “Just a change of one degree in maximum temperature in that creek would have the effect of weakening the ability of these trout to resist invasion of populous rainbow-cutthroat hybrid trout in the main stem of the Highwood River,” said Mayhood. Particularly concerning is the plan to log a significant portion of watercourse lengths without any riparian buffers. According to West Fraser’s current plan, 22 of the 36 area sub-watersheds will have over 25 percent of their watercourse lengths left unprotected. “It seems like a very small thing, but logging can increase temperatures in streams even when they’re buffered with a buffer strip that is left alone and not logged at all. You can get increases of up to five Celcius in the water temperature, and that only has to happen in one season and these fish have lost ground to their competitors,” said Mayhood. “In the end, we end up with damaged or destroyed fish populations that are supposedly fully protected under the Species at Risk Act.” The study also looked at the risk of flooding during peak flows and summer low flows, which are associated with drought. “Removing effective forest cover in this area is likely to increase flood risk by increasing the frequency and magnitude of peak flows,” it stated. “It may also reduce late-season water availability by advancing the onset of low flows to earlier in the season.” Josh Killeen, conservation science and programs manager for CPAWS Southern Alberta, said it’s expected that climate change will exacerbate hydrological changes. While Killeen and Mayhood were conducting watershed assessments for the area, another report was commissioned by Alberta Forestry and Parks to assess potential for hydrological alteration and risk associated with logging. Mayhood obtained that report through a Freedom of Information and Privacy request and shared it with the Outlook. To Killeen’s point, it noted that changes in climate are likely to compound some hydrologic effects of forest disturbance, including increases in peak flows and earlier peak flow timing. “The hydrological model projects a higher and more volatile extreme peak flow regime under the climate change scenario; this increased variability suggests hydrologic alteration could be considerably higher than projected under historical conditions,” states the report, completed by MacHydro. While no fieldwork was undertaken for the study, it recommended future assessments look at what degree of hydrologic alteration is unacceptable, as well as periodic evaluation of the change in hydrologic indicators on an ongoing basis. The report further acknowledged the Highwood River is a high value watershed for its aquatic habitat for westslope cutthroat and bull trout, as well as an important source of water for irrigation and communities in southern Alberta. Killeen and Mayhood’s report, which did not take the MacHydro report into consideration, unbeknownst of its existence at the time, also calls for further on-the-ground analysis, specifically from a hydrologist and a fish biologist team. “We’ve recommended that both to West Fraser and to the forestry and parks government regulator,” said Killeen. “We see it as being a really important part of actually understanding the distribution and the populations status of bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout, as well.” Little is known about the status of the two species populations in the Highwood River and Loomis Creek, however, CPAWS commissioned a study that was completed in winter 2023-24 and funded by the Bow River Trout Foundation, which proved – using environmental DNA (eDNA) sample collection – that bull trout are present and spawning in a much larger area than previously known. Over the study period, bull trout eDNA was strongly detected in all three sample sites in Loomis Creek near Bishop Creek in late November, when much of the creek was covered in ice. The site furthest upstream on Loomis Creek was approximately 3.2 kilometres upstream from the Highwood River and 520 metres downstream from the confluence of Bishop Creek. The study further noted the Fisheries and Wildlife Management Information System shows two electrofishing records of bull trout captured in Loomis Creek. One record from 1989 was upstream of Bishop Creek, where three fish were captured, and another record from 2008, further downstream, recorded two fish captured. “Considering two previous electrofishing captures, as well as records of spawning activity, Loomis Creek is likely used by bull trout throughout the year, supporting all life stages of the species,” the study, titled Winter Environmental DNA Survey for Bull Trout in Loomis Creek, noted. Shortly after that study was released, and after Spray Lake Sawmills was bought out by B.C. lumber giant West Fraser, the company announced it was pausing its logging plan in the Upper Highwood in February 2024 to further consult interested parties. It was initially set to begin harvest operations in winter 2023-24. “We are now in the process of meeting with local groups that are interested in sharing information regarding forestry operations in the region,” the company stated at the time. “We will work to incorporate actionable information that we garner through these conversations into our future harvest plans for the Highwood.” The announcement also came after the Department of Fisheries and Oceans launched an investigation into the lumber company prematurely building a bridge over the Highwood River to access logging operations. When activities and infrastructure building are planned that could damage critical habitat for a threatened species – federally listed and subject to protections and recovery strategies under the Species at Risk Act – a company must apply to the federal fisheries agency for a permit. Based on what was presented at West Fraser’s annual open house earlier this month, no changes have been made to the logging plan. Joyce Wagenaar, director of communications for West Fraser, said the plan is still paused as the company continues to seek out actionable feedback. “No revisions to the plan have been made at this point as we are still collecting and assessing information. Once that is completed, we will provide an updated plan,” she said in a statement. “The timing for proceeding will not be determined until the feedback has been incorporated into the plan and the necessary government authorizations are obtained. We are currently in discussions and working with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans on a solution. As this work progresses and we finalize the decision, we will have more to share.” Killeen said this much was unclear based on what was recently presented to the public. “From what I saw at the open house, the plans appear to be essentially the same as they were prior to West Fraser announcing the pause, and they also listed in the general development plan that was posted on their website along with it that the Highwood was scheduled for harvest this winter, so 2024-25,” said Killeen. “I don’t know if there was some confusion there or what was going on, but we were surprised to see it in the plan like that with no mention of the pause or ongoing consultation. We’ve still been meeting with the company with the impression that they are consulting, but at the same time they are presenting the plan as going ahead at the open house.” Killeen and Mayhood still see regulation under the Species at Risk Act and the 2020 Recovery Strategy for bull trout as the firmest grounds to stand on in defence of the Upper Highwood watershed. The recovery strategy calls for riparian setbacks of at least 30 metres to protect critical bull trout habitat. “This 30m riparian area is necessary to protect key stream attributes such as clean and cold water with low sediment and silt, maintain channel configuration and habitat structure, and provide terrestrial food inputs and woody debris into the aquatic environment,” the recovery strategy states. For westslope cutthroat trout, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans initially proposed a 100m riparian buffer in the draft federal recovery plan, but Alberta government officials challenged this, resulting in a 30m buffer being adopted. “But that still doesn’t line up with how West Fraser operates under provincial regulations,” said Killeen. “For these smaller watercourses, the provincial regulations give only very small buffers or none at all, while the Species at Risk Act and associated recovery strategies are calling for these larger 30m buffers. “When we look at the plans, there’s no sign of those larger buffers on those smaller watercourses like Loomis Creek. There’s a mismatch there between what’s in the provincial regulations and what’s in the recovery strategies that define critical habitat.” Killeen said provincial and federal regulations need to align and be enforced as a first step. Step two would be having a more fulsome assessment requirement for Alberta native trout in the forest management planning process. “At the moment, we see that there’s a lot of damage done to critical habitat on quite a regular basis, and of course that makes it really challenging for these species to survive and recover.”",

The latest is featured in WWE 2K24, which leads to a video on this website called ‘Remember.’ The video features flashes of several images, including a shack, a person, a bird, flies, before a message that reads: “Remember who you are.” The images continue from there, with a door opening, the person pointing to the side and at the camera, as well as art and various symbols. The person then removes their shroud but their face isn’t seen. According to one Twitter user, the number in the site’s URL (11_19) is the same that was featured on Bray Wyatt’s hat during a Firefly Funhouse episode with Alexa Bliss.

        "description": "‘Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,’ Israeli PM Netanyahu said on Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament.",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged on Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants in its tally. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened,” a US National Security Council spokesman said on Monday. “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” the spokesman said. 04:23 GEN-Z VS GENOCIDE: HOPE FOR HUMANITY? Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state”. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. “A few hours ago, a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,” the Israeli military said in a statement. Egypt warned against compromising the security and safety of its security forces following the shooting, a high-level source told Egypt’s state-linked Al-Qahera news on Monday. Preliminary investigations showed that Egyptian security staff had reacted to an exchange of gunfire “between Israeli forces and members of the Palestinian resistance, which led to shooting in several directions”, the source said, adding that Egypt would take necessary measures to prevent the incident from recurring. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people – about half of Gaza’s population – displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks. Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and that it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally.",

        "content": "The Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) commenced the Continuous Voter Registration exercise in Edo State on Monday. The exercise aims to capture would-be voters who have yet to register ahead of the governorship election in Edo on September 21. Naija News gathered that the CVR and the PVC collection would be a 10-day exercise from May 27 to June 5, 2024, from 9 am to 3 pm daily, including weekends. Despite a call from the state acting chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Jarret Tenebe, on Friday, to cancel the exercise due to the damage to its secretariat, materials, and equipment meant for CVR, it proceeded as scheduled. In response to the call, Edo INEC’s head of Voters Education and Publicity, Timidi Wariowei, expressed dissatisfaction, stating that it is unjust to accuse the electoral body in this manner. The CVR exercise, monitored in Oredo, Egor, and Ikpoba-Okha local governments, indicated that PVC collection was also progressing alongside the continuous voter registration exercise. At the registration site in Ikpoba-Okha, Rhoda Gumus, the INEC National Commissioner overseeing Edo, Delta, and Cross River, expressed contentment with the ongoing exercise and urged registrants to wait patiently as their registrations were processed. Gumus said, “ We have been to Oredo, and we are here at the Ikpoba-Okha registration area, which we are using as our state head office registration centre because of the flood disaster that happened at our head office on Friday. “We are in touch with other registration areas within and outside Benin, and the exercise is going on smoothly. As you can see, we have registered some people, and others are still waiting. The process just started today. It is impressive and commendable . “ The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Anugbum Onuoha, affirmed that INEC was adequately prepared for the exercise, emphasizing that the flood disaster, which damaged some of the commission’s equipment, would not hinder the operation. Onuoha said, “ We thank God for the enablement to begin this exercise, having in mind the flood disaster that destroyed some of our equipment on Friday. Due to the flood disaster, we moved our head office registration area to the INEC office at Ikpoba-Okha local government. “We are here and witnessing a large turnout of people who are here as either new registrants or to transfer their registration or for PVC collection. INEC is prepared for this exercise and nothing will make us fail. People expected us to discontinue the exercise but we were prepared even before the flood disaster happened. “Yes, we had some initial network problems, but it has been resolved, and the exercise is going on smoothly, and by the grace of God, the exercise will be successful .”",

It is understood that the Brazilian is set to leave Spurs over the next few months, and Milan, who are in the market for a right-back, have been now. The North London club are planning to continue with Pedro Porro as their first-choice right-back, which would leave Emerson with a lack of consistent first-team game time. He is still under contract in North London until 2026. Tottenham reportedly value the player in the region of €30m. He is, however, not the only right-back that Milan have been evaluating, according to .

        "content": "Home | News | Opinion Legalise Street Busking Opinion: Legalise street busking Recognising the rights of street buskers will help them earn livelihood, preserve local art forms, promote tourism By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 11:56 PM By Ghanshyam Sharma As more Indians migrate to urban areas, policymakers face the challenge of finding cost-effective ways to improve the urban experience for people. The government can improve the city experience by encouraging street buskers. Such a policy change will protect the livelihood of local artistes, promote traditional art forms and make the city more lively. Street buskers have used the streets as a platform to entertain and enchant people worldwide. Ed Sheeran, Pierce Brosnan, Robin Williams and Steve Martin are some of the contemporary Western celebrities who started as street buskers and continue to captivate global audiences. Potential of Busking Several studies suggest that the presence of street buskers makes the streets more friendly for people. For example, surveys conducted in Stockholm, New York City, Santa Monica, Hong Kong, Bath, and several other cities suggested that people felt that street performers create intimacy and allow people to feel comfortable and safe. They also provide citizens with low-cost live entertainment. Hence, street performers enrich the city experience for its inhabitants and tourists. Therefore, several major cities around the world have realised the potential of street busking to improve the well-being of citizens and attract tourists. For example, London recognised the popularity of busking among visitors and made regulations to encourage busking. Istanbul legalised busking in ferries after 80 per cent of the respondents in a survey conducted by the government supported the idea. Dublin sells permits to busk in designated public spaces. In Hong Kong, the Basic Law Article 34 protects street performers. The cities of Barcelona, Melbourne and Toronto issue a licence for street performers to perform in designated spots. In the United States, the courts have protected street buskers by citing the First and the Fourteenth Amendments. Several cities in the US encourage street buskers. Indian Context Unfortunately, India is an aberration in international practices in the context of street buskers. Civic authorities and the police harass street buskers and discourage them from performing in public spaces. The harassment of street buskers persists because buskers are not recognised or protected by any law despite several constitutional provisions for their protection. For example, Article 21 protects the right to life and personal liberty, Article 19(1a) protects the freedom of speech, and Article 19(1g) protects the freedom to trade. Despite these constitutional provisions and after 77 years of independence, street buskers continue to be governed by colonial legacy laws. For example, the British introduced the Dramatic Performances Act in 1876 to prohibit street buskers in response to the growing dissent among the natives against colonial rule. The British government prohibited street buskers because of the latter’s contribution to social resistance against colonial rule. In the absence of any legal framework for street buskers in India, authorities equate busking with begging and use the Prevention of Beggary Act 1959 against them In the absence of any legal framework for street buskers, public authorities equate busking with begging and use the Prevention of Beggary Act 1959 to harass and shoo away buskers on account of inconvenience or public safety. In 2018, the Delhi High Court decriminalised begging in Delhi. However, buskers continue to face harassment in the national capital. The current status of street buskers is unfortunate because India has rich and diverse art forms which reflect its linguistic, religious and ethnic diversity. However, most marginalised people do not have platforms for their art as they do not find space in the entertainment industry or traditional theatres. Local artistes often do not get conventional platforms to showcase their talent. Therefore, they turn to streets to attract and charm audiences. It is plausible that we have already lost several art forms and risk losing the ones that have survived. As several studies suggest, street buskers improve the city experience and contribute to the economy by promoting domestic and international tourism. They can also boost India’s soft power and global recognition. In India, people have limited options for relaxation outside of their homes. Street artistes can increase the alternatives available to people for entertainment. They can also keep local art forms alive by enthralling people with traditional music. Alternative Platforms Street busking can contribute to the diversity and democratisation in the art and entertainment forums. The entertainment industry in India is relatively homogeneous and does not appropriately reflect its diversity. The entertainment space is also dominated by a few leaders and restricted to some regions like Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai. Street busking spots in cities will create alternative platforms for artistes while legal recognition will give space to new artistes to showcase their talent. Buskers can also contribute to inclusiveness in the city by providing cost-effective live entertainment to people in open public spaces. Such spaces in the city can create an environment where people from different socioeconomic backgrounds can connect while appreciating local artistes. Such an experience will provide a more equitable environment compared with expensive closed-door theatres and concerts restricted to elites. Street busking is also a source of livelihood for several communities such as the Kathputli Colony in Delhi. Indifferent laws and hostile authorities threaten the livelihood of these communities. Ghegholi village in the Alwar district of Rajasthan was a community of artistes, singers and performers. However, when the laws turned hostile and their trade was no longer recognised, the women had to take refuge in prostitution for the survival of their families. Several studies suggest that employment opportunities are declining across the globe, including India. Recognising the rights of street buskers can improve livelihood opportunities. A pragmatic approach to regulating street busking is designating and auctioning some spots in the city where street buskers can perform and entertain. By improving the city experience in India, street buskers can play a role in arresting a substantial decline in international tourists to India. They can be integrated into the Ministry of Tourism’s Iconic Tourism Destinations initiative worth Rs 5,294 crore to attract tourists. Legal recognition will allow street buskers to earn their livelihood, preserve local art forms, promote tourism, create cheaper and alternative sources of entertainment and generate additional revenue for the local governments.

        "content": "The Nigeria Police, Lagos State Command, has confirmed the arrest of an online blogger, identified as Stanley Okoruwa for allegedly defaming a businessman, Emeka Okonkwo, popularly known as “E-Money”. The suspect, who was paraded before newsmen on Monday, confessed to the crime and claimed to have used the offending video to boost his followership online. Okoruwa in the said video accused the businessman of having illicit affairs with the wife of the late Nollywood star, John Odonwodo, aka Junior Pope. He also accused the businessman of being responsible for the death of the late Nollywood star, who died in a boat accident. The spokesperson of the command, Benjamin Hundeyin, told newsmen that the suspect would be prosecuted for cyberbullying and defamation of character. ALSO READ: Junior Pope’s wife: E-money confirms arrest of ‘man who defamed him’ He said that the suspect was arrested in Uromi, Delta State, following a petition from the businessman. Hundeyin said, “He is going to be prosecuted because the things he engaged in were criminal in nature. He has allegedly defamed E-Money and he is going to be prosecuted. “We are not prosecuting the suspect because of the personality involved, but because he has allegedly committed a crime, the personality goes through the normal channel by reporting the case to the police and we investigated and arrested the suspect.” Hundeyin warned social media users against content that is injurious to other people’s personalities, stressing that action may be taken against them if reports of their content were found offensive by anyone. The suspect, while speaking with newsmen, said “I did a video about E-Money. I said a lot of things that are not true in that video, that is why the police arrested me.” He added, “I said something regarding a video I saw online about a woman – saying that Sir E-Money is responsible for the things that happened to Nollywood Actor, John Odonwodo, aka Junior Pope’s case. “I said something like that, I also said that Sir E-Money was also having an affair with Junior Pope’s wife. I have never in my life met E-Money. Everything I made in that video was not true.” Continuing, he said, ” I made the video out of trying to boost my page traffic level, I never knew it would go viral the way it went. I don’t have a bad intention to spoil Sir E-Money’s name. I was just making the video, I didn’t know it would go such wide.” “I know the contents of the video were wrong of me to have made. I don’t know the video will escalate to that extent,” the suspect added. Stanley stated, ” I saw that the video was already going viral, I thought pulling it down will not make sense. I decided to leave it. I have not reached out to E-Money to apologise, because I don’t have his contact to do so. “I was already planning to make an apology video, that was when I was arrested by the police. I have been praying to have this opportunity to apologize to him. I am very sorry Sir E-Money, I don’t mean to tarnish his image, I didn’t mean to spoil his name online.”",

        "content": "World leaders were swift to condemn Israeli strikes on a tent camp in Rafah late Sunday, which killed at least 45 people and injured dozens, according to Gaza health authorities — focusing further scrutiny on Israel’s controversial offensive in the south. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged by the Israeli strikes that have killed many displaced persons” and called for “an immediate cease-fire.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified” by the news from Rafah. “There is no safe place in Gaza,” he said. “These attacks must stop immediately.” Borrell said the attack underscored the “dilemma” facing the international community over how to enforce Friday’s ruling from the International Court of Justice, which ordered an immediate halt to Israel’s offensive in Rafah. Israel dismissed the order and said its military operations would continue. In an address to parliament Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the Rafah strike a “tragic accident” but vowed to gain “absolute victory” in Gaza. GET CAUGHT UP Summarized stories to quickly stay informed “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” a White House National Security Council Spokesperson said in a statement Monday afternoon, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Qatar expressed concern that the bombardment would “complicate ongoing mediation efforts and thwart reaching an agreement for an immediate and permanent cease-fire,” as well as the release of Israeli hostages. Israel’s military confirmed it carried out an airstrike in northwestern Rafah on Sunday night based on “precise intelligence.” The strike killed two senior Hamas officials, it added, including Yassin Rabia, the commander of the group’s operations in the West Bank. A Hamas official confirmed to The Post that two of members of the group had been killed. The IDF said in a statement Monday there were “many measures taken before the attack to minimize harm to non-involved people, including using precision weaponry. Based on these measures, no harm was expected to non-involved civilians.” The incident was being investigated by an “independent body responsible for examining unusual incidents in combat,” the IDF added. The United Nations’ Middle East envoy, Tor Wennesland, called on Israel to carry out a “thorough and transparent” investigation. Video posted by local journalists in the immediate aftermath late Sunday showed charred bodies being pulled from the flaming wreckage of the densely packed encampment in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood. An Israeli strike on a camp for displaced Palestinians killed dozens in Rafah on May 26. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post) Muhammad Al-Mughair, a civil defense official in Gaza, told The Post that the makeshift camp was inside Block 2371, which he said was an Israeli-designated humanitarian safe zone for displaced Palestinians. Residents in the block were not ordered to evacuate ahead of the strikes, and there was confusion on the ground as to whether Israel had designated it a humanitarian zone. Gazans told The Post that Arabic-language pamphlets previously dropped by the Israel Defense Forces over Gaza about safe zones — a key source of information for people there — were imprecisely phrased. Al-Mughair said it was his understanding that the block was included. Tal al-Sultan tent camp as of May 24 Tal al-Sultan tent camp as of May 24 The area was not pictured in a map of humanitarian zones provided by the IDF online and in recent announcements. In its statement, the IDF said “the attack did not take place in the humanitarian area in Al Mawasi, where the IDF called for evacuations.” At least 800,00 Palestinians have been displaced by Israel’s military campaign in Rafah in recent weeks, and many have fled to Mawasi. But new arrivals have told The Post the area is desolate and devoid of even the most basic services. Of the 45 people killed in the Rafah strike, about half were women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry reported. “We are horrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe,” Doctors Without Borders wrote on X. The medical organization said more than 15 of the dead and dozens of the injured were brought to a trauma stabilization center that it supports. “The images of charred bodies, including children ... are unbearable,” read a statement from the foreign office in Germany, which has been one of Israel’s strongest supporters in Europe. “The civilian population in Gaza must urgently be better protected.” European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accused Israel of pushing forward with “military action that has been asked to stop” after Rafah strikes. (Video: Reuters) Egypt’s armed forces said it was investigating a shooting incident at the Rafah border area Monday that killed a member of its security forces. The IDF confirmed a “shooting incident at the Egyptian border” Monday, which it said it was also investigating. “A dialogue is underway with the Egyptians,” the IDF added. A former Egyptian official told the Post that details of the incident could be outlined by a joint committee as early as Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. The IDF said that eight rockets were launched from Rafah toward central Israel on Sunday and that its Iron Dome defense system intercepted a number of them. Hamas’s military arm, the al-Qassam Brigades, said it had launched projectiles toward Tel Aviv, stating that the move was in response to “massacres perpetrated on civilians.” Far-right Israeli settlers have stepped up attacks on aid trucks passing through the West Bank, using a web of publicly accessible WhatsApp groups to track the trucks and coordinate attacks, The Post reported. It comes as humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza resumed Sunday via Israel’s Kerem Shalom border crossing. A U.S. congressional delegation visited Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi on Monday, according to the government’s State Information Service. The cross-party delegation was led by Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). “The members noted Egypt’s great contribution as a pillar of regional stability,” the statement said and “they expressed their appreciation for the Egyptian efforts to establish peace and security in the region, highlighting the key Egyptian role in promoting efforts aimed at achieving a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.” The IDF said it expanded its operations into eastern Jabalya over the past few days. It said in a Monday statement that its troops in northern Gaza killed militants in close-quarters combat, located large amounts of weaponry, and dismantled an explosives manufacturing facility and tunnel shafts. The Israel Air Force also struck a launch site in Jabalya, the IDF said, from which attacks had been launched toward the Israeli city of Ashkelon during the war. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 36,000 since the war began , according to the Gaza Health Ministry on Monday. At least 36,050 people have been killed and 81,026 injured in Gaza since the war started, the ministry said, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 282 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operations in Gaza.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena, File) WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda has spoken on the phone with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi in an effort to obtain the release of a Polish traveler who was sentenced to life in prison in the vast Central African country on espionage charges, an aide said Monday. The 52-year-old Pole, Mariusz Majewski, was detained by Congolese forces in February and later faced a military court in the restive nation, accused of spying. The allegations against him said that he had “approached the front line with Mobondo militiamen,” moved along the front line without authorization and “took photos of sensitive and strategic places and secretly observed military activities.” The Mobondo is a militia group that has been involved in intercommunal violence in southwestern Congo since 2022. Majewski was convicted last week and sentenced to life in prison. No details were released as to where he is held. Duda’s aide, Wojciech Kolarski, did not say what the outcome of the conversation between the two presidents was but stressed that the state had the obligation to take care of its citizens who find themselves in such dramatic situations overseas. Majewski’s family says he is in poor health and insists that he is just a traveler. Last week, Poland’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said without elaborating that Majewski “is not a spy, he is a member of a travelers club” and was just following his “passion in life.” Wronski said it was due to a chain of coincidental circumstances and events that he found himself in Congo and his “behavior was the result of a lack of knowledge of local customs.” Polish authorities are aware of the “very difficult political situation in Congo” and a recent coup attempt there but expressed hope that Majewski will not be implicated in a situation he has no connection to. Poland does not have a diplomatic mission in Congo. Earlier this month, the Congolese army said it had foiled a coup attempt and arrested the perpetrators, including some foreigners. Several U.S. citizens are among those arrested.",

        "content": "CANNES Film Festival was once the Mediterranean jewel in Hollywood’s crown, with elite, A-List stars desperate to get an invite to the coveted red carpet premieres. But my insiders who headed over to the film festival told me it now resembles something you might find for sale on Temu: cheap, tacky and lacking any real substance. 13 Film insiders are furious at the growing 'tackiness' of Cannes Film Festival due to the increasing presence of reality stars like Ekin-Su Culculoglu from Love Island Credit: BackGrid 13 Molly-Mae Hague has also been spotted there at the event, even though it is traditionally considered fairly classy and exclusive Credit: Alamy “Cannes has become a circus,” my disgruntled film insider told me from the Marriott Hotel, where actors like Kevin Costner and Zoe Saldana were staying for the 77th festival. “You look in one direction and it’s Ekin-Su from Love Island, turn the other way and you see Molly-Mae . “It’s not that these celebs aren’t welcome in Cannes, it’s just the Film Festival has lost that Hollywood appeal. Everywhere you turn there is an influencer taking photos. “Nothing is exclusive in Cannes any more, it’s a free-for-all.” The festival was once world renowned for its carefully curated programme of films which made the careers of directors, with Sean Baker picking up the top prize, the Palme d’Or, this year for his film Anora. Tickets used to be like gold-dust too, with only the specially invited able to walk alongside — albeit behind a rope — with the creme de la creme of the acting world. But amid the sea of influencers and supermodels who flocked to the annual AmFar Gala, including Bella Hadid, Helena Christensen and Heidi Klum, those on the inside said the event has lost its exclusive charm. Director Shaunak Sen, whose film All That Breathes won the coveted Golden Eye Award in 2022, said people had forgotten what Cannes was supposed to be about.

Unsurprisingly, every Tom, Dick and Harry was there. 13 Zoe Saldana is staying at the Marriott Hotel in Cannes Credit: Splash News 13 The same is true of Kevin Costner - who was said to be in tears at all the influencers around Credit: Getty Our Cannes insider said: “Campari was chaos not class. “They hosted what was billed as an exclusive party in a beach suite but they ended up giving out hundreds of wrist bands. “People were barging around on Boulevard de la Croisette (the main drag) and jostling to get in. There’s no glamour when someone’s “There’s no glamour when someone’s got a selfie stick out.” The hotels favoured by the rich and famous, including the five-star hotels the Marriott and the Martinez, are also now hotbeds for the fame hungry. Our insider adds: “Kevin [Costner] was in tears after the premiere of his film Horizon. It meant so much to him and it was beautiful to see. “But afterwards when he tried to get into the Marriott he had to dodge around influencers posing for silly photographs in the entrance hall. “Before there would be awe at the sight of Hollywood stars like him. “Now ‘guests’ are more interested in how many likes they get. “It’s truly depressing that Cannes has come to this.” I’ll definitely be swerving it next year.

What is this?” A pretty decent gig, that’s what it was. As we revealed last week, Sabrina’s boyfriend, Saltburn star Barry Keoghan was at the show and I spotted him proudly watching her from the side of the stage. Chris also put a special touch on the gig just for Luton footie fans, who feared the band would perform their 2000 hit Yellow – the colour of bitter rivals Watford. Instead they performed . . . Orange, Luton’s shirt colour, which included the lyrics: “It’s hard to be a football fan here in Luton town . “Sometimes you do the best you can, still you find you’re going down. “We didn’t win all our matches, we didn’t win the cup. But when you get knocked down in Luton, you always get back up. “So you can come in singing Yellow, that’s all right with me, I prefer a warmer colour spelt o-r-a-n-g-e.” Sabrina also endeared herself to the Luton crowd in her bright orange dress. 13 Chris ended up playing Orange instead of Yellow - to honour Luton footie fans Credit: Getty DUA’S ON THE SLIDE DUA LIPA has told how her dancers give it so much welly on stage she’s been sent flying after slipping in their pools of sweat. It’s enough to make me gag. 13 Dua Lipa told radio station Siriux XM that she has fallen over after slipping on puddles of sweat from her dancers Credit: Getty Dua told radio station Siriux XM: “I’ve fallen over quite a few times. “I fell over on my tour once in Barcelona, once in Milan on the same spot, it was just the hottest week in Europe. Some of my dancers were sweating a little bit extra. “I slipped on a little sweat puddle and we kind of had to change the choreography so I don’t get a puddle of sweat where I’m about to start dancing.” Hopefully she cracks out some cans of deodorant for her next gig in Berlin on June 5. YOU could see a very familiar face in the I’m A Celebrity jungle later this year. Lily Allen has admitted she would love to head to Australia with Ant & Dec for a Bushtucker Trial. Chatting about the show with Miquita Oliver on their podcast, Miquita said: “In times of my career being in the doldrum dead-out like nothingville I’ve been asked to do I’m a Celeb. “I got that call, every year for six. And I always said no for reasons of self-worth.” Lily replied: “Don’t knock it. I like I’m A Celebrity. I’d go on I’m A Celebrity.” But Miquita told her: “I don’t want to be on TV that badly. I don’t want to put myself through all that torturous s**t?” Lily replied: “Don’t want to eat a kangaroo ball?” Come on Miquita, it can’t be that bad. BOYZLIFE JOIN FOOTIE CLUB MOVE over Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell, there are some new celebrity football club owners in town. Boyzone duo Shane Lynch and Keith Duffy and Westlife pal Brian McFadden have snapped up . . . Chorley FC. 13 Boyzlife have snapped up Chorley FC and hope to turn around the fortunes of the non-league Lancashire club Credit: Alan Keville / Powerscourt Studio And they are hoping to turn around the fortunes of the non-league Lancashire club by getting some of their celebrity mates to watch games. But unlike big names David Beckham and Paul Rudd, who have been spotted watching Ryan’s Wrexham, Chorley fans will be getting names who are a little more down to earth. In an exclusive chat, Keith joked: “We’ll have Dean Gaffney and Dane Bowers, all the big A-listers. “Our friends are the people we worked with growing up. We’re not into the celebrity friends thing.” On the chances it will provide, Keith continued: “I went from selling vegetables and potatoes at the side of the road, a waiter, a barman, I worked all sorts of jobs. “Then to get the opportunities Boyzone gave me to travel around the world on private jets and stay in five-star hotels and get to meet my heroes, it was life-changing. “If we have any ability to bring what we’ve learned through our success to a football club and to lend our support and weight to try to bring some media attention and put that fire in the players of the team, to make them feel like they’re working to achieve something, it’s very exciting.” Away from their footballing ambitions, Brian and Keith are busy touring as Boyzlife – a duo with 21 No1 singles between them. They will head on the road next January, with tickets on sale now, and they have promised to perform all the hits. Brian admitted: “There was a long time when we had that attitude like, ‘I’m sick of singing that song’. “I detest singing Mandy, but when we sing Mandy, the fans love it. “We took it out of the set for a little bit and the fans went bananas and were on social media like, ‘We were waiting for it all night!’.” 13 They joked that they'd have Dean Gaffney as one of the big A-listers Credit: Getty 13 They also mentioned Dane Bowers in the same breath Credit: Rex Features LOREEN IS GOING IT ALONE EUROVISION star Loreen has followed in Sam Ryder’s footsteps and ditched her record label to become an independent artist. I’ve learned the Swedish singer, who won the contest for a second time with Tattoo last year, has split from Universal Records for the release of her latest single Forever. 13 Eurovision star Loreen has followed in Sam Ryder's footsteps and has ditched her record label to become an independent artist Credit: Splash News And she reckons it was a sign from the universe which led to her to going it alone. In an exclusive interview, she said: “Whenever I decide things, it just turns out really bad so, hey, it just happened. It happened really fast and was very beautiful. “The people I have around me now are so amazing. “You know when you find your people and they have the same tempo as you, or the same way of seeing the world as you? Things just flow very beautifully. “So it wasn’t like, ‘I want that record label’, I didn’t decide anything, it honestly just happened. “It feels natural, it feels like home’. That’s how you know you’re in the right place.” I told last year how Sam had split from Parlophone. He went on to have No2 single You’re Christmas To Me. Hopefully Loreen’s fortunes follow suit. MELANIE Blatt is eyeing up a third shot at a solo career but her All Saints bandmate Nicole Appleton said she’d be up for getting the group back for one big show at Glastonbury. “If people are hungry enough for it, then definitely,” Nicole told me in an exclusive chat. Though she added: “I’m very different to when I was 20, and you just don’t have the same sort of sexiness. “Singing Booty Calls sometimes makes me feel a little bit different now.” Nicki’s so slick IT’S lucky Nicki Minaj got her bags back from the coppers in Amsterdam – because she went through nine outfit changes when she finally hit the stage in Birmingham. After her Manchester show got cancelled while she was helping police with their inquiries, the American singer went all out to impress, even switching up her wigs six times. 13 Nicki Minaj got to finally come to the UK after having some trouble with the coppers in Amsterdam Credit: Kevin Mazur She opened with I’m The Best before playing hits Harijuko and Save Me, before handing a fan in the crowd $1,000 dollarsfor rapping the entire verse of Bang Bang. Oddly, Nicki also revealed she has a close pal of Diana Princess of Wales – and asked fans to have a moment of silence on behalf of her “dear friend”.

        "content": "In 2023 Sechelt received $36.4 million of funding and revenue – $4 million more than they had budgeted for, in what the municipality’s auditors called a “significant” increase. At its May 22 meeting, Sechelt council received an overview of its 2023 audit of consolidated financial statements by MNP LLP. The audit is intended to assure that financial statements from the district are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes their opinion, the MNP report states. Cory Vanderhorst of MNP said the increase in revenue was due to investment income and the district receiving the Growing Communities Fund. Vanderhorst said that the district’s total cash and investments at the end of 2023 were $38.6 million – over $11 million higher than the year before. Sechelts total financial assets also grew to $49.1 million from $32.7 million. Vanderhorst explained that the total liabilities, which cover debt, accounts payable and asset retirement obligation add up to $31.2 million. Asset retirement obligation is a new liability aimed at reducing future spending, Vanderhorst explained. The $3.6 million estimate for 2023 covers $2.8 million for septage site closures and $749,290 for asbestos and other remediation. He clarified that this is a long-term estimate for what the district will have to pay on various assets it owns, not an expense for next year. MNP also recorded an accounting surplus of $14 million, which Vanderhorst said does not include capital spending ($12 million) and repayment of debt ($825,013). Auditors also reported that Sechelt accumulated a surplus of $186.3 million by the end of 2023. Vanderhorst explained this figure is predominantly made up of equity in tangible capital assets, which amounts to $160 million, as well as smaller figures such as $10 million of statutory reserves and just under $2 million in Sunshine Coast Community Forest investment. While MNP doesn’t specifically monitor for fraud, Vanderhorst confirmed that there were no irregularities in the financial statements they examined, no unusual transactions or illegal or questionable payments. Coun. Darren Inkster recognized the work of district staff and council and congratulated them on what he called a clean audit. Council unanimously approved the 2023 Draft Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as presented. Jordan Copp is the Coast Reporter’s civic and Indigenous affairs reporter.

The complaint also alleged that the driver showed obscene gestures at the family members. The trip was recreated four days ago to confirm the allegations against driver Yadhu. On the 25th, the police travelled from Plamoodu to PMG by driving a bus, followed by a car at the same time. The cantonment assistant commissioner confirmed receiving strong evidence to support the mayor's complaint. The police found that the person in the back seat of the car could see the driver making obscene gestures. The Cantonment Police had registered a case against Yadhu for insulting women. The Assistant Commissioner stated that it is customary to record mahazar in such cases. Apart from the mayor, her husband Sachin Dev MLA, Arya's brother and sister-in-law were also in the car. Their car, which was returning after the wedding reception, was not given space by the KSRTC bus. The mayor’s car then blocked the bus in front of the Palayam shopping complex and she alleged the driver of reckless driving and also making obscene gestures. Passengers stated that Sachin Dev boarded the bus during an argument with the bus driver. The conductor's trip sheet also says that Sachin boarded the bus. However, Sachin told the police that he did not board the bus and did not disrupt the service.",

        "content": "Sechelt council members were anything but stumped during their May 22 committee of the whole, when they advanced plans to better protect trees not in parks and to fine abandoned vehicles. James Nyhus, Sechelt’s chief building official said that over the last year, there have been at least 20 cases of unpermitted tree removal damage, accretion of district road allowances, clearing and habitat destruction without the ability to engage in any enforcement actions. He said one resident removed five very large Western red cedars from a road allowance to accrete and occupy district property. Sechelt council last considered this issue at its May 1 meeting and referred it to committee for discussion. Nyhus clarified that this does not affect private property. The amendments are directed to district lands that are not in parks such as road allowances and dead-end roads. Removing trees from district lands that retain steep slopes can be extremely difficult and costly to remediate, Nyhus said. He explained the proposed amendments would empower district bylaw officers to issue fines of $1,000 under the Municipal Ticketing Information (MTI) Bylaw, and seek conviction under the Offences Act for more serious violations of the Highway and Parking Bylaw. Stating that trees are a valuable natural asset worth protection, Nyhus said removing trees for cosmetic or aesthetic reasons would also be prohibited. The proposed changes include what Nyhus called housekeeping amendments to help regulate unlicensed vehicles parked on district highways – noting that this does not apply to mobility aids such as motorized wheelchairs. He said Sechelt is having problems with fining unlicensed vehicles, stating that the bylaw only allows them to tow them. Nyhus explained that staff wanted to address unlawful tree removal and unlicensed vehicles because they are both under the same bylaw. Coun. Darren Inkster asked if the district would use the fines to replant trees and if there would be a FireSmart approach taken to the replanting, recommending deciduous trees be used. Nyhus answered that the fines are solely intended as penalties adding that the MTI bylaw is the highest level of enforcement available to staff outside of the Offence Act. The committee unanimously recommended council pass second and third readings, those will need to be endorsed by council. Jordan Copp is the Coast Reporter’s civic and Indigenous affairs reporter.

        "content": "Fianna Fáil Senator Niall Blaney has been criticised by party colleagues over a ‘desperate stunt’ to boost his profile in the European election campaign. Mr Blaney publicly criticised his party leader Tánaiste Micheál Martin for failing to support his electoral campaign at the launch of the Fianna Fáil European election campaign last week. Standing beside Mr Martin at the press conference, the Donegal senator said: ‘Unfortunately, I am not getting the same support as other candidates are getting and that’s a problem for me.’ Mr Blaney is running for a seat in the European Parliament in the Midlands-North-West constituency, along with party colleagues Barry Cowen and Senator Lisa Chambers, from Co. Mayo. The public spat in front of the gathered media has not gone down well within Fianna Fáil amongst both the loyalist and anti-leadership camps. The move has been viewed by party insiders as a way of Mr Blaney ‘making himself relevant’ as he struggles to get a foothold in the campaign. ‘Everybody is violently angry with him,’ a Fianna Fáil TD told the Irish Daily Mail . ‘He [Mr Blaney] acted incredibly selfishly, even Micheál’s rebels are annoyed at him. He had a few bad performances. He tried to take on Ming [MEP Luke Flanagan] up in Donegal as a hustings and got hockeyed. It was pointless s***e. It was utterly self-destructive.’ Mr Blaney told the Sunday Independent he had a ‘robust’ conversation with his party leader after the press conference. ‘We had a robust discussion after the conference,’ said Mr Blaney. ‘He had his perspective, I had mine, and I asked him for support in the last two weeks and left it with him.’ He said it had been an issue ‘for weeks’, adding: ‘I have never had any opportunity on national television yet – I’m the only candidate of the six. ‘That is not just about me, that’s about the people I represent in the border counties and Connacht. We need the same opportunity as everybody else to make the most of the Fianna Fáil vote and go for that second seat.’ He said the Midlands-NorthWest constituency was in need of better infrastructure and was ‘not getting our fair share’. He added: ‘I feel there’s a real opportunity now to take a seat on the border and Connacht counties. But we need equal support for the last two weeks. Not just support for a few.’ It isn’t the first time during the campaign that Mr Blaney has clashed with the party. Fianna Fáil were also dealt with a selection headache in the constituency where they were expected to field just two candidates. The expectation was that Mr Cowen would win the contest and be followed in second place by Senator Lisa Chambers, with the expectation both would be selected to run. However, in a shock result, Mr Blaney finished second, losing out on the party nomination by just 41 votes, getting 1,071 compared to Mr Cowen’s 1,142. Ms Chambers received just 570 votes from party members leading to the three candidates being added to the ticket. Mr Blaney comes from a family steeped in Fianna Fáil heritage but who also have a coloured history of run-ins with Fianna Fáil party headquarters. Mr Blaney’s uncle Neil Blaney was dismissed from Cabinet alongside Charlie Haughey by then taoiseach Jack Lynch during the Arms Crisis of the 1970s. It was alleged at the time that the pair were involved in a conspiracy to smuggle arms to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the North. While Charles Haughey remained on the backbenches, Neil Blaney was expelled from the party, which caused longstanding and bitter divisions within Fianna Fáil. Niall Blaney’s uncle formed the splinter party Independent Fianna Fáil, which continued until 2006, when the Donegal senator rejoined Fianna Fáil.",

        "content": "Stock image (Image: Justin Kernoghan/Belfast Live) Police are appealing for information following criminal damage to a number of buildings in the Cookstown area. Graffiti has been noted in several areas of the Co Tyrone town, including James Street, Burn Road and Loy Street, and is being investigated as a racially-motivated hate crime. The graffiti depicts nazi symbols and uses aggressive racist language. Local policing Inspector Ross said: \"I want to assure the public that we take all reports of hate crime extremely seriously. There is no place in our society for such behaviour. Enquiries are ongoing and anyone with any information is asked to call 101, quoting reference number 1255 of 27/05/24.” Read more: Man 'covered in blood' arrested on suspicion of attempted murder READ MORE: Teenager left unconscious after group attack in park SDLP Mid Ulster candidate Cllr Denise Johnston has condemned the appearance of racist graffiti in Cookstown, some of it outside a local school. Cllr Denise Johnston said: “This graffiti is absolutely disgusting. It has no place here and it doesn’t represent people in Cookstown. I’ve been here this morning talking to people, everyone is shocked and horrified at the naked and aggressive hate that has been put on display. “I would appeal to anyone who knows anything about this to come forward to police. The recent raise in hate incidents is a serious problem and it underscores how urgently we need new legislation to deal with people who think that they can attack others in our community and get away with it. I will be writing to the Justice Minister seeking an urgent update on her promised hate crime law. “We have been in touch with the council to make sure this graffiti is removed as soon as possible.” Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp Click this link or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

        "description": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A rocket launched by North Korea to deploy the country's second spy satellite exploded shortly after liftoff Monday, state media reported, in a setback for leader Kim Jong Un's hopes to field satellites to monitor the U.S.",
        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A rocket launched by North Korea to deploy the country's second spy satellite exploded shortly after liftoff Monday, state media reported, in a setback for leader Kim Jong Un's hopes to field satellites to monitor the U.S. and South Korea. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. KCNA cited the unidentified vice director of the National Aerospace Technology Administration as saying that a preliminary examination showed that the explosion was related to the reliability of operation of the newly developed liquid oxygen-petroleum engine. He said other possible causes will be investigated, according to KCNA. Japan's government briefly issued a missile warning for the southern prefecture of Okinawa, urging residents to take shelter inside buildings and other safer places. The warning was lifted later because the region was no longer in danger, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket,” with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara called the North’s launch “a serious challenge to the entire world.” South Korea’s Unification Ministry called a satellite launch by the North “a provocation that seriously threatens our and regional security.” During the trilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang earlier Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for stern international action if North Korea went ahead with its launch plan. Kishida, for his part, urged the North to withdraw its launch plan, but Li didn’t mention the launch plan as he offered general comments about promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through a political resolution. Some observers say that North Korea's satellite launch on the first day of its eight-day window might have been aimed at casting a chill over the Seoul-Beijing-Tokyo meeting and registering its displeasure with China. Kim Jong Un has been embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and seeking to boost ties with Beijing and Moscow to forge a united front against Washington, so China's diplomacy with Seoul and Tokyo might have been a disturbing development for Pyongyang. Kim’s primary focus in recent months has been on Russia, as Pyongyang and Moscow — both locked in confrontations with Washington — expand their military cooperation. China, which is much more sensitive about its international reputation, has joined Russia in blocking U.S.-led efforts at the U.N. Security Council to tighten sanctions on the North but has been less bold and open about supporting Kim's “new Cold War” drive. North Korea's Foreign Ministry on Monday strongly criticized a joint statement issued by Li, Yoon and Kishida, calling them \"wanton interference in its internal affairs.” The ministry took issue with parts of the joint statement that said the three leaders re-emphasized their existing positions on the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. While North Korea focused much of its criticism on South Korea for allegedly being chiefly responsible for the statement, it's still extremely rare for North Korea to slam a statement signed by China. The failed satellite launch is a blow to Kim's plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 in addition to his country's first military reconnaissance satellite that was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo. Hyung-jin Kim, Kim Tong-hyung And Mari Yamaguchi, The Associated Press",
