        "content": "The Nigerian Senate, on Monday cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. The Senate Committee on Capital Market, chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of all three Executive Commissioners namely: Frana Chukwuogor, Legal and Enforcement; Bola Ajomale, Operations; and Mrs. Samiya Usman, Corporate Services. Agama’s appointment has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1 trillion economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, he was appointed to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth, stressing that “we are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointment by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market,” he added The new DG noted that the commission would implement innovative policies and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Continuing, Agama said: “you must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that,” he stressed.",

        "content": "Cross River State Governor, Senator Bassey Edet Otu, has assured children in the state of his administration’s commitment to develop and drive policies and programs that will nurture and guide them. In a statement to mark the 2024 children’s day celebration made available to newsmen by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Nsa Gill, he quoted the Governor saying, “You are the future of our state and the pillars of our society. Your innocence, creativity, and boundless energy bring joy and hope to our lives. Our responsibility is to nurture and guide you so you can reach your full potential and contribute positively to our state’s growth and development.” Governor Otu maintained that he wants the Children to know that as the Governor, he is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for all to thrive. “My administration’s continuous investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure is to ensure children can access the best opportunities and resources. “Our State is richly endowed in agriculture, and this administration has already taken steps to make agriculture the mainstay of our economy.” The Governor, in his statement, urged the children to continue to dream big and work hard towards achieving their goals. In his words, he said, “Remember that there is no limit to what you can achieve with determination, resilience, and a positive attitude. “I also want to express my gratitude to all parents, teachers, and caregivers who play crucial roles in shaping the lives of our children. Your dedication and love are instrumental in their growth and success. “As we celebrate this year’s Children’s Day, I charge you to remember the less fortunate children in our society and strive to impact their lives positively. “Once again, I wish you all a happy Children’s Day. May you continue to be a source of joy and inspiration to us all. Keep shining bright and making us proud,” Governor Otu concluded.",

        "content": "Some concerned natives of Amichi in Nnewi South Local Government Area (LGA), Anambra State have sought intervention of governor Chukwuma Soludo to end an alleged intimidation and harassment of the community’s traditional ruler, Igwe Dr. Ofobuike Ezeoke by land grabbers. According to them, a certain land the monarch inherited from his father, Igwe Alphonsus, is being dragged by some prominent indigenes of the town who were allegedly bent on using the law enforcement agents and thugs to intimidate him and his supporters, especially his Personal Assistant, Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke. They spoke in a statement signed by their leader, Chief Ogbonna Ogbonna, adding that a High Court in Nnewi had on 14th of May 2024 issued an order restraining some persons from entering the land which the Igwe claims to had inherited from his late father through a Supreme Court judgment believed to have been delivered in November 1961 under Suit No. FSC 27/61. “Unfortunately, the prominent persons had even gone ahead to start selling parts of the land for building an estate. A transporter from the community in connivance with political appointee and others had also contracted a Catholic Bishop to build on the disputed land despite court orders. On Saturday, 18th May 2024, they arrested Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke on trumped up charges and had been dragging him around. “They tried installing another Igwe just to humiliate and oust Igwe Ofobuike but Anambra State government turned them down. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi. “Our Igwe is a peaceful man. He told us that he does not want to waste the blood of any individual in Amichi because of the land regardless of the temptation to do so. He had called on the court to ward off trespass from the land since the Supreme Court adjudged and decreed that it rightly belonged to his father,” the statement alleged. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down because of land. The town has been torn apart because the rich men feel that Igwe Ofobuike should not inherit such massive 6,000 plots of land. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi.",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "Exhibitors from five continents will be taking part in this year’s Food & Beverage West Africa trade exhibition, the largest edition yet. More than 300 exhibitors representing brands and businesses from more than 50 countries will be on show from June 11 to 13 at the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Nine countries will have exhibitor pavilions and they include Turkey, Dubai, China, India, USA, Indonesia, Italy, Egypt and Tunisia. In addition, sizeable delegations from UAE, UK, Thailand, Ukraine, Ghana, Algeria, Malaysia, Netherlands and many more will use the show to launch new products into Nigeria and West Africa as well as to meet new business partners. Now in its fifth edition, Food & Beverage West Africa is the continent’s largest food and beverage trade show. More than 6,000 visitors are expected to attend over the three days. The exhibition is organised by BtoB Events. Brad Smith, Exhibition Manager, said: “This year’s exhibition is featuring more exhibitors, more countries and more products than ever. If you are seeking new and exciting products that have yet to be seen in the West African market, then FAB is simply unmissable. “FAB 2024 is bringing even more countries and exhibitors than ever before. Our brand-new USA, China and Italy pavilions are joining our regular pavilions from Turkey, Dubai, India, Indonesia and Egypt. “We are also welcoming exhibitors for the first time from countries such as Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Turkmenistan and Nepal.” The event is recognised for the number and range of overseas exhibitors which attract visitors from the West African region and beyond. “We pride ourselves on the international standard quality that our exhibition represents. It is a unique exhibition where we are bringing the global food and beverage industry to Nigeria, with both exhibitors and visitors attending and all looking to do business within the West African region,” said Smith. One of the international exhibitors, Xena’s Food Group, is a Platinum Sponsor of FAB West Africa. Based in London, Xena’s is a wholesale food distributor specialising in premium-grade fresh condiments, oils and ingredients. The company sees huge potential with the Nigerian market, noting the growing demand here for high-quality ingredients. “FAB West Africa offers a unique opportunity to connect with key players in the food industry specifically within the West African region,” says Mr Kochhar, Head of International Trade. “We believe that this targeted approach aligns perfectly with our goal of expanding our presence in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. We see this event as a strategic platform to showcase our offerings. “Our primary objective is to establish Xena’s Food Group as a trusted supplier of premium food products in the African market. We aim to forge partnerships with distributors, wholesalers, hotels, and restaurants, showcasing our extensive range of high-quality mayonnaises, ketchups, flours, cooking oils, poultry, eggs, and grains.” Another of the international exhibitors is Linc Drinks, also from London, and a manufacturer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Zoryana Slater, Linc Drinks’ Export Manager, is delighted to be coming to Food & Beverage West Africa. “We recognize the immense potential of the African market, particularly Nigeria, and view FAB West Africa as a strategic platform to showcase our premium beverages. We aim to establish strong connections with industry stakeholders, distributors, and consumers, fostering brand recognition and market penetration,” says Zoryana Slater. “We aim to forge strategic partnerships, secure distribution channels, and generate substantial interest in our products, including our private label options. Participation in FAB West Africa presents a prime opportunity to elevate the visibility and reputation of Linc Drinks in the African market.”",

        "content": "Marian Rivera with (from left) Bianca Gonzalez and Andi Manzano —CONTRIBUTED Mother’s Day may be over but a mom’s job never ends, as Marian Rivera explained last week. The actress and her husband Dingdong Dantes starred in the top-grossing movie “Rewind” in last year’s Metro Manila Film Fest, and she now appears in the GMA TV series, “My Guardian Alien.” Still, she makes it a point to be a hands-on mom with their two school-aged kids, Zia and Sixto. She constantly frets about their health, especially now that they’re both in their formative years. “I always worry that they might get sick so we try our best to avoid any illness,” Marian said. “In school, they might catch a cold from their classmates, so I talk to them about how they can protect themselves.” She makes sure that they eat well and that their diet includes an assortment of vegetables. She also sees to it that they take their vitamins, explaining to them why they need to do so. “Of course, I’m not a perfect parent, but my husband and I do our best to raise our children well,” Marian said. When it comes to exercise and playing outdoors, she is all for it—provided it’s not too hot. “My son loves to play basketball and other games, but it really depends on the weather. If they want to play outside, they have to be mindful of the time; around 4 or 5 p.m. is best. Rivera (second from left) with husband Dingdong Dantes and their children, Sixto and Zia —MARIAN RIVERA/INSTAGRAM “If it’s raining or too sunny, we stay indoors and do arts and crafts. I join in the activity so all three of us end up learning something new,” Marian said. The actress and celebrity endorser was the featured guest at the 50th anniversary celebration of Ceelin, a vitamin supplement from pharmaceutical company Unilab “My family, especially my kids, are my number one priority. Minsan lang sila maging bata kaya I promised to be the kind of mom who shows up and supports them in all that they want to do and achieve,” Marian said. “To working moms like me, alam ko hindi madali to manage your time for work and for your family pero magagawan at magagawan ito ng paraan. Sigurado din ako na it will all be worth it.” To mark its 50th anniversary, Ceelin launched its latest ad campaign with the song “Nais Ko,” that was written by National Artist Ryan Cayabyab and popularized by Basil Valdez. At the press launch held last week, the Mandaluyong Children’s Choir performed the song for an audience that included other celebrity moms like Andi Manzano and Bianca Gonzalez. The two later joined Marian onstage for an informal panel discussion. “Through the years, it has always been our mission to help Filipino children have strong immunity, as we believe this is the key to enriching their lives,” said Ceelin brand manager Rachel Mistal.

        "description": "CREATING a whole value chain for the nickel industry in the Philippines will increase the value of mineral exports by 10 times, a government economic manager said.Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Secretary Frederic Go said that instead of focusing on the exploration or exploitation of minerals, the Philippines should attract investments for downstream processing in the mining industry.\"We are now the largest exporter of raw nickel ore to the world, and we supposedly have the largest copper deposit mine here in the Philippines. And this can increase the value of our exports by perhaps 10 times,\" Go said during the Philippine Economic Briefing in Pasay City on Monday.A report from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) showed that the country's metallic mineral production value sustained growth and rose by 4.79 percent in 2023.In the latest report released by DENR's Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB), the value of domestic metallic mineral production increased to P249.05 billion from the P237.66 billion logged in 2022 due to the outstanding performance of gold and nickel.Currently, the country's nickel ore is being exported to China, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia, with China getting 98 percent of the total or 17.6 million dry metric tons in 2023.Go also emphasized the need to complete the country's geo mapping of critical mineral resources, led by the DENR, which he said would also help attract investments into the mining sector.Earlier this month, the government said it was planning to cut the processing time of mining permits from six years to one to three years via digitalization.Moreover, Go said that he was optimistic on fostering the development of the mineral industry, which in turn would create an industry for electric vehicles.\"Processing electric vehicles in the Philippines would be our end goal, at least for today, that should be our end goal,\" he said.",

Pangilinan emphasized the company's dual commitment to delivering affordable and clean energy while safeguarding the environment.\"We stay true to our word first to deliver power, to light up people's homes, offices, malls, factories at the least cost to our customers. But on top of that, we have attached the responsibility of protecting our planet,\" Pangilinan stated.Echoing this sentiment, Meralco First Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer Raymond Ravelo highlighted the significance of PowerPlants in reinforcing the company's sustainability agenda.\"PowerPlants strengthens our commitment to sustainability and to creating positive impact. Through this urban farm in our own backyard, we have hopefully a simple yet very powerful way of creating a transforming difference in our company, in our communities, and beyond,\" Ravelo said.The PowerPlants Urban Farm is an integral initiative under Meralco's sustainability agenda, \"Powering the Good Life,\" which is deeply rooted in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is supported by four pillars: Power, Planet, People, and Prosperity.",

So hopefully in a few weeks or months, we will begin looking for one so we can officially start it (the feasibility study),\" he said.In April 2024, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. secured the commitments of Japan and the US to support the development of a railway project linking Subic, Clark and Batangas during a trilateral summit last April in Washington, D.C.Manila, Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of the Luzon Economic Corridor, which will support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas.The three leaders said that through the corridor, they were committed to accelerating coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure projects at Subic Bay.These include rail projects ports modernization, clean energy and semiconductor supply chains and deployments, agribusiness and civilian port upgrades.The Subic-Clark cargo railway project is part of the DoTr's plan to create a logistics hub in Central Luzon, which will link the Port of Subic in Zambales to Clark, Pampanga.",

        "content": "Ireland has joined a European-wide effort to underscore the importance of plant health; part of which focuses on educating people to not bring back any plants, flowers, seeds, fruits or vegetables from outside the EU when returning from their travels, lest they introduce plant pests or diseases detrimental to native flora. The #PlantHealth4Life campaign is led by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Commission (EC), and is active in 22 European member states. Senator Pippa Hackett, Minister of State for Land Use and Biodiversity with special responsibility for Horticulture at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine said: “We are proud to stand alongside our European partners to raise awareness of the profound interdependence between plant health and our collective well-being. This collaborative effort is a unique opportunity to engage citizens from all walks of life — be it the intrepid traveller, the conscientious gardener, or the vigilant parent — in safeguarding plant health.” Louise Byrne, Chief Plant Health Officer for Ireland, added that the Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine conducts comprehensive inspections on imports of regulated plants and plant products. Importantly however, a critical element is educating the public across all spectrums, from commercial importers to amateur gardeners on the need for heightened awareness of the issues at stake and to not attempt to import unchecked plants and plant products that pose a risk to Ireland. The campaign urges travellers not to bring back any plants, flowers, seeds, fruits, or vegetables from outside the EU, as these items may harbour plant pests or diseases detrimental to native flora. Additionally, consumers are advised to buy plants and seeds online only if accompanied by a valid phytosanitary or plant health certificate. Embracing good plant hygiene practices and promptly addressing signs of plant pests or diseases in home gardens and communal outdoor spaces will also prevent their spread to neighbouring plants and natural habitats. Speaking on Ireland’s involvement in the campaign, leading Irish garden designer Diarmuid Gavin, who was appointed as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations’ Goodwill Ambassador for Ireland in May 2022, said: “Safeguarding Irish plant health is paramount. As gardeners, we hold the power to effect change — by allowing our gardens to flourish naturally, propagating your own plants from seeds, sourcing plants responsibly, and vigilantly monitoring for abnormalities, we can collectively protect our botanical heritage.” © ITTN.ie",

        "description": "LOCAL analysts surveyed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) expect the Monetary Board to cut policy rates every year until 2026.",
        "content": "LOCAL analysts surveyed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) expect the Monetary Board to cut policy rates every year until 2026. In the latest Monetary Policy Report, analysts said by the end of this year, the monetary authorities could cut policy rates by 25 to 150 bps. For 2025, the analysts said, the BSP could loosen its policy stance by a range of 25 to 250 bps; while in 2026, analysts expect an additional reduction of about 50 to 150 bps in the policy rate. “The results of the survey showed that most of the analysts anticipate current monetary policy settings to remain unchanged in Q2 [second quarter] 2024,” the report stated. This outlook on policy rates is consistent with expectations that inflation will slow to 3.7 percent in 2024 from the initial estimate of 3.8 percent. Inflation forecasts by analysts for 2025 remains unchanged at 3.5 percent but higher in 2026 at 3.5 percent from the initial outlook of 3.4 percent. “Analysts expect within-target inflation over the policy horizon, although settling at the upper end of the target range as uncertainty lingers. Upside risks continue to dominate due mainly to supply chain disruptions,” the report stated. The local analysts said the primary upside risks to inflation are higher oil and food costs, including rice. The price of these basic goods, the report stated, are affected by supply-side pressures due to geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. In April 2024, rice inflation slowed to 23.9 percent from the 24.4 percent posted in March 2024. Rice inflation has been above 20 percent since January 2024. The list of upside risks also includes the impact of extreme weather events such as El Niño in the first half of 2024 and the La Niña in the second semester. Based on the latest report of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), the severe dry spell affected 175,063 farmers and fisherfolk and cost the economy P9.496 billion in damages. On Monday, the NDRRMC also reported that Tropical Cyclone Aghon has affected 19,373 Filipinos and displaced 5,343 residents. While estimates of the damage are not yet available, 22 damaged homes and 13 flooded areas were initially reported. “A few analysts cited downside risks from easing albeit still elevated food and non-food inflation, such as rice and oil; and waning inflationary pressures on prices as El Niño and base effects weaken in the near term,” the report added. The report also noted that 15 out of 20 respondents said there is a higher chance, 77.2 percent, that inflation will settle within the 2 to 4 percent inflation target of the BSP. In April, analysts said there is only a 71.5-percent this can happen this year. However, analysts said there is a 22.8-percent probability, lower than the 28.3 percent posted in April 2024, that inflation will breach the upper end of the target range. For 2025, analysts said the probability that inflation will fall within the target band increased to 85.3 percent, higher than the 78.2 percent expectation in April. The report said that for 2026, there is a 73.5-percent probability, lower than the initial 76.5 percent, that inflation will settle within the target band. More expensive rice and vegetables and higher transport costs caused inflation in April to accelerate to 3.8 percent, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said last May 21. The National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) and the Department of Finance (DOF) said the government is now fast-tracking interventions to beef up food supply to shield consumers from the ill effects of El Niño as well as La Niña. Data released by the PSA indicated that inflation quickened for the third consecutive month in April. The inflation rate last month was faster than the 3.7 percent recorded in March, but slower than the 6.6 percent in April 2023. Citing data from the PSA, Neda noted that April witnessed a “surge” in food inflation, which rose to 6.3 percent from the previous month’s 5.7 percent. Key contributors include vegetables, up by 4.3 percent; fish, up by 0.4 percent and ready-made products up by 4.8 percent.",

        "description": "Jacks struck an unbeaten century off just 41 balls and helped RCB chase down 200 to beat Gujarat Titans in an IPL match with Kohli looking on from the other end.",
        "content": "Will Jacks hopes to put the on-field “coaching” he received from Virat Kohli to good use when England bids to retain its T20 World Cup title next month. Jacks goes into the third game of England’s warm-up series against Pakistan having helped propel the hosts to a 23-run win at Edgbaston on Saturday. The Surrey all-rounder struck a quickfire 37 in what proved to be a decisive stand with captain Jos Buttler as England went 1-0 up in the rain-hit four-match series ahead of Tuesday’s game at Cardiff’s Sophia Gardens. It was another example of Jacks’ power hitting after he recently struck an unbeaten century off just 41 balls -- including 28 runs from one Rashid Khan over -- as Royal Challengers Bengaluru chased down 200 to beat Gujarat Titans in a high-pressure situation, with India star batsman Kohli looking on from the other end. “The big thing with the IPL is that every game is such an occasion, the crowd, the atmosphere,” Jacks told reporters on Monday, just over a week from England’s World Cup opener against Scotland in Barbados. “Every game you feel like you’ve got to step up and that’s similar to international cricket.” As for batting with Kohli, the 25-year-old added: “He’s a very good role model. The way he approaches all the training and every aspect of the game off the field, his intensity, everything he does is a 100 percent attention. “He’s done it for such a long time and I can appreciate that as a young guy who often doesn’t want to do the hard yards, but you see him doing it and want to copy that.” “When we were batting together, he was coaching me through there. I learned some valuable things about chasing in that innings and pacing the game, which was really helpful,” Jacks added. “I was really proud of the way I stayed in the partnership, didn’t throw it away.” Now Jacks, whose England career currently consists of a mere two Tests, seven one-day internationals and 12 T20s, is looking forward to a major global tournament. “Playing in a World Cup is something I’ve dreamed of since I was a little kid. I’m really excited to do it,” he said. “It’s getting closer now and we’re building in the right direction.” Jacks labelled his England T20 record of 218 runs at 18.16 a “mixed bag”, although his cause has not been helped by switching between opening the innings and batting at three. “I’ve probably opened half my games and batted number three in the other half,” he said. “It’s no lie that I’m new to batting at three, I’m learning on the job.” He added, “I’ve been getting starts every game and it’s about how do I change those into match-winning scores. That’s more of a mindset thing. It doesn’t matter what I’m averaging: if the team’s winning, then it’s good.” Comments Related stories Related Topics",

        "content": "The Lagos State Police Command, on Monday, repelled attack on a station in the state, arresting some of the attackers and impounding over 200 motorcycles used by the attackers. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Lagos State Command, Ikeja, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, in a statement on Modnay @LagosPoliceNG indicated that Officers of Ipaja Police Division successfully repelled an early morning attack on their division by motorcycle operators. According to the PPRO, the attack came after police officers commenced the day’s enforcement of the existing ban on motorcycles in Lagos State. The attackers, who came in their hundreds, stormed the station with dangerous weapons, shooting at the officers and attempting to overrun the station. He added that while officers and men of the division held their ground, reinforcement came from the Area Command and the Rapid Response Squad (RRS). Two of the attackers were fatally injured during the attack, Hundeyin said. However, this did not deter the officers from accomplishing their mandate as over two hundred motorcycles were impounded and some of the attackers arrested, with one locally made firearm retrieved. “The Lagos State Police Command will not be cowed into abdicating its responsibilities of enforcement of all duly passed laws and maintenance of law and order within the society,”the PPRO declared.",

        "content": "South Lanarkshire school leavers are exceeding national and local benchmarks. New data has revealed that young people leaving school across the region are stronger in comparison to their peers in the West Partnership of nearby local authorities as well as nationally. The data, which has been released by the Scottish Government for the session 2022/23 relates to four national benchmarks which highlight the performance of pupils at the point of exit from school. The four national benchmarking levels are attainment in literacy and numeracy, attainment for all, and attainment vs deprivation with an emphasis on closing the gap and post-school participation. Across South Lanarkshire, young people who left school in 2022/23 achieved literacy levels which were better than those achieved nationally and in the West Partnership. At all levels, attainment in literacy has improved since 2019. Young people who left school in 2022/23 also achieved numeracy levels which were better than those achieved nationally and were in line with the West Partnership. At levels three and four, attainment in numeracy has improved since 2019 and at levels five and six, attainment in numeracy remains in line with the 2019 levels and remains higher than the virtual comparator. The overall attainment of the middle 60 per cent of school leavers in South Lanarkshire is in line with the West Partnership and virtual comparators. It is also above the national level and is higher than in 2019. The overall attainment of the upper 20 per cent of leavers is also in line with the West Partnership and national levels and it is also higher than in 2019. The data also shows that some measures in the attainment gap remain high, and there is evidence of more young people from less affluent backgrounds leaving school earlier. Their attainment levels are generally improving but are not increasing at the same rate as their peers. Both the staying-on rate and the attainment of young people from deprived backgrounds are a focus for schools in the upcoming session. Leavers’ destinations and post-school participation is still a key strength for South Lanarkshire school and support services, and positive destination rates continue to improve and remain above all comparator measures. The West Partnership - which South Lanarkshire education data is being compared to - is a collaboration of eight local authorities across the West of Scotland, including East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow City, Inverclyde, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire.",

        "description": "\"Data science’s power lies in the ability to connect theoretical knowledge and real-world actions,\" remarks Aditi Goyal, a data engineer at AmazonThe post Forging the link between data science and practical application appeared first on Digital Journal.",
        "content": "Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own. “Data science’s power lies in the ability to connect theoretical knowledge and real-world actions,” remarks Aditi Goyal, a data engineer at Amazon . The global big data market is set to reach a valuation of $234.6 billion in 2026, creating a demand for professionals who can translate complex data. Like other data science professionals, Goyal’s contributions to her field largely revolve around helping businesses make better decisions through data analysis and collation. With a background in computer science and information systems, Goyal’s technical skills and business sense allow her to turn complex data challenges into actionable solutions. Her work prompts decisive action and efficiency across Amazon, impacting teams throughout the organization. Goyal has developed machine learning (ML) models that analyze customer buying patterns, allowing Amazon to gain insights into purchasing trends for events like Prime Day. This project aimed to improve sales and customer satisfaction through personalized content and recommendations. Furthermore, her work has involved deploying real-time analytics systems to enable Amazon to respond to market changes. Other Amazon teams now use data pipelines and analytics tools developed by Goyal’s team. These tools optimize performance, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. Goyal has also worked on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with Amazon’s data analytics frameworks. These systems leverage AI-driven forecasts to help maintain optimal stock levels, avoiding overstock and understock situations. Goyal has also employed ML models aimed at identifying user preferences among Smart devices to improve customer satisfaction. Moreover, Goyal’s team has developed sentiment analysis algorithms. These algorithms analyze customer feedback and online interactions to extract insights into customer emotions and preferences. This data-driven approach enables Amazon to tailor its customer service and product offerings more effectively. It aims to fortify customer loyalty and brand strength. However, not all of Amazon’s data handling is done in the name of customer service. A 2015 study by BARC Research indicates that companies that analyze big data report an average of 8% increase in revenues, largely owing to enhanced decision-making by leaders. One notable example of Goyal’s contributions in this vein is her contributions to Amazon leadership surrounding high-severity issues, where her high-performance dashboards and deep data analysis methodologies aided in major decision-making. In these cases, Goyal’s expertise allowed her to produce visualizations and concrete facts related to Amazon warehouse performance and progress tracking on the renowned sub-same-day delivery program. One of the critical challenges facing the data science community is the need for more clarity between academic research and practical application. Machine learning and AI continue to push the possibilities, but translating their output into tangible business value remains a hurdle. Goyal addresses this challenge through collaboration and cross-functional teamwork. By working closely with stakeholders across the organization, from product managers to software engineers, she ensures that data science initiatives are aligned with business objectives and deliver measurable results. Goyal has worked on translating technical concepts into language that non-technical stakeholders can understand, with the goal of making data science more accessible and actionable. Goyal envisions integrating data science into every aspect of business. “There is great potential for data science to transform industries,” says Goyal. “Capitalizing on analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence will let us discover previously hidden insights and drive development we never thought possible. Like the mathematicians of old, pure data can also teach us about the universe itself.” Goyal, however, argues that realizing this potential requires drastic changes in how organizations approach data science. She believes businesses must embrace sharing data across teams and using it to drive strategic initiatives. “The future of data science isn’t just about technology.

        "content": "The family of a stroke victim have thanked volunteers from a national construction charity who have built him a ground-floor extension so he can sleep in his own bedroom for the first time in more than two years. Keith Parry, 70, has only left his house three times after suffering a severe stroke in late 2021, which left him in hospital for seven months. The joiner, from Gaer, Newport, South Wales, was only able to return home after his wife had a specialist bed and lifting equipment installed in the lounge. But he was left without any privacy or facilities and effectively lived under the stairs in his lounge, prompting the comparison by local healthcare professionals to fantasy character Harry Potter, who had to live in a cupboard under the stairs in the world-famous books. In an emotional handover, Mr Parry’s wife Linda thanked the volunteers from Band of Builders. They built the extension – which includes a bedroom and wet room – as well as all the national and local companies that rallied around by donating everything from materials for the project to food and drinks for the volunteers. “What Band of Builders has done will change our lives forever,” she said. “Our gratitude will never be enough – and from the bottom of our hearts we thank all the volunteers who travelled from far and wide to build the extension with a bedroom and bathroom to give Keith his dignity back. “The work has been of the highest standards and long may Band of Builders continue helping people like us.” The father-of-three suffered a stroke in an upstairs bedroom at his home in late 2021 which robbed him of his speech and mobility. Mr Parry spent seven months in different hospitals in South Wales undergoing rehabilitation. He went home after a hospital bed and lifting equipment were installed in the lounge of their home, where he has slept ever since. Because their house is at the bottom of a steep bank, his family cannot get him out of the house, so he has only left three times in the last two years. When Mr Parry needs to attend medical appointments, two ambulance crews are required, and often the fire service is on hand to help as well. Nearly 50 tradespeople – including plant workers, bricklayers, builders, roofers, plumbers, electricians and decorators – and other Band of Builders supporters volunteered on the three-week project, which was sponsored by Tarmac Blue Circle. Garry Gregory, from Tarmac Blue Circle, added: “We’re extremely proud to once again be supporting Band of Builders with its latest project for Keith. “We hope that this project has brought some comfort to him at this difficult time. “The work the team is doing is extremely important for the industry and we look forward to continuing to make an impact with Band of Builders.”",

        "content": "OTTAWA — Immigration Minister Marc Miller is increasing the number of applications that will be processed under a much-criticized program to reunite Palestinians with Canadian relatives. The move comes as he testifies about measures introduced months ago that were meant to bring relatives of Canadians from conflict zones in the Gaza Strip and Sudan to safety. The Gaza program initially had a cap of 1,000 applications that could be “accepted into processing,” but Miller is now increasing that number to 5,000, each of which can include multiple family members. Palestinian Canadians have complained about inconsistent messaging and onerous requirements that left people unable to leave Gaza before Israel effectively closed access to Egypt. Civil war in Sudan broke out last spring, yet family members say officials expect their relatives will not reach Canada until the end of this year, citing delays with fingerprinting and other biometric requirements Miller is providing a briefing about both programs today at the House of Commons immigration committee. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it has issued 179 temporary-resident permits through the Gaza program as of April 29, but the department doesn’t know whether anyone has actually reached Canada. In a statement, Miller said that Canada has been sending the names of approved temporary residents to Israeli and Egyptian authorities, even though they can’t currently exit the Gaza Strip. “While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time,” Miller said. “With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves.” There continue to be reports of Palestinians paying thousands of dollars to cross into Egypt amid uncertainty over their resettlement status. Relatives in Canada say they were given mixed information from Ottawa about whether those who paid to cross could still access the Canadian program. The Gaza program involves temporary residency permits, while the Sudan program is for permanent residency. The NDP has accused the government of bungling both programs, and not learning from other conflict situations, such as the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

(EDC) on Monday listed the second tranche of its Asean green bonds, amounting to P10 billion, at the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. (PDEx).It was the final tranche of a P15-billion shelf registration and was comprised of three-year bonds due in 2027, five-year bonds due in 2029, and seven-year bonds due in 2031.EDC said that strong demand enabled the company to exercise an oversubscription option and raise an additional P4 billion.The bonds were priced at the lowest end of the credit spread range, fetching rates of 6.7478 percent, 6.8873 percent and 7.0626 percent for the three-year, five-year and seven-year series, respectively.EDC President and COO Jerome Cainglet noted that the \"dangerously high heat indices\" experienced in the country over the past weeks had led to a surge in demand for electricity, particularly for cooling, \"which has significantly reduced our reserve levels and has put upward pressure on electricity prices.\"\"We look forward to adding renewable energy capacity to address these and, through the green bonds, present the public with the opportunity to participate in financing clean and renewable energy projects,\" he added, in line with EDC's mission of forging pathways for a \"decarbonized and regenerative future.\"EDC Chief Finance Officer Erwin Avante said the proceeds from the bond offer would be used mostly for geothermal projects, maintenance of other green projects, and for battery energy storage systems.\"Our capital expenditure [budget] for this year is around P40 billion, and this P10 billion [bond offering] is just part of that, so we're still talking to the banks for the balance,\" he added.Avante said that half of the capex budget was intended for growth projects that were expected to be completed within the year, while the other half \"is for our [geothermal] drilling, as we are drilling a lot of wells this year.\"EDC was granted the go-ahead for its second tranche green bond offer by the Securities and Exchange Commission last May 10. The first tranche, amounting to P5 billion, was issued and listed in June 2021.BDO Capital and Investment Corp. and BPI Capital Corp. acted as joint issue managers and were also joint lead underwriters and joint bookrunners together with China Bank Capital Corp. and SB Capital Investment Corp.RCBC Trust Corp. and RCBC Capital Corp. were the trustee and selling agent, respectively, for the transaction.EDC parent First Gen's shares dropped 1.53 percent to P17.98 each on Monday.",

        "description": "FUEL and power costs in the Philippines are higher because the country does not provide subsidies compared to its neighbors, according to one of the country’s top businessmen.",
        "content": "FUEL and power costs in the Philippines are higher because the country does not provide subsidies compared to its neighbors, according to one of the country’s top businessmen. In the Philippine Economic Briefing (PEB), San Miguel Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer Ramon S. Ang said gasoline in Malaysia costs P20 per liter, P40 per liter more than the average P60 per liter price in the country. Ang traced this mainly to the Malaysian government’s subsidizing a third or 30 percent of fuel costs in their country. In contrast, he said, the Philippine government, apart from not subsidizing fuel costs, also imposes excise taxes that make up another one-third of pump prices in the country. “If you look at it on an equal basis, our prices without the subsidy and without taxes is even lower than Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. It’s also the same as power,” Ang said at the open forum at the PEB’s first plenary session on Monday. “Our power generation compared to our neighboring countries are lower. But we impose taxes on the power sector of fuel. And we also...don’t give subsidy on power. That’s why our power prices are higher,” he added. Meanwhile, Ang said that despite the high fuel and power costs, investors must not use this as a reason why they will not invest in the Philippines. If investors are keen on putting up businesses such as factories in the Philippines, they should consider putting up their own power generation facility to serve their power needs, he added. “If you are a foreign investor that wants to come to the Philippines, that [high power costs] is not a reason for not coming. You should come and put up your own power generating plant in your factory. Which is very easy to put up. And the Philippine government encourages all big energy consumers to put up,” Ang said. The SMC executive also said the country should fight for its sovereignty when it comes to the West Philippine Sea. The country has a lot of reserves in the WPS and could allow the production of more natural gas to help bring down energy costs. “Our oil production is only 6,000 barrels per day. Compared to our neighboring countries, average 1 million barrels a day. That’s why they can put in subsidy. [In the] Philippines, we don’t have oil,” Ang said. “But we have a very big reserve in West Philippine Sea. That’s why they are very interested in the Philippines. So let us start. Let go of it. We should protect our territory,” he stressed. Asked whether subsidies are a good idea to bring down the cost of fuel and power, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan said subsidies may not be the best way forward. Balisacan explained why: the main subsidy recipients will be the rich, who are the biggest consumers of fuel and power. However, he said, the government already has programs to subsidize the fuel and power needs of the most vulnerable. The National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) Secretary said targeting mechanisms can be improved through the government’s digitalization program and the national ID. “That way we can save a lot of fiscal resources and avoid potentially serious problems like a fiscal crisis. That’s what happened in the past when we had the Oil Price Stabilization Fund [OPSF] that became so unsustainable and caused a lot of fiscal problems,” Balisacan recalled. In a discussion paper published in 2022, PIDS Senior Research Fellow Adoracion Navarro said reviving the OPSF would be anti-poor. If the OPSF is revived, Navarro said it disproportionately benefits the rich more than the poor. This will be complicated by the government’s lack of expertise when it comes to “managing the fund, and controlling the deficits of the fund.” She, instead, recommended oil stockpiling instead of reviving the OPSF. Keeping strategic oil reserves, Navarro said, is common practice by net oil importing countries. While this is not yet part of the National Energy Plan, stockpiling is proposed to be done by the state-owned Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC).",

        "content": "DOZENS of accommodation centres for Ukrainian refugees are set to close, the Taoiseach has said. Almost 70 contracts for Ukrainian refugee accommodation will expire “shortly”, according to Simon Harris . Mr Harris said that many hotel and community facilities which were being used as refugee accommodation will made available again for local use. Speaking to Ireland AM on Virgin Media , Mr Harris said that the state needs to move “beyond this emergency response” to migration. He added: “Firstly, we need to stop taking the only hotel in the town and there is some good news in relation to this. “In Co Kerry , for example, we’ve been able to put two hotels that had been used for migration back into use. \"There are 68 contracts currently being used for Ukrainian accommodation that will not be used shortly and that we’ll see many hotels and other facilities coming back into their community, that’s important for communities to see and to know. “The second thing though is, and I’ve been very honest about this, we have to stop the conversation about migration only being about accommodation. “If you do that you’re going to completely lose the people in this country, you’re going to see a breakdown in social cohesion. “I believe very strongly that Irish people are compassionate. I really believe it. Irish communities have done an incredible job. “We have taken a number of measures to show people that there’s a rules based system, that if you come here and you don’t have a right to be here, you’re going to find out about that quicker and be asked to leave, that our welfare system is there to support you, but it’s never open to abuse.” In recent months the Government has introduced tighter rules around welfare supports for asylum seekers and Ukrainians. Last week, the Government announced plans to means-test asylum seekers . Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys is currently looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, following a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in state-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year.",

        "content": "I have learned that it may not be a good idea to go shopping online when you are tired. And it is the middle of the night. And you may, or may not, be shopping in your sleep. Because that is how I recently ended up placing a bid of $100 on a $1 Matchbox car for our grandson’s first birthday. My intentions were honorable. It was a good idea at the time. Except the time was somewhere between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. The auction clock was ticking. I had around 45 seconds to place my bid. Somehow, I typed in $100 instead of $1. And for the next 421⁄2 seconds I held my breath and hoped nobody ran up my stupid bid. Well, now I know I can hold my breath for at least 421⁄2 seconds. This chain of events started when I received the newest catalog from our favorite discount bookseller. Those catalogs are eagerly anticipated, and we order so many books that the FedEx drivers draw straws to see who has to deliver the books to our porch. We seldom see the same driver twice. I favor buying large and glossy art books. They are full of pictures, and not a lot of words. Art books are invariably in a large hardcover format, and 200 pages of art can weigh about five pounds. Art is a heavy subject. ADVERTISEMENT My history-loving husband buys big fat books that are chock-a-block full of words and dates and people. Not a lot of pictures. His books are heavy by the sheer weight of all the words in them. Eight hundred pages of history weigh about the same as 200 pages of art. My art books are way prettier to look at, though. The company has flat-rate shipping, and we always figure, “Why buy ten books, when we can buy 15 or 20, and they ship for the same price?” Okay, we usually stop at about 30 books per order. That is how I ended up with “Vroom” on the kitchen table. “Vroom” is a toddlers’ picture book about a little boy who likes fast cars. Perfect for a first birthday. But one needs a fast car to go with a book about fast cars. What is the best fast car around? A Corvette. Particularly, a red Corvette convertible. Especially because I have one. And that is why I was cruising eBay at 2:30 in the morning, looking for a 1987 Corvette Matchbox car. Vroom-Boom. Now JJ will have a hot car, just like his Gamma’s. I admit to shopping online for books in the middle of the night, too. Fortunately, I am not bidding at auction for them. But I do sometimes end up with strange volumes. Like my illustrated book on the complete history of political picture postcards from 1900 to 1945. I am giving that one to a friend. I suppose I will have to browse eBay to find some postcards to go along with it.",

        "content": "Libertarians have crowned former Georgia Senate hopeful Chase Oliver as their 2024 presidential nominee after a grueling eight hours of voting at their convention over the weekend. Oliver, 38, who managed to fend off outside attempts to usurp the Libertarian Pary endorsement, now joins the likes of independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and independent Cornel West as a third-party force in the 2024 arena. “We did it! I am officially the presidential nominee,” Oliver posted on X after clinching the party nod. Oliver now appears to be the first millennial to clinch a significant third-party presidential nomination. During the Libertarian Convention over the weekend in the Washington Hilton, former President Donald Trump and Kennedy delivered entreaties to the liberty-loving party, seeking to join forces. Trump sought to woo libertarians with a promise to pardon Ross Ulbricht, a darknet black market operator who was arrested in 2013 and is serving out a life sentence. The 45th president also said that he would put a libertarian in his cabinet. Ultimately, Trump’s vows fell flat and he was forced to power through a chorus of boos at times during his speech Sunday. “If you want to lose, do that. Keep getting your 3% every four years,” Trump chided to the raucous crowd at one point. Libertarians drew their largest share of the presidential vote in 2016 when they nabbed 3.3% support nationally. Oliver suggested to CNN that amassing over 2% of the national vote is a reasonable objective. Scores of libertarians have been keen on distinguishing themselves from the duopoly, despite some overlap on vaunted small government talk with conservatives. During the voting process, Trump attained six write-in votes in the first round. Kennedy, who was nominated by a delegate, scored 19 votes and was eliminated in the first round. Despite his defeat, Trump, 77, was adamant that he could’ve won the Libertarian nod if he actually wanted it. “The reason I didn’t file paperwork for the Libertarian Nomination, which I would have absolutely gotten if I wanted it (as everyone could tell by the enthusiasm of the Crowd last night!), was the fact that, as the Republican Nominee, I am not allowed to,” he wrote on Truth Social . Oliver initially came in second place, behind Michael Rectenwald, who held the lead during the early rounds of voting. But eventually, Oliver cut a deal with Mike ter Maat, who was among the top three, which helped propel him over the finish line during the seventh round of voting with about 60% of the vote. Ter Maat later won the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nod after two rounds of voting. Here is what we know about Oliver, the Libertarian Party’s millennial nominee. Oliver, who has been described as “ armed and gay ,” grew up in Nashville, Tenn. He was briefly a Democrat from roughly 2003 to 2009, before switching his party affiliation to Independent. In 2020, he vied for Georgia’s 5th congressional district special, which was won by former Rep. Kwanza Hall (D-Ga.). Oliver then jockeyed for the 2022 Georgia Senate race. That contest ultimately went to a runoff, something that some analysts blamed on him as he garnered over 2% support during the first round. Now that Oliver is the party’s nominee, he is hoping to mount a campaign in all 50 states and is keen on trying to peel off younger voters. “I wanted to demonstrate to the delegates and to the voters that we have the drive and energy to push ourselves everywhere to grow our party’s foundation in every state,” Oliver told Politico . Like many libertarians, he has distanced himself from both Democrats and occasionally even Republicans on many economic issues. But he has also roiled conservatives on social issues. After he clinched the nod, right-leaning accounts quickly slammed him for defending the right to host drag queen story hours. Libertarian nominee Chase Oliver: 99% of drag queen story hours are fine for kids. If he had children, he says he'd bring them to one and leave them there. \"It's just like the Wiggles\" pic.twitter.com/grNYFtAVHQ Earlier this year Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party Nominee, went to the border to advocate for open borders. With everything we've seen happen to our country because of Biden's policies, this guy is arguing to open the border even more. Naive. Foolish. Anti-American. pic.twitter.com/rAZvtVVZVw They’ve also seethed at him for pushing back against GOP goals for shutting down the US-Mexico border. Chase is also pro-abortion rights. Polling has sparsely gauged libertarian influence in the 2024 presidential election given the lack of a nominee until now. Nationally, Trump is up in front with 41.2%, followed by President Biden at 39.4%, Kennedy at 10.6%, Stein at 1.8%, and West at 1.8%, per the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls.",

        "content": "GREENHILLS Shopping Center (GSC) has committed to gradually move 100 percent of its merchants away from selling intellectual property (IP) infringing products by 2027, according to the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL). The intellectual property rights watchdog said, in its statement on Monday, the commitment was made after it met with the shopping mall, as well as brand owners and enforcement agencies on May 9. It unveiled developments in its campaign to encourage the flea market traders to shift away from counterfeit products. At the meeting, GSC Assistant Vice President and Trade Fairs and Exhibits Head James Candelaria presented the mall’s 10-year roadmap, which aims to gradually move 100 percent of its merchants away from selling IP-infringing products by 2027. According to IPOPHL, starting in 2020, GSC management decided to reduce the number of stalls to 1,412 from 1,771. Candelaria also reported that as of October 2023, at least 80 percent of the traders have gone through the transition program and are now selling local products, Halal items, jewelry, antiques, furniture pieces and artworks. He also showed that over the years since the implementation of the roadmap, the mall was able to “weed out” nearly 299 stores by suspension. “The GSC suspends stores that violate its rules, including [intellectual property] IP rules, and majority of the suspended sellers, according to Candelaria, do not return to GSC,” IPOPHL noted. According to Candelaria, the shopping mall has so far educated its traders to tell them that “it’s time to change and that there are other products to profit from.” The GSC official said some of the mall’s recent education initiatives include a learning event with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), attended by over 400 merchants, and “Bagsakan” events where the GSC showcases local products traders could explore selling. IPOPHL said that since 2022, the mall has refused to accept applicants who intend to sell bags, watches and similar products, except where local manufacturers or labeled products are involved. “The category usually makes up a big share of the counterfeit products seized by the National Committee on IP Rights [NCIPR],” said IPOPHL. The country’s intellectual property rights body said Greenhills also provided incentives to stores that sell local delicacies and items, placing them at “premium” locations in various entrances of the building where the flea market is located. IPOPHL said the meeting was also attended by legal representatives of luxury brands, who discussed solutions with GSC for their teams to better monitor stores. The dialogue was followed by a brief tour, through which GSC showed the new mall building, filled with well-known apparel brands and food stores, and the flea market, said the IP rights body. For his part, IPOPHL Director General Rowel S. Barba reminded stall owners on the importance of selling original products, noting IPOPHL will soon conduct an IP briefing with these stall owners to help them transition to “legitimate goods.” “We laud the commitment of the GSC to work together with its merchants to create a fairer and more IP-conscious business environment. We look forward to seeing more positive outcomes from this transition program,” Barba said. IPOPHL is one of DTI’s attached agencies. Trade and Industry Secretary Alfredo E. Pascual for his part called on other malls to look at the Greenhills Shopping Center as an “example and see how good business practices can be done gradually.” While the GSC is the lone physical market flagged in the United States Trade Representative Notorious Markets Lists, it is joined by the Cartimar Shopping Center and the markets of Baclaran and Divisoria in the European Commission’s Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List.",

It also serves around 17 international carriers that bridge Cebu to multiple foreign destinations.\"For us to meet this increasing demand brought about by the boom of travel and tourism, real estate investments [have] now become a center of attention because we believe that there is still a huge opportunity that Cebu still has to offer,\" Manigsaca said.This year, AppleOne is looking to launch The Fairfield by Marriott Cebu Mactan and targets another luxury brand hotel in Cagayan de Oro to expand its presence in Mindanao.AppleOne, added Manigsaca, will continue to elevate industry standards in residential, commercial, and hospitality sectors by bringing in global brands to promote Visayas and Mindanao.The firm's investments there were said to have produced around 5,000 direct employment opportunities, which helped boost local tourism and economic growth.Since its entry into the country's property market, AppleOne has widened its portfolio of residential, hotels and resorts, and commercial developments.It also has two tertiary health care facilities — one in Cebu and the other in Davao — and a primary hospital in Tacloban.",

        "content": "THE Joint Foreign Chambers (JFC) called on legislators on Monday to approve critical bills aimed at overhauling the governance framework of the country’s airports. According to the JFC, there are three urgent reforms that will enhance the safety, efficiency, and quality of domestic and international airports across the country. These three legislative reforms are the following: amendments to the Civil Aviation Authority Act of the Philippines (Caap) Law; the creation of the Philippine Airports Authority; and the establishment of the Philippine Transportation Safety Board. “These reforms are essential to enhancing the safety, efficiency, and overall quality of both domestic and international airports in the Philippines,” the JFC said in its letter to the Philippine Senate. The proposed amendments to the Caap Law aim to bolster the agency’s role in safety oversight by improving human resource development, strengthening the board, and aligning with global safety standards. The creation of the Philippine Airports Authority is intended to resolve the conflicting roles of Caap as both an airport regulator and operator, thereby improving operational efficiency. Lastly, the formation of the Philippine Transportation Safety Board would enhance the government’s capacity to investigate accidents and bolster overall transportation safety. According to the JFC, the government should prioritize these legislative reforms, citing the recent events at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia), where numerous flights were delayed due to a technical issue with the navigational air traffic management system. This incident—along with other unfortunate events at the Naia such as power interruptions, congestion, and even sanitary issues—has underscored the need for robust regulatory and operational frameworks to prevent similar occurrences in the future. The JFC, representing over 3,000 member companies and over US$100 billion in trade and $30 billion in investments in the Philippines, stressed that these reforms would significantly benefit the country’s aviation sector. The coalition includes the American, Australian-New Zealand, Canadian, European, Japanese, and Korean chambers, as well as Pamuri. “The JFC supports and promotes open international trade, increased foreign investment, and improved conditions for business to benefit both the Philippines and the countries we represent,” the JFC said.",

        "description": "The special counsel is seeking to prevent Trump from making further incendiary remarks about the FBI agents involved in the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
        "content": "Special counsel is preparing legal action if a Donald Trump-appointed judge refuses to rein in the former president's comments, a former prosecutor has said. Trump has repeatedly said that the FBI was willing to use legal force while searching his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents. Smith filed a motion to Judge on May 24 seeking an alteration to Trump's bail conditions, in which he would be restrained from making dangerous and untrue comments about the FBI. Smith was appointed special counsel supervising Trump's federal indictments. sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Monday. Former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance wrote in her legal blog, , on Sunday that Smith decided not to apply for a gag order because he knows that it would be easier to appeal if Cannon refuses his request to adjust Trump's bail conditions. \"Why did Smith go this route instead of asking for a gag order? That's a great question, and I think it suggests where Smith is headed,\" wrote Vance, who served as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama during the Obama administration. She said the relevant federal law \"specifically authorizes the government to appeal if a district judge denies a motion to modify the conditions of release.\" \"That's what this is all about. Donald Trump isn't the only one who can take an appeal for strategic reasons. Judge Cannon has had real trouble ruling for the government in routine motions that clearly merited that treatment. If she rules against them here, they'll be prepared to take a quick appeal,\" Vance wrote. Cannon is a U.S. district judge based in Florida and was appointed by Trump in 2020. She is now presiding over the DOJ's case against the former president. He is and then obstructing the government's efforts to retrieve them. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Cannon has faced criticism and calls to recuse herself from the case for making a the former president. Vance said \"the more pressing question\" is what Smith will do if Cannon deliberately doesn't move on his request—\"if she sits on the motion, as she has on so many others in this case, without ruling or even scheduling a hearing.\" \"Smith will likely be politely persistent at first, asking her to schedule the hearing,\" she wrote. If that doesn't work, Smith will likely seek a writ of mandamus to the appeal court, Vance believes. \"Mandamus asks an appellate court to order a trial judge to do something they are obligated to do but won't or to refrain from doing something they are not permitted to do,\" she explained. The search warrant used in the 2022 raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence was recently in Florida. The raid led to the seizure of hundreds of documents containing classified information, which resulted in dozens of felony counts against the former president. The former president posted on his Truth Social account, alleging that the DOJ \"AUTHORIZED THE TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\" In addition, a Trump campaign email that was recently sent to supporters said that FBI agents were \"authorized to shoot\" Trump, saying President was \"locked & loaded and ready to take me [Trump] out.\" However, the FBI said in a statement that the wording of the warrant was standard and the phrase \"deadly force\" was also included when agents . \"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the agency's statement said. Discussing Trump's claim about the search warrant, U.S. Attorney General said at a news conference on Thursday that the \"allegation is false and it is extremely dangerous,\" reiterating that the document in question is standard policy. Smith's filing to Cannon on Friday included 12 pages of Trump's online about the FBI deadly force claim, along with another from X account PatriotTakes, which describes itself, in part, as \"researchers monitoring and exposing right-wing extremism.\" The latter said former adviser had claimed that \"the Mar-a-Lago FBI classified document search was 'an attempted assassination' by Joen Biden on Trump and his associates.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "description": "Analysis: The decline in foreign capital flowing into Israel marks a critical juncture for the nation's economic future; unlike the robust recoveries in the United States and Europe, Israel's ongoing downturn highlights the urgency of addressing this issue",
        "content": "In the bustling landscape of global venture funding, Israel's diminishing share raises red flags, signaling a potential crisis for the nation's economy. As Q1 2024 figures reveal a surge in global investment, Israel is heading in the opposite direction. Even as growth equity begins to recover globally, Israeli VC investments peaked at $29 billion in 2021 but then dropped significantly to $17 billion in 2022, $7.3 billion in 2023, and are currently (in 2024) on a $5 billion run. 3 The high-tech industry faces difficult times as party ends Photo: Yuval Chen While the global economy shows significant signs of recovery, Israel's trajectory is lagging. The disparity becomes evident when comparing IPO figures. In Q1 2024, the United States witnessed IPOs soar to $5.67 billion, a 100% increase from the previous year. Similarly, Europe experienced a notable surge, with IPOs escalating from $1.3 billion to $8.1 billion (720% growth). In contrast, Israel reported zero IPOs in 2024, a decline of 100%, indicating that while other regions are recovering, Israel is not. Beneath the surface, troubling trends from the largest foreign investors tell an even more alarming tale. In 2021, Japanese investment in the Israeli tech sector surged to roughly $3 billion. SoftBank Group Corp., a Japanese multinational holding company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, engaged in a significant number of deals in Israel, with twelve in 2021, four in 2022, and three in 2023. Since October 7, SoftBank has suspended deals in Israel but has closed nine deals in the US, Europe, and Canada. Similarly, Koch Investments, based in Wichita, Kansas, has refrained entirely from engaging in deals within Israel since October 7, mirroring the Japanese trend. Despite closing four deals with Israel in 2023 (and additional deals worth billions of dollars prior to 2023), Koch has redirected its focus since October 7, closing four substantial deals outside of Israel in the United States, Europe, and Canada and zero in Israel. Rapid decline in foreign capital since October 7 Before October 7, 2023, Israel witnessed a steady increase in passenger traffic. However, the aftermath of geopolitical tensions heightened by Iran’s attack has dealt a severe blow to the nation's inflow of foreign visitors. Despite efforts to resume normalcy, airlines like United (the most important travel proxy for American businesspeople coming to Israel) continue to suspend flights to Israel. Since October 7, United maintained flights to Israel only during a brief period in March and April 2024. 3 Hamas terrorists breach the border fence on October 7 Photo: Reuters The 2023 Annual Report on the State of High-Tech highlighted that Israeli high-tech accounted for 18% of the country's GDP and nearly half of its exports. Over the past decade, the sector's growth has been exponential, cementing its pivotal role in the nation's economic landscape. Understanding the importance of the sector to the Israeli economy, the Israeli government established the \"Yozma (Initiative) Fund”. The fund aims to co-invest alongside Israeli institutional investors in local venture capital funds, expand funding, and increase local capital's influence and stability in the high-tech sector. By reducing dependence on foreign capital, the fund seeks to enhance stability, especially during crises. However, according to discussions with the CIOs of leading institutional investors, there is little if no interest in participating in the 30% free leverage program offered by the Yozma Fund. 3 Photo: Shutterstock Despite government efforts to jump-start the tech sector, there has been a rapid decline in foreign capital since October 7. According to recent estimates, there are only $200mm-$300mm of dry powder (cash) left in Israel to support the vital tech sector (out of the $2.4BN raised in the past five quarters). Nonetheless, efforts have been made by venture capital firms and foreign investors to increase capital flow into Israel. Several firms have launched their own emergency fund initiatives, offering investment opportunities to their investors (without the usual management fee structure). Varana Capital’s Chai Fund, the largest October 7 emergency fund, has raised $30mm. Another fund had raised a modest $14mm for its no-fee resilience fund (despite its relatively large database of approximately 225,000 accredited investors on its distribution platform). While commendable, the amounts raised are insufficient to sustain the current tech sector in Israel. How to avoid the impending crash We have spoken to and are in constant communication with numerous foreign and local investors. We have also been involved in discussions with the Government and Government-backed investment entity, The Israeli Innovation Authority. The situation is terribly bleak. Foreign investors have disappeared from Israel, and the Government funds dedicated to investment post-October 7th are not sufficient. We must get investors back into Israel to avoid this impending crash. We believe that there are significant opportunities, in fact, the most attractive deals we have seen anywhere since the Global Financial Crisis, where there was much more financial and business risk than today in Israel. Our opportunity fund is still open to investors and, while gaining significant traction, cannot alone fill the hole of many billions of dollars missing from the market due to the flight of other foreign investment firms. Without sufficient funding, many of Israel’s emerging technology companies may be doomed Jonathan Nesher, a US-based M&A and Corporate Finance partner with the international law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP (BCLP), also expressed his concern for Israel’s emerging companies, stating that “there has been a noticeable decline in cross-border transactions with Israeli companies. Stabilization and positive resolution of the current geopolitical issues are crucial to the survival of Israel's emerging company sector. Companies cannot survive in limbo indefinitely.” Israel's downward trajectory of incoming foreign capital highlights a critical moment for the nation's economic future. The contrast between the robust recoveries seen in the United States and Europe and Israel's continuing decline underscores the urgency of the situation. Addressing this issue requires concerted efforts from policymakers, investors, and the tech ecosystem to reinvigorate the nation's investment appeal. Without swift and strategic action, Israel risks falling further behind in the competitive global market, jeopardizing its position as a leading innovation hub.

        "description": "Orlando Pirates head coach Jose Riveiro has not lost focus of the challenge to compete with Mamelodi Sundowns for the DStv Premiership title in spite of qualifying for the CAF Champions League.",
        "content": "Pirates booked their spot in the CAF Champions League on the final league game after a 1-1 draw against SuperSport United was enough to see them edge Stellenbosch for the second spot on the standings on a superior goal difference. Despite the achievement, Riveiro said in his post-match press conference, that they will not be celebrating finishing second, with full understanding that finishing 23 points behind number one, Sundowns, is not good enough for the Soweto giants. \"I think we shouldn't undermine what it means to be in the Champions League but (we're) not celebrating being second, we're celebrating to be in the Champions League, we've got the right to be there and it's something very important for the club,\" Riveiro told journalists at Orlando Stadium. \"But being second, 23 points behind the first one is not a huge achievement. So that's our objective from now, how can we reduce that gap with whoever is there leading the log. It's too much distance between the second and second position. \"Even though we're fighting with the team that is not famous for dropping points frequently, the things that we can control, the things in our hands like last two games, having the possibility to consolidate the second spot and giving away the points that we gave, it's something we need to do a reflection,\" he said. \"To understand why, because it's our responsibility and like I said, celebrate the Champions League spot but obviously not celebrating that we're second, 23 points away from the first,\" the Spanish coach added. Last season Pirates also finished second, 16 points behind the Tshwane giants. The Brazilians and the Buccaneers will meet in the Nedbank Cup final on Saturday afternoon at Mbombela Stadium.",

According to Daily Trust, the plaza resumed operations around 2:30pm on Monday. DAILY POST reported that the market was sealed by military authorities on May 18, following a violent clash between traders and military personnel. Trouble started when thugs allegedly beat up some soldiers who had a disagreement with a trader in the plaza. The trader had reportedly sold a bad phone to someone who invited soldiers. The police stepped in to resolve the situation, but soldiers later stormed the plaza, forcing traders to shut down immediately. Human rights activists, including Femi Falana, SAN, civil society organisations, among others had condemned the military action.

        "content": "Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner start French Open with straight-set victories PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek has started her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean. Monday's win stretched Swiatek's winning streak to 13 matches. She put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Jannik Sinner also won in straight sets Monday. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Acuña is placed on IL after suffering a 2nd season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn ACL in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña’s second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris was scheduled to play Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09. Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months.",

        "content": "CONCORD, N.C. — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson's quest was to complete — if not win — the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. ''What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I've ever experienced,'' Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson's team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane, and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That's when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. ''So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,'' Larson said. ''I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.'' Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson's focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can't participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn't been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting ''The Double'' was one of the best experiences of his life — right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. ''I can't describe how appreciative I am of everyone's support of me to live out a dream,'' Larson said. ''I hope it's not the last opportunity I have to try 'The Double' but if it is I guess it was memorable.'' ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

        "content": "“How can I leave everything behind and go? My priority is relief work. Even if I am holding a meeting here, my heart goes out to those people (affected by the cyclone),” Mamata Banerjee said at the Kolkata rally. Published: May 27, 2024 9:49 PM IST By Edited by West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Monday said she will not attend the meeting of the INDIA bloc on June 1 due to the last phase of Lok Sabha polls and ongoing relief work after cyclone ‘Remal’ hit the state’s coastal regions. According to sources, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has convened a meeting of the INDIA bloc leaders in the afternoon of June 1, coinciding with the last round of polling. Addressing an election rally in Kolkata, Banerjee mentioned her inability to attend the INDIA bloc meeting due to the scheduled elections in the state on that day. “The INDIA bloc meeting has been fixed on June 1. But I have already said I can’t go on June 1 as there is an election in our state on that day. So far I know there are elections in Punjab, UP and Bihar. Voting will continue till 6 pm, and at times it extends beyond that (6 pm),” she said. Banerjee highlighted the dual challenges of post-cyclone relief work and ongoing elections, emphasising her priority towards relief efforts. “How can I leave everything behind and go? My priority is relief work. Even if I am holding a meeting here, my heart goes out to those people (affected by the cyclone),” she said at the Kolkata rally. The TMC had withdrawn from the INDIA bloc in West Bengal in January but affirmed its commitment to remain part of the opposition alliance at the national level. During the election campaigns in the last two months, Banerjee had expressed confidence that the INDIA bloc would win the Lok Sabha elections and affirmed her involvement in the anti-BJP alliance at the national level. Sources in the TMC revealed that voting will be conducted on nine seats, including two seats in Kolkata, in West Bengal on June 1, which are crucial for the party.

        "content": "THE Supreme Court has directed the Commission on Elections and joint venture led by South Korea’s Miru Systems Co. Ltd. to comment on the petition seeking to enjoin the implementation of their P17.9-billion Automated Election System (AES) contract for the 2025 national and local elections. The Court gave the respondents 10 days from receipt of notice to file their respective comment on the petition and application for temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction filed by former Caloocan Representative Edgar Erice last April 18, according to a statement released by the SC Public Information Office. Erice’s petition primarily seeks to stop the poll body from implementing its February 21, 2024 resolution awarding the Full Automation System with Transparency Audit/Count (FASTrAC) contract to Miru and its partners St. Timothy Construction Corp. and Centerpoint Solutions Technologies. The former solon also ultimately prayed that the contract between the Comelec and Miru be declared null and void, and that the implementation of any other contract that the poll body may have entered into with the Korean firm, in connection with the incoming elections, be nullified. The petitioner argued that the deal violated the provisions of Republic Act (RA) 7369 or the Automated Election Law, particularly on the bidding procedures and the use of prototype machines during the election process. He claimed that the contract is highly disadvantageous to the government as it stands to lose around P10 billion in taxpayers money. Erice’s petition comes on the heels of the Court’s ruling in April which reversed the Comelec’s decision to disqualify Smartmatic-TIM Corporation from participating in the bidding process for the subject contract. Despite its decision favoring Smartmatic’s petition, the SC did not nullify the P17.9-billion contract that the Comelec inked with Miru. SC spokesman, lawyer Camille Sue Mae Ting, clarified that the validity of Miru’s contract with Comelec was not the issue presented in the case before the SC. She added the Court’s ruling was not tantamount to upholding Comelec’s contract with MIRU since it was not the issue decided upon by the magistrates.",

She said: \"I think I’m single because I don’t underestimate the fact that I’m hard work. I know what I want and I'm not easily pleased.

        "content": "LOVE Island 2024 is almost upon us, as a whole host of new islanders prepare to enter the famous villa. Jess White has been confirmed as one of the new stars of series 11 . Here's what we know about her. Jess White is 25 years old and hails from Stockport . Jess says that she wanted to do the show as all of her friends are in long term relationships and she didn't want to be left behind. I think that can sometimes put people off me because I am quite loud and you can hear me before you see me. Some men love that though. She said: \"All my friends are in relationships, settled down with babies and I’m going to end up that aunt that rocks up at family parties and they say ‘she's still not met someone, she’s still going to Ibiza having a midlife crisis.’ \"I just want to meet somebody and to be able to do all of that stuff too.\" Jess went onto describe why she thinks she is single ahead of her appearance on the show. She said: \"I think I’m single because I don’t underestimate the fact that I’m hard work. I know what I want and I'm not easily pleased. When you’re a loud, outgoing woman, sometimes it can intimidate men - men don’t always want that. I think that can sometimes put people off me because I am quite loud and you can hear me before you see me. Some men love that though.\" Jess works as a retail manager. She has outlined her expectations for any potential lovers that she meets on the show. She said: \"I would say nice teeth, I love a set of white Turkey teeth but a good set of Turkey teeth. I would say personality traits, you have to be family orientated. \"I’m so close to my mum and I’d like my future partner to be really close with their family too. You have to be tall, you can’t be shorter than me, I can't be having to question whether I can wear heels around you and what height of heels I can wear. If you’re vertically challenged, it’s not for me.\" The new series of Love Island will start on June 3, 2024 at 9pm. Jess will be one of the first Islanders to enter the villa for series 11. She will be joined by ten other singletons hoping it will be a summer to remember. As the weeks go by, they will be joined by a host of other bombshells which is sure to stir up drama and tension. The Sun revealed how the iconic villa has undergone a makeover in preparation for the brand new series. For launch night, The Sun revealed that ITV bosses are planning a huge shake-up that has never been done before. The first episode of Love Island 2024 will air on ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX simultaneously, with the rest of the series being shown on ITV2 and ITVX. The show will air at 9pm, Sunday to Friday. A highlights programme from events during the week will be shown instead of the normal show on Saturdays. A source said: “ITV want to throw their weight behind Love Island and make sure it has a big, glitzy moment when the 11th series kicks off next month. “Showing it across every channel means creating what they hope will be a big TV moment. It shows there is still a real commitment to the format even nine years on.\" Every year Love Island opens its doors to more sexy Islanders who are hoping for a holiday romance that could turn into more. Here we take you though all of the Love Island winners so far and what their relationship statuses are now: 2024 - The first ever All stars spin off show was won by Molly Smith and Tom Clare . STATUS: Still together. 2023 - Jess Harding and Sammy Root took home the 50K, and won the summer 2023 Love Island . STATUS: Broken up. 2023 - The first series of 2023 saw Sanam Harrinanan and Kai Fagan crowned Love Island winners in South Africa . STATUS: Still together. 2022 - Davide Sanclimenti and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu's time in the villa was anything but a smooth ride, but they managed to win the public's hearts - and the ITV2 reality show. STATUS: Broken up. 2021 - Liam Reardon and Millie Court were announced winners of Love Island 2021. STATUS: Still together. 2020 - The first ever winter Love Island saw Paige Turley and Finn Tapp crowned winners after falling in love on the show. STATUS: Broken up. 2019 - Series 5 saw Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague runners up to winners Greg O'Shea and Amber Gill, who met in the last few days of the series. STATUS: Broken up. 2018 - It wasn't surprising fan favourites Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer won the show , as they were strong throughout. But sadly things didn't last. STATUS: Broken up. 2017 - Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies had lots of ups and downs in the villa but went on to win the show . STATUS: Broken up. 2016 - Nathan Massey and Cara De La Hoyde were together form the start of the series, and since they won show have two kids and are married. STATUS: Still together. 2015 - Despite poor Jess Hayes being Max Morley's second choice on the show, they did win - but they didn't last as a couple. STATUS: Broken up.",

        "content": "CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s quest was to complete — if not win — the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson's team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane , and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That's when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. “So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,” Larson said. “I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.” Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson's focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can't participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn't been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting “The Double” was one of the best experiences of his life — right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. “I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream,” Larson said. “I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try ‘The Double’ but if it is I guess it was memorable.” AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

        "description": "Erik ten Hag remains in the dark as to whether he will be replaced at Old Trafford this summer",
        "content": "Sport | Football Manchester United have reportedly made contact with Roberto De Zerbi as they consider a managerial change, with it increasingly likely that Kieran McKenna will stay at Ipswich. A decision has not yet been made on Erik ten Hag ’s future at Old Trafford, ahead of an end-of-season review taking place this week to decide if winning the FA Cup is enough for the Dutchman to keep his job, after a campaign in which the club finished eighth in the Premier League. Initial talks have been held with the representatives of a number of managers, in case United do look to make a change this summer, and McKenna was believed to be high on the club’s wishlist, after leading Ipswich into the top-flight with back-to-back promotions. However, The Athletic report that McKenna, who was also previously in contention for the Chelsea job, is now expected to sign a new long-term contract with Ipswich, despite interest from United and Brighton. McKenna was assistant to Jose Mourinho at United and then worked under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, further strengthening suggestions that he could favour a return to Old Trafford, but that now appears to be off the cards and his former employers will have to look elsewhere if they do decide to replace Ten Hag. Discussions are understood to have already taken place with Mauricio Pochettino , available after leaving Chelsea at the end of the season, and Brentford boss Thomas Frank , who was also strongly considered to replace Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. The Blues are expected to appoint Leicester manager Enzo Maresca. According to the Daily Mail, De Zerbi has now been sounded out by United, after the Italian parted ways with Brighton. The 44-year-old received significant praise during his time in charge of the Seagulls, leading the club into Europe for the first time in their history and playing an attractive style of football. It is suggested, however, that De Zerbi’s desire for control over recruitment could prove problematic, with United putting an extensive team in place off the pitch since Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s arrival at the club. Pochettino and Frank still remain options, if Ten Hag is sacked, with Thomas Tuchel also a possibility. The German left Bayern Munich after a frustrating campaign, and is set to be replaced by Burnley’s Vincent Kompany in a surprise move.

        "description": "India is set to play five Tests at the Perth Stadium, Adelaide Oval, Gabba, Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) from November 22 to January 7.",
        "content": "Discussing the upcoming 2024-25 Border Gavaskar Trophy, Australia great Matthew Hayden here said that the Australian team is in a transition period and vulnerable at the top, with the need for a new opening batter to replace David Warner. “Well, it’s a time in Australian cricket where it’s a transition period. And so, we’re vulnerable at the top. I was very forthright in saying this, Steve Smith should never have been the opening batter for Australia. And I still believe that’s the case. “So, we are on the lookout for, I believe, another opening batter to replace the great David Warner, who’s had an exceptional career. He really, I feel, built on the legacy that JL (Justin Langer) and I created in our period. He went better. Whereas our strike rate was 65 to 70, Dave Warner was 80 and sometimes more,” he said during the panel discussion on the India-Australia cricket with the legendary Sunil Gavaskar and former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh at the launch of the Australia-India ‘Summer of Cricket,’ organised by the Australian Consulate in partnership with Cricket Australia (CA) and the Centre for Australia-India Relations. “It’s really a battle of the top order. And Australian cricket has put itself in a position where it’s kind of got no further games to really anticipate what it’s going to look like ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. So, that’s the only question mark. If I were to do a SWOT analysis on us as a group, that would be my only question mark,” he added. India is set to play five Tests at the Perth Stadium, Adelaide Oval, Gabba, Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) from November 22 to January 7. “I’ve played in three-match series and that’s not enough. Four’s an awkward number. You can’t get your teeth into it. But five has just got it all on the line. “You can get behind in the series. You can come back in the series. And that’s why the Ashes, which has now been reduced to five or six, is still a great series. Because it sways in roundabouts. And you have to be up for it because it’s a long tour,” said Hayden. Asked for his wish list for the series, Gavaskar said: “My wish list is, obviously, India should continue to be winning us three in Australia - twice they’ve won now, and so for the third time as well. “Hope it’s a good, close series with the matches going into the fifth day. A lot of Test matches finish in three-and-a-half, four days. A five-day Test would be fantastic for everybody concerned. I just hope that happens because that means that it won’t be one-sided. It will mean that the balance of power will move from day one to day two. “Test matches in the earlier days used to be like an Indian soap. So, on the first day, the mother-in-law is the boss; on the second day, the daughter-in-law is the boss, and on the third day, the mother-in-law is the boss. That’s what happens in Indian TV serials. Something like that you want to see, where Australia and India keep on dominating for four days alternately, and maybe on the fifth day the team that has really got that greater desire goes out and wins. That would be, obviously, the wish list, and all five Test matches should have a result. That would be absolutely fantastic. In the 1977 India-Australia series, Australia won 3-2. You just want that kind of a situation where you have a result in every game. “On an individual level, maybe for Virat Kohli, who’s got four centuries on four different venues, that he becomes the third overseas player who’s scored a century in all the Australian venues. I think he doesn’t have one at the Gabba. I think he’s got it everywhere else. So if he gets a century at the Gabba, that means he joins me and Alastair Cook as the third overseas batter to have got a century at all the Australian venues. That would be fantastic. Because, if he gets runs, India will get a lot of runs as well.” When asked for his prediction for the series, Hayden said: “Just to sum this up, I’ll paint out what it’s going to look like. Australia is gonna win the first Test in Perth. So, drop-in wicket, but it’s about 12 mm grass that your (Indian) top-order can look forward to; 12mm of very bright green grass. (Josh) Hazlewood, (Pat) Cummins, and (Mitchell) Starc will bother you with pace. And for (Nathan) Lyon, I guess, the ball will really bounce there as well. “Come across to Adelaide, Kuldeep will turn it. It’s a drop-in wicket as well. It also starts a little grassy, but what tends to happen is it tends to get footmarks and so you’ll win that game. “And then, you’ll come across to Brisbane and Australia will win that Test match, because it’s just one of those venues which is classically in favour of us. “So, now you’ve come to Melbourne, and India comes back hard. You saw the passion and the rivalry at that (2020) Test match. That venue is home to well over 700,000 expats. That’ll be Australia’s away game. It’s the only away game that Australia will actually play. “So, now you’re 2-all up, then you go to Sydney and that’s when eyeballs start to meet and rivalry starts to happen. Because everyone’s tight. Conditions not being drop-in, they start to then become fierce. Whoever starts that Test match really well, will find it hard to also lose the Test match because once you get into day three, day four, and in particular day five, it’s a batting graveyard. It becomes really hard to score. Sometimes, it’s tricky in the middle couple of days, but often it’s very hard to score. “So, I’m going to just leave it 2-all, and I’m going to hedge my bets into that fifth Test match because I can’t wait to see that one. That’s my favourite Test match when India tours Australia because it does turn and the wicket becomes a little tricky to bat on as well.” Comments Related Topics",

        "content": "This news has been read 101 times! MADRID, May 27, (Xinhua): Xavi Hernandez ended his two-and-a-half years as coach of FC Barcelona with a win as goals from Robert Lewandowski and Fermin Lopez gave his side a 2-1 win away to Sevilla. It was fitting that Lopez, who has been one of the successes of Xavi’s management this season, scored the winning goal just before the hour. Youssef En-Nesyri leveled for Sevilla after half an hour, but Lopez’s second-half strike meant Xavi could leave with his head held high. Mallorca ended a difficult season with a 2-1 win away to Getafe thanks to late goals from Vedat Muriqi, who canceled out Gaston Alvarez’s opener for Getafe in the 90th minute before Pablo Maffeo gave coach Javier Aguirre a winning send-off three minutes into injury time. Celta and Valencia ended their campaigns with an entertaining 2-2 draw with Iago Aspas’s penalty canceling out Carlos Dominguez’s own goal, which had given Valencia an early lead. Alberto Mari’s 60th-minute penalty put Valencia back in front but just two minutes later Anastasios Douvikas ensured it ended honors even. Things also ended all-square between Las Palmas and Alaves with Carlos Vicente giving Alaves a second-half advantage and Marc Cardona assuring a draw as the two sides promoted last season celebrated top-flight survival for another year. Real Madrid prepared for next weekend’s Champions League final with a 0-0 draw at home to Betis, which saw coach Carlo Ancelotti give Thibaut Courtois over an hour in goal, while Andriy Lunin didn’t get a single minute, in what could be a hint to who plays in next week’s Champions League final. The match also saw Toni Kroos give an emotional ‘adios’ to the Santiago Bernabeu after announcing his retirement earlier in the week. The issues of who would claim the Zamora and Pichichi awards for the best goalkeeper and striker of the season were resolved, with Athletic Club Bilbao’s Unai Simon winning the Zamora as he kept a clean sheet in Athletic’s 1-0 win away to Rayo Vallecano. Nico Williams decided a game with an end-of-season flavor with a 66th-minute goal after good work from Alex Berenguer. Girona’s Artem Dovbyk scored a hat-trick in Girona’s 7-0 thrashing of Granada on Friday night to win the Pichichi award. The Ukrainian forward ended his hat-trick with an 89th-minute penalty that took his total for the season to 24 goals and although Villarreal’s Alexander Sorloth had the chance to overtake that in his side’s visit to Osasuna, the Norwegian was struck by bad luck as he had to limp off with a muscle injury after 14 minutes of a 1-1 draw. Goals from Samuel Lino and Reinaldo saw Atletico Madrid to a 2-0 win away to Real Sociedad in a result that ended Real Sociedad keeper Alex Remino’s chance of ending the season with the best goalkeeping record. Finally, Almeria beat Cadiz 6-1 in a match between two teams who will play next season in the second division. Although Brian Ocampo put Cadiz ahead, two goals each from Sergio Arribas and Luis Suarez, an own goal and an effort from Gonzalo Melero saw Almeria romp to a win that saw them climb off the bottom of the table and above Granada, whose coach Jose Ramon Sandoval announced his resignation before the defeat in Girona.

THE Murcia Council is enhancing the installation of bat shelters across parks and green spaces to control mosquito populations sustainably. Bats play a crucial role in urban ecosystems by controlling insects and aiding in pollination. These shelters, strategically positioned in parks and green areas, are durable and eco-friendly, providing a safe habitat for bats. Regular monitoring ensures the well-being of bat colonies and evaluates the project’s impact on the biodiversity of towns and cities. The initiative not only benefits bats but also promotes a healthier environment by reducing the need for chemical pesticides. It serves as an educational tool, emphasising the importance of bats and dispelling misconceptions. This effort complements previous installations of nest boxes for birds and owls, contributing to over 50 bat shelters across the Murcia area. Bats play a vital role in controlling insect pests, with some species consuming up to 3,000 mosquitoes per night. Thank you for taking the time to read this article.

        "content": "As one would expect with the schedule of upcoming Dwayne Johnson movies , the man also known as The Rock is still on his ever-continuing grind. We can definitely see that in action, thanks to his return to the role of demi-god Maui in not only 2024’s Moana 2 , but also the live action remake, is keeping him busy as anything. But in a recent social media post from the Fast Saga vet, that hard work came with some sweet play, thanks to a surprise birthday celebration from his Moana crew. The ever active Johnson took to his online presence to share a very heartfelt moment, which coincided with his most recent birthday on May 2nd. Apparently after recording the “new version” of his signature Moana tune, an intimate party that also saw director Tommy Kail and vocal supervisor Alex Lacamoire on hand took place. Check out this pure Disney moment for yourself: A post shared by Dwayne Johnson (@therock) A photo posted by on You have to wonder if, somewhere in the contract for Disney talent, there’s a clause that says, “Your employment is subject to potential surprise birthday celebrations, complete with the musical director of Hamilton playing accompaniment.” And if not, the fact that The Rock got this treatment for his own big day is even more special. This video marks yet another special milestone in this WWE legend’s Moana journey, as Dwayne Johnson has also recently wrapped vocals for Moana 2 . So the wheels seem to be turning quite fast for both fronts of this Disney princess resurgence. Though it is quite thankful that the Thomas Kail directed flesh and blood revamp was recently moved into 2026’s summer movie schedule. As for how The Rock’s work on re-recording “You’re Welcome” has been going, well Johnson has provided us with an even deeper look behind the scenes for the process. Check out an early version of that “new version” Dwayne was talking about, below: A post shared by Dwayne Johnson (@therock) A photo posted by on Going into his 52nd year of life, Dwayne Johnson doesn't look like he'll be slowing down any time soon. With his acting career entering a phase that balances reprising Maui's shenanigans with transformative efforts like his role in the upcoming A24 biopic The Smashing Machine , we're going to continue seeing that trademark hustle presenting itself. That right there is why it's so nice to see The Rock taking time to celebrate his birthday, while also lifting up those he works with as a winning team. It may be hard playing a demigod, but Dwayne Johnson seems to make it look so easy. Now let's just hope his birthday happened to be a cheat day, so he could truly enjoy that delicious baked good presented in his honor. Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Moana’s live action remake is currently set for release on July 10, 2026. However, Moana 2 is still on track for its surprising, but welcomed, November 27th debut on the 2024 movie schedule . And, of course, if you’d like to take that first voyage all over again, a Disney+ subscription is all you’ll need to see how far you’ll go on that nostalgic trip.",

COMMENTS BY CEO, ALÄ° TAHA KOÃ‡, PhD We are delighted to celebrate our 30th anniversary as the pioneer of TÃ1⁄4rkiye's digital transformation. As Turkcell, we have introduced numerous innovations in the industry. Today, we are entering an era wherein we will solidify our leadership of TÃ1⁄4rkiye's digital transformation by focusing on our technological capabilities and bringing global technological advancements to our country. Moreover, we are proud to enter our 30th year with strong financial and operational results. A strong start to 2024 Although the first quarter of 2024 was impacted by economic and geopolitical uncertainties, it was a period where hopes for macroeconomic normalization began to increase. Domestically, the Central Bank of the Republic of TÃ1⁄4rkiye's controlled interest rate hikes were monitored amid reaccelerated inflation, while global attention was on the Fed's cautious approach to interest rate cuts. In the first quarter of the year, we achieved strong growth by enlarging our subscriber base with our value-oriented postpaid and fiber subscribers, along with the support of our digital services and techfin business. Our ongoing inflationary pricing policy has significantly contributed to strengthening our company's financial performance. Our group revenues increased by 11.8% yearly to TRY 30.8 billion, while EBITDA1 rose by 23.2% to TRY 12.8 billion. The EBITDA margin reached 41.4%, improving 3.8 percentage points. We delivered a TRY 2.6 billion net profit for the quarter. Our operational performance started the year strong, led by the mobile segment. We gained 229 thousand net mobile subscribers in the first quarter. While our postpaid subscriber base posted an increase of net 472 thousand in this quarter, our net addition for the past twelve months surpassed 1.7 million subscribers. Other sector players also made the price adjustments we made during this period. While aggressive offers from competitors were less observed this quarter, the Mobile Number Portability (MNP) market volume also contracted compared to the previous quarter. Thanks to the increasing contribution of sequential price adjustments, the postpaid subscriber base, which expanded to 72%, and our ability to upsell our customers, our Mobile ARPU2 rose 17.1%. We continued to offer innovative and comprehensive tariffs to our customers. In line with this, we are now offering the Smart Control Service for free, as an example of our strategy based on always being there for our customers. This service automatically suspends usage when customers reach their package limits, ensuring no additional charges on customers bills. Despite price adjustments, thanks to these initiatives, our mobile subscriber churn rate reached its lowest level in the past 6 years, at 1.5%. We maintained our focus on fiber subscribers in the fixed broadband segment. With demand for high-speed and quality fiber services remaining strong, we gained a net of 48 thousand fiber subscribers, pushing our fiber subscriber base beyond 2.3 million. Our strategy of shifting customers to 12-month contracts contributed to limiting the delaying effect of inflation on our growth performance. Thanks to this strategy, the share of 12-month contracted subscribers in residential fiber base reached 74%. In this quarter, fiber ARPU rose 13.7% yearly. While our total fixed subscriber base surpassed 3.1 million, this quarter's fixed subscriber churn rate reached its lowest level since 2007, at 1.3%. Digital services continue to drive our financial performance The growth of our digital services continues to support our group revenues. Revenues from the stand-alone paid users of our digital services grew by 32% to TRY 1.6 billion. The number of stand-alone paid users3 utilizing our digital services amounted to 5.5 million. Digital Business Services provide cloud-based software services enabling automation in business processes, end-to-end digitalization, data center services, and next-generation technologies such as the Internet of Things to our corporate customers. The revenue generated by these services amounted to TRY 2.8 billion this quarter. The revenues from our cloud services, where we provide value-added services and operate four next-generation data centers with a total IT capacity of 54 MWs, recorded growth of 48%, reaching TRY 470 million. Our Techfin segment, with the contributions of our subsidiaries Financell4 and Paycell, significantly contributed to the group's growth in the first quarter. Financell, with 1.1 million active customers, reached a loan portfolio of TRY 6.1 billion, and with rising interest rates, its revenues rose 53.5% yearly. On the other hand, Paycell's revenues, which offer fast and secure payment solutions, increased by 33.2% year-on-year, while its users5 reached 7.8 million. We pioneer innovation, social responsibility, and sustainability By carrying the 'Turkcell and Technology' focus to the international domain, we participated in the 'Sustainable Digital Transformation' panel at the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. As Turkcell, we emphasized that we make our operations sustainable and develop products, services, and project solutions that add value to the economy. Moreover, by opening Call Center and Training Center in Hatay, where Hatay is the most affected city by the February 2023 earthquake, we strengthened our commitment to social responsibility while providing new job opportunities for the region's youth, creating long-term support with sustainable impact. As TÃ1⁄4rkiye's leading technology integrator, we hold data, energy, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity in sharp relief. In a digital world, we consider data generated by people and objects the most valuable raw material. In this context, as TÃ1⁄4rkiye's largest data center operator, I emphasize our company's superior position in the industry. Our Board of Directors TRY 6.3 billion dividend proposal was approved at the Annual General Assembly meeting of May 2, 2024. We will continue to work with dedication to sustain our successful financial and operational results while maintaining our robust balance sheet. We revise our guidance upwards Considering our first quarter performance, we revise our guidance6 upwards. We expect low-double-digit growth of Group revenues in real terms in 2024. We maintain our EBITDA margin expectation of approximately 42% and our operational capex to sales ratio7 target of around 23%. As we celebrate our company's 30th anniversary with joy and pride, we confidently advance towards making Turkcell the leader of TÃ1⁄4rkiye's Digital Century. We will continue to leverage the opportunities provided by technology to build on our sustainable successes and add value to our country. (1) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(2) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 14 for the explanation of how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to net income. (3) EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure and is equal to EBITDA minus depreciation and amortization expenses. Revenue of the Group grew by 11.8% year-on-year in Q124. This resulted mainly from expanding postpaid subscribers of Turkcell TÃ1⁄4rkiye and price adjustments. Additionally, our digital services & solutions, and techfin business made contributions to overall revenue growth. Turkcell TÃ1⁄4rkiye revenues, comprising 86% of Group revenues, grew 13.1% to TRY26,516 million (TRY23,455 million). Consumer business rose4 by 19.5%, driven mainly by strong postpaid subscriber net additions, rising fiber subscriber base, price adjustments, and upsell efforts. Corporate revenues4 decreased by 1.4% mainly due to fewer large-budget projects as compared to the prior period. Standalone digital services revenues from consumer and corporate segments grew 32.3% driven mainly by an expanding standalone paid user base compared with the first quarter of 2023, and price adjustments. Wholesale revenues decreased 6.1% to TRY1,450 million (TRY1,544 million). (4) Following the change in the organizational structure, the revenues from sole proprietorship subscribers that we define as Merchant, which were previously managed under the Corporate segment, are being reported under the Consumer segment as of and from the third quarter of 2023. Within this scope, past data has been revised for comparative purposes. Turkcell International revenues1, comprising 3% of Group revenues, increased 2.3% to TRY815 million (TRY797 million). Techfin segment revenues, comprising 5% of Group revenues, increased 43.7% to TRY1,513 million (TRY1,053 million). This was driven by 53.5% growth in Financell revenues and 33.2% rise in Paycell revenues. Please refer to the Techfin section for details. Other subsidiaries' revenues, at 6% of Group revenues, including mainly consumer electronics sales revenues, and non-group energy business revenues, decreased 12.6% to TRY1,979 million (TRY2,263 million). Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased to 48.5% (52.5%) as a percentage of revenues at the end of the first quarter. This was driven mainly by the decline in the cost of goods sold (2.9pp), energy cost (1.8pp), and interconnection cost (1.2pp) despite the increase in funding cost (1.3pp) and personnel expenses (0.6pp) as a percentage of revenues. Administrative expenses increased to 3.8% (3.3%) as a percentage of revenues in Q124. This was led by higher personnel expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased to 5.7% (5.3%) as a percentage of revenues in Q124. This was driven by the increase in marketing expenses (0.3pp), and personnel expenses (0.2pp) despite the decline in selling expenses (0.1pp) as a percentage of revenues. Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets was at 0.7% (1.3%) as a percentage of revenues in Q124. EBITDA2 rose by 23.2% year-on-year in Q124 leading to an EBITDA margin of 41.4% with a 3.8pp improvement (37.6%). Turkcell TÃ1⁄4rkiye's EBITDA rose 24.4% to TRY12,027 million (TRY9,671 million) leading to an EBITDA margin of 45.4% (41.2%). Turkcell International (excl. Ukraine operations) EBITDA increased 16.2% to TRY297 million (TRY256 million) driving an EBITDA margin of 36.5% (32.1%). Techfin segment EBITDA declined 17.0% to TRY345 million (TRY416 million) with an EBITDA margin of 22.8% (39.5%). The key factor behind the year-on-year decline in EBITDA margin was the rise in funding cost for Financell compared with the first quarter of 2023. The EBITDA of other subsidiaries was TRY84 million (TRY11 million) in Q124. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 18.0% year-on-year in Q124. Net finance income of TRY160.8 million (negative TRY872 million) was recorded for Q124, including TRY2.6 billion monetary gain and net FX losses of TRY2.3 billion. See Appendix A for details of net foreign exchange gain and loss. Other expenses decreased to TRY218 million (TRY232 million) in Q124. Income tax expense increased to TRY1,320 million (TRY2,319 million) due mainly to a lower corporate and deferred tax expense compared to the previous year. Profit /(loss) from discontinued operations of TRY541 million (TRY527 million) was recorded in Q124. Net income of the Group was TRY2.6 billion (negative TRY269 million) in Q124. This result was mainly due to significant contributions from monetary gains and strong performance at the EBITDA level. Total cash & debt: Consolidated cash as of March 31, 2024, decreased to TRY48,779 million compared to TRY57,507 million as of December 31, 2023. Please recall that the second installment of the earthquake donation, eurobond purchasing, personnel bonus payment, and wireless fee tax were paid in this quarter. Excluding FX swap transactions, 49% of our cash is in US$, 24% in EUR, 1% BYN, and 25% in TRY. (1) As of December 31, 2023, our Lifecell, UkrTower, and Global LLC operations in Ukraine have been classified as a disposal group held for sale and as a discontinued operation. Therefore, this segment does not include revenues from those. (2) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 14 for the explanation of how we calculate adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to net income. Consolidated debt as of March 31, 2024, increased to TRY98,050 million from TRY96,750 million as of December 31, 2023 due mainly to the impact of currency movements. Please note that TRY3,197 million of our consolidated debt is comprised of lease obligations. Please note that 43% of our consolidated debt is in US$, 33% in EUR, 3% in CNY, and 21% in TRY. Net debt1 as of March 31, 2024, increased to TRY33,441 million from TRY27,389 million as of December 31, 2023 with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.6x times. Turkcell Group had a long FX position of US$158 million at the end of the quarter (Please note that this figure takes hedging portfolio and advance payments into account). The long FX position of US$158 million is in line with our FX neutral definition, which is between -US$200 million and +US$200 million. Capital expenditures: Capital expenditures, including non-operational items, were at TRY7,508 million in Q124. Operational capital expenditures (excluding license fees) at the Group level were at 18.2% of total revenues in Q124.

This strong performance led us to achieve a total of 1.7 million postpaid net additions in the last 12 months. On the mobile front, our subscriber base expanded to 38.2 million on 229 thousand net additions in Q124. This was driven by 472 thousand net additions from the postpaid subscriber base, which reached 72.3% (69.1%) of total mobile subscribers. We experienced a net decline of 243 thousand in our prepaid subscriber base quarter-on-quarter, due mainly to the disconnection of 319 thousand prepaid customers in Q124 in accordance with the ICTA regulation. The market was not overly aggressive compared to previous quarters, but there have been aggressive campaigns by competitors during some periods of the first quarter. Accordingly, our mobile ARPU (excluding M2M) rose by 17.1% year-on-year thanks to price adjustments, a larger postpaid subscriber base, and upsell performance in Q124. The average monthly mobile churn rate decreased to 1.5% in Q124, the lowest level since 2018. On the fixed front, our subscriber base reached 3.1 million on 50 thousand quarterly net additions. Our fiber subscriber base expanded by 48 thousand quarterly and 179 thousand annual net additions. Meanwhile, IPTV customers reached to 1.5 million on 41 thousand quarterly and 141 thousand annual net additions. The average monthly fixed churn rate at 1.3% in Q124 which is the lowest level since 2007. Our residential fiber ARPU growth was 13.7% year-on-year, mainly on the back of 12-month commitment structure, price adjustments, and efforts to higher tariffs, as well as higher IPTV pricing. Average monthly mobile data usage per user rose 9.9% year-on-year to 17.8 GB, with the increasing number and data consumption of 4.5G users in Q124. Accordingly, the average mobile data usage of 4.5G users reached 18.8 GB in Q124. Total smartphone penetration on our network was at 90% at the end of the quarter. 95% of those smartphones were 4.5G compatible.

BeST registered an EBITDA of BYN24.2 million in the first quarter, which led to an EBITDA margin increased to 49.5%. BeST's revenues in TRY terms increased 3.0% year-on-year in Q124. BeST continued to offer LTE services to all six regions, encompassing 4.3 thousand sites in Q124. Enhanced LTE coverage has enabled BeST to expand its 4G subscriber base.

Accordingly, Paycell's EBITDA increased 47.4% year-on-year leading to an EBITDA margin of 46.7% on a 4.5pp improvement in Q124. The primary factor behind the rise in EBITDA margin was POS expense growth, which lagged behind the increase in revenue. Additionally, the\"Pay Later\" mobile payment service was another key factor of revenue growth for Paycell. The Pay Later service transaction volume (non-group) increased by 57% year-on-year to TRY2.2 billion in Q124. This service was utilized by 6.0 million active Pay Later users in Q124.

Financell's revenues rose by 53.5% in Q124. EBITDA decreased 59.3% yielding an EBITDA margin of 11.1%. The primary reason for the decline in EBITDA margin compared to the previous year was the increase in funding costs. Financell's loan portfolio was at TRY6.1 billion in the first quarter of the year. Financell has provided loans to about 30 thousand corporate customers. Financell's cost of risk was at 1.7% at the end of the Q1. Financell continued to offer innovative solutions including green loans for solar projects, car loans, and shopping loans for both individual and corporate customers. Turkcell Group Subscribers Turkcell Group registered subscribers amounted to approximately 56.2 million as of March 31, 2024.

It also facilitates performance comparisons from company to company. Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure eliminates potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact of changes in effective tax rates on periods or companies) and the age and book depreciation of tangible and intangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense and amortization expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the performance of other mobile operators in the telecommunications industry in Europe, many of which present Adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Our Adjusted EBITDA definition includes Revenue, Cost of Revenue excluding depreciation and amortization, Selling and Marketing expenses, Administrative expenses and Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets, but excludes finance income and expense, other operating income and expense, investment activity income and expense, share of profit of equity accounted investees and minority interest. Nevertheless, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations, as reported under IFRS. The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated using financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS to net profit, which we believe is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.

Management believes this measure is helpful in assessing the development of our services over time. The following table shows the reconciliation of Turkcell TÃ1⁄4rkiye revenues to such revenues included in the ARPU calculations for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.

        "content": "Walmart promoted its new Pride apparel on social media ahead of Pride month on Saturday, writing on Instagram, “Not just a slogan. #PrideAlways is a reminder to lead with love.​” The company’s promotion comes just weeks after Target said its Pride collection would only be available in “select stores” following a major backlash by conservatives last year. Target has had June Pride Month displays with rainbow and LGBTQ+ messaging for years, but the addition of products such as female-style swimsuits that can be used to “tuck” male genitalia outraged many consumers last year. The backlash was so severe that an insider told Fox News Digital at the time that some stores were told to relocate their Pride month displays to avoid sparking a “Bud Light situation.” Along with Target, Bud Light faced a conservative backlash last year after featuring a transgender influencer in an ad. Target also saw a sales slump following the backlash . Target CEO Brian Cornell said last year’s second quarter sales downturn showed “an ever-changing operating and social environment” and taught the company a lesson . At the time, FOX Business’ “The Big Money Show” co-host Brian Brenberg said the backlash had a profound effect. “Clearly, the Pride month backlash by consumers had a huge effect. I mean, particularly on sales,” Brenberg told Fox News Digital. Walmart’s new “Pride Always” collection promo includes products like a notebook that says “beyond gender” a tote bag that says “totes gay,” a fanny pack with “I heart gay people” on it and rainbow-colored products like a pool floatie and an apron. A post shared by Walmart (@walmart) “While I was creating my collection, it was important to me for it to be positive and uplifting,” Bianca of Bianca Designs said in the promo of her collection. Amid the Target backlash, Walmart told FOX Business last year it had no plans to change its LGBTQ+ merchandise. “I think we have merchandise that we sell all year that supports different groups,” the company’s Chief Merchandising Officer Latriece Watkins said in response to a question about the Target controversy made at the company’s associate and shareholder week attended by FOX Business. “I’d say in this particular case, we haven’t changed anything in our assortment.” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told shareholders last year that the company does not “wake up in the morning wanting to go and make social and political statements,” in response to a question about the company’s engagement with public commentary. “We’re [a] retailer,” he added. “We want everybody to feel comfortable shopping with us...and we want everybody to feel comfortable and excited about working at Walmart.” FOX Business has reached out to Walmart for comment.",

        "description": "FINANCE Secretary Ralph G. Recto gave assurances on Monday that the government can still collect its much-needed revenues despite the value-added tax (VAT) exemption for registered exporters on their local purchases of goods and services.",
        "content": "FINANCE Secretary Ralph G. Recto gave assurances on Monday that the government can still collect its much-needed revenues despite the value-added tax (VAT) exemption for registered exporters on their local purchases of goods and services. With the burden and complexity that comes with claiming VAT refunds in the country, local exporters receive their refunds either delayed or not at all. Recto said at the Philippine Economic Briefing on Monday that passage of House Bill 9794 or the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (Create More) bill exempts local exporters from VAT. “If you are a registered business enterprise [RBE] and you are an exporter, you are exempted from VAT so that you will not have to get a refund anymore,” Recto said at the open forum. The Create More bill aims to reconcile the disparities between the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (Create) Act and its implementing rules and regulations, while addressing the concerns about VAT administration affecting registered export and domestic market enterprises. Recto assured that the government will not lose revenues from the VAT exemption since exporters are “supposed to be exempted.” “They used to be zero-rated. So di ba dapat may refund system? That’s not working so might as well make them exempted para wala nang refund [There’s supposed to be a refund system, right? That’s not working so might as well exempt them so there will be no refund anymore],” Recto told reporters on the sidelines of the briefing. “ refund eh so [let’s] be practical about it. [We will just fight over the refunds so let’s be practical about it],” Recto added. Create More also clarifies the incentives for RBEs enjoying benefits before the enactment of CREATE, including an extension of VAT incentives from 10 to 12 years. The Create More bill seeks to enhance the fiscal and non-fiscal provisions under Title XIII of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is targeting to collect P599.235 billion in VAT for this year. So far, the BIR has collected close to 1 trillion or P970.3 billion as of April, while the Bureau of Customs (BOC) has generated P299.3 billion. “We are focusing on growing our tax revenues further by plugging tax leaks and improving tax administration, especially in the e-commerce market, through digitalization—a process that, admittedly, will take some time,” Recto said. The Department of Finance (DOF) aims to raise P4.3 trillion in revenues this year. Despite the lofty goal, the BIR and BOC will stick with the target of raising P3.05 trillion and P1 trillion, respectively, as ordered by Recto.",

        "description": "THE Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday said it had filed charges against a woman who tried to sell her newborn baby online and the woman who helped her do it in a first move against a thriving black market on social media.Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said qualified trafficking and child exploitation charges were filed against Ma. Chariza Rivera Dizon, the baby's mother, and her companion, Arjay Escalona Malabanan, before a Manila regional trial court.The case stemmed from the complaint filed by the Philippine National Police-Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC) before the Justice Department against Malabanan and Dizon.On Feb. 12, 2024, the PNP-WCPC acted upon the information reported by the National Authority for Child Care (NACC) about a \"black market\" proliferating on some social media groups and communities where aspiring parents seek to illegally adopt children.Several days later, the PNP-WCPC, using a policewoman who pretended to be a buyer of a baby, was able to close a transaction with a certain \"Kuy's Jay,\" who offered to sell them a newborn child for P90,000.The police agent pretending to be an aspiring parent and \"Kuy's Jay\" agreed to meet at Concepcion Church in Dasmariñas City, Cavite, where the deal was sealed.Using marked money, authorities were able to receive the baby from Kuy's Jay, who was later identified as the accused Malabanan and arrested right there and then the baby's mother, co-accused Dizon.\"Evidence adduced sufficiently established the crime of qualified trafficking: respondents facilitated the adoption of the newborn baby; facilitation of the adoption was for a consideration of P90,000; purpose was to facilitate illegal adoption; the trafficked victim is a child; and the act of trafficking was committed by or through the use of ICT or any computer system, the transaction having been done through [the] Facebook Messenger platform,\" the DoJ said.\"The act of respondents in selling the newborn child is an act of exploitation,\" it added.On May 20, officials of the Department of Social Welfare and Development-National Authority on Child Care (DSWD-NACC) said they were monitoring Facebook pages that were peddling children in the guise of adoption.NACC Executive Director and DSWD Undersecretary Janella Estrada said they found 20 to 30 Facebook accounts buying and selling children.\"We have been monitoring the sale since last year, and in February, we coordinated with the Philippine National Police to apprehend the people involved in these pages,\" she said.Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian said there was rampant sale of babies on social media, particularly Facebook, with some being sold by their parents.\"This is a cruel form of child exploitation and, at the same time, a cruel form of human trafficking... It is ongoing and a bothersome concern that the public must know,\" he said.In a statement, Remulla said \"children are the most precious treasures of society meant to be fully protected by law; they are the best investments of today for a better tomorrow. We will never allow anyone to exploit them in any way.\"The prosecutors recommended no bail for the qualified trafficking charges and a bail of P80,000 for the child exploitation charges.",

        "description": "Egypt's military said it was investigating a shooting near the border with Gaza",
        "content": "At least 45 people have been killed, including women and children, in an Israeli air strike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Videos from the scene in the Tal al-Sultan area on Sunday night showed a large explosion and intense fires burning. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had killed two \"senior Hamas terrorists\" and that it was \"investigating the circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area\". Hours earlier, Hamas had fired eight rockets from Rafah towards Tel Aviv - the first long-range attacks on the central Israeli city since January. Some 800,000 people have fled Rafah since the start of an Israeli ground operation there three weeks ago, but hundreds of thousands are still believed to be sheltering there. In a separate development on Monday, Egypt's military said it was investigating a shooting near the border with Gaza, just south of Rafah, in which a member of the Egyptian security forces was killed. The IDF, whose forces have seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah border crossing, said it was discussing a shooting incident with Egyptian authorities. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Sunday’s air strike targeted tents for displaced people near a UN facility in Tal al-Sultan, about 2km (1.2 miles) north-west of the centre of Rafah. Graphic footage showed a number of structures ablaze next to a banner saying “Kuwaiti Peace Camp '1'”, as well as first responders and bystanders carrying several bodies. \"We were sitting at the door of the house safely. Suddenly we heard the sound of a missile,” witness Fadi Dukhan told Reuters news agency. “We ran and found the street covered in smoke,\" he said, adding that he and others saw a girl and a young man who had been killed by the blast. Abed Mohammed al-Attar said his brother and sister-in-law were killed, leaving their children as orphans. \"The [Israeli] army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman,” he said. The IDF said in a statement on Monday afternoon that Israel’s Military Advocate General, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi - who is charged with making sure the military acts in accordance with the law - had ordered an investigation into the incident. Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft had “conducted an intelligence-based strike in the area of Rafah against significant terror targets in the area of Rafah” on Sunday, it said. The IDF identified them as Yassin Rabia, the chief of staff of the armed group’s fighters in the occupied West Bank, and Khaled Nagar, another senior official in the West Bank wing, who it accused of directing and carrying out deadly attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians. “Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, the deployment of precise munitions by the IAF, and additional intelligence information,” the statement added. “Based on these measures, it was assessed that there would be no expected harm to uninvolved civilians... The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians during combat.” Israeli government spokesman Avi Hyman told the BBC: “It appears from initial reports that somehow a fire broke out, and that sadly took the lives of others.\" In a speech on Monday morning, Maj Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi described the incident in Rafah as “very difficult”. The Hamas-run health ministry said on Monday afternoon that at least 45 people, including 23 women, children and elderly, had been killed in the strike on the camp. A senior official in Gaza’s Hamas-run civil defence agency, Mohammad al-Mughayyir, meanwhile told AFP that the agency’s rescue workers had seen “charred bodies and dismembered limbs”, as well as “cases of amputations, wounded children, women and the elderly”. Médecins Sans Frontières said overnight that 15 bodies and dozens of casualties had been brought to a trauma stabilisation point which the charity supports. “We are horrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe. We continue to call for an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza,” MSF added. A spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza - said it had been very difficult to communicate with its teams on the ground in Rafah. “But what we do know is that there was a serious incident that took place quite close to one of the largest Unrwa buildings in the north-west of Rafah. We’re talking about dozens of people who have been killed and many others injured,” Juliette Touma told the BBC. “No place is safe in Gaza. No-one is safe, including aid workers.” The head of the Hamas-run government media office, Ismail al-Thawabta, said the camp was away from recent military action and that the IDF had \"called on citizens and displaced persons to go to these safe zones\". However, the IDF said: \"The strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in al-Mawasi, to which the IDF has encouraged civilians to evacuate.\" French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\" by what had happened. \"These operations must stop,\" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire.\" Hours before Sunday's strike, air raid sirens sounded around Tel Aviv as central Israel came under attack by Hamas rockets, fired from south-eastern Rafah. The eight rockets were mostly intercepted by air defence systems or fell in fields. A house was damaged north of Tel Aviv. The barrage highlighted the threat Hamas still poses to people across Israel, although there were no reports of injuries. It also illustrates the challenges the IDF faces as it moves further into southern Gaza to oust Hamas from what it calls its “last major stronghold”. The military wing of Hamas said it had acted in response to \"the massacre of civilians\". Israeli military operations have continued in Rafah despite a ruling on Friday by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The UN's top court said that “in conformity with its obligations under the Genocide Convention, Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\" Israeli officials said over the weekend that the wording did not rule out all military action. \"Israel has not and will not carry out military operations in the Rafah area that create living conditions that could cause the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population, in whole or in part,\" National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said in a statement. About 1.5 million people had been taking refuge in Rafah before 6 May, when Israel began what it called “targeted” ground operations in eastern areas of the city to destroy the last remaining Hamas battalions and rescue hostages it believes are being held there. The UN estimates that more than 800,000 people have fled in response to orders from the IDF to evacuate to an “expanded humanitarian area” stretching from al-Mawasi, just north-west of Rafah, to the southern city of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage. At least 36,050 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

RM boasts, “I f*ck it u,p” and, at one point, insults someone because “You walk like a duck, b*tch,” but ultimately, the outro finds him softly singing, “I see what I see / I be what I be / I’ll set you free.” “Groin” joins “ ” and “Lost!” as tracks to receive the video treatment.

        "content": "VIENNA — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency’s September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA’s acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.",

The West Lothian side were relegated from the Scottish Premiership this term, finishing rock bottom of the league and dropping straight into the Championship . 3 Martindale is staying put Credit: SNS 3 His side were relegated Credit: SNS 3 But club bosses think he's still the man for them Credit: Kenny Ramsay But Livi chiefs have cited Martindale's \"commitment and dedication\" over a near four-year spell in charge as the reason he's the man to lead them forward. In a join statement from chairman John McIlvogue, CEO John Ward and commercial officer Dave Black, fans were told the news . It read: \"There is no getting away from the fact that this season has been disappointing. Every single member of staff inside the building is hurting with how the year transpired and we know full well that the same disappointment and upset is shared amongst our supporters. \"However, we now have an opportunity to regroup, both on the park and in the stands, but we can only do with everyone pulling in the same direction.

His involvement in the dugout has seen us lift a League One title, win the Premiership play-offs, two top-6 finishes, two seasons just missing out on the top 6 on the final game before the split, a national cup final appearance and a club record 6 consecutive seasons in the top flight . \"As your Board, we believe that David has earned the right to remain as first-team manager and have the opportunity to try to steer us back to the Premiership.\" Martindale has had to deal with restraints to his budget and a court case around the team's ownership. But he has remained loyal to the club which gave him a chance in football after a serving time in prison , despite admitting he could walk away depending on the outcome of the ongoing legal issues.

But the deal has been challenged by a number of previous directors, who maintain they are still the rightful owners. I'm not going into my work relegated, says defiant Livingston boss David Martindale as they're left TEN points adrift The statement added: \"His commitment and dedication to the club over the years is unrivalled and whilst that alone can’t be the sole driver behind remaining in charge, his qualities as a manager, as a coach and as a leader give us full confidence that David is the man we want in charge of this football club going forward. \"We are acutely aware of the budget constraints that David was working under this season. Losses in the previous two years meant that we had to convince club auditors that we could remain viable in the 2023/24 season and the only way to do that was to reduce the clubs budget across all departments. \"Such is the nature of football that everyone has an opinion and some people will have a differing opinion to ours. However, with this decision now made and the hard work continuing off the field, we need our supporters to put this season to bed, understand that as a club it’s been an undoubted disappointment to drop a division, but now start to look to the season ahead and the new challenge we face. \"We believe we have the core of a very good squad and with the addition of further targets that the manager has identified, we will give ourself a real good chance of being right in the mix come the end of next season.\" Livingston will take part in an exciting race for promotion from the second division next season, with the Lions joining the likes of Raith Rovers , Partick Thistle , Airdrie, Falkirk and co. for a place in the top-flight. And the club are embracing the challenge after defying the odds to stay in the top league since 2018. They continued: \"We’re excited at the challenge we face. With that, we’ll have a different pressure on all of us next season but there’s a real, positive energy within the club that we can take this year of adversity and use that to channel a successful promotion push. Having that same, positive energy in the stands from the fanbase can make such a vital difference on match day. We need to get back to that united feeling of “us against the world” which was what got us into the Premiership in the first place.

        "description": "THE Department of Health (DoH) on Monday said it has ordered the Bureau of Quarantine to enhance the screening for arriving passengers, specifically those coming from countries where new Covid-19 variants have been detected.The bureau has placed all its stations and other agencies under \"heightened alert for KP.2 and KP.3 variants,\" said DoH spokesman Assistant Secretary Albert Domingo.The bureau called on all travelers to complete the health questionnaire, which is part of the e-travel declaration mandatory for departing and arriving passengers.Those who are experiencing signs and symptoms of Covid-19 were advised to go on home isolation.\"The general public should take basic health measures such as frequent hand washing, coughing etiquette, avoiding crowded situations and getting in contact with people with flu-like symptoms,\" the bureau said in a memo.The KP.2 and KP.3 variants, more commonly known as \"FLiRT,\" are descendants of JN.1 together with JN.1.18, and are being closely monitored by the World Health Organization.Earlier this month, Singapore said it saw a steep spike in Covid-19 infections, breaching the 25,000 mark for the period of May 5 to 11 alone. Because of this, at-home testing kits for the virus have been selling out in pharmacies across the island-nation.Herbosa last week said the DoH still does not see the need to impose health or border restrictions or recommend mandatory mask-wearing.The health chief instead advised the public, especially those who experience flu-like symptoms, to get tested for Covid-19 \"only when they have access\" and if their respiratory distress last longer than five days.Last week, the DoH said the Philippines remains at low risk for the new variants despite the slight increase in cases observed, with an average of 125 cases reported per day from May 7 to 13, 2024.Infectious disease expert and Philippine College of Physicians President Rontgene Solante said the public need not be alarmed by the new Covid-19 variants as these pose low health risks.These variants only present upper respiratory tract manifestations — slight cough, slight sore throat, phlegm, sometimes body pains — which are mostly mild and self-limiting symptoms.",

        "content": "THE Philippines recorded the highest increase in cyber threats in Southeast Asia for 2023, according to a recent report from global cybersecurity company Kaspersky. According to the cybersecurity giant, the Philippines saw a 243-percent surge in web threats, the fastest growth rate in the region, marking a significant rise from 492,567 incidents in 2022 to 1.69 million incidents in 2023. Singaporean businesses experienced an 86-percent increase in web threats, rising from 889,093 in 2022 to 1.65 million in 2023. Thai companies also saw a notable 24-percent increase, with incidents climbing from 1.23 million to 1.53 million. Despite having the three most frequent attacks in the region, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam had lower web threats in 2023 versus 2022. Indonesia saw 4.96 million attacks last year, a 23-percent drop from 6.42 million. Malaysia also experienced fewer threats versus the year prior at 1.54 million from 1.82 million. Threat actors also slowed down their attacks in Vietnam, whose threats were reduced to 1.95 million from 2.49 million. In total, there were 13.41 million attacks in Southeast Asia last year, almost flat from 13.33 million. According to Yeo Siang Tiong, General Manager for Southeast Asia at Kaspersky, this means that on a daily basis, an average of 36,552 online attacks were launched against businesses in the region last year. Web-based threats, which encompass a range of cybersecurity risks executed via the internet, pose significant dangers to both individuals and organizations. These threats exploit vulnerabilities in end-users, web service developers, and the web services themselves. The consequences can be severe, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. “Economic experts predict positive economic growth for the key countries in Southeast Asia this year. Parallel to this is the continuous growth in these markets’ strong digital economies, which open opportunities for both individuals and companies. As most governments in the region build and boost their policies to foster their digital economy and infrastructure, it is urgent for local businesses to prioritize strengthening their cyber defenses against threats lurking online which can hamper their efforts to harness the benefits digitalization brings about,” Yeo said. According to a PwC study, the increase in cyber threats corresponds with the ongoing digitalization efforts within Southeast Asia, indicating that 28 percent of businesses acknowledged their greater exposure to cyberattacks due to their digital transformation initiatives. Additionally, 16 percent of surveyed companies reported heightened external pressure to disclose cyber incidents and comply with cybersecurity practices. “2024 should be the year for businesses here to take their cybersecurity one step forward. Long gone are the days when a basic firewall and endpoint solutions are enough. With the massive data all types of organizations are handling now and the immense reputational and financial damages an attack can result in, an adaptive and intelligence-led security solutions and services portfolio is the need of the hour,” Yeo added.",

        "content": "The administration had shifted 2,07,060 people to 1,438 safe shelters. Published: May 27, 2024 9:46 PM IST By Edited by An official of the West Bengal government said on Monday, 27 May, that nearly 29,500 houses in 24 blocks and 79 municipal wards, mostly in the south coastal areas of West Bengal, were partially or entirely damaged by Cyclone Remal while 2,140 trees were uprooted and about 1,700 electric poles fell in various parts of the state. According to the early valuation, out of the damaged houses, 27,000 suffered partial damage, while 2,500 were completely destroyed. The state government official cautioned that these figures might change as evaluations are ongoing, with data collection and damage estimation still in progress. “The figures will probably change as the evaluation process is still not complete. Data is being collected from the districts and the estimation of the damage is being calculated,” said the official while talking to news agency PTI. The administration had shifted 2,07,060 people to 1,438 safe shelters, he said, adding that currently there are 77,288 people. “In all, 341 gruel kitchens are being operated at the moment. We have distributed 17,738 tarpaulins to the affected people in the coastal and low-lying areas,” he added. The affected areas included Kakdwip, Namkhana, Sagard Island, Diamond Harbour, Fraserganj, Bakkhali, and Mandarmani. There were minor breaches of embankments due to the cyclone, he said, adding that those were repaired immediately. “No major breach of embankment has been reported so far. All those reported were minor ones and were addressed immediately,” he said. Six persons, one in Kolkata, two women in South 24 Parganas district, one in Panihati in North 24 Parganas district, and a father-son duo in Memari in Purba Medinipur lost their lives due to the cyclone. Coastal regions bore the brunt of cyclone Remal’s fury with significant infrastructural damage reported in both West Bengal and neighbouring Bangladesh, where winds reached speeds of up to 135 km/h. Cyclone Remal made landfall around midnight on Sunday and brought heavy rain in the southern part of West Bengal, including Kolkata. The Kolkata airport suspended flight operations for 21 hours from Sunday noon because of the possible impact of cyclone Remal. The state capital Kolkata received heavy rain and gusty winds. The flight services were resumed at Kolkata airport on Monday after a 21-hour suspension. According to the airport sources, flight operations have begun but it will take some time for the situation to become normal.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "The Geneva Planning and Zoning Commission voted not to recommend approval of a special use permit to allow an 85-foot Verizon cell tower in a strip mall at 1749 S. Randall Road.",
        "content": "After a three-hour public hearing May 23, the Planning and Zoning Commission voted not to recommend a special-use permit to allow an 85-foot Verizon cell tower in a strip mall at 1749 S. Randall Road. Petitioner Doug Dolan of Dolan Realty Advisors and president of DRA Properties, the company that will own the cell site, testified that the tower meets all conditions required for a special use. The tower would be light gray in color, unobtrusive and blending in with its surroundings with all antennas and hardware hidden inside, the real estate appraiser reports showed it would not have an effect on property values and the tower is necessary to prevent a gap in Verizon’s cellphone coverage, Dolan said. Dolan said it was of a 2021 proposal that did not get approval. “Our need with Verizon Wireless is very strong for a cell site here,” Dolan said. “We plan to demonstrate why this site is the best site. ... The proposed use of the specified location is consistent with the comprehensive plan. ... Cell towers are permitted in this [zoning] district if you meet the standards of the special use.” Dolan said Verizon needed the additional tower to fill a coverage gap as the system was almost at capacity. About a dozen residents of the nearby Eagle Brook subdivision challenged the accuracy and integrity of all the documents provided, as well as Dolan’s testimony. The presentation by resident Emily McCafferty, who lives on Eldorado Drive, slammed Verizon’s reports that cell towers do not have a negative impact on property values. McCafferty gave a full-scale PowerPoint that compared sales of homes near a proposed cell tower in Eagle Brook to a subdivision in Wheaton built by the same developer, Keim Custom Homes. In slide after slide, McCafferty narrated a decline in the value of home sale prices impacted by a cell tower. The total projected decline in value for 83 Eagle Brook homes nearest the tower – were the tower to be approved – would be more than $3 million, according to McCafferty’s research. “This is what these residents stand to lose and what the city of Geneva stands to lose to the benefit of Mr. Dolan and the benefit of Verizon,” McCafferty said. “This tower belongs in an industrial or commercial area that is not closely surrounded by residential homes.” Other residents weighed in. Dale Rathunde, who lives on Crystal Tree Court, presented a petition with 136 names of residents who opposed the cell tower. Those residents’ streets connect to Bent Tree – the street in back of where the cell tower is proposed. Rathunde challenged Dolan’s assertion of the need for more cell tower connections, saying cellphone ownership has plateaued since 2021. “He has not shown any evidence of exponential growth that was to occur or soon to occur in the area,” Rathunde said. Rathunde challenged the affidavit from Verizon’s engineer that stated the existing towers were almost at capacity and users would experience dropped calls. “If this was the case, Verizon would be able to show an increase in the dropped call rates over time, especially during busy hours,” Rathunde said. “Without real evidence, the city does not know if the capacity issue was even genuine.” Rathunde said Verizon was pushing this tower close to residential neighborhoods to support its home internet product to get people to ditch cable and switch. Resident Cheryl Reis, who lives on Eldorado Drive, echoed Rathunde’s assertion, citing the 1976 movie “All the President’s Men” and the famous line of “Follow the money.” “Just follow the money to see who benefits,” Reis said. “In our case, with this proposal, if we follow the money, it’s actually quite obvious. Ironically, there is nothing secretive or clandestine about it. The only one who benefits is Mr. Dolan and his real estate company.” Resident Don Manikes, who also lives on Eldorado Drive, challenged the petitioner’s report that a cell tower could improve the property values of homes nearest to it. “As a real estate attorney with 30 years of experience, I can tell you this is not credible,” Manikes said. “No serious person would assert or believe that ... homes closest to the tower will benefit [from] an increase in value from that.” Amanda Driscoll, who is not a resident of Eagle Brook, said she bought a home in Geneva in 2021 during the pandemic. “I can’t tell you how many homes that I passed up because ... when I drove up to the home, there was a massive cell tower,” Driscoll said. “I didn’t even step inside. ... It really matters to new homebuyers.” Dolan responded that the cell tower would “be a significant asset for this area.” Dolan cited the report from the real estate appraiser that cell towers have no impact on property values. “My testimony is as good as anybody else’s,” Dolan said. “The condition that you not be able to see them [cell towers] is an unrealistic condition.” In voting to recommend denial of the application for a special use, commissioners cited McCafferty’s presentation and the lack of specific information from Verizon about its system being almost at capacity. Dolan said company information is proprietary and would be provided to the City Council, but it would have to be kept confidential. “The network is not busted yet,” Dolan said. “Network engineers are patching right now. ... Tactics used to keep the network in peak efficiency, those are failing. So that’s our testimony.” In voting 6-0 to recommend denial, the commission cited the special-use standards that affect property values and neighborhood character. The commission also recommended that before Dolan takes the application before the City Council that he have a signed lease from Verizon for the tower, a structural design plan for the foundation and tower, a review from the National Environmental Policy Act regarding tower siting and construction and information showing the system is at capacity.",

        "description": "Health Department is keen on enabling more government hospitals to perform liver transplants, and has been encouraging them to have tie-ups with well-established hospitals and receive training for the procedure",
        "content": "In a span of 15 months, the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) has performed 11 cadaveric liver transplants. With the deceased donor liver transplantation programme steadily progressing in the State’s largest government hospital, the Health Department is keen on enabling more government hospitals to perform cadaveric liver transplants. Health Secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi said they were encouraging hospitals such as the Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, to perform liver transplants. The Tirunelveli Medical College also has an initial tie-up with a private hospital for the procedure. “We want more and more government medical college hospitals to perform liver transplants so that the poor benefit. We are asking government medical colleges, particularly the departments of surgical gastroenterology and deans, to have tie-ups with well-established hospitals so that cross-learning happens. This way, the experience can be broad-based to other parts of the State and common people will stand to benefit,” he said. It may be recalled that the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital was the first among government hospitals to start performing liver transplants in Tamil Nadu. Cadaveric liver transplants took off at the RGGGH in February 2023. In a nearly 14-hour procedure that started at 6.30 p.m. on Saturday, doctors performed its 11 th liver transplantation in 15 months on a 40-year-old woman who had Wilson’s disease. E. Theranirajan, Dean of RGGGH, said eight cadaveric liver transplants were performed last year and three so far this year. “This time, our team retrieved the liver independently from the donor. As per the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the State government and Rela Hospital (2022 to 2025), our team had undergone training in liver transplantation. We had put in place appropriate infrastructure to take forward liver transplantation in the institution. Our aim is to operate independently, and in the near future, start pancreatic and small intestine transplantations,” he said. RGGGH has recorded 18 donors so far this year, while 26 kidney transplants were also done. K. Prem Kumar, Director In-charge of Institute of Hepatobiliary Sciences, RGGGH, said that training was a continuous process. “Before we started performing transplants, our doctors, staff nurses, and paramedical staff, such as those from microbiology and biochemistry departments, underwent extensive training,” he said. Liver transplants require teamwork and coordination, and this has been put in place at the institute, C. Sugumar, Director, Institute of Surgical Gastroenterology and Liver Transplant, RGGGH, added. “We have the required infrastructure. We have WhatsApp groups with other departments pertaining to liver transplant as well as with the Rela Hospital team. Once an alert on brain death identification comes in, we take up all required measures, including asking the priority list of patients to come in for re-evaluations,” he said. Post-transplant, doctors meet every day to discuss the patient’s condition and treatment protocols. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

        "content": "A crowd of supporters, community members and politicians rallied in North York Monday to denounce hatred and antisemitism after shots were fired at a Jewish girls' elementary school over the weekend. Daniel Held, chief program officer at the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto, denounced the shooting incident at Bais Chaya Mushka school, calling it an attempt to intimidate and isolate Jewish people. \"It was a deliberate attempt to spread fear across our entire Jewish community — to make us cower and hide who we are,\" Held told a crowd of onlookers who had gathered in the rain. \"But as you can see here today, the attackers completely failed. We are more united than ever. We are more committed than ever to support each other. We are more determined than ever to fight antisemitism wherever it happens.\" Toronto police say two suspects fired shots at the school shortly before 5 a.m. Saturday. It's too early to say for sure if the shooting was hate-motivated, according to investigators. But Premier Doug Ford and other politicians have labelled it as an antisemitic act and are condemning it. \"We're not going to ignore the obvious, you know, what occurred here and what the target of the shooting was,\" Toronto police Insp. Paul Krawczyk said at a news conference over the weekend. \"But at the same time, it will be wrong to just guess at this point.\" A crowd gathered outside Bais Chaya Mushka Monday after a shooting over the weekend. (Myriam Eddahia/Radio-Canada) There were no reported injuries, but Krawczyk said the front of the school has been damaged. Several politicians spoke at Monday's rally including Mayor Olivia Chow, who called the shooting a \"despicable, antisemitic act. \"It was a disgusting attempt to intimidate the community, to fill people with fear,\" she said. Chow called those responsible \"cowards,\" and added \"we will find you, you will be held responsible.\" Shots fired at Toronto Jewish girls school, police investigating Ontario Minister of Education Stephen Lecce also spoke, and urged people who aren't Jewish to stand up against incidents of antisemitism. \"We are here with a message, asking Canadians to stand up shoulder to shoulder with the Jewish community in defence of democracy, civility, human rights and the rule of law,\" Lecce said. Rabbi Yaacov Vidal, the school's principal, said the shooting was shocking and thanked police for their dedication to protecting the community. \"Children go to school, and they deserve to be safe,\" he said. \"We live in a democratic country, and everyone deserves to be able to practise their religion in peace.\"",

        "description": "A similar Sunseeker Predator was featured in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\"",
        "content": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ( ) — Two people were rescued just before a $1 million luxury 80-foot sport yacht sank off the coast of Florida Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The incident was reported just after 11:35 a.m. about 3 miles off St. Augustine Beach, a news release from the Coast Guard said. The operator of the Atlantis, an 80-foot sport yacht, said the vessel hit an object in the water and was sinking. The Coast Guard sent out a boat crew to assist and coordinated with St. John’s County Fire and Rescue, which soon arrived and plucked both people from the yacht. The Atlantis yacht appears to be a 1999 or early 2000s model of the Sunseeker Predator 80. A larger Sunseeker Predator was featured in the 2006 James Bond film “Casino Royale.” A 2001 Predator that is 5 feet shorter than Atlantis, which sank Saturday, is listed for sale for $975,000. Sunseeker Predator 80 yacht, built in the United Kingdom, can accommodate up to six guests in four staterooms, with two crew members aboard. Atlantis has two Caterpillar diesel engines and can reach a top speed of 44 kn, or 50 mph, according to data from Boat International. A data sheet about Atlantis says the vessel is in the top 5% by speed in the world. After Saturday’s rescue, a hazard to navigation was broadcast to alert mariners about the yacht, which could cause damage to other vessels, according to the Coast Guard. The owner of the Atlantis will arrange for a salvage of the vessel, the Coast Guard said. The cause of the incident is under investigation.",

        "description": "Moroccan midfielder finished a difficult loan spell on a high with future uncertain",
        "content": "Sport | Football Sofyan Amrabat has indicated that he could yet stay at Manchester United this summer. The Moroccan midfielder has endured a difficult season-long loan spell at Old Trafford from Serie A side Fiorentina, starting only 10 matches in the Premier League and limited to a lot of substitute cameos under Erik ten Hag. However, Amrabat’s influence grew as he showed signs of improvement during the final stages of the season, starting the last three Premier League matches and also Saturday’s surprise 2-1 victory over champions Manchester City in a memorable FA Cup final triumph at Wembley that guaranteed Europa League qualification for next term. The 27-year-old has spent time this season deployed as an emergency left-back during United’s well-documented injury crisis that has seen them without England starter Luke Shaw for large portions of the season. Amrabat’s previous struggles to convince during a season that resulted in an eighth-place Premier League finish - their worst league position for 34 years - had led many to believe that there was very little chance of United exercising their €25million (£21m) option to sign him on a permanent basis this summer, having already spent €10m (£8m) on the initial loan deal. However, his recent resurgence appears to have changed the mind of many fans, while Amrabat - otherwise under contract with back-to-back Europa Conference League finalists Fiorentina until next summer - himself has now admitted that he could still have a future at Old Trafford. \"Do I already know what I’m going to do next year? No. We are going to talk,\" he told Dutch outlet Ziggo Sport. \"Staying is certainly an option. Look, I think it has been a very difficult season. For Manchester United it needs to be much better, and also for me personally.\" Amrabat’s position could yet depend on how United’s managerial situation plays out in the days and weeks ahead. Ten Hag’s Old Trafford future after months of intense speculation is expected to be decided this week during an end-of-season review, with United now said to be considering him potentially staying but having also sounded out the representatives of the likes of Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Frank, Kieran McKenna and Thomas Tuchel amid fresh links to ex-Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi, who appears to have missed out to Leicester’s Enzo Maresca in the race to succeed Pochettino at Chelsea. United have confirmed their first summer deal with the permanent sale of Spanish defender Alvaro Fernandez, who has joined Benfica for £5.1m after the Portuguese giants activated their option to turn his productive half-season loan arrangement at the Estadio da Luz into a full-time transfer. United, with co-owners Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos now in control of football operations, are expected to embark upon a comprehensive overhaul of their squad this summer after their lowest league finish since 1989/90, with the expectation that they are willing to listen to offers for the majority of their first-team squad, bar the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund.

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to get economic sanctions imposed over it's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing it down. This is all under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader and likely won’t change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further to weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Grossi has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The latest IAEA report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. Iran and the IAEA are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The latest report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. The report said that the IAEA’s request needed to be resolved otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

After all, government policy changes can have a profound effect on a company’s future profitability.” ALSO READ: Elections 2024: investors keeping their options open This is not to say that investors should try to predict the future, he says. “There have been a number of elections in recent years which resulted in surprising outcomes and therefore it is best for investors to focus on long-term investments they believe can ride out political storms and news flow.” What are the implications for investing in a time of political change? “Politics can create short term noise. Although the market likes to focus on events like elections, political trends tend to play out over months and years. But if you can withstand the volatility, it is best to sit on your hands and wait for it to pass,” Johanna Kyrklund, group chief Investment officer says. Bank any profits before the election “If you really have to trade, then it may be wise to bank any profits before an election. But investors should always avoid knee jerk reactions when results come out.” Alex Tedder, co-head of equities, says short-term market setbacks, like those created by political uncertainty, can prove very helpful for more patient investors looking to generate returns. “Over the long term, we still feel that this is a bigger determinant of investor returns than trying to respond to political events.” ALSO READ: Multi-Party Charter winning election a long shot, could lead to unrest Alex Monk, portfolio manager for global resource equities, says the US election in November 2024 will be most important for energy transition equities, given the risks to Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) support in a strong Republican win. “Although support to energy transition sectors is unlikely to be removed in its entirety, the leading runners for the Republican nomination have talked about repealing aspects of the policy, making the risk of a reduction in support a credible threat. “Regardless of the ultimate outcome, we would at least expect those names that currently benefit most from the policy to experience volatility as the election looms. Outside of the US, major elections in Taiwan, India, Mexico, South Africa, the UK and Belgium must all be watched.” Politics important for many investors Simon Adler, fund manager for the global value team, says they understand that politics can be an important consideration for many investors. “After all, the political instability in countries in, say, Africa and South America, can be disconcerting, especially when they lead to industrial unrest, strikes in key sectors such as power, the imposition of emergency measures and so on.” He says while Schroders is mindful of the possible impact of political events, it avoids buying into any prevailing opinions or other ‘noise’ that could influence portfolio decisions. “On the global value team, we believe an unemotional, valuation-based approach to investing should deliver over the long-run regardless of politics and indeed we can point to more than 100 years of history that backs this up.“ Duncan Lamont, head of strategic research points out that stock markets often fall in the near-term when geopolitical risk spikes, as markets re-assess risk. “Past performance is not a guide to the future and every situation is different but, historically, they have started to recover strongly within a matter of months. Staying the course rather than reacting rashly has worked out for the best.” ALSO READ: ANC/DA coalition: better politically/economically; risk of unrest higher It is about the destination, not the journey, he says. “We have no way of knowing yet whether Trump will seize power again in the US, or whether we may see various iterations of coalitions in South Africa and what these may look like. More important is the direction of political travel and how it could impact investment prospects either locally or abroad.” Nkosi adds that while the political outlook may be getting more complicated, a resilient long-term investment strategy that can withstand political shocks is likely to help investors navigate what lies ahead. Investors must be careful in election market sentiment Roger Eskinazi, managing partner at Tickmill says traders are advised to take caution amid upcoming elections market sentiment. “As we find ourselves in the thick of election season, traders and investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and avoid making rash decisions based on emotional biases given the uncertainty of the outcome of the national election taking place this week.” He remembers five years ago, South Africa experienced a phenomenon known as “Ramaphoria”, following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s narrow victory. “Initially, domestic equities and the South African rand rallied strongly. However, within just two months, the rand weakened by 8% and banks and insurers saw declines of more than 10% following the administration’s announcement.” Similarly, irrational market behaviour was observed during these significant political events, he says: Nenegate (2015): The dismissal of finance minister Nhlanhla Nene resulted in a temporary rand volatility Zuma unrest (2021): Despite the initial turmoil, the rand remained relatively stable amid the chaos. Eskinazi says recent strength in the rand can be largely attributed to a weaker US dollar and cautious optimism regarding the election outcome. “Market sentiment suggests a possible scenario where the ruling party may lose some ground, but not enough to result in a destabilising coalition. “Should the election result in a favourable outcome, it is likely that the rand will strengthen and banks, insurers and domestically sensitive stocks will outperform.” He says in this sensitive period traders are advised to align their trades with thorough valuation assessments and consider their time horizons and remain aware of exogenous events that could trigger irrational emotional responses.",

        "content": "A TEENAGER charged over a petrol bomb attack at a building in Tallaght, Dublin, which was earmarked for asylum seekers, has been refused bail. A hearing was told that the sole occupant of the building was a female security guard on duty who fled through a back exit when petrol bombs were hurled through a broken window a few metres from her desk. Andy Donohue, 18, of Citywest View, Tallaght , was charged with causing criminal damage on May 21 at St John's House and remanded in custody by Judge Patricia McNamara at Tallaght District Court this morning. The incident happened just after 11pm at the vacant property on High Street in Tallaght, Dublin 24. At the time, the building was being considered to house international protection applicants. Emergency services were called to the scene, and the Dublin Fire Brigade brought the blaze under control a short time later. The youth was arrested on Saturday and held at Tallaght Garda station. Mr Donohue was charged on Sunday afternoon and held pending his appearance before Judge McNamara on Monday morning. Dressed in a grey sweater, blue jeans, and white runners, he spoke to confirm his name and said that he had been shown CCTV footage in Garda custody. Garda Eoin Monahan told Judge McNamara that the youth made no reply when charged. The garda objected to bail due to the seriousness of the charge, which, on conviction, could carry a 10-year sentence and a fine of up to €10,000. A file is to be prepared for the Director of Public Prosecution, and the officer expected further charges. The court heard the current estimate for the damage was €20,000. It was alleged Mr Donohue set fire to St John's house at approximately 11.10 pm on Tuesday, and gardai observed fire coming from the building and damage inside. Garda Monahan said: \"The building security guard was the sole occupant of the building when the incident occurred; she escaped through the back fire exit.\" Outlining the investigation, he said that \"an extensive CCTV trawl was carried out\". He claimed footage from St John's House showed a male whose face was not covered walking down High Street with a backpack. Garda Monahan added: \"He was observed throwing a petrol bomb which was already ignited at the concourse of St John's House. The court heard it \"bounced off\" the front window, and the man in the footage smashed it with a hammer and threw two more petrol bombs inside. The court heard a third petrol bomb was picked up and thrown into the building. The garda maintained there was video evidence of the accused's movements. Officers searched his address on Saturday when the accused was not present. After contacting his mother, he came to the garda station that evening. Runners were seized as evidence. Garda Monahan said it was evident Mr Donohue \"had a clear view on current immigration policy in Ireland\". The judge heard there had been publicity and demonstrations about the intended use of the building, and the petrol bomb attacker was reckless about putting lives at risk and would not have known if there were other people on the premises. The court also heard that adjoining buildings were occupied. But for the prompt actions of the Dublin Fire Brigade, the incident could have had \"serious and tragic consequences\", the court heard. The garda alleged a newspaper article about the incident was on the youth's bed, and the garda believed the teen \"had a certain amount of pride in relation to the damage he caused\". The court heard he had no previous convictions. Footage from inside and outside St John's House was shown during the contested bail hearing. However, the garda agreed with defence counsel Lauren Flanagan that the accused had the presumption of innocence, and the video evidence was open to challenge. The court heard he had surrendered his passport. In exchanges with the defence, the garda said bail conditions would not allay his concerns. The defence barrister proposed that the accused reside at his current address with his family, abide by a curfew, be contactable by phone at all times, not apply for a replacement passport, and sign on five days a week at his local garda station. The barrister asked the judge to note that her client \"has just turned 18\" and that if he were denied bail, he could face two years in custody pending trial, which was a long time for a person his age. She said he did not have a drug problem, history of warrants or prior convictions, and the conditions suggested could address the concerns raised by the garda. Judge McNamara stressed the accused had the presumption of innocence but refused bail and remanded him in custody to appear at Cloverhill District Court on Friday via video link. The teen was accompanied to the proceedings by his mother and another relative. Legal aid was granted.",

        "description": "\"I'm glad court suits are piling up for Cristy Fermin,\" a high school principal-now US-based cousin sent me once.Always abreast with current showbiz news, my cousin is obviously aware of the successive cyber libel cases which the veteran radio anchor-online host is facing these days.In March, Esther Lahbati lodged a complaint against Fermin with the Quezon City Prosecutor's Office.In an interview story, the respondent noted the difference with the way cases are now dealt with. Whereas the parties involved before had to show up at the scheduled time of the hearing, their names are sounded off now.Only then are they allowed inside the courtroom.Fermin clearly described how Mrs. Lahbati looked during their supposedly first ever meet-up. With the aid of a walking stick, Fermin noticed how Sarah's mom has considerably aged. Her recognition of Lahbati was, no doubt, old photo-based.It was at their said meet-up at the court where Fermin lauded how understanding the other party was toward the demands of her work. Fermin reasoned out she could not make it to future hearings due to conflict in her work schedule.That of Lahbati's case up against Fermin — unbeknown to the latter — turned out to be the \"buena mano\" of sorts.Came early part of May, Fermin was slapped with a similar case this time by Bea Alonzo (who also filed a separate complaint versus Ogie Diaz). Alonzo's case is with the Makati Prosecutor's Office.The Kapuso actress' case sent shock waves to Cristy who initially acknowledges the universal truth that it comes with the territory.To prove that libel or cyber libel is part and parcel of the writing profession, Cristy, in the vernacular, likened it to \"parang dila at ngipin 'yan na magkasama (They're like tongue and teeth that go together).\"Despite her grasp of the hazards of her job, Cristy couldn't help but begrudge Bea for the latter's total disregard for all her positive, favorable items she has both written and said about her on radio/online.In particular, Cristy is fiercely harping on Bea's lack of gratitude: \"Magpasalamat man lang muna siya (At the very least, she should be thankful).Not only was Cristy caught by surprise with Bea's legal action. Lolit Solis — who was the actress' indefatigable detractor for the longest time in recent memory — was shocked Bea had spared her.Caught in the legal crossfire, Lolit could only play safe by wishing both parties — Bea and Cristy — iron out their creases. But really, how could Bea have shrugged off Lolit's cruddy articles about her when those were far more pejorative?As we often say, it comes in threes.Cristy faces her third cyber libel case jointly filed by Sharon Cuneta and Kiko Pangilinan, also at a court in Makati City.\"There's so much unfairness,\" the Megastar lamented of her case in support of her affected children Frankie, Miel and Miguel.For her part, Cristy reserved her thoughts about the complaint pending receipt and perusal of the affidavit contents.But as far as Sharon is concerned, it occurs to us that she has reached the tipping point. She confessed to having made amends with Cristy years ago, and how unfortunate they had to end up this way as though their rekindled ties hardly mattered.Having to wrestle with three cyber libel cases simultaneously, do her regular listeners/viewers expect a humbled Cristy, cautious with her language and fair with her opinionated thoughts?On the contrary, she even proudly stated, \"The ones who are charging me (with cybel libel) are leveling up! Sa tingin n'yo, sino kaya ang susunod...si Julia Roberts (Who do you think will come next)?\"Meanwhile, Vice Ganda made an insinuation on \"It's Showtime\" about the netizens' request to likewise prepare charges against a person in anonymity. She told on air, \"Netizens are asking me to do so many things — there's the Asoka challenge, Pipiliin Ko ang Pilipinas, and some want me to file a case!\"Albeit anonymous, netizens were sure about who the TV host was picking on.In yet another news item, US-based Giselle (or simply G) Toengi posted an unsolicited advice to Cristy: \"Retire...it's time!\"The former Viva artist won a good number of netizens to her side, all begging for Cristy bid showbiz her long-overdue goodbye.Before that. Cristy, they insist, has to face the music.For all her vast writing experience — libel suits notwithstanding — Cristy isn't the type who'll take this thought piece lock, stock and barrel, \"You don't court libel or you end up in court.\"",

        "description": "(UPDATE) LONDON — More than 300 million children a year are victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse, according to the first global estimate of the scale of the problem published on Monday.Researchers at the University of Edinburgh found that one in eight of the world's children have been victims of non-consensual taking, sharing and exposure to sexual images and video in the past 12 months.That amounts to about 302 million young people, said the university's Childlight Global Child Safety Institute, which carried out the study.There have been a similar number of cases of solicitation, such as unwanted sexting and requests for sexual acts by adults and other youths, according to the report.Offenses range from so-called sextortion, where predators demand money from victims to keep images private, to the abuse of AI technology to create deepfake videos and pictures.The problem is worldwide, but the research suggests the United States is a particularly high-risk area, with 1 in 9 men there admitting to online offending against children at some point.\"Child abuse material is so prevalent that files are, on average, reported to watchdog and policing organizations once every second,\" said Childlight chief executive Paul Stanfield.\"This is a global health pandemic that has remained hidden for far too long. It occurs in every country, it's growing exponentially, and it requires a global response,\" he added.The report comes after UK police warned last month about criminal gangs in West Africa and Southeast Asia targeting British teenagers in sextortion scams online.Cases — particularly against teenage boys — are soaring worldwide, according to nongovernmental organizations and police.Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) issued an alert to hundreds of thousands of teachers, telling them to be aware of the threat their pupils might face.The scammers often pose as another young person, making contact on social media before moving to encrypted messaging apps and encouraging the victim to share intimate images.They often make their blackmail demands within an hour of making contact and are motivated by extorting as much money as possible rather than sexual gratification, the NCA said.",

        "content": "MASINLOC, Zambales —Zambales fishermen would need bigger boats and modern fishing gear, alongside safe access to traditional fishing grounds like Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal, so that they can compete with well-equipped foreign fishers that venture into the West Philippine Sea (WPS). This was stressed by Governor Hermogenes Ebdane Jr. at the recent public consultation conducted here by the House of Representatives’ Committee on National Defense and Security and the Special Committee on the West Philippine Sea to examine the impact of Chinese incursion into the Scarborough Shoal. Fishermen who attended the dialogue complained of poor catch due to bullying by Chinese militia boats, as well as stiff competition from legitimate fishermen from Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia. They said they have yet to receive assistance from the national government since China took effective control of Bajo de Masinloc. Ebdane, a former Secretary of Defense, pointed out that while the situation at the shoal has socioeconomic, political, and security implications, the welfare of local fishermen is a primary concern. He stressed that while the Philippines has won in the arbitration case over the Scarborough Shoal, the ruling has not been not acknowledged by China, thus rendering it unenforceable. “So, there has to be an alternative to this problem in Bajo de Masinloc,” he said. Ebdane averred that as far as local fishermen are concerned, the Zambales government has short- and long-term programs in place to address their needs, including putting funds for fisherfolk to go into payao fishing, a system that uses fish aggregating devices in open sea. “We’re laying the foundation to ensure development and progress for the next generation of fishers,” he said, adding that the long-term program starts with reorganizing fisherfolk into cooperatives to qualify for financing, followed by training and apprenticeship to ensure they are ready to undertake the project. Ebdane said the provincial government is teaming up with local educational institutions, including the Philippine Merchant Marine Academy, to train the youth in new fishing technologies, as well as fishing boat operations, to provide “a better foundation” for fisherfolks. Citing a recent survey, Ebdane said 65 fishermen’s groups in the province with about 4,500 members can qualify for financial assistance. “They can already get a big fishing boat with P1.5 million, and we can provide that at no interest,” he added. Ebdane said that while access to Bajo de Masinloc is currently a “huge problem” to the government, the state of the local fishing industry is also a major concern. “If our fishermen remain doing marginal fishing, then they become another problem to local governments because we have to dole out food or cash assistance every time they cannot go out to fish,” he added. The recent threat by China to detain “trespassers” in the South China Sea is another concern that must be addressed within the parameters of international law, he added. In Friday’s hearing, Congressman Dan S. Fernandez of the lone district of Sta. Rosa, Laguna observed that the problem of limited access to Scarborough is exacerbated by the use of outdated fishing gears and technology. “We have to evolve,” he said. “If our fishermen would continue to use small traditional boats, they would really be in a dangerous situation.” Ebdane said a fishers’ cooperative in the town of Sta. Cruz would be the first group to avail themselves of the provincial government’s assistance to modernize their fishing boat and equipment. He said fishers’ groups can apply for financial support starting at P5 for fishing implements, including payaos. He added that the provincial government can provide up to P60 million should fishers opt to own and operate bigger boats, depending on their developed expertise and capability.",

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as “vital” in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has “its own large reserves of uranium.” Putin, in turn, vowed to “do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan’s (nuclear energy) market.” If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia’s influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China , where he expressed appreciation for China’s proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "description": "Trinamool Congress to skip event due to final phase of election.",
        "content": "Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has called a meeting of the Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) in Delhi on June 1 to assess their performance in the ongoing elections and chalk out a strategy ahead of the results on June 4. The Trinamool Congress has expressed its inability to attend the meeting due to the last phase of polling. Also read | INDIA and the hurdle of convincing the voter “It is an informal discussion. During the elections, we have not met. We have only been coordinating over the phone. And contrary to everyone’s initial expectations, the INDIA bloc has performed very well across the country. The meeting is to assess our electoral performance and to chart the way ahead,” a top Congress leader said. There is no conversation yet on formulating a common minimum programme, though the INDIA bloc leaders appear optimistic about the poll outcome. The INDIA bloc was constituted in March 2023 in Patna and since then it has suffered multiple setbacks, including losing founding members such as the Janata Dal(U) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal. The allies have also fought against each other in at least three States — the Congress against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab; the Congress against the Left parties in Kerala , and the Trinamool Congress against the Congress-Left combine in West Bengal. The various committees and sub-committees constituted for campaigning and publicity also failed to function during the election. However, the allies believe that they have good coordination particularly in Uttar Pradesh that sends the highest number of MPs to the Lok Sabha. The Trinamool Congress said it will not take part in the meeting as nine seats in West Bengal would be going to the polls on June 1. The party had won all nine seats in 2019. “Nothing much should be read into our absence. We are defending nine seats that vote on June 1. It will be impossible for us to go. And in all INDIA bloc meetings only three of our top leaders have participated, so we can not really depute any junior member,” a Trinamool leader said. The two prominent allies have run a bitter campaign against each other in the election. However, after some strong statements against the Opposition bloc, the Trinamool has softened its stance and insists that while an electoral understanding could not be achieved, the party remains with the INDIA bloc at the national level. Senior Congress leaders said initially they were planning to schedule the meeting on June 2 or 3, but could not do so because of the commitments of various leaders.

        "content": "News | UK The family of a stroke victim have thanked volunteers from a national construction charity who have built him a ground-floor extension so he can sleep in his own bedroom for the first time in more than two years. Keith Parry, 70, has only left his house three times after suffering a severe stroke in late 2021, which left him in hospital for seven months. The joiner, from Gaer, Newport , South Wales , was only able to return home after his wife had a specialist bed and lifting equipment installed in the lounge. But he was left without any privacy or facilities and effectively lived under the stairs in his lounge, prompting the comparison by local healthcare professionals to fantasy character Harry Potter, who had to live in a cupboard under the stairs in the world-famous books. In an emotional handover, Mr Parry’s wife Linda thanked the volunteers from Band of Builders. They built the extension – which includes a bedroom and wet room – as well as all the national and local companies that rallied around by donating everything from materials for the project to food and drinks for the volunteers. “What Band of Builders has done will change our lives forever,” she said. “Our gratitude will never be enough – and from the bottom of our hearts we thank all the volunteers who travelled from far and wide to build the extension with a bedroom and bathroom to give Keith his dignity back. “The work has been of the highest standards and long may Band of Builders continue helping people like us.” The father-of-three suffered a stroke in an upstairs bedroom at his home in late 2021 which robbed him of his speech and mobility. Mr Parry spent seven months in different hospitals in South Wales undergoing rehabilitation. He went home after a hospital bed and lifting equipment were installed in the lounge of their home, where he has slept ever since. Because their house is at the bottom of a steep bank, his family cannot get him out of the house, so he has only left three times in the last two years.

Nearly 50 tradespeople – including plant workers, bricklayers, builders, roofers, plumbers, electricians and decorators – and other Band of Builders supporters volunteered on the three-week project, which was sponsored by Tarmac Blue Circle. Garry Gregory, from Tarmac Blue Circle, added: “We’re extremely proud to once again be supporting Band of Builders with its latest project for Keith. “We hope that this project has brought some comfort to him at this difficult time. “The work the team is doing is extremely important for the industry and we look forward to continuing to make an impact with Band of Builders.” Create a FREE account to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.

        "description": "Gurugram social media influencer arrested for running 'human trafficking network'",
        "content": "Listen to Story Gurugram Police on Monday arrested social media influencer Bobby Kataria for allegedly running an international human trafficking network, officials told India Today TV. Katarai was arrested following a joint raid conducted by Gurugram Police and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) at his residence in Gurugram's Sector-109. During the raids, officials recovered several suspicious documents and a huge stash of cash, officials said. Kataria was arrested following an FIR filed against him by the Gurugram Police which alleged that he and other human traffickers had held over 150 Indians captive, seizing their passports and other documents, and forced them into cyber fraud operations for a Chinese company. The FIR also stated that the victims were also subjected to severe mistreatment. Arun Kumar from Gopalganj, Uttar Pradesh, and Manish Tomar from Dhaulapur, Hapur, filed a complaint with Gurugram Police, alleging that Bobby Kataria advertised overseas job opportunities on his Instagram page. Influenced by the advertisement, they contacted Kataria's team and were called to his office in Sector 109, Gurugram, where they were charged a registration fee of Rs 2,000 and promised jobs in the UAE. In pursuit of their dreams, they ended up paying Rs 3.5 lakh in three installments into Kataria's accounts. The victims reported that they were sent to Vientiane (Laos) on tickets provided by Kataria. Upon arrival, they were met by an associate of Kataria who identified himself as Pakistani and took them to a hotel in Vientiane. The next day, they met another individual named Abhi, who gave them train tickets to Navatuai. On reaching Navatuai, they encountered Ankit Shaukeen and Nitish Sharma, who took them to a Chinese company where their passports were confiscated, and they were held captive and assaulted. The complainants said they were forced into illegal American cyber fraud activities. Desperate and distressed, they eventually escaped and reached the Indian embassy, where they exposed Bobby Kataria and his network. The police and the NIA are probing the case further to nab other accused involved in the human trafficking syndicate. This is not the first time that Bobby Kataria has been arrested. Earlier, he was arrested in a case pertaining to extortion and abusing a woman on social media. In August 2022, a case was lodged against Bobby Kataria in Dehradun after a video of him drinking alcohol in the middle of a road went viral on social media. The Gurugram-based influencer was also arrested in 2022, when he had someone record a video of him smoking a cigarette inside a SpiceJet flight.",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs unveils plan to cut jobs amid global economy fears New Delhi: Leading global financial firm Goldman Sachs has revised its forecast for India’s GDP growth by 10 basis points to 6.7 per cent as it expects the government’s heavy investments in big-ticket infrastructure projects to continue with the huge dividend coming in from the RBI. “Going forward, we expect investment growth momentum to sustain with extra fiscal space for infrastructure spending given a higher than expected dividend transfer by the RBI. As a result, we recently revised our growth forecasts for 2024 slightly higher by 10 bps to 6.7 per cent,” Andrew Tilton, head of emerging markets economic research at Goldman Sachs said in a note. “In India, growth momentum remains strong, and while we think core inflation will bottom out in April-June, we expect it to be around 4.0 - 4.5 per cent in July-December,” the financial company said. However, the RBI’s monetary policy committee members have recently sounded cautious on sticky food inflation and may want to see monsoons progress and the summer crop sowing to assess the food inflation outlook in July-December, before pivoting towards monetary policy easing, the report said. “Taking into account these developments, we push our RBI rate cut call back by one quarter to October-December, with the first cut most likely in the December 2024 meeting,” the report added. The report also came on a day when the IMD confirmed its forecast of above-average monsoon rains this year which are expected to spur production in the agricultural sector that was hit by erratic weather last year.",

        "description": "Saundra Glenn has mobility issues and was struggling to walk into Radio 1’s Big Weekend until Martin pulled up in a car to help.",
        "content": "Saundra Glenn told the PA news agency she was close to giving up and going home after struggling to walk to the accessibility box office at the entrance of the festival, which took place in her hometown Luton this weekend. With osteoarthritis and problems in her hip, knee and ankle, the 64-year-old was resting against a fence when a black Mercedes people carrier pulled up next to her and a woman in the front seat told her she could hop in. “The back door glided back and Chris Martin was in the backseat,” said Ms Glenn, a local community advocate. “I looked at him and said (to the woman in the passenger seat) ‘I can’t get in, that’s Chris Martin’. “He goes: ‘Yes you can, just come on in’.” when in Luton, you sing Orange 🧡 — BBC Radio 1 (@BBCR1) Ms Glenn was then driven into the festival alongside Martin, who talked with her about “all kinds of things” including her work in the local community in Luton. “He said ‘It’s lovely to hear about what you do’,” Ms Glenn said. “I said I’m 65 this summer, he said ‘You don’t look it’ and not to worry about age and just to keep doing what I’m doing. “He seems like a totally decent human being and I told him that... I said ‘You’re just a very nice person’.” Ms Glenn took several selfies with Martin, who even offered her a hint about a secret he had planned for his set that evening. Coldplay played a new song called Orange during their set in tribute to Luton Town FC after a public campaign by fans, so the band played a new song celebrating the local club. “He told me he’s going to do something special at the end – I said ‘Go on are you changing yellow to orange?'” said Ms Glenn. “He said, I can’t tell you that, but I can say, wait ’til the end – I’m doing something special, and that was special.” Martin had to jump out of the vehicle before Ms Glenn, but when he got to his destination he told staff to get into a buggy with her and escort her all the way to her destination at the festival’s accessible area. “They didn’t leave me until I had my wristband on – that’s how dedicated they were,” Ms Glenn said. “I got onto the stage area where you can sit and I saw Chris’s set – it was a fantastic experience last night, it’s the best thing I’ve done in a long, long time.” “He’s shown that kindness rules the world. “Be more Chris Martin – be more that humble guy that doesn’t mind picking up an OAP – albeit a good-looking, young-looking OAP – and giving her a ride to help her out.”",

        "description": "Car seats are essential for ensuring your child is safe when traveling on the road. That's why you need to check three things when installing them.",
        "content": "If you're traveling with your child, a car seat is an essential accessory to have on your next road trip . Many manufacturers offer different child car seats for maximum protection when out on the road. Whether you've used one before or not, there are many safety precautions to be aware of when installing and using your car seat to keep your child secure. Despite there being some unwritten rules of child road safety, such as the widely-used \"Baby on Board\" sign , there are some stricter requirements that have come into place. In 2019, a new legislation was proposed enforcing a mandatory alert system for kids left in cars . Another law is the New Mexico Child Restraint Act, which requires all children under seven or weighing less than 60 pounds to travel in a car seat. While the majority of child car seats share similar safety features, not all of them are built the same. It is important to read the instruction manual for your child car seat carefully as you complete the steps covered in this guide. Here are three important safety measures to take when installing a child car seat. When attaching a child car seat using a seat belt, it's crucial to check your car's seat belt system so that you can lock the seatbelt correctly. Locking the seat belt is crucial to ensure the seat doesn't become loose while you're driving, especially if you're traveling long distances. Here's a general guide to locking a seat belt with a child seat: Different cars have varying seat belt locking systems, with most modern vehicles featuring retractor mechanisms. So, you'll need to consult your vehicle owner's manual if you need further help. Another common mistake is twists in the seatbelt, so make sure to remove any twists for a secure fitting. To test how secure your infant car seat is, try moving the seat back and forth and side to side. The seat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction. A common misconception is that all infant car seats need the same recline angle. However, there are many factors that determine which reclining angle is best for your child, including their age and weight and what model you're using. Firstly, you'll need to check any weight and height restrictions as detailed by the manufacturer of your car seat, as improper measurements will put your child at a greater risk of injury. The next most important thing is correcting the reclining angle. For babies, it is important to ensure the car seat is semi-reclined, not upright or fully reclined. Positioning your car seat upright creates the risk of a baby's head falling forwards, which can restrict airflow. While the best reclining angle typically falls between 30 and 45 degrees, always refer to the manufacturer's instructions to find the most secure angle for your child. Many models come with built-in angle adjusters, and you may also find instructions on changing the angle as your child grows up. While it may seem obvious, many parents fail to set up a fit snug enough for the car seat to be safe. A loose fitting can cause a child to slide around during the course of your driving and can put them at a greater risk of injury in the event of a crash. The harness is the most important safety feature for keeping your child safe. For maximum safety, you shouldn't be able to pinch any extra material at the shoulder level. Another important safety measure is positioning the chest clip, responsible for keeping the child securely in place. The chest clip should be at armpit level and snuggly pressed against your child's chest. Sometimes, you may find it helpful to place blankets or towels in any gaps to minimize movement and provide extra comfort. However, it's critical to position items such as blankets after securing the harness, as doing so before can weaken the fit. You'll also want to avoid extra thick clothing when putting your child in a car seat, as this may also provide a looser harness fitting.",

        "description": "PORT MORESBY — More than 2,000 people have been buried in a Papua New Guinea landslide that destroyed a remote highland village, the government warned Monday as it called for international help in the rescue effort.The once-bustling hillside village in Enga province was almost wiped out when a chunk of Mount Mungalo collapsed in the early hours of Friday morning, smothering scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them.\"The landslide buried more than 2,000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,\" Papua New Guinea's national disaster center said in a letter to the UN, which was obtained by Agence France-Presse.The main highway to the large Porgera gold mine was \"completely blocked,\" it told the UN resident coordinator's office in the capital Port Moresby.\"The situation remains unstable as the landslip continues to shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors alike,\" the disaster center said.The scale of the catastrophe required \"immediate and collaborative actions from all players,\" it said, including the army, and national and regional responders.It called on the UN to inform Papua New Guinea's development partners \"and other international friends\" of the crisis, with relief to be coordinated through the disaster center.Locals and rescue teams have been using shovels and pieces of wood to find bodies under the landslide — a mix of car-sized boulders, uprooted trees and churned-up earth that is thought to be up to eight meters (26 feet) deep.'Serious risk'\"The landmass is still sliding, rocks are falling from the mountain,\" UN migration agency official Serhan Aktoprak told AFP.Streams of water were flowing between the soil and debris while cracks were appearing in land adjacent to the landslip, Aktoprak said.\"This might trigger a further sliding,\" the UN official warned, posing a \"serious risk\" both to rescuers and people living in the area.Locals said the landslip may have been triggered by heavy rains in recent weeks.Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world, and research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could exacerbate the risk of landslides.Aktoprak said his colleagues had to flee falling rocks at the site at the weekend.The estimated death toll has been climbing since the disaster struck as officials reassessed the size of the population lying beneath mud and rubble spanning almost four football fields in length.Five bodies and the leg of a sixth had been pulled from the debris by Saturday night.\"It has been already three days and seven hours since this disaster hit, so basically we are racing against time, but to what extent we might be able to bring people to safety is another issue,\" Aktoprak said.More than 1,000 people have been displaced by the catastrophe, aid agencies have estimated. A school teacher from a neighboring village, Jacob Sowai, said more than 2,000 people lived in the disaster zone.\"Nobody escaped. We don't know who died because records are buried,\" he told AFP.People from adjoining villages were helping to unearth bodies, said Nickson Pakea, president of the nearby Porgera Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Since the start of the year, the country has experienced multiple earthquakes, floods and landslides, stretching the resources of emergency services.",

        "content": "THUNDER BAY – On Sunday, the 20th annual fundraising walk in support of Cystic Fibrosis Canada was held at Half-Way Motors Powersports. “Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic illness affecting children and young adults in Canada,” said Karen Danelisky, coordinator for the 2024 Walk to Make Cystic Fibrosis History. “As it stands now, there is no cure. There are some effective controls that are extending the lives of our patients, but unfortunately it is still a fatal disease,” she said. Danelisky said the reason they hold this event year after year, and raise as much money as they can, is to find a cure for CF, or an effective control that extends a patient’s life to a normal lifespan. She intends to continue with the event and all fundraising opportunities until a cure has been found. The main goal is to live in a world without cystic fibrosis. The annual Walk to Make Cystic Fibrosis History offered music, face painting, popcorn sales, raffles, kid’s games and a barbecue. The police pipe band piped out the participants and they began their walk along the river. In honour of the 20th anniversary of the walk for CF, the local committee set a goal of “$20k for 20 years.” They were approximately two thirds of the way to the goal on Sunday afternoon. “The funds always go to cystic fibrosis research. They fund the clinics that are located in the cities that walks are held,” Danelisky said. “Some of the funds will come back to Thunder Bay to host clinics here for CF patients.” \"We have a lot of new families coming up that are being diagnosed now with the genetic testing at birth. It’s being found faster and the patients are able to be treated quicker,\" she said. “It’s extending their lives,” Danelisky said. Donations to the walk to make cystic fibrosis history will be accepted until August 31. Donate online through their website .",

        "description": "OVER 4,000 megawatts (MW) power generating capacity was shaved off from the Luzon grid, owing to a number of power plants that are on outage and running on derated capacities.",
        "content": "OVER 4,000 megawatts (MW) power generating capacity was shaved off from the Luzon grid, owing to a number of power plants that are on outage and running on derated capacities. On Monday, the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) placed the Luzon grid on red alert from 1pm to 4pm and from 6pm to 10pm. A red alert status is issued when power supply is insufficient to meet consumer demand and the transmission grid’s regulating requirement. From 12noon to 1pm, 5pm to 6pm, and 10pm to 12 midnight, the grid is on yellow alert, which means that the operating margin is insufficient to meet the transmission grid’s contingency requirement. According to the NGCP, Luzon’s available capacity reached 11,810MW as against a peak demand of 11,785MW. The grid operator said three power plants have been on forced outage since 2023, two between January and March 2024, and 15 power plants between April and May 2024; while three are running on derated capacities, for a total of 4,497.3 MW unavailable to the grid. It also cited several factors that contributed to the raising of red and yellow alerts. These include the forced outage of Ilijan (600MW), Pagbilao 1 (382MW) & 3 (420MW), and San Buenaventura Power Ltd. (SBPL) (455MW) due to typhoon Aghon; forced outage of Masinloc 3 (335MW) due to boiler feed water trouble; forced outage of Quezon Power Philippines, Ltd. PPL (460MW) due to broken spring support of turbine combine reheat valve; and deration of Sual 1, Calaca 2, Masinloc 1. The Visayas and Mindanao grids, meanwhile, are in normal condition. The NGCP said it may implement Manual Load Dropping (MLD) in some parts of Batangas to maintain the integrity of the power system. In an online news conference, the Department of Energy (DOE) said 34 power plants are offline, 23 of which are within the grid while 11 are in various off-grid areas. Nine of the 23 plants are on shutdown due to Typhoon Aghon. “Typhoon Aghon has caused a substantial decrease in available power supply in the grid at a time when the hydro power plants have not yet recovered from their low water supply. While the power supply is expected to improve in the coming days, the DOE encourages everyone to conserve energy in order to minimize dispatch of the more expensive oil-based power plants,” the agency said. Based on DOE records, the total capacity on forced outage is 4,281.3MW while deration amounts to 216 MW. Since Typhoon Aghon entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) last May 25, the 1,200 MW Ilijan power plant was on shutdown as its Floating Storage Unit (FSU) had to be disconnected and relocated for safety reasons. Last May 26, Pagbilao Units 1 and 2 with a total capacity of 764 MW and Unit 3 with a capacity of 420 MW went on shutdown due to Typhoon Aghon. Masinloc 3 with a capacity of 335 MW, SBPL with a capacity of 455 MW and Botocan with a capacity of 20.8 MW also went on outage due to the typhoon. In addition, Kalayaan Unit 4 with a capacity of 180 MW tripped on Monday morning. Currently, the Ilijan/Linseed FSU is undergoing berthing and attachment. Securing the berthing and attachment of loading arms will take around two to three hours, after which the regasification will resume. But due to Ilijan’s shutdown, it will have to undergo 14 to 16 hours of cold start before it can resume full normal operations. Meanwhile, restoration work is currently ongoing for the lines to the Pagbilao plants and other affected plants. The Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) of First Gas continues to supply the grid despite the typhoon, the DOE said. Meanwhile, several hydro power plants are derated, having been affected adversely by another natural disaster, the El Niño that brought drought in addition to extreme high temperatures. On various dates throughout April and May 2024, seven hydroelectric power plants with a total capacity of 440 MW went on forced outage due to low water level. In addition, four fossil-fueled power plants with a total capacity of 916 MW have been on forced outage due to technical problems aggravated by extreme heat indices. Four other hydroelectric power plants and two biomass power plants with a total capacity of 34.7 MW have been offline since August 2023 due to insufficient water level and lack of feedstock, respectively. Another 15.8 MW biomass power plant was on forced outage since May 18 due to lack of feedstock. According to DOE Undersecretary Rowena Guevara, red alerts could still be hoisted over the Luzon grid next week if these power plants remain on shutdown or would still fail to deliver their full capacity. “If these plants will not come back on line next week then probably we will have red alerts next week,” the DOE official warned. During red alerts, the operation of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) is suspended. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on Monday afternoon ordered the suspension due to insufficient generation capacity in the grid. Following the suspension, the ERC has directed the Independent Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP) and the NGCP to operate the market. “The operations of the WESM shall remain suspended until issuance of a Notice of Market Resumption by the ERC,” the ERC said,adding that it is closely monitoring developments in the country’s power situation to ensure the reliability and security of the power system, and maintain continuous operations of the generators.",

        "description": "Many people make mistakes when using household chemicals, which creates more problems with home care",
        "content": "Modern cleaning products make it much easier for us to clean and maintain our homes. But only if you use them correctly - mistakes in their use can lead to additional problems. Home care experts have identified the most common mistakes in the use of household chemicals. OBOZ.UA tells about them in more detail. Improper dilution of bleach Chlorine bleach helps to deal with many problems - it not only discolors stains but also disinfects surfaces and kills fungi. However many people overuse it, which jeopardizes its effectiveness and safety. Another common mistake is diluting the product in hot water. To make the bleach as effective as possible and safe for the surfaces and you, it should be diluted with cold water or water at room temperature. Also, be sure to follow the instructions for use. Remember to ventilate the room you are cleaning with chlorine. And always keep in mind that some things should never be cleaned with bleach. Surfaces such as wood, children's toys, and electronic devices can be easily damaged by such treatment. Insufficiently thorough use of cleaning wipes Cleaning wipes are often used incorrectly, especially when it comes to proper disinfection. You simply wipe the surface once and move on if it seems clean enough. However, this quick cleaning means that the surface dries out before the disinfectant has had a chance to work. Using such wipes requires a certain amount of contact time with the surface to kill germs and bacteria. So be sure to check the instructions. Too much laundry detergent The rule \"more is better\" does not apply to the use of laundry detergent. On the contrary, it leads to undesirable results when caring for clothes. If you go overboard with the detergent, too much foam will be created. This can impair the washing machine's ability to effectively wash and rinse clothes. Excessive detergent can also leave stubborn marks on the fabric and make the textiles stiff. Moreover, the doses recommended on the package may be slightly excessive - manufacturers do this to make you buy more. Try using about three quarters of the recommended dose. You will notice that the effectiveness of the product does not decrease. Use all-purpose cleaners for everything All-purpose cleaners are marketed as a kind of panacea that will take care of your entire home. Many people use it to clean everything from countertops to plumbing fixtures. However, such liquids and gels are not really suitable for some tasks. They're good for removing physical dirt, such as food stains, small debris, and grease marks. But universal products can't cope with disinfection. And even more so with mold. They can also leave stains on the glass. And for plumbing, you should choose something more powerful to remove soap scum, lime traces, and bacteria. Excessive use of glass cleaners Many people make the mistake of using too much glass cleaner, pouring it over windows and mirrors in the hope of achieving a dazzling shine. However, this only leads to stains and smudges. Therefore, before you start cleaning glass surfaces, read the instructions for the product - do not exceed the dosage and give preference to microfiber cloths for wiping the surface, because they will polish it well and will not leave behind lint. Cross-contamination with sponges Using one sponge to clean everything in the house is a huge mistake. This approach can be a real danger. After all, different bacteria live on the surface of the countertop and in the toilet bowl, which are better not to mix with each other. And the sponge has the ability to collect bacterial contamination and transfer it to another place if you do not take care of it properly. That's why experts advise using different sponges for different areas of the house and cleaning them thoroughly on a regular basis. Once or twice a week, wash them in the dishwasher or put the soaked tools in the microwave for one minute. It is also important to dry the sponges thoroughly between uses and to replace them in time. Using water on wooden surfaces Often considered the easiest and most natural cleaning agent, water can cause major problems when used to care for natural wood. Excessive water can penetrate the pores of the wood, causing it to swell and eventually warp, leading to damage and costly repairs. All wood surfaces, including floors, should be cleaned with damp, not wet, cloths. Never allow puddles to form. And don't forget to apply protective agents, such as rubbing with oil. Improper use of plumbing cleaners Bathroom gels, powders, and liquids often require some time to work. And many people start rubbing the surfaces with them immediately after applying them. To correct this mistake, it is important to follow the instructions for use. Apply the product, distribute it evenly, and leave it on for the time recommended by the instructions on the package. Only then do the cleaning. And always rinse off the residue thoroughly. Overuse of furniture polish We rely on this product to get rid of dust. But too much of it can do more harm than good. Yes, perhaps a large amount of polish will give the surfaces a glossy shine. But it will be ineffective, and the furniture will form a sticky layer that will attract more dirt and dust. To avoid this, buy a microfiber dust cloth - it will clean surfaces better. And apply polish on it, not directly to the surface.

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico's southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions that were imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and likely won’t change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The IAEA report comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have also carried out direct strikes on each other’s territories for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the International Atomic Energy Agency's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "It’s not uncommon for 20-somethings to win the Iron Horse Bicycle Classic. Just look at names like Kira Payer and Riley Amos. Saturday’s road race winners – Lauren Aggeler and Cobe Freeburn – are no strangers to those who pay attention to Durango cycling either, but their top spots on the podium are capstones of both their Iron Horse careers so far. Both riders have been training and racing with the Durango Devo program from childhood, with Freeburn going on to race numerous disciplines with the Fort Lewis College Cycling team. In 2022, Aggeler won two collegiate mountain bike national titles for Northern Arizona University on home courses at Purgatory Resort. Both riders have earned impressive results, but winning the Iron Horse puts them in special company of Durango cycling royalty. Sepp Kuss won in 2017, just before he broke through into the professional ranks of the World Tour. Sarah Sturm’s 2019 victory took place just before the FLC alumnae was making inroads in the endurance off-road cycling scene. Kuss and Sturm are now household names, and Aggeler and Freeburn are not far behind. Aggeler circles globe on World Cup circuit When 20-year-old Aggeler isn’t in Durango, she’s competing around the globe in the mountain bike World Cup, the world’s most prestigious mountain bike series. After spending time on both the Bear National Team and Durango’s Segment 28, Aggeler signed to Trinity Racing in 2023. The U.K.-based team has both road and mountain bike squads and has graduated riders into the very top ranks of the sport. At the World Cup, Aggeler competes in the Under-23 category, designed for young riders to prepare for the elite category. She began her season this year in Puerto Rico, earning a trio of fifth-place finishes across four races. Then the World Cup series began with a duo of races in Brazil, where Aggeler’s best result was 18th place in a short track race. After placing ninth in the Continental Championships in Utah, Aggeler claimed second place at a national-level elite race in Wisconsin – not a bad spring campaign to warm up for the Iron Horse. Aggeler plans to head to Europe to rejoin the World Cup in a couple of weeks. Freeburn shows off-road prowess The 22-year-old Freeburn earned top results in his junior and collegiate career with FLC Cycling. Last year, his top result was a fifth place at the U.S. Pro Cup race in Arkansas, and he also completed three World Cup races in Europe Later in the year, he raced the inaugural Gravel National Championships and also placed 17th in Trinidad, Colorado’s The Rad Dirt Fest gravel race. Once again racing for Bear National Team, Freeburn’s 2024 calendar has included additional gravel races, a discipline that has risen in popularity domestically and abroad in recent years. Earlier this year, he placed eighth at the well-known Belgian Waffle Ride’s Utah stop and then rode to a career-best second place at a UCI Gravel World Series race in Arkansas. One doesn’t have to look far down the results sheet to identify additional young talent. Third-place Michaela Thompson (age 21) also won Sunday’s gravel race and this year is competing in the invite-only Life Time Grand Prix series. Third place in the men’s road race went to 17-year-old Emmett McManus of Segment 28 who won his first-ever UCI-level race in Utah last week. Durango can’t wait to see what else these athletes get up to this summer.",

        "content": "Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "description": "Ruto presided over signing of Sh27bn Last Mile Connectivity Project contract on Monday",
        "content": "An additional 280,000 households in 32 counties are set to be connected to the national grid following the signing of a new Sh27 billion Last Mile Connectivity Project contract. President William Ruto said this will add to the 9.6 million Kenyan households that are already connected to electric power with a national access rate well mor than 75 per cent. He said the government has the commitment of Sh2.5 billion to the new phase of connectivity while French Development Agency (FDA), the European Union and the European Investment Bank (EIB) will foot the remainder of the cost. “I wish to express profound appreciation to our development partners for their consistent support throughout the course of this initiative and, in particular, to the FDA, EU and EIB for their support of this part of our plan,” Ruto said. He spoke on Monday during the signing of the contract at State House, Nairobi. “By standing with us in this initiative, our development partners have made an indelible contribution to Kenya's economic transformation and inclusivity. Thank you very much,” added the President. He said that with the new development, Kenya is now well on course to achieving 100 per cent connectivity by 2030 where every Kenyan household, regardless of location, will enjoy reliable and affordable power. “As I speak, we are working on a similar connectivity programme worth Sh22 billion in partnership with the AfD and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to connect more than 270,000 customers,” he said. The President said the Last Mile Connectivity Project has enabled businesses in rural areas to flourish since its inception in 2013. He noted that power connectivity is a vital priority because electricity is the lifeblood of modern economies and has immensely contributed to Kenya’s GDP and created numerous job opportunities. Reliable electricity supply, he noted, is a crucial enabler which complements other commitments of supporting small businesses by enabling them to operate efficiently and expand their reach. Ruto added that power connectivity has also revolutionized the agricultural sector by powering irrigation systems and agro-processing units, thereby boosting productivity and ensuring food security. “By connecting millions of households to the power grid, we have not only illuminated homes but also empowered communities, enhanced educational opportunities, improved healthcare services and turned the entire country into one flourishing economic hub,” the President said. He said the signing of the new contract is an immense milestone that puts Kenya on an upward trajectory towards a brighter and more prosperous future for her people. Ruto said by extending the electricity grid to rural and underserved areas, the Last Mile Connectivity Project has not only bridged the development gap between urban and rural communities, but it has also effectively raised the overall rate of national productivity across sectors by facilitating the uptake of efficient technologies. “In the beginning, this vision was not just seen as bold and ambitious, it was also considered to be too audacious to be impossible. But it has become possible due to a resolute commitment to deliver consistent investment of resources and determination,” the President said.",

The lawsuit alleges that Bombardier, then-CEO Alain Bellemare and then-chief financial officer John Di Bert failed to make timely disclosures of key facts around the company's financial forecast. Filed in Quebec Superior Court by shareholder Denis Gauthier in 2019, the class action concerns investors who bought company stock between Aug. 2 and Nov. 8, 2018. In the months leading up to Nov. 8, the Montreal-based company said it was on track to achieve financial goals linked to its restructuring. Analysis How once mighty Bombardier became politically toxic in Quebec But in its third-quarter results in November 2018, Bombardier announced it would cut 5,000 jobs and sell off two units, and reported free cash flow that sat \"well below\" expectations of breaking even without falling back on proceeds from a recent factory sale, according to one analyst at the time. Stock at Bombardier tumbled 23 per cent on that November day in 2018. Bombardier, which has since reinvented itself as a pure-play business jet manufacturer, says it may appeal the authorization by the court, which has not yet heard or ruled on the allegations.",

The Woodstock Fire/Rescue District responded to the 11200 block of Charles Road about 2 a.m., finding a car that had rolled over with one person trapped inside, two others who appeared to have been ejected and a fourth person who was able to get out of the vehicle, the district said in a news release. Firefighters extricated the occupant within four minutes and requested four different medical helicopters, but each declined because of the severe weather, according to the release. The occupants were instead taken to local hospitals with conditions ranging from serious to critical, officials said.

        "content": "A moving tribute was paid to a teenage boy a year after he died at a Welsh music festival. Schoolboy Rhys Murray from Port Talbot died at the In It Together festival in Margam following an asthma attack in May 2023. In an emotional interview following his death the 16-year-old Ysgol Cwm Brombil pupil was described by his older brother Thomas as being a \"wonderful boy and a ball of charisma\". Speaking to WalesOnline last year he said: \"Rhys was my absolute world, he was my rock and everything someone could mean to someone. \"He was absolutely adored and worshipped by his family. He absolutely loved musical theatre and performing on stage. He was very big into his drama and music in general. He loved his boxing too.\" READ MORE: The unusual reason you might have a headache or joint pain right now READ MORE: Furious families protest outside prison after deaths One year on from the tragedy Rhys was honoured in an emotional tribute during the festival. It came as organisers teamed up with charity Asthma + Lung UK Cymru in Rhys' memory and to help educate people about the condition. For the latest Neath Port Talbot news, sign up to our newsletter here The event - where the likes of Sugababes, Dizzee Rascal, Sam Ryder and Craig David performed over the weekend - saw crowds stop what they were doing to pay their respects in a \"lovely moment\". A festivalgoer told WalesOnline: \"At around 8pm on Sunday a series of photos of the young lad played on the screen on the main Parc Stage while the host led everyone in a one minute round of applause in his memory. Everyone stopped what they were doing and took a moment to pay respect and applaud. It was a lovely moment.\" Posters were also placed around this year's festival to show what steps should be taken when someone has an asthma attack, including when to call 999. A video where a specialist nurse explained what to do was shown on the main stage screen. According to Asthma + Lung UK Cymru you should follow the following steps if you think you are experiencing an asthma attack:",

        "content": "The Ilorin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC on Wednesday, May 22, 2024 arraigned two persons for offences bordering on possession of solid minerals without lawful authority. They are Nura Lawal and Tunde Jimoh. The defendants were arraigned on one-count charge before Justice Uche Agomoh of the Federal High Court sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State. While Lawal was the driver of a truck allegedly conveying about 30 tons of assorted , Jimoh was the escort of the truck. Their journey to the dock started when the Ilorin Command of the EFCC received intelligence about the activities of some people who were engaged in mining of solid minerals within Kwara and transporting same outside for commercial purposes without lawful authority. The Commission swung into action and eventually arrested the two defendants on February 4, 2024 in Ogbomosho area of Oyo State. The charge against the defendants reads: “That you, Nura Lawal and Tunde Jimoh sometime in February 2024 within the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court, without lawful authority were found in possession of minerals conveyed in a truck with plate number T3815LA contrary to, and punishable under Section 1 (8) (b) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act Cap M17, 1983” Lawal pleaded guilty to the charge read in English Language and interpreted to him in Hausa Language, while Jimoh pleaded not guilty to the charge. Following the pleas by the defendants, counsel to the EFCC, Mustapha Kaigama, urged the court to fix a date for review facts in the case of Lawal that pleaded guilty and trial in the case of the second defendant (Jimoh) that pleaded not guilty to the charge. There was no objection to the prosecution’s prayer by Lawal’s counsel, C. I Ipinsokan. However, Jimoh’s counsel, Michael Adetayo urged the court to fix an early date to enable him move the bail application of his client, while praying the court to allow the defendant to continue on the administrative bail earlier granted him by the Commission. Justice Agomoh after listening to the parties, refused the prayer by Jimoh’s counsel, saying, “the proper place to keep an inmate under the law is the Nigerian Correctional Centre.” He also said, “the court cannot give a date to hear and determine a bail application that is yet to be filed before it.” The judge thereafter ordered that the defendants be remanded at Nigerian Correctional Centre, Agodi, Ibadan and adjourned till June 5, 2024 for review of facts in Lawal’s case and trial in the case of Jimoh.",

        "content": "Tis Hazari court on Monday dismissed the bail application of Bibhav Kumar, who is the former aide of the Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal bail application. He has been arrested in the Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal assault case. He is to be produced before the court tomorrow after the expiry of 4 days of judicial custody. Additional Sessions Judge Sushil Anuj Tyagi dismissed the bail application after hearing submissions by senior advocate N Hariharan for the accused, additional public prosecutor Atul Srivastava and advocate Madhav Khurana, counsel for Swati Maliwal. The court had reserved the order on the day after hearing lengthy arguments on the bail plea of Bibhav Kumar, accused in the Swati Maliwal assault case. Swati Maliwal, who was presented in the hearing, opposed the bail plea saying she was receiving threats. She broke down in tears during the hearing. At the outset, Delhi Police opposed the bail application by saying that it was not filed in an appropriate court. Senior advocate N Hariharan submitted that this bail application is maintainable. This is the right court that has jurisdiction to hear the bail application. In this FIR section 308 IPC has been invoked which is triable by the sessions court. Advocate Hariharan argued that the complainant went to CM’s residence and called PA Bibhav Kumar. PA Bibhav Kumar was not present at the CM’s house, after which she headed towards the CM’s residence without any permission or prior appointment. “Can anyone enter in this manner, this is the official residence of CM,” Senior Advocate Hariharan argued. “There was a trespass and a report was also filed. She had no appointment for a meeting, and there was no message of her arrival,” he further argued. He further submitted that she was stopped by the security staff after which she asked them “You will make an MP wait,” the senior Advocate referred to the report. “Maliwal sat in the waiting room and asked security to talk to Bibhav Kumar,” the senior defence counsel said. Senior counsel argued, “What she is stating in the FIR, that is not true.” “This FIR is not the result of contemporaneous complaint. FIR was lodged after three days,” the senior Advocate argued. “Kindly look at the place where the alleged incident took place where many people were present. How can such an incident take place at this place,” N Hariharan submitted. “There are many hospitals in the area, but she was taken to AIIMS for medical. There is no grievous injury on the vital part, so where is the question of Culpable homicide not amounting to murder,” the Advocate argued. Defence counsel N Hariharan further argued that the injuries can be self-inflicted. “The allegations do not make out a case of intention to disrobe her,” the senior Advocate argued. At this point, Swati Maliwal broke down in tears when the defence counsel was arguing. “This entire FIR is the result of afterthought. I am seeking bail only, not the acquittal,” the senior advocate argued. He submitted that CCTV footage has already been recovered, so there is no question of tampering. “My (Bibhav) availability to police investigation is from the very beginning, he argued, adding that everything was pre-planned and tailor-made to suit her story,” Advocate Hariharan argued. Senior Advocate further submitted that it was an overreach by the prosecution preventing this court from passing an order on anticipatory bail. “They informed about the arrest when the court was dictating the order, he added. He has been in custody since May 18,” the senior Advocate concluded his arguments. Additional Public Prosecutor(APP) Atul Srivastava opposed the bail application and submitted that intention is not required to make out a case of Culpable homicide not amounting to murder, knowledge is sufficient. “The accused had beaten a lady, alone dragged her and her head hit the centre table, will this not cause death,” APP argued. “If I slap a lady in an open place, it is outraging the modesty of a woman,” the APP argued. Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the submissions of defence counsel that she went there with a premeditated mind to malign Bibhav Kumar. Her reputation was kept in high esteem by the party chief and was called Lady Singham, the APP submitted. “The accused was terminated from his post. The accused did not tell the complainant that I was not in service and couldn’t arrange the meeting with the CM. It shows the intention on the part of the accused,” APP submitted. APP submitted that there was no occasion earlier when she was asked to take a prior appointment. “Why did the security officer not make a call to PCR,” APP argued. “She was allowed to sit in the waiting room. It was implied permission, where is the question of trespass, APP submitted. When Bibhav Kumar reached there, he asked who allowed her to go inside,” he added. “All the people at the place of occurrence were reporting to Bibhav Kumar. It shows that he is influential. He can tamper with the evidence,” APP argued. Section 308 (Culpable Homicide not amounting to murder) IPC is made out against the accused, the APP submitted. He added that the complainant was taken to AIIMS as she was residing at CR Park, APP argued. “She was not maligning the accused,” he added. On the point of delay in FIR, the APP submitted that the complainant did not disclose the entire incident to the police. Even thereafter, a police officer visited the place of the incident. “In India, women are very reluctant to report the sexual offences,” APP argued. The CCTV footage may be missing due to some technical reasons, the APP submitted. The court asked, “Why are the police looking into the phone of the accused? APP said that there may be some crucial evidence. iPhone was handed over after formatting, it is tampering, the APP submitted. “The accused went to Mumbai to format his phone. He admitted that he had formatted his phone and the password was not given. We may ask for further police custody. I strongly opposed the bail application,” APP submitted. Senior Advocate N Hariharan opposed and said the counsel for the complainant couldn’t address the court. The court Advocate Madhav Khurana argued and he referred to judgement whether he can address the court or not. He submitted that the victim has the right to be heard. The bail application can’t be heard without issuing a notice to the victim, Khurana argued. Swati Maliwal was also standing with her counsel before the judge. He submitted that Maliwal said that she was going inside and, you could call the police. But the police were not called. As per the MLC, the injuries were there even after four days, which shows the magnitude, Khurana argued. Three-four days delay is inconsequential in these cases, her Advocate added. The accused sent a complaint through email on May 17, Advocate Khurana submitted. “The accused was found at the place of occurrence, he was interrogated but was evasive in answering,” Advocate Khurana said. He also submitted that the accused allegedly assaulted a public servant earlier. “If the accused is innocent, then why format his phone, tempered the CCTV, and file a complaint on May 17,” Advocate Khurana said. “The complainant is receiving rape and murder threats. The triple test was not satisfied in this case advocate,” Khurana argued. Swati Maliwal also addressed the court. She said after recording her statement, AAP leaders organised a press conference. “I was called a BJP agent”. “They have a huge troll machinery, they have pumped the machinery, she said while adding that the accused was taken to Mumbai and Lucknow by the leaders of the party. “If this accused is released on bail there would be a threat to me and my family,” Maliwal told the court. She said that the accused is not an ordinary man, he is getting the facilities used by the ministers, Maliwal said. Senior Advocate M Hariharan rebutted and submitted that there are no ingredients to make out the offence of Culpable homicide not amounting to murder",

        "content": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News: ACTICOR BIOTECH (FR0014005OJ5 - ALACT), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing glenzocimab, an innovative drug for the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies, today discloses the total number of voting rights and shares as of April 30, 2024 (pursuant to Article L. 233-8 II of the French Commercial Code and Article 223-16 of the General Regulation of the French Financial Markets Authority). Listing Place: Euronext Growth Paris ISIN Code : FR0014005OJ5 Web site: acticor-biotech.com Date Number of shares making up the share capital Theoretical number of voting rights (1) Number of voting rights excluding shares stripped of voting rights (2) April 30, 2024 15.755.227 15.755.227 15.510.598 (1) In accordance with Article 223-111 of the AMF's General Regulation, this number of shares is calculated based on all shares carrying the right to vote, including those stripped of voting rights. (2) The actual voting rights correspond to the total number of voting rights that can be exercised in a general meeting. They are calculated on the basis of the total number of voting rights attached to the total number of shares minus the shares without voting rights. About ACTICOR BIOTECH Acticor Biotech is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing glenzocimab, an innovative drug for the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies, particularly ischemic stroke. The positive results of the phase 1b/2a study, ACTIMIS, published in January 2024 in the Lancet Neurology (link to publication) confirmed the safety profile of glenzocimab and showed a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group of stroke patients. A post-hoc analysis of brain imaging at 0 and 24 hours using artificial intelligence confirmed these results, showing a reduction in the number and volume of intracerebral lesions in patients treated with glenzocimab. On April 25, 2024, the company announced the initial results of the international phase 2/3 ACTISAVE study in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, which showed no efficacy of glenzocimab on the primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with severe disability or death (mRS 4-6) 90 days after stroke, nor on the secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients returning to life without disability (mRS 0-2). On May 15, 2024, Prof. Mikael KÃ¶hrmann (Principal Investigator of ACTISAVE) presented the main results of the study at the opening session of the European Stroke Organization Conference (ESOC), confirming the neutrality of the study on the primary and secondary endpoints, and showing trends in return to normal life (mRS 0-1), notably in sub-populations of patients with complete recanalization after mechanical thrombectomy. Glenzocimab is being evaluated in 2 other clinical trials initiated by academic teams: GREEN: a phase 2/3 study in the treatment of stroke in thrombectomized patients, with a futility analysis after inclusion of the first 78 patients (30% of patients) expected in Q4 2024; LIBERATE: a Phase 2b LIBERATE trial in the treatment of myocardial infarction, with final results expected in Q4 2025. Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici, Karista, Go Capital, Newton Biocapital, CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited, A&B (HK) Limited, Anaxago, and the Armesa Foundation) and has been listed on Euronext Growth Paris since November 2021 (ISIN: FR0014005OJ5 - ALACT).

        "content": "The Texas cheerleader stripped of her valedictorian title over a ‘miscalculation’ got a private graduation ceremony from her family, who shared pics of the happy occasion with The Post and as they all remain positive about her future. In March, Maya Veliz was officially announced as north Texas’ Blue Ridge High School valedictorian. However, she was quickly stripped of the title after the school said they’d made an error involving transfer credits from another school, dropping her grade point average (GPA) to make her third in her class. Given the situation, Veliz’s family decided to throw her a private graduation ceremony Thursday, separate to the school’s celebration, where she delivered the speech she had planned as valedictorian. “It was great. She gave her speech,” her father Jorge Veliz told The Post. “An anonymous viewer of our local news [who also featured Maya’s story] paid for her first year at University of Texas.” In her planned speech, which the family previously shared with The Post, Maya shared how “honored” she was to be named valedictorian. “Failure has made me who I am today and to have found success and persevere regardless of the outcome,” the speech read. “I stand here before you tonight, Honored as the valedictorian for the class of 2024,” the draft of Maya’s speech began. Veliz’s family had received a phone call from the school’s principal, Trent Hamilton, in April about the miscalculation with the GPA and transfer credits. Maya transferred from a school in Frisco, Texas, in 2022 when she was a junior. However, some of the classes offered at the school in Frisco weren’t at Blue Ridge High School and not weighed under the transfer policy. “She feels sad, she feels left out. They’ve always had her be part of any kind of event at school. They had her give a speech during last year’s graduation,” Jorge told The Post at the time. The school district did admit to the miscalculations but said it investigated the issue as a “private student matter” which was then “communicated with the parents,” and they wouldn’t change their position. “The district reviews academic achievement, grade calculations, and class rank during this time period each year in accordance with applicable state law and board policies EIC and EIC Local,” a Blue Ridge ISD spokesperson said to WFAA. “Miscalculations were originally made when finalizing GPA and Class Rank; then corrected to ensure compliance with both of those board policies.” Veliz was a member of the school’s cheerleading team. She was also recognized by the College Board National Hispanic Recognition Program for her academic achievements. The school said it plans to take measures to prevent such an error from being made in the future. “Any further specific student information cannot be discussed pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act,” the school said.",

Talking about the so-called \"China economic recession theory,\" he said China's economy remains dynamic, and the Chinese government and people are fully prepared for changes in the external environment and can make corresponding adjustments in a timely manner.In the face of a complex international environment, Asean should strengthen unity and provide a reliable Asian solution by formulating appropriate economic policies, giving full play to its economic advantages, and promoting trade and investment, Anwar said.\"It is crucial to promote Asean unity and strengthen Asean's overall economic strength,\" he added.The prime minister also said Malaysia will assume the Asean chairmanship in 2025, and its policy focus will be to enhance economic cooperation among member states and attract more investment and trade cooperation opportunities.",

Juan Miguel Zubiri as Senate chief, made the remark on Monday when asked what his leadership style will be.\"I don't know. I just want to focus on the Senate as an institution. I have no dreams or ambitions of running for higher office as one would usually say or think,\" Escudero said in a television interview.\"We ran for vice president [in 2022] and [I] lost. That's enough for me,\" Escudero said.He added, \"I guess I will be focused on the Senate, the institution, the employees, [and] the officials to be able to perform [efficiently].\"Meanwhile, Escudero said it is unfair to link Malacañang to Zubiri's ouster amid insinuations that the Palace got irked by the continuing Senate probe into alleged \"leaked\" Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency documents that linked then-senator and now President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to drug use.\"That's an unfair accusation not only to me but also to Senator Bato (Ronald dela Rosa). In fact Senator Bato was emotional because he was made to understand that the reason why there was going to be a leadership change was because of him and because of the hearings,\" Escudero said. \"That's unfair because nobody ever accused Senator Zubiri of being a Palace lackey. That he was chosen by the Palace to be our Senate president.\"Escudero revealed that Sen. Bong Revilla was \"the first [who] actually expressed support\" for the plot to oust Zubiri.Revilla reportedly got offended when Zubiri denied his request to attend the Senate session online because he underwent foot surgery.But Zubiri explained that under the rules, senators are only allowed to attend sessions through teleconferencing if they were suffering from highly communicable diseases such as Covid.Sen. Nancy Binay, who supported Zubiri, ridiculed the notion that the Senate leadership would change over a foot.Despite the uneasy situation caused by Zubiri's ouster, Escudero said he saw himself as a consensus builder.\"As much as possible I would like to build consensus instead of dictating. At the end of the day we are a democracy. And I see myself as just one of the 24 [senators]. I'm not even considering myself as primus inter pares, someone above equals,\" Escudero said.",

        "content": "Angela Levin discusses Harry and Meghan in Nigeria Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were warned that their \"faux royal tours\" abroad could \"deepen\" the ongoing rift with the Royal Family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was described by many as a \"successful\" three-day trip to Nigeria earlier this month to promote mental health for soldiers and empower young people. And they also hinted that there could be more tours on the horizon after Harry told PEOPLE that it's \"hugely important for us to meet directly with people, supporting our causes and listening, in order to bring about solutions, support and positive change.\" But now a PR expert has claimed trips of this nature could have an impact on the Montecito couple's already strained relationship with the Royal Family. PR specialist Lynn Carratt from Press Box PR told the Mirror : \"These faux-royal tours could deepen their rift with the Royal Family, if not handled correctly.

She explained: \"I don’t believe the Nigerian tour helped to increase their popularity in the UK and USA, but it did showcase to the African nations the work that the couple can do and will certainly have increased their popularity there.\" Meanwhile, sources claimed last week Harry and Meghan could be eyeing up Ghana for their next tour.

        "content": "High Street Essentials (HSE), the parent company of women’s fashion brands Indya and FabAlley, said it had raised ₹50 crore in equity and debt infusion. The funding round was led by Sangita Jindal, Chairperson of JSW Foundation with participation from family offices of SRF Group, Krishna Bodanapu of Cyient Technologies and Timmy Sarna from Pure Home + Living. This fund infusion will enable Indya to undertake business expansion of its premium occasion wear range “Weddings By Indya” and chart a growth roadmap in the occasion and wedding wear market, the company said. Sangita Jindal, Chairperson of JSW Foundation said, “ Indya’s core strength lies in their unique designs that cater to the Indian as well as global diaspora. Shivani & Anurag have built strong back-end capabilities and this investment will empower them to fuel Indya’s global expansion while allowing them to take a larger share of the vast Indian wedding wear market.” To capitalise on the growing wedding wear segment, Indya has plans to expand its business presence across the country with 10 new wedding stores in this financial year. It currently retails through 12 exclusive brand outlets in 8 cities, and 150 large format retail outlets. However, the company’s largest volumes come from its international direct-to-consumer ecommerce business spanning more than 43 countries. With over 1.5 million customers globally, this business segment has posted a 50% year-on-year growth, the company said. Shivani Poddar and Anurag Murali, co-founders of HSE in a statement said, “ We see an immense opportunity to build a strong presence for Wedding By Indya in the $15 billion wedding wear market, a large part of which is still unorganised.” Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

Evander scored the winner in the 79th minute with assists from Mora and Jonathan Rodríguez. Evander's goal was his sixth of the season. Rodríguez's assist was his third this season to go along with five goals, making the Timbers the only team to have three players with at least five netters.

To protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration: 1. Lightning safety plan: 2. Indoors safety measures: 3. Wait for the all-clear: When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety. Rain can turn roads into hazards.
