        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Catch up on the French Open with a guide that tells you everything you need to know about what happened at the clay-court Grand Slam tennis tournament, how to watch it, what the betting odds are, what the schedule is and more: Who is Playing on Monday? The match getting by far the most attention — Rafael Nadal vs. Alexander Zverev — will be third in Court Philippe Chatrier. That means it should start at around 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT; 9:30 a.m. EDT). That will be preceded by No. 8 Ons Jabeur against Sachia Vickery, which starts play in the main stadium at noon (1000 GMT; 6 a.m. EDT), and the second match there, with Iga Swiatek against Leolia Jeanjean. Another match that could generate interest will be Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who is coming off a hip injury, against Chris Eubanks, a big-serving American who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year. That starts the day in Court Suzanne Lenglen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT; 5 a.m. EDT). What Happened on Sunday? Two-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz pronounced his recently injured forearm “fully recovered,” even if it still is “feeling weird,” after overwhelming J.J. Wolf 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. “It's still in my mind, but I didn’t feel anything after the match ... which is really, really good for me.” Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka won a match at a major for the first time in more than two years by defeating Lucia Bronzetti 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to advance to what could be a second-round showdown against Swiatek. Other players moving into the second round included Caroline Garcia of France, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, No. 30 Dayana Yastremska and Donna Vekic in the women's draw, and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men's. No. 17 seed Ugo Humbert was eliminated by Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. There was a brief rain shower in the afternoon, which delayed action on several courts but allowed for the first use of the new retractable roof at Court Suzanne Lenglen. How to Watch the French Open on TV — In the U.S.: Tennis Channel, NBC, Peacock. — Other countries are listed here . Betting Guide Nadal is usually favored to win the championship at the French Open — he has 14, after all — but BetMGM Sportsbook has him as the underdog in the first round against No. 4 seed Zverev on Monday. Zverev is a -350 money-line favorite against Nadal, who is listed at +260 for that match. Nadal is just 7-4 this year and missed nearly all of last year while dealing with injuries; that is why he is unseeded and so could have been drawn to face anyone to begin the tournament. Zverev was a semifinalist in Paris each of the past three years and is coming off a clay-court title at the Italian Open this month. Swiatek is a big favorite to win the title (-155), so it makes sense that she is listed at -10000 against Jeanjean, who has +1600 money-line odds for their match.

        "content": "Stormy Daniels revealed she has received death threats (Image: MySpace) President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels, the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal, the Daily Mirror has revealed. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. READ MORE: Trump snaps back at booing crowd as he's branded 'worst president in history' [LATEST] Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar’, ‘slut’, ‘gold digger’. This time around, it’s different. “It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat’.” The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump (Image: GETTY) “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time in the UK tonight [TUES] on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” She adds that that is a ‘direct threat’. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again”. Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” Stormy premieres Tuesday, May 28, Channel 5, 10pm and is also available to stream on My5.

        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

        "content": "Indian tennis star Sania Mirza, who is considered as a role model and source of inspiration by many for her talent and accomplishments, has redefined the role of women in the society. Though the women all over the world have outgrown the societal barriers and done wonders by their work in various fields, society in the South Asian countries still see females in limited roles. The 37-year-old sportswoman, who has seen the epitome of success and fame owing to her skills and brilliance as a professional tennis player, believes that the women are not just about beauty or their knack in the kitchen. Being a mother and a celebrity all at the same time, Sania is of the view that women are much more than what society wants them to be. “Women are not just supposed to look pretty and cook. They are more than that,” she told leading Indian magazine Famina in a recent interview. The quote was shared by the journal on their official Instagram and reshared by Sania on her Instagram stories. It may be noted that the Indian tennis ace is mother to six-year-old Izhaan Mirza Malik. Despite having taken retirement from professional tennis, Sania is widely followed for her charismatic personality and sparkling career.",

        "description": "Former South African President Jacob Zuma is the wild card in Wednesday’s election for Africa’s most advanced country. He leads a new political party that's draining support from the ruling African National Congress that he once said would rule until...",
        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "description": "Scott Watter, a staffer in McMaster's psychology, neuroscience and behaviour department, has been 'removed' due to a 'breach of trust,' the Ontario university has said.",
        "content": "A McMaster University professor in Hamilton, Ont., acquitted of sexual assault in 2022, has lost his job with the post secondary institution. Scott Watter, who taught in the psychology, neuroscience and behaviour (PNB) department, has been “removed” from the university’s faculty, according to two McMaster executives. The institution’s president David Farrar and board chair Jane Allen in a joint statement insisted that Watter “abused” his position as a faculty member and that his conduct and pattern of behavior involving multiple students was a “breach of trust.” Farrar and Allen explained the board’s executive and governance committee decided on dismissal after receiving a recommendation from a three-member senate committee determining “there was adequate cause for his removal.” “That committee found Dr. Watter’s conduct to be unethical, inappropriate and in some instances exploitative,” the joint statement said. Story continues below advertisement “In engaging in sexual relations with a number of students, one of whom was in a vulnerable position and relying on him for support, the Hearing Committee found that Dr. Watter abused the responsibilities and authority of his position as a faculty member.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. Watter was charged by Hamilton police in June 2020 after a woman came forward with accusations of sexual assault and sexual assault causing bodily harm. The university would then reveal its own probe a month later after receiving more complaints and subsequent suspension of several faculty members, including Watter.

Watter, then-46-years-old, appeared in front of a justice in August 2021 and registered a not-guilty plea. The accuser, a former student never identified due to a publication ban, took the stand in the 2022 judge-only trial and insisted she was repeatedly assaulted without consent over several months in 2017. In December 2022, Justice Amanda Camara acquitted Watter saying the Crown failed to prove that he misused his position to persuade the student’s consent. She also rejected the accuser’s testimony saying inconsistencies in her story never proved there wasn’t consent to sexual activity. Story continues below advertisement McMaster’s executive and governance committee revealed that Watters did object to “the process and procedures” of their “removal proceedings” in mid-May. “The approach taken by the Hearing Committee was not procedurally fair, and resulted in a flawed conclusion based on a hearing that lacked the foundation of adequate particulars,” council for Watters said in a complaint. The hearing committee dismissed the submission insisting there was no proof of any “procedural error.” Related News McMaster University prof accused of sexual assault pleads ‘not guilty’",

        "content": "Valeri Fridman, 60, of Dimona, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Sderot on October 7. Valeri was one of 13 people taking part in an organized trip for older Israelis, mostly immigrants from the former Soviet Union, to the Dead Sea that morning, when their minibus got a flat tire near Sderot and stopped next to a bus stop in the city to try and fix it. While the group was standing there, rocket sirens rang out, and the bus stop bomb shelter — which was supposed to automatically open during a siren — remained electronically locked. Moments later, a pick-up truck of terrorists drove by and shot dead all 13 travelers. Only the driver emerged alive. Images of the group of pensioners lying dead at the bus stop were among the first to circulate on the morning of the Hamas onslaught, shocking Israelis and the world with the brutality of the assault. Valeri was buried in Dimona on October 12. He is survived by his three sons, Gadi, Alon and Steve, and two grandchildren. The Dimona municipality said he worked in a factory in Sderot. Family and friends remembered Valeri as a devoted fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv and a dedicated family man, who came to Israel 30 years ago from the former Soviet Union to establish a life in Israel. A family friend, Galit Glikin, eulogized Valeri on Facebook as “the person with the most golden heart. My father’s closest friend, and an uncle to us from a young age when I still lived in Dimona. A beloved man, with a huge heart.” Steve, Valeri’s son, visited the site where his father and so many others were gunned down, a month after the attack, and told Channel 12 news that the family “still haven’t accepted that this happened — we feel that Dad is coming home any minute.” Valeri’s son, Alon, told Ynet that his father was looking forward to the day trip to the Dead Sea, “to disconnect a little bit from work.” “Dad was probably the funniest person ever,” said Alon. “He got along with everyone and he had a big heart, we never saw him argue or fight with anyone, or say ‘no’ to anybody who asked him for anything. He was a special guy, he was always there for his grandchildren and for everyone.” Read more Those We Have Lost stories here.",

        "content": "Georgie Palmer reacts to being kicked off flight over daughter's nut allergy A BBC weather presenter whose family was kicked off a flight has said the ordeal was \"humiliating\". Georgie Palmer, 49, her husband Nick Sollom, 48, and daughters Rosie, 12, and Annie, 14, were ordered off the plane after they told the crew Rosie was allergic to peanuts. Staff on the flight from Gatwick Airport to Dalaman in Turkey refused to make an announcement to tell passengers not to eat peanuts, according to Ms Palmer. The forecaster said she gently asked fellow passengers sitting around her not to eat peanuts and to pass the message on. But Ms Palmer claimed the \"angry\" captain of the jet insisted they get off the plane before it would take off. She told Good Morning Britain the experience was \"absolutely humiliating\" for her daughter. Ms Palmer added: \"When he (the captain) found out I had spoken to the other passengers he was screaming at me from the cockpit. He was so angry.

It is really beautiful how every passenger on that plane was so wonderful, but nobody working on that plane showed one ounce of compassion.\" Ms Palmer added: \"Rosie is in a terrible state about this. It has ruined her holiday. We don't go away all the time. We maybe fly once a year and have never had problems with other airlines. \"If we had known that policy, we would never have booked with them. We have been through the website with a fine-tooth comb and there is nothing.\" She said there was no way to inform the airline beforehand and wondered how many people with peanut allergies would fly on SunExpress this summer not knowing the policy.

Read our Privacy Policy Ms Palmer said even if her daughter didn't come into direct contact with a peanut, if someone ate one on board, then she could die. The presenter said three days after what happened the family still hadn't heard from SunExpress and the family's insurance says the captain has the discretion to remove people for no reason. A spokesman for SunExpress said: \"We take the safety of our passengers very seriously. Shortly after boarding our flight from London Gatwick, the passenger raised a concern about one of his family group having a serious peanut allergy and requested an announcement to other passengers. \"We refrain from making these kinds of announcements as, like many other airlines, we cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment on our flights, nor prevent other passengers from bringing food items containing allergens on board.\" The spokesman said due to the \"insistent behaviour\" of the passenger to others on board that they should not consume nuts, the captain decided it would be safest if the family did not travel on the flight. Trending The family was told to get off the plane at London Gatwick (Image: Getty) He added: \"When this was explained to the passenger, he did exhibit aggressive behaviour towards our crew members and tried to gain access to the cockpit. \"To ensure the safety of our crew and our passengers on board, we cannot tolerate aggressive and unruly behaviour on our flights. \"Additionally, our website states passengers must notify us 48 hours in advance of any special care required due to a medical condition and no such notification was received from the passengers in this instance.\" The spokesman said the airline is fully aware this was an upsetting situation for the family and is taking the incident as an opportunity to conduct a review of the information provided during the booking process to ensure \"more effective solutions\" for passengers with allergies. Mr Sollom denied behaving aggressively, but admitted to feeling irked by the decision. He said he knocked on the cockpit door in a bid to speak to the captain after being told the family's bags were being removed from the plane.

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: An international team of scientists from Finland, Canada, the US, and New Zealand has discovered a specific brain network hub that plays a key role in stuttering, an advance that can lead to new treatment options. The research, published in the Brain journal, examines two different types of stuttering — developmental and acquired. While both types are traditionally known to be separate, the study showed that besides “similarities at the behavioural level, there are also similarities at the neural level”. “Stuttering affects approximately 1 per cent of adults and can result in significant communication problems and social anxiety, yet the cause of stuttering is still unknown,” said lead author Catherine Theys, Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. The professor said that while stuttering is a developmental disorder, it can also be caused by focal brain damage after a stroke or other neurological conditions. For the study, the team used two datasets and lesion network mapping to test whether lesions causing acquired stuttering map to a common brain network. They also used a third dataset to test whether this lesion-based network was relevant to developmental stuttering. Analysing each dataset, the team located a common stuttering network — a specific part of the left putamen, which is responsible for lip and face movements and timing and sequencing of speech. They also identified two additional areas of interest for speech imaging and stuttering research — the claustrum and amygdalostriatal transition area. “These are tiny areas of the brain — only a few mm wide — which is why they may typically not have been identified in previous studies. This shows a plausible network for stuttering,” they said, adding that the findings have relevance for treatment.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair.

        "content": "In her May 27 , Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili called for “full mobilization” of Georgians living abroad for the October parliamentary elections, a crucial vote that she recently dubbed a “referendum” on the country’s future. “Our future is in your hands, your vote will be very important, and I am waiting for you in Georgia or in the country where you live to show us, to tell us what kind of future you want for Georgia,” Zurabishvili told “over a million” of Georgian emigrants. According to the President, her address comes on a “Diaspora Day” which, contrary to custom and for reasons unknown to her, was not marked this year. Referring to the vision for the upcoming elections [Georgian Charter] that during the Independence Day celebrations on May 26, the President said that the diaspora is of “great importance” in the “plan.” “When the [foreign policy] course, the orientation, the future of our country is at stake: will it be a European country in close, tight relations with our partners or an isolated, some kind of Neo-Russian country – your role and your involvement in this decision is very important,” Zurabishvili said. Over the past few months, the President, along with opposition parties and civil society organizations, for a more active engagement of the diaspora in the October elections, where the votes of Georgians living abroad could be decisive. However, calls for the Georgian government to do more to facilitate the exercise of voting rights for Georgian emigres have largely gone unanswered.",

        "description": "Police say spectacles found near military barracks hours after soldier snatched them during tour of first premier's desert abode; pilferer interrogated, put on remandThe post Ben-Gurion’s stolen glasses returned to Sde Boker museum appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "Glasses belonging to David Ben-Gurion were returned on Sunday to the founding prime minister’s hut-turned-commemorative museum in the southern kibbutz of Sde Boker, after a soldier stole them during a tour of the site, police said. The spectacles, which hold “historical and national significance,” were found near a military barracks in southern Israel, where the soldier who filched them had apparently tucked them away, police said in a statement. The soldier was put on remand after police investigated him, according to the statement. Gil Schneider, the museum’s manager, told Kan public radio that a staff member had alerted her Sunday morning that the glasses were missing. “First we had to check, maybe someone took them for treatment, because the items here are treated individually,” said Schneider of the museum’s copious collection, which includes Ben-Gurion’s 5,000-book library. Perusing hours of security camera footage, Schneider said, she discovered that a person in uniform — apparently a soldier — had seized a moment when his tour guide was not looking to cross the ropes cordoning off the exhibit and slip the glasses into his pocket. Soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces are often made to participate in “Culture Sunday” trips, during which they are taken to national landmarks before returning to their bases after weekends at home. It was unclear whether Ben-Gurion’s glasses were pilfered during such a tour. The museum lodged an online complaint to the police, which the Dimona police station responded to within less than an hour, Schneider said. Later that evening, police informed her that the glasses had been located, and would be returned the following day. Ben-Gurion, who as head of the Jewish Agency assumed the office of prime minister after proclaiming the founding of Israel in 1948, moved with his wife Paula to the Negev Desert’s Kibbuz Sde Boker after resigning the premiership five years later (he returned in 1955 for another eight-year stint). In moving south, the founding father famously called on Israel to “make the desert bloom” and tap into the unrealized potential of the Negev, which made up about two-thirds of the new state’s territory. Upon his death in 1973, Ben-Gurion’s hut was turned into a museum in his memory. Sde Boker also houses the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, which develop methods for food production in arid areas, and are affiliated with the Beersheba university that carries Ben-Gurion’s name.",

        "content": "Canada announced on Monday that it will grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for relatives of Canadian living in the war-torn Palestinian enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the Canadian immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. “While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,” Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister had previously said that leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program’s efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, he added. There was no immediate comment from Israel or Egypt regarding Canada’s announcement. A spokesperson for Miller said 448 Gazans had been issued a temporary visa, including 254 under a public policy, and that 41 have arrived in Canada so far. The temporary visas are valid for three years after entering the country, according to the Canadian government website. The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas’s October 7 massacre, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 252 hostages, mostly civilians, amid acts of brutality and sexual assault. Vowing to destroy Hamas’s military and governance capabilities in Gaza and bring the hostages home, Israel launched a wide-scale operation in the Strip which is ongoing. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 35,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though only some 24,000 fatalities have been identified at hospitals. The tolls, which cannot be verified, include some 15,000 terror operatives Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. An estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza’s population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. A total of 288 IDF soldiers have been killed during the ground offensive against Hamas and during operations along the Gaza border, as well as a acivilian Defense Ministry contractor.",

        "content": ": A realtor from the city was found murdered in Bidar on Saturday. The body of Madhu was found a deserted spot next to a closed dhaba on the national highway. CCTV footage showed four persons abandoning the body at the spot. Karnataka police said it appeared that Madhu had been attacked by broken beer bottles and a rock. No complaint has been lodged with the Jeedimetla police yet, officials said. Sub-inspector D. Shailaja of the Mannaekhalli police in Karnataka told Deccan Chronicle: “We have received a call on Saturday morning about an unidentified body.” She said that preliminary investigation based on the statements of Madhu’s family members indicated that the murder could be the result of previous enmity. “CCTV footage from the area showed four persons abandoning his body in a deserted place. It shows that they might have murdered him somewhere else,” Shailaja said. According to reliable sources, on Friday afternoon Madhu's friend Renuka Prasad and two others, Nikith and P. Gopi, took Madhu from his house. Madhu informed his family members that he was going to Bidar with them for some work. Later that night, he called again to say he was on his way back home. On Saturday morning, the police informed the family about Madhu's murder. They immediately rushed to the scene. Investigations are underway to ascertain motive behind the murder, the police said.",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: India is urgently in need of stem cell donors to fight blood cancer that kills over 70,000 lives every year, said experts on Monday ahead of World Blood Cancer Day. World Blood Cancer Day is observed every year on May 28 to raise awareness about deadly cancer and other blood disorders, such as thalassemia and aplastic anaemia, which affect more than a lakh people in the country, Although conventional methods like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, a blood stem cell transplant is the only hope for survival for many blood cancer patients. The health experts noted that every 5 minutes, someone in India gets diagnosed with blood cancer. Yet, the country faces a severe shortage of blood stem cell donors. “Besides being the thalassemia capital of the world, India also has a high prevalence of blood cancers. Stem cell transplants are often the only curative option for these conditions, but finding a compatible stem cell match is difficult, especially in a country as genetically diverse as India,” Dr Rahul Bhargava, Principal Director & Chief BMT, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, told IANS. “In India, someone is diagnosed with blood cancer or a severe blood disorder every five minutes. Despite the global registry having over 41 million donors, India has only about 0.6 million registered. Thousands of patients are in dire need of matching stem cell donors to undergo life-saving transplants,” added Patrick Paul, CEO of DKMS BMST Foundation India — a non-profit.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "DALLAS — A year ago, Anthony Edwards sat silently at his locker after Minnesota went down 3-0 to Denver in the first-round series and stared into the mirror before eventually getting up and walking out without saying a word. Two days later, he scored 34 points on the strength of five three-pointers to lead the Timberwolves to a Game 4 victory over the Nuggets. The win, the only victory of last year’s playoffs for Minnesota, had meaning to Edwards. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t ever want to say I got swept in my career,” he said. Mike Conley sat at his locker after Minnesota’s dramatic Game 7 victory in Denver in the Western Conference semifinals, and was asked, “What’s next?” Conley secured his first career playoff sweep in Round 1 against Phoenix. He notched his first Game 7 victory in Denver. Surely, there was another box to check on the horizon. The veteran point guard’s answer: “Win a conference finals game.” ADVERTISEMENT Conley’s goals are certainly higher than that; the 36-year-old point guard yearns to win an NBA championship before he hangs up his sneakers. But it’s well documented by now that this is Conley’s second conference finals appearance – and first since 2013. And his team in 2013, the Memphis Grizzlies, was swept by San Antonio that season. An identical exit would likely cut a little deeper 11 years later. No NBA team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7 series in 154 tries — and both the Wolves and Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals find themselves in such a hole. So no, it’s not likely Minnesota will reel off four straight victories to reach the franchise’s first NBA Finals. Though, hey, who knows? But just nabbing a win Tuesday in Game 4 would mean something. It would mean no sweep of Edwards. It would mean another small career achievement for Conley. It would also mean Minnesota gets to fight another day. ADVERTISEMENT That’s the Wolves’ plan. “I just told them to keep fighting. We fight. We’ve been fighting all series, and we’re not going to stop fighting,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “We’ll look at it, we’ll build it back up and we’ll be ready to go on Tuesday, and see what happens from there.” It’s true, the Wolves have been resilient all year. Whenever a player went down, another stepped up. When a deficit grew, the Wolves responded and rallied. Lest we forget the defending NBA champions led Minnesota by 20 points on their home court in the second half of a Game 7, and the Wolves still won. ADVERTISEMENT Perhaps the team that has routinely set new franchise marks will achieve an NBA first, as well. One thing is for sure: If the Wolves go down, it will be swinging. “If (there’s) a team that can do it, I think it’s us. We’re built to do that,” Wolves forward Naz Reid said. “Everybody still got their heads up. You don’t want to go down 0-3, but it’s part of life. We’re not going to hang our head about it. We’re going to go out there and fix it.” It’s worth a try. ADVERTISEMENT “We ain’t got nothing else to do,” Edwards said. “We can’t do nothing but be positive at this point. We can’t be negative. Just try to get it one win at a time.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "DALLAS — A year ago, Anthony Edwards sat silently at his locker after Minnesota went down 3-0 to Denver in the first-round series and stared into the mirror before eventually getting up and walking out without saying a word. Two days later, he scored 34 points on the strength of five three-pointers to lead the Timberwolves to a Game 4 victory over the Nuggets. The win, the only victory of last year’s playoffs for Minnesota, had meaning to Edwards. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t ever want to say I got swept in my career,” he said. Mike Conley sat at his locker after Minnesota’s dramatic Game 7 victory in Denver in the Western Conference semifinals, and was asked, “What’s next?” Conley secured his first career playoff sweep in Round 1 against Phoenix. He notched his first Game 7 victory in Denver. Surely, there was another box to check on the horizon. The veteran point guard’s answer: “Win a conference finals game.” ADVERTISEMENT Conley’s goals are certainly higher than that; the 36-year-old point guard yearns to win an NBA championship before he hangs up his sneakers. But it’s well documented by now that this is Conley’s second conference finals appearance – and first since 2013. And his team in 2013, the Memphis Grizzlies, was swept by San Antonio that season. An identical exit would likely cut a little deeper 11 years later. No NBA team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7 series in 154 tries — and both the Wolves and Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals find themselves in such a hole. So no, it’s not likely Minnesota will reel off four straight victories to reach the franchise’s first NBA Finals. Though, hey, who knows? But just nabbing a win Tuesday in Game 4 would mean something. It would mean no sweep of Edwards. It would mean another small career achievement for Conley. It would also mean Minnesota gets to fight another day. ADVERTISEMENT That’s the Wolves’ plan. “I just told them to keep fighting. We fight. We’ve been fighting all series, and we’re not going to stop fighting,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “We’ll look at it, we’ll build it back up and we’ll be ready to go on Tuesday, and see what happens from there.” It’s true, the Wolves have been resilient all year. Whenever a player went down, another stepped up. When a deficit grew, the Wolves responded and rallied. Lest we forget the defending NBA champions led Minnesota by 20 points on their home court in the second half of a Game 7, and the Wolves still won. ADVERTISEMENT Perhaps the team that has routinely set new franchise marks will achieve an NBA first, as well. One thing is for sure: If the Wolves go down, it will be swinging. “If (there’s) a team that can do it, I think it’s us. We’re built to do that,” Wolves forward Naz Reid said. “Everybody still got their heads up. You don’t want to go down 0-3, but it’s part of life. We’re not going to hang our head about it. We’re going to go out there and fix it.” It’s worth a try. ADVERTISEMENT “We ain’t got nothing else to do,” Edwards said. “We can’t do nothing but be positive at this point. We can’t be negative. Just try to get it one win at a time.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "description": "Could it be?!",
        "content": "Ever since the Society was cruelly canceled after the first season, fans have been crying out for it to somehow return – and our hopes could possibly get answered soon. The beloved series premiered on Netflix in May, 2019, and followed teenagers who were displaced from their hometown while on a school trip – and thrown into an identical version, without any adult supervision. They were forced to take things into their own hands and created their own community, but things quickly got out of hand and spiraled into a Lord of the Flies-style situation with an almighty cliffhanger. Viewers watched in their droves, with TV bosses initially renewing the program for a second season, but it was eventually canceled due to the global pandemic , leading to huge backlash. Five years on, fans’ calls for more episodes have not quietened , with creator Christopher Keyser touched by the huge response – teasing that those behind the camera are always trying to come up with ways to move the story on. In fact, we were almost close to getting new episodes in the form of a graphic novel before the publishing company went bust. ‘This wasn’t a normal cancellation. This wasn’t about not having the audience or we didn’t believe in it anymore. There was a global crisis that changed all of our lives in the one year we were able to make it,’ he insisted to Variety . ‘I have consistent conversations with a bunch of the writers and Marc Webb [executive producer] about how we might bring this back in some way. We don’t have an answer yet, and I wouldn’t count on it, but I don’t do that with every show that gets canceled. ‘The audience still wants to talk about it. They are still moved by it and want answers to the questions and then new questions are posed. I just don’t know whether the world is going to work in a way that aligns for us, but we’ll keep trying for a while because it’s gotten under my skin as well.’ Kathryn Newton, Gideon Adlon, Olivia DeJonge, Toby Wallace and Jacques Colimon led the cast of youngsters as they desperately tried to understand their plight, and how their lives had changed in the blink of an eye. The first series ended on a huge cliffhanger as viewers learned that the parents of the teens were still alive and well back in ‘normality’, and believed that their children had somehow died. We also had questions about where the school buses transporting the students actually went after vanishing in thin air, and whether the two timelines would ever merge again. Netflix bosses announced the decision to cancel The Society – as well as I Am Not Okay With This – in August, 2020, in the middle of the globall Covid-19 pandemic. ‘We’ve made the difficult decision not to move forward with second seasons of The Society and I Am Not Okay With This,’ they said at the time. ‘We’re disappointed to have to make these decisions due to circumstances created by Covid, and we are grateful to these creators, including: Jonathan Entwistle, Christy Hall, Shawn Levy, Dan Levine, Dan Cohen and Josh Barry at 21 Laps Entertainment for I Am Not Okay With This; Chris Keyser, Marc Webb and Pavlina Hatoupis for The Society; and all the writers, casts and crews who worked tirelessly to make these shows for our members around the world.’ Remaining coy about what could happen next – in case their plans for a revival or a graphic novel ever come to fruition, Christopher vowed that they had the storylines already mapped out. ‘It really feels like this thing that we loved and were ready for was taken away more than anything I’ve ever done,’ he added. ‘That’s true for the writers and Marc Webb, with whom I made the show. There’s a sense that it stopped in mid-animation, but we knew a lot of what was going to happen on the other side. ‘There’s also the emotional thing going on with the audience reaching out to us and consistently saying, “Tell me what happened. When is it coming back?” It was particularly poignant for us since we were closer than I think most shows get to being ready to go again.’ Right on cue, fans began dissecting his comments on social media, begging Netflix to pick up more episodes once again for some much-needed ‘closure’. Taking to Twitter, Elise begged: ‘Bring the entire cast back and continue on, we as a society will ignore the fact they’ve aged.’ Ashley agreed: ‘OH MY GOD?! please I’m begging, I’ve literally never wanted a show to return more than The Society. I need closure!!!’ ‘We were robbed,’ Kathy fumed. ‘This show was renewed then cancelled when it should have been placed on delay. We deserve another season.’ Sam and Nia share marriage update after cheating admissions in Ashley Madison documentary Outraged Netflix subscribers threaten to cancel their memberships ahead of huge change Controversial Netflix series had 'worst TV ending in history' The top critically acclaimed films you didn't realise were on Netflix now Nowwhyami_innit pleaded: ‘Even if it’s one more season FINE! Just tell us wtf happened in that town.’ As Kat Pettibone added: ‘When I say I would sell my soul for this! It would be my biggest win.’ Honestly, hard same. What I Own: My partner and I bought our own home before we were 30 — through a loophole I pay £395 a month to live in an underground doomsday bunker 'Magical' town with two castles named best place to live in the South West What I Rent: 'I pay £1,925 for a one bed flat but it revived my social life after divorce' Someone is literally renting out their garden shed – for £1,300 per month The Society is available to stream on Netflix now.

        "content": "In today's DNA, Zee News' Saurabh Raaj Jain, analysed the final round of the 'battle of bengal' lok sabha elections. He also analysed the roadshows by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata. With a massive roadshow in Kolkata, Prime Minister Modi is expected to mount a last-ditch effort in the Bengal elections—this will be his final face-to-face meeting with Mamata Banerjee. The \"Bangalir Mone Modi\" roadshow will travel through important historical sites. Modi will travel in a hi-tech bulletproof car, showcasing a grand spectacle of Bengali culture. The theme of Modi’s roadshow, ‘Bangalir Mone Modi’, translates to ‘Modi is in the heart of Bengalis’. The Prime Minister’s 2-km roadshow will commence from Vidhan Saryan of Shyam Bazar and conclude at Swami Vivekananda’s house. This route holds historical significance as it was frequently used by Swami Vivekananda to visit his Guru, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. In today's DNA, Zee News' Saurabh Raaj Jain, analysed the final round of the 'battle of bengal' lok sabha elections.

Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, has been seen to strategically position her campaign events to coincide with or follow Modi’s. She will hold a rally in south Kolkata at the same time Modi is in North Kolkata and will campaign along the same route in North Kolkata the following day to counteract the Modi effect. The seventh phase of the election will decide the fate of 9 seats in Bengal, all of which were won by the TMC in 2019. The BJP is focused on winning these seats, while Mamata Banerjee’s mission is to retain them. The campaign has been charged, with both parties making strong allegations against each other.

        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030.

Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida.

Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain.

Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous.

Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "Former president Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels , the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar,' ‘slut,' ‘gold digger.' This time around, it’s different. It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat.'\" READ MORE: Donald Trump's confidence takes hit as he sends 'warning signal' to crowd booing him Stormy Daniels has opened up about her experience of the Trump hush money trial in a new documentary The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” The new documentary will air as closing arguments are heard in the trial For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time on Tuesday night in the UK on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” Stormy Daniels thanked her attorney, Clark Brewster She adds that that is a ‘direct threat.' Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again.\" Trump is facing 34 counts of falsifying business records in the hush money trial ( Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” Stormy Daniels said she's 'desensitised' now She talks philosophically about what she has learnt since the story first broke. “The way this is different from 2018 is that I have more knowledge, “ she says. “The shock of it’s not the same. I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” Stormy premieres Tuesday, May 28, Channel 5, 10pm and is also available to stream on My5.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. “It’s more nerve-racking watching than playing,” the 34-year-old centre said. “But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. Story continues below advertisement “You’re just itching to be a part of that.” Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. 1:34 Ice District regulars: Meet the stars of the Edmonton Oilers watch party Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. McLeod comes out of Edmonton’s lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers’ penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod taking a seat to the “reset” the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. Story continues below advertisement “There’s a lot to like about his game,” said the coach. “A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He’s been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn’t been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. “We’ve got a lot of players that are playing well. It’s been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.” Hintz, the Stars’ No. 1 centre, hasn’t played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Monday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. “He’s just an awesome player,” Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. “He’s one of the best players in the in the world. You can’t really replace a guy like that. “Being able to get him back, it would be huge.” The game starts shortly after 6:30 p.m. MT.",

        "description": "Murdered by Hamas terrorists who attacked Kibbutz Nahal Oz on Oct. 7The post Dikla Arava, 51, and Tomer Eliaz, 17: Beloved mother and son appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "Dikla Arava, 51 and her son Tomer Arava Eliaz, 17, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7. Terrorists stormed into the home of Noam Elyakim, Dikla’s longtime boyfriend, whose two daughters, Dafna, 15 and Ela, 8, were also home. The terrorists cruelly forced Tomer at gunpoint to knock on the doors of their neighbors and try to convince them to come outside — all the while livestreaming their psychological and physical terror on Dikla’s Facebook page. Ultimately, the terrorists murdered Tomer, Dikla and Noam, and kidnapped Dafna and Ela to Gaza, where they were held captive for 51 days before being released as part of a truce deal on November 26. Dikla and Tomer’s bodies were only discovered and identified more than a week after the attack, outside the kibbutz grounds. They were buried side by side on October 16 in Kfar Maimon. Dikla and Tomer are survived by their two other older children/siblings, Odin and Stav, and Tomer is also survived by his father, Ma’ayan. A eulogy from the kibbutz lauded Tomer, a student in 12th grade, for “acting with bravery in the face of the murderers who took him as a captive... Tomer acted calmly and with nobility at the gunpoint of the killers.” The teenager, the kibbutz said, was “a magical boy, an angel, a golden child with a good heart, full of joy for life.” His friends and family noted his love of trance music and festivals, as well as his addiction to the gym and working out. On an Instagram memorial page set up for Tomer, his sister, Odin, wrote there are “not enough words that can describe what a wonderful person you were.” “Thank you for everything you were to me, that you always worried about me and put me first, even on that horrible Saturday when you thought about me and checked if I was OK,” she wrote. “Thank you for opening your heart before me like you never did with anyone else. Thank you for recording our conversations which are now all I have left to make me smile again. My angel — you always wanted to be taller than me, and now you are in the highest place in heaven and looking down on me from above.” Weeks after she returned from captivity, Dafna wrote on Instagram that “my Tomer, I miss you so much, it’s hard for me without you. Until 135 days ago we would go to school together every day, and now I go to school alone every day.” In April, Dafna wrote a message to Dikla, noting that it had been “196 days that I haven’t heard you, 196 days that I haven’t seen your smile in person and not in photos, 196 days that you are watching over me from above... I hope you are happy and joyful up there.” The kibbutz eulogy for Dikla noted that she ran the education system for Nahal Oz, and in later years was an educational consultant for preschools. “Dikla was full of life, loved to dance, to be happy, was a warrior mother for her children,” the eulogy noted. “Her charming smile and laughter will be missed in all of our meetings.” Maayan Zin, Noam’s ex-wife and the mother of Dafna and Ela, wrote on Facebook that Dikla “loved my daughters so much and my girls loved Dikla so much.” She said that Dafna and Dikla “connected immediately — Dafna loved her from the first minute they met, they would swap shoes, put on makeup and laugh, Dikla was so present in her life.” Ela, she said, “doesn’t know any life without Dikla. Without Dikla’s family.” “So yes, Dikla is the new girlfriend, but what Dikla gave to Dafna and Ela and Noam nobody can take away from her,” added Maayan. “I just hope she didn’t suffer in her final moments.” Shalev Zarka, who is married to Dikla’s niece, noted in a eulogy at the funeral that when he joined the family five years earlier, “I heard so many stories about you, and when we met we fell in love in a moment.” “Aunt Diki, I love you so much. You were a listening ear to me at any time of day — every phone call from you, every cigarette with you by the fish pond was an experience I will never forget,” he said. “And Tomer — ‘Tomer the king’ — that’s how you are written in my phone,” Shalev continued. “You were the king in my eyes. Determined in every task, working out like crazy, we would compete in the gym — and you at age 17 would crush me every time. I will take your determination to reach every goal and stand by it. The desire to be the best at everything you wanted to be.” “Tomer, even in your final moments, when we saw you facing the terrorists, you were such a warrior. Determined and composed. I love you so much.” Read more Those We Have Lost stories here.",

        "content": "POTTSTOWN — A threatened thunderstorm held back Monday morning long enough for the borough’s Memorial Day Parade and Services to be held. Leaving from its muster point in front of the Goodwill Firehouse at High and Bailey streets, the parade made its way west along High Street, cut a right onto Manatawny Street and headed to the Veterans Island area of Memorial Park. More than 14 fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, a sampling of classic cars, flag-bearing motorcycles, military vehicles and marching bands from Pottstown and Pottsgrove middle schools were all part of the all-American event marching down an all-American Main Street. There were almost as many American flags as there was chrome on this vintage Cadillac in Pottstown's Memorial Day Parade Monday. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The Pottsgrove Middle School Band was one of two bands that marched in Monday's Memorial Day Parade in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown Police Officers rode patrol bikes along the parade route to ensure the safety of all. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Members of the St. Nicholas Patriotic Society brought along their best classic cars for the Memorial Day Parade Monday in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Classic military vehicles joined the other classic cars that participated in Monday's Memorial Day parade in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Crowds, smaller than some years no doubt due to the ever-present threat of rain, were nonetheless enthusiastic and appreciative. At Memorial Park, the services organized by the Joint Veterans Council of Pottstown began by introducing Joseph Tursi, USMC, the 2024 Veteran of the Year, who told the crowd simply to remember what, and who, the holiday is really meant for. Echoing Tursi’s sentiment, Rabbi Cynthia Kravitz of Congregation Hesed Shel Emet, offered a prayer whose theme was “We remember them.” Montgomery County Commissioner Tom DiBello called Memorial Day “the most important holiday on the U.S. calendar.” He quoted James Garfield, former Major General, then congressman and future U.S, president, who gave the address at the first Decoration Day celebration at Arlington National Cemetery in 1868: “We do not know one promise these men made, one pledge they gave, one word they spoke; but we do know they summed up and perfected, by one supreme act, the highest virtues of men and citizens. For love of country, they accepted death, and thus resolved all doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and their virtue.” The Owen J. Roberts ROTC unit leads the Pottstown Memorial Day parade Monday by carrying the colors. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The crowd at Monday's Memorial Day services on Veterans Island stand for the playing of the national anthem. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The Korean War memorial wreath was one of 13 such wreaths placed on Veterans Island Monday during Pottstown's Memorial Day services. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown resident and Vietnam Veteran Jonathan Raden contemplates the World War II Memorial on Veterans Island Monday in Memorial Park. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown resident and Navy veteran Jonathan Raden, points to the name of his father, Army veteran Joseph Raden, on the World War II Memorial in Pottstown's Veterans Island. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) DiBello said Montgomery County provided 62,000 flags for Memorial Day and has re0-named and refocused its veterans services department to be more effective. State Rep. Paul Friel, d-26th Dist., said “when we watch the American flag fully ascend once again, our thoughts will be with our servicemembers both lost and living — including the nearly 200,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines beyond our shores as we gather here, so ably protecting us far from home. They too join us in mourning the fallen. They too join us in celebrating our strength. And like those we remember today, they too serve in a long line of patriots who fought in places like Lexington and Concord; Gettysburg and Midway; and, more recently, Fallujah and Helmand.” “There is no greater sacrifice than to give your life in the defense of this nation,” said state Rep. Joe Ciresi, D-146th Dist. The day’s speaker was Robert W. Boyce, a retired submarine commander who also taught high school and was manager for a decade of the Limerick Nuclear Generating Station. “This holiday,” said Boyce, “is not about hot dogs and hamburgers. It’s about the men and women who served this nation to their death.” The nation, Boyce said, “is facing multiple crises” at the same time its armed forces are depleted. None of the military’s branches met their recruitment goals in the last year, he said, urging young people to join and “serve your country.” As the ceremony came to a close, Marine Corps veteran Billy Worrell stood along among the trees and flowers of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and mournfully played “Taps.”",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: The Election Commission of India (ECI) Monday complimented the electorate of Jammu and Kashmir for the 35-year high voter turnout. The ECI termed J&K witnessing its highest poll participation in the last 35 years as a massive stride for India’s electoral polity. It said that the Combined Voter Turnout (VTR) at the polling stations for the entire J&K (5 Lok Sabha seats) was 58.46 percent in the Lok Sabha polls. The ECI said that this significant participation was a testament to the robust democratic spirit and civic engagement of the people in the region. The ECI led by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar and Election Commissioners (ECs) Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu thanked the polling personnel and security officials for the peaceful conduct of elections in J&K. CEC Rajiv Kumar while conveying ECI’s compliments to the voters of J&K said, “This achievement sits on a credible weave of 25 percent increase in the number of contesting candidates since 2019, C-vigil complaints showing enhanced citizen involvement, and Suvidha Portal showing 2455 requests for rallies, reflecting the steady retaking of the election and campaign space away from hesitation and to fuller participation.” He compared this outcome of the layered depth of electoral mobilisation and participation, as reminiscent of the fame and deft of the legendary Kashmiri artisanal weave. Kumar said that this active participation was a huge positive for the assembly elections to be held soon so that the democratic process continues to thrive in J&K. The voter turnout of 50.86 percent from the three parliamentary constituencies in Kashmir echoes the faith of the people in the democratic process. The poll participation percentage witnessed 30 points jump from the last Lok Sabha polls in 2019 where it was 19.16 percent. The three parliamentary constituencies in Kashmir – Srinagar, Baramulla, and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded a voter turnout of 38.49 percent, 59.1 percent and 54.84 percent, which has been the highest in the last three decades. The other two parliamentary constituencies in J&K – Udhampur and Jammu recorded 68.27 percent and 72.22 percent voter turnout. The ECI said that the historic participation in J&K was realised by earnest efforts of the election and security officials who had worked tirelessly to empower the people of J&K, especially the youth to participate in the elections. It said that more young people had asserted their faith and embraced democracy in a big way. The ECI said that another interesting perspective is the electors in the age group of 18-59 years which forms the major part of electors in J&K. It said that the high poll percentage in Lok Sabha polls was reflective of their faith in democracy, which was a positive and heartening development. The ECI said that that commission also enabled Kashmiri migrant voters residing at various relief camps in Delhi, Jammu, and Udhampur to also have the option of voting in person at designated special polling stations or using postal ballot. It said that 21 special polling stations were established – 16 at Jammu, one at Udhampur, and four at Delhi. The ECI said that as part of awareness and outreach, a wide range of activities were organised under the SVEEP programme in J&K for Lok Sabha elections. The office of the Chief Electoral Officer, J&K, organised adventure sports events, symposiums, awareness rallies, nukkad nataks, and numerous other events to propagate the message of voting. Amongst various efforts, activities included creating igloos as a dummy polling station in Baramulla, para scooter event in Kathua, sensitisation in Beating the Retreat ceremony on Suchetgarh border, mega awareness rally in Teetwal near the Line of Control (LoC), near Dal Lake in Srinagar to Chougan in Kishtwar and playing instrumental version of ECI song on highest railway bridge. Musical programmes and activities were carried out at many places including Lal Chowk, Gulmarg, Kulgam, and Anantnag by famous singers. Every nook and corner of J&K witnessed a rejuvenation of democracy and victory of the ballot with thumping participation in polling, resulting in a record voter turnout.",

        "content": "Two women have filed a lawsuit accusing kicker Brandon McManus of sexually assaulting them on a Jaguars team flight last year. Michael DiRocco of ESPN reports that the Jaguars are by the two flight attendants for failing to supervise McManus, who now plays for the Commanders, and failing to create a safe environment for staff serving the team. They are seeking a jury trial and more than $1 million in damages. The Jaguars declined an opportunity to comment and a statement from McManus or his attorney is expected to come later on Monday. McManus is accused of trying to kiss one woman while she was seated during a turbulent period of the September flight and “grinding up against her” during one of the flight’s meal services. The second woman also accuses McManus of grinding against her and then “smirked and walked away” when confronted about it. The lawsuit also claims that McManus offered money to other flight attendants to “drink and dance inappropriately.” McManus spent nine seasons with the Broncos before joining the Jaguars last year. He signed a one-year contract with the Commanders in March.",

The post No family member of terrorists, stone pelters to receive Govt jobs in J&K: Amit Shah appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: In a significant move, Union Home Minister Amit Shah declared that no family member of terrorists or close relatives of stone pelters will be eligible for government jobs in Jammu and Kashmir. This announcement underscores the Modi government’s firm stance on eradicating terrorism and its ecosystem in the region. In an interview with PTI, Shah detailed the government’s uncompromising strategy. “In Kashmir, we have decided that if someone joins a terrorist organization, their family members will not receive any government job,” he said. Shah extended this policy to stone pelters as well, affirming that their families too will be barred from government employment. Despite challenges from human rights activists who approached the Supreme Court, the government’s stance prevailed. However, Shah mentioned an exception: if a family member comes forward to inform authorities about a relative joining a terror outfit, relief may be provided to that family. Shah highlighted the changes in handling the funerals of terrorists. Previously, large processions were a common occurrence, but now, terrorists are buried with full religious rites in isolated locations to prevent public gatherings. “When a terrorist is surrounded by security forces, he is first given a chance to surrender. We bring in family members like his mother or wife to appeal for his surrender. If he refuses, he faces the consequences,” Shah said. The Home Minister said that there was a substantial decline in terror incidents due to the government’s dual approach of targeting terrorists and dismantling the terror ecosystem. “The National Investigation Agency has taken decisive actions against terror funding, significantly curbing it,” he said. Regarding the Popular Front of India (PFI), Shah confirmed that the government has banned its publications and propaganda under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The PFI, a group founded in Kerala, was banned in September 2022 due to its alleged terror links. Touching upon the case of Amritpal Singh, a pro-Khalistani separatist, Shah revealed, “We have incarcerated him under the NSA (National Security Act).” Singh, the leader of ‘Waris Punjab De’ was arrested in April 2023 and is currently lodged in Dibrugarh jail, Assam. Despite his incarceration, Singh has filed nomination papers to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Punjab’s Khadoor Sahib constituency. Union Home Ministry data highlights the impact of these stringent measures. Terror incidents in Jammu and Kashmir dropped from 228 in 2018 to approximately 50 in 2023. Encounters between security forces and terrorists decreased from 189 in 2018 to around 40 in 2023. Civilian casualties due to terror incidents fell from 55 in 2018 to about five in 2023, and security personnel fatalities reduced from 91 in 2018 to around 15 in 2023. The government’s firm actions have led to a notable decline in terrorism and its support systems in Jammu and Kashmir, marking a significant shift towards lasting peace and security in the region.",

        "content": "Atlante’s ultra-fast charging stations, designed by Bertone Design, equipped with solar panels and energy storage systems, will soon arrive on Italian highways to serve electric mobility Milan, Italy — Atlante, the company of NHOA Group dedicated to electric vehicles fast and ultra-fast charging network, has won the first tender in Italy for the design, construction, and management of over 90 ultra-fast charging points for electric vehicles (EV) for Autostrade per l’Italia (ASPI). The charging points will be located in 8 service areas along the highways managed by ASPI and will feature the exclusive design by the international firm Bertone Design, as well as the presence of solar panels and energy storage systems. This award represents an absolute innovation in Italy, where Atlante is the first independent operator to install its charging stations on the ASPI highway network, continuing the path towards widespread electrification on the entire Italian road infrastructure. Atlante’s charging stations, equipped with ultra-fast charging points up to 400kW, will allow electric vehicles to recharge in a few minutes and will be uniformly distributed throughout the national territory, particularly in service areas in Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany, Campania, and Apulia. All Atlante stations will be equipped with photovoltaic panels covering the charging station, combined with storage systems for better management of the solar energy produced on-site. This forward-thinking decision allows Atlante to continue providing an optimal charging experience while offering a charging experience powered by 100% renewable energy. Atlante stations will be recognizable thanks to the iconic canopy designed by Bertone Design and will integrate various technological solutions, including: a system for detecting unauthorized parking of internal combustion engine vehicles, intelligent lighting and signage, and Wi-Fi connection. There will also be digital information totems and a 24-hour video surveillance system. “Our mission is to contribute to achieving zero-emission mobility in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. This award represents a further step after the 87 fast and ultra-fast charging points on the French highways for VINCI Autoroutes and consolidates Atlante’s position as main independent operator in Southern Europe in the development and management of fast and ultra-fast charging networks on highway infrastructures,” commented Stefano Terranova, CEO of Atlante. “Increasing charging stations on Italian highways is a concrete response to concerns about the compatibility of electric vehicles with long-distance travel. Making charging simple and ultra-fast even on highways simplifies the transition to electric mobility, thus contributing to a more sustainable future.

        "description": "Everton are looking to make their loan deal for Jack Harrison permanent and are confident in doing so after Leeds United lost in the Play-Off...The post Everton 'Confident' of signing 27-y/o attacking player, wheels already in motion - report appeared first on Goodison News.",
        "content": "Lewis Steele reported [27 May] that Sean Dyche is “exploring” a deal to sign Harrison this summer after featuring regularly when fit in the 2023-24 season. This deal has been made easier as Leeds missed out on promotion to the Premier League at Wembley against Southampton. The Toffees are said to already be exploring getting a deal over the line. Leeds’ 1-0 defeat now means they will look to sell players this summer, which has given the Toffees confidence in signing Harrison. Harrison was a useful asset to Dyche’s squad as Everton secured yet another season of Premier League football with time to spare. The winger has got plenty of experience now in the top division which certainly makes him a positive addition to the side. With himself and Dwight McNeil firing on all cylinders with Dominic Calvert-Lewin through the middle, the Toffees have a solid front line. The 27-year-old will likely come for quite a large fee given the financial situation at Goodison Park, but he could be worth bringing in. In the Premier League last season, he scored three and assisted three but only featured from the start across 25 games [ ]. If he can maintain fitness over the course of the whole campaign, he could prove to be one of Everton’s more important players next season. The positivity behind this move depends on the fee that the Toffees pay to Leeds given the financial struggles they are likely to endure this summer. In other Everton news,",

Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter We have more newsletters Hundreds of 'illegal' vapes have been seized after cops raided a shop in a Scots town . In a joint sting operation on May 27 with North Ayrshire Trading Standards, cops visited several shops stocking the electric cigarette-style devices. They found one store in Irvine selling unregulated counterfeits. Around 220 devices were confiscated from the location and it is unknown if cops or the trading standards authority took any further action. Police across the country have been cracking down on the sale of illegal devices that are often targeted at young people and teens. Last week the Record reported how police and trading standards seized hundreds of illegal supersized vapes in North Lanarkshire. Following today's operation, a spokesperson for Police Scotland said: \"In a continued intelligence-led partnership with North Ayrshire Trading Standards, police today attended several vape stockists in North Ayrshire. \"Vapes are regulated in the UK, and there is specific guidance which must be met. These include maximum nicotine strength, maximum liquid capacity, compliant packaging and health warnings. \"Within one Irvine store alone today, 220 counterfeit vapes were found and seized.\" Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

        "content": "Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa met European Council President Charles Michel on Sunday in Brussels as part of a visit to the heart of EU institutions. Earlier Sunday, Mustafa met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide who officially gave him recognition of the State of Palestine papers. Mr Mustafa was in Brussels to meet with international partners including EU Foreign Policy chief Josep Borrell and Norway’s Foreign minister who handed over the official papers for recognition. He says the Palestinian Authority is preparing to be the government of the future state of Palestine – including Gaza. \"The first priority is to support our people in Gaza. They need every support we can. And I think the best support we can all do for them is to speed up the ceasefire. Every day represents a major loss of human lives and properties and hope for our people,” said Mohammad Mustafa, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. He also met with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and EU High Representative, Josep Borrell. Meanwhile, the Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares says his country won’t be intimidated by Israel’s response to recognition of Palestine after Israel announced it would no longer allow Spanish NGO’s work in the West Bank. \"Our goal is to recognize the State of Palestine tomorrow and make every possible effort to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible, and ultimately, to reach that definitive peace. That is what is currently focusing our attention, what is important, and what has centered our conversation in the previous meeting and the attack mentioned, I believe that what it does is underline what the International Court of Justice has indicated,\" said José Manuel Albares Bueno, the Spanish Foreign Minister. Norway, Spain and Ireland last week agreed to recognize a Palestinian state in a move welcomed by Palestinians as an affirmation of their decades-long quest. Israel recalled its ambassadors to the three countries in protest. Several European Union countries argue a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. Additional sources • AP",

        "content": "Dividend stocks attract many investors due to their steady cash flow. Corporations with strong balance sheets tend to give out quarterly dividends and hike their payouts every year. This combination makes it feasible for investors to retire on dividend income and cash from other sources, such as Social Security. Some dividend stocks are well positioned to deliver meaningful dividend growth in the upcoming years. Investors may want to keep these rock-solid dividend stocks on their radars. Broadcom (AVGO) Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is a leading semiconductor company that is capitalizing on the AI boom. While the company’s chips generate plenty of demand, its recent acquisition of VMware continues to fuel its earnings. Revenue increased by 34% year-over-year in Q1 2024 as the company reached $11.96 billion. Broadcom anticipates generating more than $50 billion in fiscal 2024. Wall Street analysts have quickly assigned higher price targets for the “Strong Buy” stock. The stock has 21 “Buy” ratings and three “Hold” ratings. The average price target suggests a 12% gain is coming. Broadcom currently offers a 1.49% yield, which is good for a stock up by 459% over the past five years. A 30% year-to-date gain suggests momentum is still building for this long-term winner. Over the past five years, an annualized dividend growth rate of 17.49% cements the company as a top dividend stock. American Express (AXP) American Express (NYSE: AXP ) has been in business since 1850 and has become a leading fintech firm in the credit and debit card industry. Millions of people use American Express cards for purchases, and the company makes a small percentage of each transaction. As long as consumers continue to spend, American Express stands to benefit. The formula worked well for the company in Q1 2024 . During that quarter, revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income rallied by 34% year-over-year. American Express has been producing several solid quarters. Those successes have resulted in shares more than doubling over the past five years. The stock is currently up by 26% year-to-date and has a 20 P/E ratio. Furthermore, investors can get shares while they offer a 1.18% yield. American Express has had an annualized dividend growth rate of 10.51% over the past decade. The firm only has a 20.31% payout ratio, indicating plenty of room for dividend growth. Main Street Capital (MAIN) Main Street Capital (NYSE: MAIN ) doesn’t have a high annualized dividend growth rate. The company recently hiked its annual dividend 2.1% year-over-year. While that’s not impressive, the business development company currently offers a 5.93% yield. Unlike most dividend stocks, Main Street Capital also issues monthly dividend payouts instead of quarterly payouts. The stock typically stays flat but has an exceptional year. Main Street Capital has gained 22% over the past year as its diversified portfolio of lower middle market companies continues to generate returns. Total investment income increased by 9% year-over-year in Q1 2024 . The firm has 191 cumulative investments and $7.4 billion in capital under management. The management team has a cumulative 100 years of experience and prioritizes companies with revenue between $10 million and $150 million and EBITDA between $3 million and $20 million. Main Street Capital is diversified across several industries with a strong focus on internet software and services, machinery and professional services. Walmart (WMT) Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) has become a top destination for people who want affordable prices for a wide range of goods. It is the largest grocer and continues to see high demand for its inventory. Revenue increased by 6.0% year-over-year in Q1 FY25 as the company saw more demand for its e-commerce and advertising segments. Both of those components exhibited year-over-year growth rates above 20%. The stock is up 23% year-to-date and has soared by 93% over the past five years. Walmart trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.27% yield. Dividend growth has been slow, but a recent 9% dividend hike offers long-term optimism. Walmart has raised its dividend for 51 consecutive years. Revenue and dividends weren’t the only things going up for Walmart. The retailer also reported a 22.4% year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS. Walmart has $9.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, even after a $1.1 billion stock buyback during the quarter. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has exposure to numerous verticals and looks like it will continue to outperform the stock market. The tech conglomerate is currently the world’s most valuable publicly traded corporation. It has a $3.20 trillion market cap and is up by 16% year-to-date. Its 5-year gain comes to 248%. Microsoft trades at a 37 P/E ratio with a 0.70% yield. While the dividend is low, most investors won’t mind due to the high long-term returns. However, the dividend can become a notable component soon enough. Microsoft has been raising its dividend considerably over the years. The annualized dividend growth rate has stood at 10.60% over the past decade. The tech giant only has a 24.66% dividend payout ratio, so Microsoft likely maintains a double-digit growth rate for many years. However, Wall Street analysts aren’t waiting for the yield to increase. Based on the average price target, the stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” and has a projected 14% upside. Costco (COST) Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) has a 32.50% dividend payout ratio and has an annualized dividend growth rate of 12.65% over the past decade. These metrics make the 0.57% yield look more promising, but the occasional special dividend payout leads to significant value for patient investors. Costco closed out 2023 with a special $15 dividend , a big jump from the quarterly payout of $1.16 per share. The low yield shouldn’t discourage investors, thanks to the special dividend. However, that’s not the only perk of Costco stock. It’s been outperforming the market for several years. Shares are up by 24% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years. April sales results suggest that investors should expect more gains. Total company sales increased by 5.6% year-over-year over the previous 4-week period. E-commerce led the way with a 14.6% year-over-year increase. Costco also exhibited sales growth over the 35 weeks. Procter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) closes out the list of dividend dynamos with an impressive dividend streak. The consumer goods company has been paying out dividends for 134 consecutive years . That also includes 68 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Dividend growth has been at a crawl for several years, but the corporation recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.9407 to $1.0065 per share. That’s a 7% year-over-year increase. The stock is up by 61% over the past five years and is off to a good start with an 11% year-to-date gain. Shares trade at a 27 P/E ratio and offer a 2.44% yield. Procter & Gamble is currently rated as a “ Moderate Buy ” with a projected 3% upside. Only five analysts rated the stock as a “Hold,” while the other 12 rated it as a “Buy.” The company sells many essential goods that will continue to garner demand during a slower economic cycle. Procter & Gamble isn’t as vulnerable to dramatic price swings and offers a solid yield. On this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AVGO and MSFT.

        "content": "Treasury Board President Anita Anand says she wants to increase the use of artificial intelligence in Canada's public service but insists there's no question of using AI tools like ChatGPT for confidential information like cabinet documents. Speaking to reporters Monday as she launched consultations on the use of AI in the public service, Anand said the government is looking for a strategy to use AI responsibly. \"This is in the area of generative AI, in particular incorporating platforms like ChatGPT into the workplace,\" she said. \"Managers will have the discretion as to when that is able to be used, but I will say that in areas of confidentiality, cabinet confidences for example, generative AI isn't generally going to be used.\" When asked why the government doesn't plan to allow public servants to use AI tools with confidential documents, Anand said that's part of a separate consultation. \"The issues relating to confidentiality are being addressed in our review of the use of confidential information across government,\" she said. \"And so, I'm currently looking at that under a trust and transparency approach and I will have more to say on that specific issue very shortly. Not today, but shortly.\" Trudeau announces $2.4 billion for AI-related investments Federal government issues new rules for public servants using AI Ottawa will prevent AI tools from discriminating against potential hires, Anand says Ottawa unveils new AI code of conduct for Canadian companies Anand said she wants the government's strategy to avoid bias or discrimination in the use of AI. \"This is the part of the work that we're doing to ensure that the AI tools that we are incorporating are not used for unsavoury or discriminatory purposes,\" she said. \"It is part of the work that we're doing to use AI responsibly.\" Anand acknowledged the government will have to compete with the private sector for the technological talent it will need to increase its use of AI but said there are plans to retrain existing public servants. \"We will be setting up a specific division of Treasury Board to re-skill existing public servants, if they would like to do that, in the area of cyber and cyber technology,\" she said. WATCH: Open AI shows off model's capacity for conversation OpenAI demonstrates new model's capability for realistic conversation 13 days ago Duration 0:42 From giving advice and analyzing graphs to guiding someone through a math equation and even cracking a joke, the new model of ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, is touted as having real-time responses in natural human tone. Speaking to a hand-picked roundtable of experts Monday, Anand said the government has set three priorities for a national public service AI strategy: providing services to Canadians, increasing operational efficiency and driving science and research. \"The question is really going to be how can we, with this strategy, add greater efficiencies but also simplify the interactions of the Canadian population and organizations and businesses with federal services,\" Anand told the roundtable. Anand said that while it's important to help the private sector develop AI, it's also important to develop the public service's use of AI. \"As the largest employer in the country, we set an example for those employers,\" she said. Earlier, academics and experts participating in the roundtable stressed the importance of public trust in the government's use of AI, comparing it to the need for the public to trust the government's oversight of Canada's food safety system. Officials told the roundtable that the government plans to launch its public service AI strategy by March.",

        "content": "A Manitoba school division is saying comments made by a parent that were posted on social media are defamatory and untrue in a recently filed lawsuit. Beautiful Plains School Division in Neepawa, Man. said in a statement of claim filed on May 14 with the Court of King’s Bench that a parent of current and former students within the division has been making defamatory comments against the division and a number of teachers at the schools. Beautiful Plains said in the statement of claim that posts were made on Facebook on April 18, and between May 1 and May 13. Several of the posts were listed in the claim which named a number of employees in the division, and used profanity such as “f**king Nazi” “You’re a b***h” and \"toxic piece of s**t.\" The posts also accused staff of sexualizing children, abuse, misogyny and sexism, the suit said. \"The Division says that the Online Defamatory Statement are false and were made for the improper purpose of causing embarrassment and humiliation to the Division and/or its employees,\" the claim reads. The division said in the lawsuit, that the comments were meant to undermine the division and \"lower the Division in the estimation of members of society in general.\" The lawsuit also said the division's character and reputation have been \"severely injured\" and that it will \"continue to suffer significant loss and damage and irreparable harm.\" The division is calling on the parent to stop making and publishing untrue statements and to delete previous posts from their social media, the claim said. The division is also asking for general and punitive damages. CTV News Winnipeg has reached out to the parent but has not heard back. No statement of defence has been filed. The allegations have not been tested in court.",

        "description": "PM Modi said that India is a mature democracy and boasts of rich and well-established electoral principles and traditions and such “provocation” was a matter of grave concern and calls for a thorough investigation.The post External forces can’t influence mature Indian voters: PM Modi appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday expressed shock and surprise over Pakistani voices of endorsement and praise for a select few Indian counterparts (Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal) in the middle of Lok Sabha elections and asserted that Indian voters were mature enough to see through their gimmicks. In an interview with IANS at his official residence in the national capital, the PM said that India’s voters were mature in their thoughts and could not be influenced by any external factor. On questions of Pakistani politicians’ support to Congress leader and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal amid polls, he said: “I don’t understand why some select group of people, apparently those who harbour animosity against us, get endorsements from Pakistan, why voices of support emanate from there, for certain individuals.” PM Modi said that India is a mature democracy and boasts of rich and well-established electoral principles and traditions and such “provocation” was a matter of grave concern and calls for a thorough investigation. He said that he understands the aspirations of the country’s youth and considers it a responsibility to provide them with a launching pad so that they can achieve their desired goals. “I understand their aspirations. Today’s youth is very different from the past. They don’t want to conform to the previous standards. They want to make a big leap in every field to reach their intended destinations, even if it means bypassing some steps. Our responsibility is to provide them with launching pads and give them a platform to fulfil their aspirations. There is a need to understand youth and their thinking pattern,” the PM said. “When I do Pariksha Pe Charcha, I get to interact with thousands of students. I come across many students who are thinking decades ahead of their time. A major gap will emerge if the government and the leadership fail to understand the aspirations of this new generation,” he said. Stating that his government turned the COVID pandemic crisis into an opportunity, PM Modi said that he completely understands the true potential of technology and how it can be harnessed effectively. “During the COVID period, I was worried about the country’s young generation. I was worried about their youthfulness confined to the four walls of the room. In my video conferencing sessions, I tried to energise them with certain tasks to lift their spirits. That is why we made data very cheap. My logic behind the move was to turn them towards the new digital world, and we succeeded in it,” he said. The PM said that the digital revolution that was being witnessed right now was a result of India successfully managing to turn around the huge COVID crisis into an opportunity. “The digital and Fintech revolution in the country owes much to the government’s focus on converting the crisis into an opportunity during that time. I fully understand the prowess of technology and the impactful changes that it can bring for generations and therefore want to harness it to full potential,” he said. PM Modi said India’s G20 presidency last year marked a significant milestone in its global leadership role. He said that this contributed massively to making India “world-ready” and the world “India-ready”. “We held G20 meetings all over the country because the world should know that India is not just only about Delhi. It is also not enough for my country’s tourism industry if people just visit the Taj Mahal. My country has massive potential which needs to be known and understood. We used the G20 as an opportunity to establish India’s image in the world,” the PM said. “We were highly successful in creating curiosity about India among the world community. More than one lakh policy-makers from the entire world attended over 200 G20 meetings and explored first-hand different places of India, most of which they had not even heard of before. They also correlated things with their own country and kept on talking about India after returning home. I am seeing that the tourist flow has increased enormously after India held the G20 Summit,” he said. Emphasising that every city and district of the country has its unique vibrancy and potential, PM Modi said he makes it a point to spread India’s culture, traditions, and heritage during his foreign visits. “India is a land of diversities and any country cannot stand tall on just one pillar. I laid strength on ‘One District, One Product’ (ODOP) because every district in India is unique and has its strength. I want to bring them to the fore. Now, when I go abroad, I don’t have to spend too much time deciding what gift to take along with me. Whether I am going to Africa or Europe, I just have a look at the ODOP catalogue and it is quite easy for me to decide what product to take along with me,” he said. “I have told the External Affairs Ministry that I will measure your success on three parameters. First, how many goods from India are brought in the country you are posted in? Second, which is the best technology in that country which India still does not have, and how can we get it here? And thirdly, how many tourists do you send to India from that country? India and ‘nation first’ is at the centre of every decision I make,” the PM said. He said that driven by digital public infrastructure (DPI) models like unified payments interface (UPI), the country was now leading the global fintech ecosystem and several countries were ready to embrace the ‘India Stack’ solutions to empower the masses. The PM said when he kicked off the ‘Digital India’ movement, opposition parties made allegations that this was being done to serve the needs of the service providers. “They could not understand how big this area is and the 21st century is technology-driven. Moreover, technology today is driven by artificial intelligence (AI),” he said. PM Modi said that UPI had played a huge role in the world of fintech and due to this, “several countries are ready to embrace UPI because this is the era of fintech and India is now leading the fintech ecosystem”. He came down heavily on those objecting to crack down on big fish of corruption rackets and said some people were scripting a fake narrative to save them from the grip of law. The PM said that, unlike earlier regimes, not the small players but big fish and perpetrators were being brought to book under his watch and this was breaking the backs of their masters. “The same people who earlier cried foul over no action on big players have started crying hoarse about it,” he said. PM Modi also expressed dismay over a recent trend, which he said, was the glorification of the corrupt. “Earlier, people used to stay 100 steps away from the convicted or even those with any corruption taint but today there is a tendency to support and rally behind them,” he said. The PM said how his government questioned in 2019 for going slow on the corrupt and shady practices, had ensured the prosecution of big fish and racketeers and also stated that this had triggered a wave of protests and backlash from certain sections of the Opposition. “The same people who demanded that Sonia Gandhi be put behind bars are crying hoarse over action against corruption,” PM Modi said. He said that the action against the corrupt and the dishonest was based on facts and evidence, and not on perception. “Before the 2019 elections, we were questioned over our stand and action on graft and why the government was not quick on punishing the perpetrators. Our outright response was that Independent agencies will act against them and it will be done based on facts. Officials worked hard to gather the facts and today, big players are being caught and brought to justice,” the PM said. “It is the Independent investigative agency which apprehends the accused, and it is the judiciary which decides on his conviction or trial. The Prime Minister has no role in this,” he said. PM Modi said that his government’s approach was comprehensive, integrated, and holistic. “Nation’s fundamental issues can’t be ignored. If people in villages and remote locations are facing issues, they call for immediate redressal. They too are important constituents of India’s growth story and can’t be looked down upon,” he said. “I have also briefed the Foreign Department about measuring their scale of success on three counts. First is how much Indian produce is bought by the country where you reside, second is which modern technology can be brought in India and third is how many citizens of that country visit India every year, for tourism,” PM Modi said. He said that their government had transferred about Rs 38 lakh crore directly into accounts of beneficiaries via Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), so far. “If we talk about times of Rajiv Gandhi government (when out of Rs 1, only 15 paise reached the intended beneficiaries), about Rs 25-30 lakh crore could have been gobbled up by the middlemen,” the PM said. Stressing the thrust of technology in his governance, he said that it made records transparent and administration more efficient. PM Modi elucidated how two factors — policy-driven governance and saturation of schemes — worked wonders in containing corruption to a large extent. “When the policy is laid out in black and white, the grey area is brought down to minimal levels, this reduces the scope for any discrimination. We have focussed on policy-driven governance,” he said. The PM said that saturation of schemes gives a guarantee for corruption-free governance and gives a guarantee of social security. “We have focused on 100 percent delivery of schemes to targeted beneficiaries. If people are convinced that they are bound to get benefits sooner or later, this leaves no room for corruption. Some mischievous elements may still try to spoil the system but can’t befool the beneficiaries for long,” he said. PM Modi said that the government would ensure the country’s leadership in the world of gaming in years to come. He said that there was a huge gaming market waiting for India. “The irony is that Indians are investing large sums of money while others are making huge profits in the gaming industry. I called young gamers recently to understand their problems. After the interaction, I told my government that I want to cement India’s leadership in the global gaming market,” the PM said. “There is such a big future market. Gaming has come to the Olympics now and I want Indian youth to participate in it.”",

        "content": "Article content Thessalon First Nation’s community health manager is being added as a defendant to a wrongful termination lawsuit brought against the band. In an amended statement of claim, Mary Jane Wardell accuses Wendy Pekalski of accessing her medical information without permission on Dec. 20, 2023, roughly a month after Wardell was removed from her position as TFN’s director of operations. Wardell claims that members of TFN’s newly elected chief and council directed Pekalski to access her private medical information, bolstering her broader argument that the band’s leadership spearheaded a “co-ordinated attack” to discredit her reputation in the community. On top of the $850,000 in damages Wardell initially sought for her wrongful termination, she is seeking an additional $200,000 for the “tortious invasion” of her private health records. “The information disclosed was inherently private given that it was the intimate and personal health records of the Plaintiff, and a reasonable person would find that this unauthorized access is highly offensive causing severe distress and anguish,” Wardell’s statement reads. Wardell was informed of this alleged privacy breach on Feb. 26 via Maamweysing North Shore Community Health Services, which is responsible for providing primary care and medical record keeping in the community. The following month, Maamweysing chief privacy officer Michelle Brisbois told The Sault Star that at least 20 TFN members had suffered a similar fate to Wardell, with their medical records being accessed without permission between October and January. The Star obtained several letters that Maamweysing sent out to TFN members informing them of this alleged privacy breach, all of which name Pekalski as the culprit. Because of this alleged mass privacy breach, Maamweysing has since relocated to the nearby Town of Thessalon, leaving many TFN members on reserve concerned about the accessibility of primary care moving forward. The TFN administration has publicly denied Maamweysing’s claims that a mass privacy breach took place under their watch, writing in an April 5 Facebook post that the health agency’s allegations “have not been proven.” The Star reached out to Pekalski for comment on the claims Wardell made in her amended statement. However, she did not respond by press time. Chief Joseph Wabigwan and TFN executive director Lesley Boulrice haven’t returned The Star’s request for comment as of Monday afternoon. Wardell claims that her wrongful termination took place immediately following the Nov. 17 election , which resulted in the appointment of Chief Wabigwan and several new members of council. The following evening, Wardell alleges that Wabigwan and newly-elected councillor Robert Simon Sr. attended her residence to deliver an envelope in person, with several other band members and OPP officers parked outside. Wardell, according to court documents, did not receive this envelope at the time, since her sister refused to wake her “given the hour and the aggressive nature of the attendance.” When Wardell reported to the band office on Nov. 22, she was given a termination letter and asked to vacate the premises. Wardell, who began working for TFN in 1991, believes her firing is completely without justification, arguing that she “did not have a history of formal disciplinary action against her” before the termination. Outside of being fired without proper justification, Wardell also claims that the current administration’s “unprofessional” conduct during this period includes a “planned” and “orchestrated” effort to sully her reputation in the community. Wardell said she believes this administration’s intentions are made clear through a private Facebook group run by Boulrice and others, which was allegedly used to post and spread false information about the former director of operations and her family. “The First Nation’s conduct has been highhanded, outrageous, oppressive, and represents a marked departure from ordinary standards of decent behaviour, justifying an award of punitive and/or aggravated damages,” the statement reads. When reached for comment back in April over the initial court filing, Chief Wabigwan told The Star via email that “Thessalon First Nation disputes her claim but does not comment on matters that are before the courts.” kdarbyson@postmedia.com The Local Journalism Initiative is made possible through funding from the federal government Share this Story : TFN community health manager added to wrongful termination lawsuit Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr",

        "content": "CORBIN Bleu fans have praised the actor for showing off his double dutch skills 17 years after Jump In! was released. On Sunday, the High School Musical actor posted a video on TikTok showing him jump roping in New York City . Corbin, 35, captioned the post, \"Still got it.\" In the video, the actor was shown jump roping double dutch in an NYC neighborhood. Corbin starred in the 2007 Disney Channel Original Movie, Jump In! In it, he played amateur boxer Izzy Daniels, who is asked to sub in as a jump rope team member for a Double Dutch tournament by his friend, and eventual love interest, Mary - played by Keke Palmer , 30. In the TikTok , Corbin sported a gray T-shirt, denim shorts, and aviator sunglasses as he skipped over the rope - performing stylish tricks as he jumped. Fans rushed to the comment section to share excitement about the \"iconic post.\" One person wrote, \"When I tell you this cured EVERYTHING about my childhood. LOVED 'jump in.'\" \"People walking by not knowing how iconic this is,\" commented another. Corbin replied, \"Why I love NY.\" \"What do you mean 17 yrs? It still feels like it only came out a couple of years ago,\" mentioned a shocked fan. The actor responded, \"2007,\" along with a mind-blown emoji. \"Ahh jump in was one of my fave disney originals back in the day!! what a throwback,\" wrote a fourth commenter. \"ICONIC POST,\" asserted another. One fan joked, \"Okay fine, I’ll go watch Jump In again.\" Corbin rose to fame as Chad Danforth, the basketball-playing best friend of Troy Bolton, played by Zac Efron , in High School Musical. After the third film wrapped, he turned his musical talents to Broadway and established himself as a fixture in American theatre. People walking by not knowing how iconic this is.\" He's trodden the boards for In The Heights, God Speed, and Holiday Inn, the New Irving Berlin Musical. Corbin has also established himself on the small screen with roles in The Beautiful Life: TBL and on the silver screen with Scary or Die among other films. He has also released two albums, Another Side (2007) and Speed of Light (2009), but only his first release charted at 36 on the US Billboard chart. In 2011, Corbin was dragged into a court battle over the failure of the racing film Free Style, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter . The lawsuit alleged that the film failed due to a mix of alleging fraud, breach of contract, and misrepresentation. The financiers, who brought the suit, also claimed that Corbin hadn't promoted the film enough. It is not clear how the claim was resolved. In 2013 he appeared on Dancing With The Stars and came second. Corbin tied the knot with long-term girlfriend Sasha Clements on July 23, 2016. Sasha Clements was born on March 14, 1990, in Toronto , Canada but moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. Her first role came in 2005 as the robber girl in the TV film The Snow Queen before she moved on to the TV series Majority Rules! In 2009. Like her husband, Sasha was a Disney actor as well. Okay fine, I’ll go watch Jump In again.\" In 2014, Sasha appeared in the Disney Channel movie How to Build a Better Boy. The Canadian actress went back to her roots and appeared in both Degrassi: The Next Generation and Degrassi Don't Look Back. Corbin met his now-wife in 2011 in the grocery aisle at a supermarket, later going on a date when he met her as she was finishing her shift. Sasha is a Disney lover who grew up enjoying the Disney theme parks which became the eventual stage for Bleu to propose. In 2014, the couple took a trip to Disney where Bleu popped the question in front of the Cinderella Castle while taking a photo. The couple stood in front of the cameras and they started rolling, Blue said he had a glass slipper prop to put on Clements’ foot. Instead, Sasha looked down to see Corbin on one knee with an engagement ring in the glass slipper. When she said yes, fireworks were timed to go off behind them and Bleu told her they would, in fact, be staying in the Cinderella Castle. Sasha reflected on their meeting and said, “I don’t know if I believe in love at first sight but I definitely believe in ‘something at first sight.’ We both remember feeling that spark of something being different.” They were engaged for two years and were married on July 23, 2016, at the Hummingbird Nest in Santa Susana, California .",

        "content": "DEAR MISS MANNERS: My husband and I have suffered from several years of infertility, and I am often asked why we don’t have children. As it’s none of their business, and for privacy reasons, I typically answer with, “Though it’s a desire, it has not come as easy for us as others.” Whenever someone inquires further, I would like to know how to politely tell them it’s none of their business. GENTLE READER : In polite language, “None of your business” is translated as “That is a personal matter.” DEAR MISS MANNERS: I was wondering if my daughter should have sent thank-you cards to my wife and myself when she graduated from college. My wife said she should have, but I don’t feel the same way. Could you please let me know? GENTLE READER: In the normal course of events, children take it for granted that their parents feed, clothe and educate them. In happy families, it sometimes strikes adult children how enormous an undertaking that is. That may bring on a spontaneous burst of gratitude, beyond the usual affection that children who have felt loved and cared for will presumably have been expressing. This may be prompted by special occasions, such as parental birthdays; typically, however, the full realization of the time, energy, patience and money spent occurs when the children have children of their own. Miss Manners would not have thought that college graduation would bring this on. Does your wife really want to focus on your shared contributions to your daughter’s education, however much you sacrificed, instead of on your daughter’s achievement? Isn’t this the time to tell her how proud of her you are -- not how indebted to you she is? That may come later. Miss Manners hopes it will not be merely with a paltry card. DEAR MISS MANNERS: I am a case manager at a law firm and frequently must call people at another law firm to discuss cases that we have together. Sometimes the receptionist at the other law firm will ask detailed questions as to what the call is about before transferring me to the person with whom I need to speak. I don’t mean a simple inquiry as to which case the call is about -- I mean detailed questions. In my view, it’s none of the receptionist’s business what the call is about; if the law firm wanted her to have substantive conversations about cases, she would have a different position than receptionist. On the possibility that she may be following instructions, I’ve never pushed back, but it does irritate me. Is there a polite way to convey “It’s none of your business, so please put me through to So-and-So” without actually saying that? Or does business etiquette require that I answer whatever questions the receptionist has before speaking with the person I actually called to talk to? GENTLE READER : Well, this is not a personal matter. And most likely, the receptionist is not being nosy, but rather following instructions from her employers, as you suggest. Still, you could say, “She’ll know what it is about.” Miss Manners hopes that works.",

        "description": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died.",
        "content": "By Tim Reynolds The Associated Press Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

Several posts on social media noted a strong police presence on University Drive during the arrest. At approximately 5:19 p.m. Sunday, Gill was safely taken into custody by Surrey RCMP, with assistance from the Lower Mainland Integrated Emergency Response Team (ERT), Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT), Integrated Police Dog Services (PDS), Surrey Gang Enforcement Team (SGET) and several frontline officers, an RCMP release noted.

        "description": "The massive new park will be nearly double the size of Vancouver's Stanley Park",
        "content": "Article content West Vancouver has unveiled plans to turn more than 780 hectares of forested municipal land into a protected park nearly double the size of Vancouver’s Stanley Park. The new park covers nearly eight square kilometres along West Vancouver’s mountainside and includes one of the remaining areas of old-growth forests on the North Shore. In comparison, Stanley Park in Vancouver’s downtown core measures about four square kilometres. “This area will help preserve sensitive ecosystems and wildlife and store carbon to fight climate change,” said West Vancouver Mayor Mark Sager in a statement on Monday. “It will also ensure that old growth trees will continue to stand in our stunning municipality, which we know is very important to our residents and people across the globe. Sager said dedicating the land to a park will ensure Metro Vancouver can enjoy the view of the mountainside above West Vancouver, which forms a backdrop to Vancouver and downtown, in perpetuity. The area is part of a larger system of protected areas including Cypress Provincial Park and the Capilano and Seymour watersheds. It also protects lands around the Old Growth Conservancy, which is managed by the District and a local non-profit. Dedicating the area to parkland has been in the works for years, with strong support by community groups and the many users of the area, including the B.C. Mountaineering Club, West Vancouver Streamkeepers, Hollyburn Ridge Association, North Shore Mountain Bike Association, and Friends of Cypress Provincial Park, said the District in a news release. To fund stewardship and maintenance of the park, B.C. Parks Foundation has launched the Cypress Hollyburn legacy fund, with a $3 million matching gift from the Wilson 5 Foundation, a private foundation by Chip and Summer Wilson focused on land conservancy and park creation in B.C.",

        "content": "We get off to a cooler start across southern Manitoba including Winnipeg on Monday. At least, by late May standards. Temperatures should reach the low 20s for this time of year. Today, though, most regions should hit highs in the mid-teens. Conditions are also just unstable enough that there is a risk of non-severe thunderstorms later this afternoon into early this evening. In the northeast, a low near Island Lake should continue to bring on again, off again rain to the region today and likely this evening. By contrast, parts of the northwest should catch at least some sunshine. High pressure building into the province over the next day or so will bring more sunshine to the south on Tuesday, particularly by the afternoon around Winnipeg. Wednesday will be a great day to book a tee time or to just head outside with temperatures in the south expected to climb into the mid-20s in the afternoon with lots of sunshine. Showers can’t be ruled out later in the week before a warm, even hot start to meteorological summer on the weekend as we move into the month of June.",

Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau , who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits , to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. Biden said that last year the Department of Veterans Affairs delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever before. He credited the PACT Act, which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned,\" Biden said. \"Not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans and Gold Star family members.",

While the overdraft will change when this is received, the distribution of salary, pension, social security pension etc. will start by the end of this week. The restriction is till June 15 considering this. The treasury will be reduced to virtually nominal activity. 5000 crores are needed for salary pension distribution and 900 crores for social security pension distribution. Essentials are exempted from the regulation. The Treasury has been in overdraft since the beginning of the financial year. Kerala was expecting a loan of Rs 44528 crore but instead got a loan sanction of Rs 21253 crore. 6500 crore has already been taken out of it. Only 14753 crores are remaining. There are fears that the financial crisis will intensify in the coming months.",

        "content": "Manchester United have confirmed yet another high-profile player departure after announcing that Raphael Varane's contract will not be extended. Earlier this month, the Red Devils announced that the from Old Trafford at the end of the season. A compatriot of his, Anthony Martial, will now join Varane in bidding farewell to the club, as confirmed by United today. \"Dear Manchester United fans, It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career,\" the striker announced on Instagram. \"Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. \"I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you've done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. \"I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my 9 years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. \"Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. I'm leaving to take on new challenges, I'll always be a Red Devil and I'll continue to follow the club's results with passion. Thank you again for everything, and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.\" The French forward joined the 20-time English champions in 2015 from Monaco, and amassed 317 appearances across all competitions, scoring 90 goals along the way. Injuries in recent seasons have seen Martial's importance at the Red Devils decline dramatically, with the striker having only featured 19 times this term. Upon his arrival at the club, the then-teenager was considered among the most promising players in Europe, but ultimately failed to live up to expectations. Martial, who will become a free agent at the end of June, won four trophies during his nine-year stay at United. You must be to read and post comments",

        "description": "Six people have put their name forward for the role, which doubles as the regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations. This includes incumbent Gerald Antoine, Norman Yak’e ula, George Mackenzie, April Martel, Paulie Chinna and Gerry Cheezie.",
        "content": "A record number of candidates are running for Dene National Chief. The election will take place in Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., at the Dene National Assembly on July 24. Online voting will open on July 14 and run until July 24, while in-person ballots can be cast at the assembly. Six people have put their names forward for the role, which doubles as the N.W.T. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations. This includes incumbent Gerald Antoine, his predecessor Norman Yak'e ula, former Tłı̨chǫ grand chief George Mackenzie, Kátł'odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel, former Sahtu MLA Paulie Chinna and former Smith's Landing First Nation chief Gerry Cheezie. \"I think most of you would be familiar with most of these candidates,\" said Kit Spence, the returning officer, in a news conference Monday. Phil Moon Sun, the CEO of Dene Nation, said this appears to be the highest number of candidates on record to run for the role. \"Judging from our records, and we haven't done a deep dive, but yes this is the most candidates,\" he said. The election will be done using a hybrid format of in-person and electronic voting. Spence said the nominations opened April 26 and closed May 24. Seven submissions were received but only six which were accepted. He said one was rejected because candidates needed to have five nominators who are active members of the Dene Nation, including two sitting chiefs, and the one applicant didn't have any sitting chiefs on their nomination list. The Dene National Chief election is delegated, which means communities select and appoint delegates to attend the assembly and vote. Those delegates who are unable to vote in person can do so online. \"I have conducted a number of elections in British Columbia for First Nations using electronic voting and have found this is a system that is well-regarded and well-used,\" Spence said. The Dene Nation used online voting in the Dene National Chief election in 2021, in the midst of the COVID pandemic. Spence said candidates are not allowed to use the Dene Nation's administrative resources for the campaign and have to use their own resources.",

        "content": "The political campaign backroom boy turned politician turned wannabe psephologist Prashant Kishor finally had his comeuppance in Karan Thapar’s studio last week. Kishor should have known that Thapar is thorough with his homework. When asked why his prediction that the Bharatiya Janata Party would secure over 300 seats in the Lok Sabha should be believed when a couple of his earlier such predictions proved to be wrong, Kishor denied any such wrong prediction on his part. He then demanded that Thapar show a video clip to prove his charge. Thapar had newspaper clips and social media posts at hand. Kishor’s demand fell flat and exposed the biased and partisan nature of his prediction of a BJP victory. Kishor should have learnt a lesson from economist-turned-psephologist Surjit Bhalla. Bhalla has been in this business for over three decades. He has made any number of predictions on election outcomes. He was right on some and wrong on others. So, Bhalla has a simple line of defence. He quotes the famous British psephologist David Butler, a guru to many Indian psephologists including Prannoy Roy, who apparently held the view that psephologists should always forecast because sometimes they get it right and sometimes they don’t. Given the nature of the playfield, especially in a parliamentary system where converting vote percentages into number of seats is always fraught, and the element of uncertainty in an electorate as diverse as India’s, electoral outcome forecasting is a risky business. The track record of even the best psephologists are full of hits and misses. What keeps them in business is that someone or the other is happy with the forecast. Rather than confess that he got it wrong on a couple of occasions, Kishor insisted he had never got it wrong. He may have felt compelled to make the claim to remain in business. Thapar had him for breakfast. Election forecasting has been around for a long time. In India, it took off with the spread of television. Prannoy Roy was the first to make a business out of it. His original team consisted of economists and statisticians who were good at conducting sample surveys, number-crunching, constructing econometric models and making forecasts. Roy is himself an economist and his original team included Bhalla and Ashok Lahiri. The TV election forecasts brought into prominence several individuals who went on to have their own political careers, like G.V.L. Narasimha Rao and Yogendra Yadav. Given the public interest, nay curiosity, and the general human nature to want to know the future, election forecasts attract a big audience and for the media they have become money spinners. Everyone and his auntie has got into the game. One can pick and choose one’s favourite forecast and go to sleep. Big money has changed the way the media, print and electronic, report not just cricket and crime but also the Union Budget and elections. It’s all about eyeballs and TRPs and keeping the viewer from flipping TV channels. Live coverage of the Union Budget also began around the same time that televised election forecasting began, in the 1980s. With the urban middle class and upper-class audiences glued to the TV on Budget day to figure out the impact of taxes and policies on households and firms, TV coverage began attracting advertising revenues. Television coverage of the Union Budget has been continued even after the time of Budget presentation was changed from evening to morning, with entertaining discussions around the Budget televised in the evening. Advertising drives everything in the media. Not surprisingly, therefore, election coverage is increasingly less about serious issues and more about entertainment. Discussions have to become arguments. All sides have to shout at each other and if the shouting becomes too much, humour is inserted as a filler. Elections as entertainment have taken political journalists into different directions, from mixing politics with cuisine and restaurant hopping to mixing politics with cinema and song. Into this milieu and melange enter the pollsters and psephologists. They too must entertain to remain in business. In this year’s campaigning the trivialisation of politics has been taken to the extreme levels. Electoral forecasting has also become intertwined with politics with many analysts and journalists becoming overtly partisan. The manifest partisanship of some pollsters and psephologists has rendered most opinion and exit polls meaningless. Yet, the show goes on. As long as the audience is there, there’s money to be made. Most view these polls much like they view the predictions of an astrologer. Who knows he may be right, he may be wrong, but let’s find out. Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be. The future’s not ours to see. But why not check it out? Some intelligent television anchors, once bitten twice shy, protect their reputation with the caveat that there is always a margin of error in all polls and this is only a survey. Voters in India are secretive. They say one thing, and do another. So on and so forth. A dozen different caveats have been invented to explain away an error of judgment in converting survey percentages into a tally of seats. For the first time this year, we see election forecasts and opinion polls being used as an instrument of the electoral campaign and propaganda. Numbers are being put out to convince voters that one side or the other is sure to win. This is being done with two different purposes in mind. One, to deflate the enthusiasm of the supporters of one’s opponent so as to discourage them from going out to vote; or, two, to enthuse the supporters of one’s own to get them to go out and vote. Lower turnouts in the first two phases have made all sides use manufactured forecasts to influence voter behaviour. Kishor entered this field pretending to be a commentator while in fact trying to be a player. He assumed he could respond to Thapar’s straight bat knocks with spin and googly. If he had shouted down his interlocutor on any other channel he may have got away with it, given that so few journalists are used to asking follow-up questions and countering statements with facts. Karan Thapar is not one to be cowed down. He is always armed with facts. Kishor got caught out.",

        "content": "The Senate Committee on Capital Market has cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of Frana Chukwuogor as Executive Commissioner (Legal and Enforcement). Mr Bola Ajomale as Executive Commissioner (Operations) and Mrs. Samiya Usman as Executive Commissioner (Corporate Services). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. His appointment as SEC DG has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1tn economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, his team was appointed by President Tinubu to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth. He said, “We are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointed by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market.” He described the capital market as the barometer of the economy, noting that the Commission would implement innovative polices and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Agama said, “You must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that.”",

        "content": "GOMA, Congo — In a makeshift nightclub in the hull of the overnight ferry from Goma to Bukavu, a handful of teenage boys are trying out some new moves. Some land, some don’t. When they don’t, the elderly man on the bench next to us nudges us and rolls his eyes, amused. The DJ, who has so far been playing the usual Afrobeats hits and Congolese rumba, whips out a more unexpected Communist crossover: the Russian Internationale — the pre-1944 Soviet national anthem — mixed with a Congolese beat. People immediately pack the dancefloor. Here in eastern Congo, enthusiasm is palpable for the “Russians,” a catch-all term for the roughly 1,000 Eastern European mercenaries stationed in Goma as well as actual Russian mercenaries embedded in other fragile states — and the Russian government, which it approved a tentative military cooperation agreement with Kinshasa. The reason is simple. Since 2022, this area has been mired in one of the world’s most catastrophic conflicts. , the M23 militia has raped and massacred its way through the North Kivu province and is edging nearer to the regional capital Goma — close enough that, the night before, we could hear the rumble of explosions outside the city. The conflict has displaced millions, wrecked lives and livelihoods and destroyed the modest tourist industry. Even the endangered mountain gorillas, the area’s most lucrative draw for visitors, have fled the besieged Virunga National Park to neighboring Rwanda. With international attention taken up by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, there is little interest in the crisis here and no hope of support from the West. The East African Community sent some soldiers early on, but the alliance quickly . Even the UN peacekeepers are packing up to leave. Congo is desperate for help, and the only groups keen to step in are mercenaries, Russian and otherwise, circling to see what they can gain. Increasingly, too, a complex web of military and commercial actors from Russia, China, UAE, the U.S., France, Bulgaria and Romania — the interests of which on paper should not overlap — appear to be working together to maximize this extraction. Historically, inviting in foreign militaries and especially mercenary groups has gone spectacularly badly throughout Africa. And while Russia may have pulled off an impressive PR feat by convincing Congolese citizens that it will be a genuine ally, its mercenary forces’ actions elsewhere on the continent tell a very different story. “The Wagner Group and other emerging Russia-backed forces and ‘advisers’ exploit the resources and people of African countries for their personal gain. They are a threat to stability and prosperity in countries where they are present,” a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said in an emailed statement. “These forces do not lower terrorism but rather exacerbate the threat by pursuing draconian, violent tactics. This results in dramatic increases of cyclical violence,” the spokesperson added. As Western countries sanctioned Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Kremlin began frantically military cooperation deals with various African nations. This included a May 2019 with Congo’s neighbor, Congo-Brazzaville/Republic of the Congo, that saw Russia send military specialists to the country and help maintain its Soviet-made equipment. The Kremlin it inked a similar agreement with Congo earlier this year. , Russia has also aggressively expanded its military presence across Africa through the Wagner Group, a collection of front companies and Russian mercenary outfits formerly owned by the late businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Once a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, Prigozhin launched the Wagner Group following the annexation of Crimea to further the Kremlin’s foreign policy goals even as sanctions piled up and the country became diplomatically isolated. The U.S. designated the Wagner Group as a transnational criminal organization in January 2023, and the Treasury connected individuals and companies. But by May last year, it was believed to have around mercenaries stationed in Africa — many of whom were former Russian soldiers and convicts. Wagner troops have been in Mali, Sudan, Central African Republic, Libya and Mozambique, and its mercenaries have been accused of torture, rape, child abduction and summary execution of civilians. Wagner-linked companies are involved in gold smuggling and illegal mineral exploitation, using Cameroon as a logistics and transport hub. The group also engaged in (through AFRIC, Prigozhin’s fake election monitoring organization) in Congo, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa. These activities tend to follow the same pattern, journalist Julia Steers said. “Get into a country that has a complex and protracted conflict that has been unsolvable by other countries by selling security personnel, services and training, and then once you are in the country you take advantage of what that country has to offer — by propaganda in the media and civil society there, by getting the political class on your side,” she says. That might be through exploitative businesses, as in the Central African Republic, she said, or straight-up resource extraction, as in Mali. But in any case, the question boils down to: “How can we take advantage of what this country has to offer once we have got our foot in the door through this security agreement?” Steers was formerly VICE News’ Nairobi bureau chief and has spent years investigating and interviewing Wagner employees across the region, gaining rare access to their operations on the ground. Wagner’s Africa strategy, Steers says, is to identify hotspots with vast mineral wealth that are beleaguered by conflict and present themselves as the solution. “In reality, what we’ve seen is that they often just prolong the conflict in a different way,” she said. The trick appears to be doing just enough to contain the worst militias that the population comes to accept abuse and exploitation as a necessary payoff. “When I was first in the Central African Republic, the sentiment was very much, ‘Russia very bad, Wagner very bad, they’re slaughtering us’,” Steers said. “But when the rebels almost took Bangui, it truly was Wagner that prevented it from falling. The perception on the ground — and the reality on the ground — was that they are doing something.” If a country is in dire enough straits, she said, the population starts to see “very, very incremental improvements” as a positive thing — “even at the cost of human rights.” Prigozhin and several Wagner commanders died when an apparent caused his private jet to crash in August 2023, two months after launching a short-lived mutiny that Putin called an act of treason. But the Wagner Group lives on in Africa and is now reportedly directly controlled by the Kremlin under the new name Africa Corps. In February, the BBC that General Andrei Averyanov, head of a Russian military intelligence unit that specializes in “targeting killings and destabilizing foreign governments,” had assumed leadership of Africa Corps and appeared to be striking deals with powerful warlords, coup leaders and military juntas in Libya, Burkina Faso, CAR, Mali and Niger to help consolidate control in return for signing away mineral rights to Russia. The Kremlin last June that the Russian state had no role Wagner/Africa Corp is hardly the first set of state-linked mercenaries to exploit security crises in African nations and gain access to valuable resources. During the 1960s, as the last of the European colonial powers were pushed out of Africa by independence movements, several scrambled for ways to cling to whatever power they could, fearing that newly independent African states would align themselves with the Communist U.S.S.R. Today, the private security contracting business in Congo is booming. The American Erik Prince, formerly of the notorious Blackwater group, was alleged by a UN report to have been MONUSCO peacekeeping services to potentially fill their role with his mercenaries. The most prominent actor currently on the ground however is Horatiu Potra, the Romanian mercenary who openly operates his armed private security firm, Asociatia RALF, in eastern Congo. The armed security operators are officially there as military instructors and to guard key infrastructure like airports. But, from on-the-ground observations, they were also taking part in active combat missions in North Kivu. The risk of foreign fighters operating inside Congo was brought to international attention this month when U.S. citizen Christian Malanga was shot dead while leading in Kinshasha. Another three U.S. citizens were detained by Congolese forces. The motivations and wider support for the group involved in this failed attempt to seize power remain unclear, but the operation stands as a reminder that, even in 2024, foreign actors are still using armed force to gain control in this mineral-rich state. Russia will capitalize on situations like this when it many Western companies, governments, militaries and certainly private security forces operating in Africa of selfishness and exploitation. The problem is that they have made it clear, at every juncture, that they will do the same. “If Africa Corps, formerly Wagner, were to arrive in the DRC, their objectives would be the same as they have been elsewhere — and even more so — which is to strengthen and extend the influence of the Russian state and show the West as feckless and self-interested, although Russia is feckless and extremist, and really acting like a neo-colonial power in Africa,” says Vanda Felbab-Brown, co-director of the Africa Security Initiative at the Brookings Institution in Washington. And while ideologically opposed countries — especially the U.S. and France on one side and Russia and China on the other — disparage each other’s predatory inclinations, behind the scenes, their most vocally patriotic mercenary leaders and mining investors appear more than happy to work together, forging dangerous alliances in spite of, rather than in support of, their respective countries’ interests. Back in Goma, outside a building that locals identify as a “Russian” base, a mercenary with an Eastern European accent smirks when we ask him if he’s Russian or Romanian. “It doesn’t matter where I’m from,” he says. “All that matters is that as long as we’re here, you’re safe.” In a sense, it’s true — no matter where these mercenaries are from, the outcome will be the same. Rebel militias might be held back, at least a little, at least for a time — and in the long term, the country will see even more of its wealth and resources slip away into foreign hands. But here in eastern Congo, where the most pressing priority is keeping the wolf from the door, it’s a risk politicians and the public appear willing to take.",

        "content": "An Egyptian soldier was killed during a clash with Israeli troops at a Gaza border crossing on Monday while an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 40 Palestinians at a camp for displaced people, further inflaming regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Egypt’s military confirmed that a border guard died at the Rafah border crossing on Monday, in bloodshed that threatened to escalate tensions with Israel. Separately, the airstrike at the camp northwest of the Gazan city of Rafah drew international condemnation. Israel acknowledged the death of dozens of people in the strike, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “a tragic mistake” in an address to the Knesset. Israeli leaders said they were still investigating both incidents. In the border clash, the Israel Defense Forces said “a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border,” and that discussions with Egypt were ongoing, without giving any more detail. Israel said the airstrike late Sunday at a Rafah tent community was based on “precise intelligence” and that it killed two “senior” officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union. But governments across the world were quick to condemn Israel for the strike. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged,” while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified.” The White House said in a statement that images of innocent civilians killed in the strike were “heartbreaking.” “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” the National Security Council said in a statement. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Israeli troops started operations around the outskirts of Rafah, which lies in southern Gaza, early this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will attack the city because it’s the last bastion of Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group, and several thousand of its fighters are lodged there. The U.S. and other countries fear mass casualties among the Palestinian civilians in Rafah and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail an assault to prevent harm to innocents. The White House said Monday it was “actively engaging” with the IDF and partners in the region to better assess what had occured. The U.S. and others have also voiced concerns about an Israeli attack on Rafah worsening ties with Egypt. The two Middle Eastern countries signed a peace deal in 1979, which is seen as crucial to Israel’s security. Egypt has been highly vocal of the war in Gaza and consistently called on Israel to agree to a cease-fire. The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. Israel’s counterattack has killed some 35,000 Gazans, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. (With assistance from Justin Sink.) ©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

Canton Central Catholic, 16-1 and Copley, 18-8 Up next: Winner advances to the Division II Region 5 final to take (2) Rocky River and (7) Toledo St. John’s on May 30. Outlook: For the first time in two years, Olmsted Falls will go on the road for a regional tournament game. With a 10-1 record in the regional tournament since 2023, the Bulldogs will put its Division II state championship defense on the line, on the road. They only had one loss at home all season. Road games are a different matter, as it went 2-7. The wins were against Bay (15-5) and a 10-9 overtime victory against Walsh Jesuit. One of the seven losses was against Wooster. However, the 12-4 loss happened in mid-April. Since then, Olmsted Falls won eight of its next 11 games. The most recent was a 13-2 victory against No. 5 seed Medina Highland. Olmsted Falls appears to have a found its fighting spirit. The question is if its championship DNA is there, too. The Bulldogs are led by Jameson DeMarco, who has a total of 72 points and is committed to Cleveland State. Jake Bill, Aidan Toth, Jonathan Blevins and Bryce Gulliford round out the attack. They fired on all cylinders against Highland and caused numerous matchup problems. Tiffin recruit Jack Birch was a force for groundballs. Goalie Caden Vinci holds the program’s single-season saves record at 166. Wooster has lost two games all season to Rocky River (7-6) and Chagrin Falls (12-6). The Generals come in riding on a five-game winning streak. The offense is spearheaded by Cooper Laughlin at 90 point, 67 of which are goals. Teammates Liam Harwoo (67 points), Braylon Dawson (49) and Drew Thomas (46) have at least 40 points on the season. Logan Beery is a sophomore at the faceoff spot and has won 84.1% of them. Wooster won 80% of its faceoffs against Olmsted Falls and Dawson scored five goals in the regular season win. If Olmsted Falls can come out with a win, this would be monumental for the program.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. \"Bill Walton,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said, \"was truly one of a kind.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career, disrupted by chronic foot injuries, lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. Raptors star RJ Barrett, family mourning death of younger brother \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" 'Relentless energy' They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, \"Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. Warriors assistant coach Dejan Milojević dead at 46 after heart attack \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a \"Deadhead.\" And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the \"Conference of Champions\" and loved it all the way to the end. \"It doesn't get any better than this,\" he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Won his first 73 college games Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA's dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton's UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins' extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. \"My teammates ΓÇa made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,\" Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. \"The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.\" Legendary Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight dead at 83 More basketball coverage He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game's greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. \"Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,\" Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. \"Playing basketball with Larry Bird,\" Walton once said, \"is like singing with Jerry Garcia,\" referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke, a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "content": "AMN / Ahmedabad Gujarat High Court on Monday said it had no faith in the state machinery, which gets into action only when innocent lives are lost. A special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai asked the Rajkot Municipal Corporation whether it had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity, after the RMC’s lawyer submitted that the TRP gaming zone had not asked for requisite permissions. The court said the state machinery gets into action only after innocent lives are lost. The HC was hearing a suo motu PIL on the deadly fire. Earlier, it had called it a “man-made disaster”. The court also observed on Monday that all the Rajkot municipal commissioners, from the time the TRP gaming zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) “should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred”, and directed them to furnish separate affidavits. On Monday, a counsel pointed out that the incident required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps. The court then said, “Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,” the court observed. Meanwhile Gujarat government on Monday shunted out five officials, including Rajkot Police Commissioner Raju Bhargava and two other IPS officers, after a massive fire at a game zone facility killed 28 people, including four children. Bhargava has been replaced by IPS officer Brijesh Kumar Jha. Additional Commissioner of Police (Administration, Traffic and Crime) Vidhi Choudhary and DCP-Zone 2 Sudhirkumar J Desai have also been transferred, officials said. According to police, the gaming zone did not have the required fire safety clearance from the city’s municipal corporation at the time of the incident. While the gaming zone owners had submitted bills to the police for fire safety equipment and claimed to have installed such equipment on the premises, the process for obtaining the necessary Fire NOC (No Objection Certificate) was underway, but had not been completed. It is suspected that the fire might have started due to a short circuit, but officials said that the exact cause will be known only after a probe. The action comes a day after Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel visited the site and instructed the officials to take strict action against those responsible for the horrific incident. The police have arrested the gaming zone’s owner – Yuvraj Singh Solanki, and his manager – Nitin Jain, under various charges, including culpable homicide. “An FIR has also been registered against four other accused under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), and 114 (abettor present when offense is committed) of the Indian Penal Code,” a police official said. The six individuals against whom the case was registered by the Rajkot taluka police in the wee hours of Sunday are Dhaval Corporation proprietor Dhaval Thakkar, Raceway Enterprise partners Ashoksinh Jadeja, Kiritsinh Jadeja, Prakashchand Hiran, Yuvrajsinh Solanki and Rahul Rathod. The state has announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each deceased. The Central Government has also announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased person. Gujarat Congress has demanded that senior civic and state officials and office-bearers of the ruling BJP be named in the FIR registered in the Rajkot gaming zone fire, stressing that action against junior-level employees is meaningless.",

        "content": "NEW YORK -- While has remained one of the most productive hitters in the majors this season, he continues making progress in his recovery to getting back on the mound after Tommy John surgery. The superstar said he started throwing from 60 feet last week and reached 80 mph. \"Just progressively increasing the distance,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter Monday before the Dodgers' series opener against the was postponed. \"Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance. Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I'm not quite sure how far I'm going to go out there, but that's the progression.\" Ohtani underwent the elbow surgery last September as a member of the after going 10-5 with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts in 132 innings across 23 starts. He is limited to only hitting this season and is on pace to post the best offensive year of his major league career. Ohtani, 29, entered Monday leading the majors in batting average (.336) and total bases (131) in 53 games as the Dodgers' designated hitter. He was tops in the National League in slugging percentage (.621), OPS (1.024) and OPS+ (188). Ohtani has recently played through a hamstring contusion he suffered when he was hit by a pickoff throw last week. He has remained in the lineup, but Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters over the weekend that he was advised to not push the hamstring. Ohtani said the injury has affected his running but not his swing. \"It's getting better day by day,\" he said. \"Today is definitely a lot better than yesterday.\"",

The initial thought was Tyson could have been removed from the plane at that time, but that detail was never confirmed. Later, representatives confirmed the initial delay in taking off had to do with an \"air conditioning issue\" and not with the medical issue Tyson suffered. Around 30 minutes before the flight landed in Los Angeles, an announcement came on the loudspeaker and on screens asking if there was a doctor on board the aircraft. about the medical issue, as a source told the publication, \"Mike had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded. Before the paramedics arrived the flight issued an announcement asking for a doctor — the message even came on everyone's screens.\" Paramedics apparently boarded the flight and attended to Tyson, leaving passengers on the plane for an additional 25 minutes. There are no further details about what the ulcer flare-up caused for Tyson, but it sounds like he got the right care. This is a scary situation for anyone Tyson's age (57), but even more for a man who's been gearing up to enter the boxing ring again. Tyson is set to face off against boxer and YouTube star Jake Paul on July 20 in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on . There have been multiple videos of Tyson training in preparation for his return to the boxing ring. The biggest concern for the legendary boxer is his age. Many believe Tyson could get hurt in the ring against a much younger fighter. At least his publicly available training videos have revealed that Tyson, the undisputed heavyweight champion from 1987-90, still appears to be in top shape. Still, questions remain. The airplane incident might indicate a more serious underlying medical issue that could keep Tyson from boxing. Texas' equivalent of a boxing commission The Department of Licensing and Regulation also states that \"contestants who are age 36 or older, must submit a report of favorable physical testing including, but not limited to, an EEG (electroencephalography), and an EKG (electrocardiogram).\" Monday's incident might prompt the department to look into details of what occurred, and see if it is consistent with any records Tyson has already submitted in preparation for his fight. The good news is Tyson appears to be in good health, and he was taken care of by the paramedics on the plane.

        "content": "NEW YORK – Shohei Ohtani missed a game with lower back tightness but has played through a bruised hamstring for more than a week. But he doesn’t blame that for a .211 average (8 for 38) over his past 10 games. “I don’t think so. Obviously, the leg isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” he said through his interpreter early Monday afternoon at Citi Field before news that the day’s game had been postponed. The Dodgers and Mets will play a doubleheader on Tuesday. Ohtani said his left hamstring is “getting better day by day.” His back issue caused him to miss the Dodgers’ game May 12 in San Diego but he said it feels “pretty good” now. “I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,” Ohtani said. Most of that pre-game work is done in areas off limits to the media and he almost never takes batting practice on the field with the team. So Ohtani’s most visible work is the throwing program he started in late March, six months after undergoing his second Tommy John surgery. Every other day, Ohtani throws briefly on the field. At this point, he has increased the number of throws since playing catch for the first time on March 25 but is still throwing from less than 60 feet. “Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance,” Ohtani said. “Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there, but that’s the progression. “Last week, I got to 60 feet and was able to throw 80 mph.” Even with his recent slump, Ohtani leads the majors in batting average (.336) and total bases (131) and the National League in slugging percentage (.621) and OPS (1.024). He also has stolen 13 bases, halfway to matching his career-high for a full season. It’s the best offensive start of his career but Ohtani doesn’t necessarily attribute that to being able to focus on hitting and not devoting any time or energy to also pitching. “It’s hard to say at this point,” he said. “I have to play a full season to see if I could really say that.” Ohtani could progress to throwing to hitters in simulated-game settings as soon as September but the Dodgers have said he will not pitch in games again until 2025. He does miss pitching, Ohtani acknowledged. “I think any starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game you start,” he said Monday. “In a sense, I do miss that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focusing on progressing every day and really focusing on that.” Related Articles Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers’ game in New York postponed; doubleheader on Tuesday Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers’ losing streak reaches five as Reds complete sweep Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers doing much better job of controlling running game this season Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers’ offensive slump continues as losing streak reaches four Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani dealing with hamstring injury NEW YORK Visiting New York for the first time since news of the scandal involving his former interpreter and friend Ippei Mizuhara, Ohtani was asked by the local media how he has been able to perform so well on the field while dealing with the upheaval in his personal life. “I think what affected me the most was not being able to sleep well,” he said in a familiar response. “Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities and I have every confidence in my own ability to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.”",

        "description": "The Yankees rotation without Gerrit Cole is now on the offensive during a dominant stretch that has played a key role in the club’s recent surge.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM, Calif. — So much for just holding down the fort. The Yankees rotation without Gerrit Cole is now on the offensive during a dominant stretch that has played a key role in the club’s recent surge. Yankees starters have gone 14 straight games in which they have thrown at least five innings and allowed two or fewer runs, tying the MLB record since 1893, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Nestor Cortes will get the ball on Tuesday against the Angels and try to make it 15, which would surpass the 2022 Mets, 1968 Pirates and 1907 Phillies. “It’s been nice, each guy’s been building on the last one,” pitching coach Matt Blake said Sunday before Clarke Schmidt took a shutout into the sixth inning in what became a 5-2 loss to the Padres . “I feel like they’ve got a nice rapport going as a group and they’re all committed to helping each other. The conversations are good. It just feels like they’ve gotten into a good rhythm and each one’s building off the last.” The Yankees entered Monday’s off day with the second-lowest starter ERA in the majors at 2.72. The only rotation that had been better at preventing runs was the Phillies (2.69), who were also the only team that had won more games than the Yankees. But the group of Cortes, Luis Gil, Carlos Rodon, Marcus Stroman and Schmidt have taken their starts to another level of late, with 18 of their last 21 starts going for at least five innings and allowing two or fewer runs. “It’s been really all year,” manager Aaron Boone said. “It’s like virtually every day they’ve given us an opportunity to win a game. But what we’ve seen over the last couple weeks and now this turn in the rotation, they’ve been remarkable. Ultimately it starts on the bump and starts with that starting pitcher. They’re the reason — it starts with them — why we’ve been off to this kind of start.” During this 14-game stretch alone, the Yankees rotation has posted a 0.84 ERA with 84 strikeouts and 24 walks across 85 2⁄3 innings. In eight of those outings, the starter has not allowed an earned run. The Yankees are 11-3 during that span. “I think we’re all just a bunch of starters who know we can be elite in this game,” Stroman said. “The flow of information, the pitching coaches and the staff, everything’s so dialed in here. I think we all feel really confident when we go out there each and every start.” Sign up for Inside the Yankees by Greg Joyce, exclusively on Sports+. Please provide a valid email address.

Of course, it doesn’t hurt when the Yankees offense has been rolling the way it has lately, usually giving its pitchers an early lead to work with. “Really, the stretch we’ve been on with those guys [the starters], we’ve just been riding their high,” Alex Verdugo said. “They’re out there dominating, getting us in the dugout to hit that much quicker.” But what makes the run the starters are on even more impressive is that they are doing it without the reigning AL Cy Young winner throwing a pitch — though Cole has played a role in this as an extra pitching coach in the dugout, bullpen sessions and clubhouse. Cole is making good progress in his return from the elbow nerve inflammation that shut him down in March, as he is expected to face hitters again this week (likely on Thursday) before potentially starting a rehab assignment on June 4. That puts him on track to return possibly by the end of June or beginning of July if all goes well. In the meantime, the current five starters have put their heads down, stayed healthy and given the Yankees a chance to win on just about every night. “It’s almost like they all kind of sensed that we’ve got to step up with Cole not there and they’ve all risen to the occasion,” Blake said. “I think they’re just every day putting one step forward and not worrying about when Cole is going to be back and what that even indicates for any of them. Just keep doing their job on a nightly basis throwing up zeroes an inning at a time.”",

        "content": "NECA reiterated its commitment to the previously proposed N57,000 minimum wage, which represents a substantial 90% increase. Mr. Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, NECA’s Director-General, highlighted the ongoing economic difficulties faced by the private sector, including rising interest rates, escalating logistics costs, increasing energy tariffs, and excessive taxes and fees. Oyerinde emphasized that the prevailing N30,000 minimum wage was already straining businesses, with many experiencing losses and closures. He warned that meeting the NLC’s demands would jeopardize enterprise sustainability and job security. In light of this, NECA urged the tripartite committee to prioritize job creation and security during minimum wage negotiations. Oyerinde stressed the urgent need to address the country’s rising unemployment rate and emphasized the importance of enhancing the private sector’s capacity to generate employment. Furthermore, he underscored the importance of productivity as a key factor in determining wage increases. According to him, efforts should be directed towards retaining employment and implementing government interventions in transportation, food security, and macroeconomic stability. In previous negotiations, the Federal Government proposed a new minimum wage of N48,000, while organized labour initially demanded N615,000 before reducing it to N500,000. However, ongoing discussions between the government and labour unions have led to the government offering around N57,000, with negotiations still ongoing.

Get the latest news on Jamie and Claire every week - sign up to our weekly Everything Outlander We have more newsletters Get the latest news on Jamie and Claire every week - sign up to our weekly Everything Outlander We have more newsletters Edinburgh's Craigmillar Castle, a filming location for the popular series Outlander was crowned the city's top 'hidden gem' according to a study by Bokun, part of the Tripadvisor family. The castle, which served as Ardsmuir Prison in the show's third season, topped the list of lesser-known beauty spots worldwide recommended by tourists. Bokun analysed over 1,000 local destinations using Tripadvisor reviews containing the phrase 'hidden gem', revealing the best places to travel worldwide according to real consumers. Other Edinburgh locations recognised on the list included Dean Village Historical Site, Gladstone's Land, Jupiter Artland and the Museum On The Mound. Scotland was revealed as the fourth most likely place worldwide to spot a 'hidden gem', claiming 4% of the total wonders. England took first place with 33% of total wonders, followed by the United States (31%) and Ireland (6%). Andencraig Gardens in Rothesay emerged as Scotland's ultimate 'hidden gem', with 17% of all reviews showering it with praise. It comes as Outlander executive Matthew B Roberts debunked a 'missing' Young Ian scene which had to be slotted in post-filming. The first part of the seventh series, premiered on Starz and Lionsgate+ on June 16, 2023, resuming the story of Jamie (Sam Heughan) and Claire Fraser (Caitriona Balfe) , amongst others. In the fifth episode titled, Singapore, Jamie's nephew, Young Ian (John Bell), was tasked with delivering a letter to influential Mohawk Thayandenegea in the Mohawk village. Ian is full of apprehension about having to return and face Work With Her Hands (Morgan Holmstrom), although the orders were clear and must be followed. Before setting off, Ian seeks counsel from Claire at Fort Ticonderoga regarding his concerns, a scene that was later incorporated into the series, reports the Express . Matthew B Roberts, executive producer, discussed this matter on the official Outlander podcast, saying: \"There was a moment where in the original script, this scene didn't exist.\" He added: \"And when we watched the episode, we realised, 'Oh we need to get Ian to the Mohawk village' and in the original cut, he just showed up with the information that he's finding out here.\" \"And he's already had that information in the scene and it just felt like something was missing.\" \"So we created this scene to give him the angst actually, we also needed there to be a dilemma for him.\" \"'Do I go or do I not go, because of who I might see there?\" Roberts added.\" \"So we wrote that scene and inserted it into the cut after we saw the original show put together.\" Upon his arrival to the village, Ian was met with a warm welcome by his Mohawk spouse Work With Her Hands who expressed happiness and pride, now mothering a son and a newborn daughter. Ian was introduced to her child and the similarities between him and the tot immediately became clear - inevitably leading to the conclusion that he was the father. Despite being unable to play an active role in raising his offspring, it was unmistakable how pleased Ian felt knowing he was a father. The seventh series has only reached its midpoint, with part two still awaiting streaming and no official return date set in stone. The end series seven part one marks the commencement of the ultimate journey as Outlander is destined to end with the eighth instalilty, with the cameras expected to roll in 2024.

The governing body had previously announced that Jack Hanratty would step down after this summer’s Olympics to take over the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees women’s team. Barrieau joined the sevens squad as an assistant coach in May 2023 from Concordia University’s women’s rugby team. Rugby Canada said Barrieau was chosen by its high-performance staff and Own the Podium prior to the Olympics to “ensure stability and facilitate strategy planning for the women’s sevens program following Paris 2024.” The Canadian women currently stand fifth in the HSBC SVNS season standings after six events. They have been drawn in a pool with No. 1 New Zealand, the fourth-ranked U.S. and No. 8 Britain in the season’s grand final that starts Friday at Civitas Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. While the women take part in a “winner-takes-all” eight-team competition in Madrid to decide the series champion, the Canadian men will be fighting to remain in the world sevens series. Canada, currently at the bottom of the 12-team men’s standings, will join the ninth-place U.S., No. 10 Spain and No. 11 Samoa and the winning teams from the World Rugby HSBC Sevens Challenger Series — Chile, Germany, Kenya and Uruguay — in a relegation playoff to decide four core teams in 2025. The Canadian men will face Germany, Uruguay and the U.S. in Pool A in Madrid. The Canadian women qualified for the Paris Olympics by blanking Mexico 53-0 last August in the final of the 2023 Rugby Americas North Sevens. The Canadian men are headed to a last-ditch Olympic qualifier June 21-23 in Monaco. — This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 . The Canadian Press",

Dunne was in New York and Florida for multiple red-carpet events with Sports Illustrated. The tour was to celebrate the launch of the 2024 Swimsuit edition of the magazine which she modeled in . She showed off in multiple red-carpet pictures alongside models Paige Spiranac , Xandra Pohl , Camille Kostek , and Brooks Nader . Fans shared their admiration for Dunne in her Instagram comments after the red-carpet events. \"Keep it up Livvy,\" one fan said. \"Obsessed you’re so hot,\" another fan said. \"Whoa, that's a whole lot of beautiful captured in one photo,\" a third fan said. \"Y'all both look amazing!\" a fourth fan said. \"She's just perfect I say!!\" a fifth fan said. Dunne took some time off from her modeling duties to go support her boyfriend Paul Skenes in Pittsburgh . \"Back in the Burgh!\" she said in a post before taking in her boyfriend's start. Olivia Dunne and Paul Skenes managed to keep their relationship a secret before finally going public last summer. The pair met at LSU, but it's not clear when they started dating. Rumors of a romance began when Dunne watched LSU win the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska last summer. And Dunne then posted selfies from Fort Myers in Florida, where Skenes was playing. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates and began his pro career by playing in minor leagues in the Sunshine State. The final clue came when Dunne posed in a Pirates cap before the pair finally went public. Skenes is blowing people away to start his MLB rookie season in major league baseball. The former LSU fireballer has 21 strikeouts in 16 innings pitched over three games. He has only allowed four earned runs, giving him an ERA of 2.25. In his second start on May 17, Skenes pitched six innings and didn't allow a single run or hit while striking out 11 batters.",

        "description": "Hundreds braved the rain for the city's annual Memorial Day parade, one of dozens that were scheduled around the state Monday.",
        "content": "Phil Spiller Jr. joked that it was a “beautiful Navy day” as it began to rain over Riverbank Park in Westbrook. But the cold and constant drizzle did not stop hundreds from lining the city’s Main Street for the annual Memorial Day parade and ceremonies. On Monday, dozens of Memorial Day events were held around the state, including more than 20 in southern Maine. Mark McGill, of Falmouth, takes his hat off during the gun salute at the Memorial Day ceremony held at Riverbank Park in Westbrook on Monday. McGill served in the Coast Guard, Navy, as a Merchant Marine, and in the Coast Guard Auxiliary. Brianna Soukup/Staff Photographe The events were to honor the hundreds of thousands of men and women who have died in combat, including those from Maine. In Westbrook, a large memorial greets those who enter Riverbank Park and reminds them of Westbrook’s history of fallen soldiers. One plaque represents the roughly 1,900 Westbrook residents who fought in both World Wars. More than 50 of them died in combat. Many of Monday’s events were led and organized by veterans. Spiller, the master of ceremonies for Westbrook’s post-parade gathering, is a Navy veteran. Several members of Westbrook’s two American Legion posts spoke during the ceremonies. And veteran couple Susan and Nelson Graham led Monday morning’s parade as co-grand marshals . The Grahams met while stationed at Fort Monroe in Virginia in the 1960s. They have lived in Westbrook for decades and volunteered as EMTs at Westbrook Rescue. Commander Dennis Marrotte from the Stephen W. Manchester Post 62 of the American Legion recalled various men who died in combat or shortly after returning home, including a Westbrook sergeant who died in Iraq. “It really hits home how long a history Westbrook has, serving this country,” said Marrotte. Spiller recalled when a list of Westbrook’s fallen was read during a local church service the Sunday before Memorial Day. “Today, on Memorial Day, we continue this heritage,” Spiller said during the ceremony. The ceremony speakers shared a prayer for those who have died in combat. They recited the Pledge of Allegiance and played Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA.” They read out loud ‘In Flanders Fields,’ a poem that Lieutenant-Colonel John McRae wrote during World War I. Families line Main Street to watch the Memorial Day Parade in Westbrook on Monday. Brianna Soukup/Staff Photographe “They gave their tomorrow for us today,” said Chaplain Phil LeClerc from Post 62. “This really is a special day that we could never forget.” After the parade ended, as some left Main Street and others migrated toward Riverbank Park, Ron Cote and Tom Haskell looked over the Westbrook Veterans’ Brick Memorial. Cote and Haskell are both from Westbrook, and both are veterans. Cote served in the Navy and Haskell in the U.S. Air Force. They said they know many who have served, including those who have died and those still living. Cote’s father has a brick at the memorial. His name and years of service are engraved on it. “When me and my buddy Tom were young boys, this (parade) was a big deal,” said Cote. “I’m glad it’s still going, to keep their memories alive.” Veteran couple to lead Westbrook’s Memorial Day parade Success.

        "content": "Don’t let these faulty locations sabotage your signal. Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters If you've ever had an issue with your wi-fi signal, it could all be down to where your router is placed. Tech guru Trevor Cooke, from EarthWeb , has shared his expert advice on where to put your wifi router for the best signal - and where to avoid. Whilst a router probably isn’t the prettiest accessory in the room, which is why many tend to hide them away in a more inconspicuous spot, this is where the issue lies. Many people don’t know is that routers need a clear “line of sight” in order to work properly. This means the answer to what is affecting your wi-fi signal could be as simple as nudging your router to a slightly different location. Apple is launching new tablets with a refreshed iPad Air and all-new iPad Pro hitting UK stores. The iPad Air now boasts a more powerful M2 chip housed within its aluminium chassis, increased standard storage, new colours, improved connectivity and extended battery life. For the first time, this tablet also comes in two sizes including a standard 11-inch display and a much larger 13-inch panel. If you're looking to go Pro, there's a significant upgrade with the 2024 range featuring a super slim design, a greatly enhanced OLED screen that's brighter and an incredibly fast M4 processor which makes these tablets faster than most PC laptops. One deal that piqued our interest comes from Sky who are offering the 11-inch Air with Wi-Fi and Cellular from just £17 per month with no upfront fee and 100MB of data included as well. You can learn more about the iPad Air deal on Sky's website here. This deal is based on a 48-month contract, with the total cost over four years coming to £816 - in comparison, the same tablet from Apple costs £749, but this doesn't include any data and requires an upfront payment. Sky also offers other deals, including the 13-inch Air for £21 per month or the Pro for £27 per month. As we've previously noted, Sky isn't the only network offering iPads on contract, with Vodafone and EE also providing customers with the option to purchase these devices via a monthly plan. Many people prefer to keep their unsightly routers out of view. Yet, concealing them behind a closed door or wall can significantly diminish the signal strength. Moreover, placing your Wi-Fi router in a confined space may lead to overheating and reduced performance. Think of it like this, if you can’t see the router, it can’t see your electronic device, and the signal won’t be as good as it could be. Perhaps your kitchen is centrally located, making it appear to be the ideal location. However, the wifi signal can be significantly disrupted by the radio waves emitted from certain appliances. The primary culprit is the microwave, which generates radio waves that can greatly affect the stability of your wifi router's signal. The expert says: \"Putting your wi-fi router on the windowsill is a bad idea because it can easily be affected by weather or other nearby networks. The same rule goes for any other exterior walls lining your house. The more central your router is inside the house, the better.\" Join the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. Keep your router away from nearby bathrooms or any other location where it can come into contact with water. This includes aquariums, fish tanks, or even vases. The first reason why is obvious: electronics and water together are a big no-no. Cooke adds: \"Many people don’t know that water can be a great hindrance to your wi-fi signal, essentially acting as a barricade. Not to mention, the humidity from these types of locations damages the router over time.\" Wi-fi routers are made to emit their signals in every direction. Therefore hiding your router away in the corner will basically only be able to reach half of its full capability. The other half of the signal will be absorbed by the wall, greatly reducing your signal strength.This could mean that some areas of your house may experience “dead zones” or a weaker connection. Cooke suggests keeping your router in a central, ground floor room of the house so its signal can reach all the rooms. Another option is to prop it up on a high shelf closer to the ceiling. That way it’s still tucked out of sight, being above your sight line, while still having an open area where the signal is unobstructed by walls and furniture.

        "description": "On the Underground, written by the late Scottish composer Harry Barry, celebrated the launch of the city’s ultra-modern Clockwork Orange on TV and radio in 1980.",
        "content": "A song from more than 40 years ago is making a comeback as part of Subway's £288 million modernisation scheme. On the Underground, written by the late Scottish composer Harry Barry, celebrated the launch of the city’s ultra-modern on TV and radio in 1980. Now the cheery ditty is back centre stage in a social media campaign as Strathclyde Partnership for Transport bids farewell to the old fleet and welcomes 17 new bespoke alongside planned upgrades along the line. The first of the new trains carried passengers in December 2023 with the new trains, currently running alongside the legacy fleet, expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2024. The current fleet is partially automatic but will move to Unattended Train Operations (UTO) only once the new full system is in place. SPT’s Director of Transport Operations, Richard Robinson said: “We are delighted to be able to use Harry Barry’s song celebrating our legacy fleet as we prepare to say goodbye to these much-loved trains from the system. “We’d like to thank Harry’s family for letting us use the track which was commissioned to mark the last modernisation of the Subway. We’re bringing this cheerful song to a brand-new audience.” The musician, of Uddingston, Lanarkshire, died suddenly in 2013, but has a huge back catalogue as a writer and producer in a career spanning 50 years. It’s not the first time one of his compositions has had a resurgence. Harry’s football anthem European Song, which celebrated Aberdeen FC’s victory in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final in 1983, featured in the film Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In, which premiered in 2021. Harry’s daughter Kate, said: “We’re delighted that dad’s memory lives on in his music. He wrote hundreds of jingles and songs during his career. His compositions have stood the test of time. “He was a very talented man.” The song is now on Glasgow Subway Instagram and platforms.",

        "description": "Not many people try to run four half marathons in a year, however breast cancer survivor Michelle Rickett is defying...The post Running for her life appeared first on Wyndham.",
        "content": "Not many people try to run four half marathons in a year, however breast cancer survivor Michelle Rickett is defying the odds and smashing her goals to raise funds for the organisations which have helped cure her cancer. It has been eight years since Williamstown North resident Michelle was diagnosed with stage three triple-negative breast cancer. Unlike other cancers, Michelle’s does not allow her to take hormone replacements which means she must produce her own natural hormones. To keep the cancer away following her radiation and chemotherapy treatments, Michelle’s oncologist told her the best way to stay healthy is through exercise. “If I exercise I produce the natural hormone that helps stop my cancer from recurring,” she explained. “So it is basically down to me to stop mine from coming back, and unfortunately triple-negative is one of the highest recurring cancers.” Backed by research, Michelle’s oncologist said exercise is a highly effective way to prevent the cancer from returning. However, given how rare Michelle’s cancer is, the research is limited, which is why she is on a mission to do as much charity fundraising as she can between the two organisations which have helped her the most, Cancer Council and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Triple-negative breast cancer is a ultra rare form of breast cancer which is typically hereditary. Thankfully, Michelle hasn’t passed the gene onto her daughters Antonia and Jodie. “Stage three is as pretty bad as it gets apart from death,” she said. “So four days after I finished chemo I went for a four kilometre walk with my kids, then I did a couple of five kilometre walks and then I did my first 10 kilometre exactly a year after finishing my treatments.” Michelle slowly worked her way up to a half marathon and is now on a mission to run four this year. “I just did my first along the Great Ocean Road and my next will be the Run Melbourne half-marathon,” she said. “Each time I get to the end and I just think, ’bloody hell how did I do this?’ “But my motto is if cancer can’t kill me, then this isn’t going to kill me. Running has got nothing on cancer, so I just keep running.” With each half marathon she completes, Michelle has decided to split her fundraising efforts to donate to all the charities which have helped her with her cancer. “For my Run Melbourne marathon in July I will be donating to Cancer Council and then for the last two I will be donating to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre,” she said. “I wanted to split my efforts across the two charities which have really helped me through my treatment. “I like to make sure that I’m giving back because they rely a lot on people’s generosity.” Originally from Cornwall, England, Michelle and husband Andrew moved to Melbourne 12 years ago, which she said saved her life. “If it wasn’t for the amazing medical services here, I would actually be dead,” she said. “Everything happens so quickly here. I was diagnosed with cancer on a Monday and I was being operated on the Friday. “I don’t take anything for granted. I always think I am really privileged and lucky to be here. “And if I lived in England I unfortunately don’t think I would have got the service I did here.” With her next half marathon less than two months away, Michelle is ready to smash her own time goal. “I am feeling really good. I have a goal I am aiming for which is what I have been training for,” she said. “My husband says it’s an obsession, a lot of people can be addicted to some really bad things, all I am addicted to is running.” Details: Jennifer Pittorino",

For the second time in about a month, the popular park created to assist those in the community with special needs has been vandalized, police said. City of Belleville municipal parks staff reached out to police Monday morning after graffiti was discovered again. Staff provided police with CCTV footage and a still image of the suspect, who painted distinctive markings on the roll-up doors and walls of an outbuilding at the site, similar to those from an incident in April.

        "content": "You could be flying down the highway in a sparkling, new 2024 Porsche Cayenne while at the same time helping the province’s young skiers fly down the slopes all across the world. BC Alpine, in partnership with Alpine Canada, is holding a fundraising raffle —the deadline is June 15—that has several prizes, the most luxurious of which is the 2024 Porsche Cayenne, valued at more than $126,000. “It’s a beautiful prize,” BC Alpine chief executive officer Anders Hestdalen says. “Either you care about skiing, which is great, or you want to win a Porsche. This is a great opportunity.” The money raised from ticket sales will go toward supporting both grassroots and high-level skiing in the province, which supplies the Olympic team with one-third of its athletes. There are also 32 ski clubs in the province, which means some of the proceeds will fund the organization’s race events, coaches, officials and programs. “B.C. has done really well,” Hestdalen says. “We’ve never had more skiers registered over the past two, three years in the province. So I would say it’s very healthy, but like all sports, prices are increasing and we just want to make sure we can offer programming for athletes when funding is staying the same or going down.” The Porsche, provided by Porsche Centre Vancouver, is Carrera white metallic and features a black leather interior, bringing its value to $126,075. Additional prizes include a commemorative bar of silver weighing 100 troy ounces, valued at approximately $3,052 and sponsored by Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. Also up for grabs are high-quality Rossignol Sender Ti 184CM skis, valued at $1,000, and a BC Ski Team Karbon uniform jacket and pants, valued at $1,050. Tickets are available now, priced at one for $50, three for $135, and five for $200, with a maximum of 17,000 tickets available for sale. The draw will be held on Saturday, June 15, at 4 p.m. at BC Alpine’s headquarters in Vancouver. And when you see a B.C. athlete standing on the podium in Italy in 2026 or taking part in a local ski race at SilverStar or Big White, you can know that you played a role in making it happen. “This supports the best athletes in the country from B.C. who are going to win medals at the Olympics,” Hestdalen says, “all the way down to the club level.” Purchase your tickets here .

Around three quarters of youngsters diagnosed survive for at least five years thanks to treatment advances. But the harsh effects of radiotherapy mean two thirds of those who receive it suffer long-term side effects including learning disabilities and hormone deficiencies. Scientists are creating an “atlas” of young patients’ brains to map out where the most damage occurs during radiotherapy - and understand how to reduce it. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Paediatric junior doctor Josh Goddard, 32, is a patient advocate for the study. He was diagnosed with spinal cancer aged 12 and underwent radiotherapy to his head and spine, plus chemotherapy. READ MORE: Suncream warning as cases of skin cancer at all-time high in UK Josh suffered side effects after cancer treatment from the age of 12 (Image: Josh Goddard) The radiotherapy caused cancer in his thyroid, a gland in the neck that secretes growth hormones, which had to be removed. Josh now needs daily injections of human growth hormone and levothyroxine tablets. He said: “It’s incredibly important that we find treatments that don’t cause long-term side effects. \"I’ve found that my brain processing power isn’t as quick as it used to be, I can’t think as quickly. I have a reduction in energy levels and I don’t think my short term memory is as good.” Other side effects include skin on his head that is particularly sensitive to sunlight. Josh added: “When I was told I was going to have radiotherapy, I remember my dad saying he felt like it was archaic, it causes lots of problems. “We don’t know whether the radiotherapy was effective because we did both at the same time. But my dad still wishes I never had radiotherapy because of the long-term effects.” The young medic, of Lancaster, still has an inoperable 18cm tumour at the base of his spine. It causes him some pain and numbness in his legs but has remained stable for around a decade. Don't miss...

Josh’s experience as both a patient and doctor has made him passionate about the need to find kinder treatments. He added: “I work with patients from birth to 60-70 years old. Some are cancer patients and I see through their eyes what it’s like going through that for the first time. I see them and their families struggling. “If we can advance science to a point where there’s minimal intervention, minimal risk, minimal consequences of having treatment for cancer, that’s the end game. “Some of the treatments we have are more brutal than others. If we can take the edge off, then that’s only a good thing.” Josh was inspired to study medicine by his time in hospital and interactions with doctors. One of his oncologists was Dr Martin McCabe, of the University of Manchester, who leads the BRAINatomy study.

Read our Privacy Policy Dr McCabe explained that radiotherapy is a vital weapon against childhood cancers but its benefits come at a price. He said: “Radiotherapy is very effective at curing tumours but it does a lot of damage. A lot of children who develop brain tumours are quite young so their brains are still developing. “When you irradiate children’s brains, you get a lot of problems in the long-term with poor memory, low processing speed, general difficulty coping with new information and learning things. That’s a real problem. “I look after young adults aged 16-25 and a lot still have quite bad memory a few years after radiotherapy.” Dr McCabe’s team have spent the last few years analysing brain scans and conventional radiotherapy plans from children with medulloblastoma, a cancer that starts in the lower back part of the brain. They have already identified areas where exposure to higher doses of radiation is particularly harmful to the growing brain and linked to later problems with processing speed. The team is now testing whether it is possible to avoid these regions using modern technology. Collaborators in the UK, US and the Netherlands will review past patient cases to determine whether their radiotherapy could have been planned differently to avoid damaging healthy tissue. DrMcCabe said: “When doctors and physicists are planning the treatments, they focus pretty much exclusively on getting the right dose to the tumour, rather than necessarily thinking very hard about how radiotherapy gets into and out of the tumour. “That’s because we’ve never really had any studies before that have said, which are the bits of the brain that we need to avoid?\" The £5million funding will also be used to carry out similar analysis on scans from children treated with proton beam therapy, a more targeted form of radiotherapy often used for paediatric brain cancers. And the study is investigating if replacing hormones early and giving drugs to reduce inflammation bring further benefits. Reducing treatment side effects would make an “absolutely colossal” difference to families, Dr McCabe said. He added: “It’s quite a depressing experience going to a late effects clinic for children who’ve been treated with radiotherapy. “Some of these children are incapable of independent living, they are completely reliant on their parents, they struggle to maintain relationships. \"I have patients who were aged 17-20 when they were treated and their memory is now so bad it’s almost as if they are demented. \"I think it will take four years to do this project. If we find regions that are very sensitive to damage and ways of avoiding it, then we could start pretty much straightaway to put into practice what we've learned.\" We must improve existing treatments as well as developing new ones, says MICHELLE MITCHELL Thanks to research, more than three in four children and young people diagnosed with a brain tumour in the UK survive for at least five years. Every extra moment that they can spend with their families is precious and we want those moments to be as comfortable as possible. Many young people who survive their cancer face long-term side effects, such as fertility problems or loss of hearing, as a result of their treatment. These problems often persist for the rest of their lives. The research from the University of Manchester highlights that, as well as developing new treatments with fewer side effects, we must also focus on making the treatments and interventions we already have better for children and their families. Across the UK, we support researchers who are dedicated to making sure that children and young people will see a future where they can lead longer, healthier lives, free from the fear of cancer. - Michelle Mitchell is Cancer Research UK’s chief executive Related articles Sunak urged to save pharmacies facing £1.2bn funding shortfall as 1,000 close Fury as women's healthcare in the UK 'worse than the US and China' Red flag symptom of cancer you can only spot after dark Influencers claim some SPFs are 'more cancerous' than sun - experts weigh in Princess Kate has been leaning heavily on her 'circle of trust' while recovering",

        "content": "Clover Moore is seeking an unprecedented sixth term as lord mayor of Sydney, saying there was “more work to do” and she still had the energy to lead the city after 20 years in the job. Moore, 78, will launch her re-election bid on Tuesday, promising a continued focus on climate change, greening, affordable housing, design excellence and cultural infrastructure. Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, pictured at her Redfern home on Monday, has announced she will seek a sixth term. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer “I’m still very committed and excited about the work. I think this next term we can just take it to another level,” she told the Herald . “People know what to expect with me, and they know that I honour commitments.” Another victory in September would deliver Moore four more years in office, and she committed to serving the full term. Her former deputy, Jess Miller, is returning to local politics on Moore’s ticket, and is an obvious potential successor, though Moore said she was making no commitments at this stage. “When the time comes, I will certainly endorse someone I believe can carry the baton.” Town Hall has been dominated by Moore and her independent team since 2004, and they retain a working majority, although there was a 15 per cent swing away from her at the last election, mostly going to Indigenous activist Yvonne Weldon. Moore rejected the suggestion that after two decades it was time for new leadership. “I don’t know if the city is just about giving someone a go,” she said. “The city is really about having a vision and a commitment, and the energy and the motivation to do all of that. Of course there are others who might share that, but we’ve got a really wonderful momentum and I want to keep that going.” ‘I don’t think I personally make mistakes because I’m careful about what I do. But it’s a very large organisation ... things can happen.’ Clover Moore, lord mayor She also cited a phrase often attributed to Buddha: “your work is to discover your world and then to give yourself wholly to it”, as well as former US president Teddy Roosevelt’s maxim that the best prize in life was to “work hard at work worth doing”. While the US presidential contest has prompted debate about the age of civic leaders, Moore said she had a lot of energy and “a heart as strong as a horse, doctors tell me”.",

        "content": "Hannah Hammoud The North Western Melbourne Primary Health Network (NWMPHN) is on a mission to protect and support patients experiencing family violence through its program, Primary Care Pathways to Safety. This program equips general practice staff with the necessary tools to provide trauma-informed care to victim-survivors. Funded by the federal government Department of Health and Aged Care, the program offers tailored training to GPs, practice nurses, practice managers, and reception staff. The aim is to enable them to effectively assist patients disclosing intimate partner violence or other forms of domestic abuse. Support ranges from providing information on local services to alerting emergency organisations for immediate protection. Developed in collaboration with the University of Melbourne’s Safer Families Centre of Research Excellence, which developed targeted training protocols, the program began in 2019, with funding provided to 30 practices across Melbourne’s north and west for training and resources. One of the 30 practices is the Deer Park Medical Centre. Practice manager Namarata Malhotra said GPs take on a multifaceted role in addressing family violence. “Beyond merely identifying signs of abuse, they serve as frontline advocates, offering compassionate support, and actively facilitating connections between affected patients and the essential resources and services needed to navigate and overcome such challenging situations.,” Ms Malhotra said. ’’... Our approach encompasses confidential consultations, where individuals can openly discuss their experiences in a safe and non-judgmental environment. Additionally, we offer tailored referrals to specialised services, ensuring that patients receive the specific assistance they require. Furthermore, our dedicated team coordinates ongoing care, guiding patients through their journey towards healing and empowerment.’’ Deer Park Medical Centre principal doctor Atef Asham said the funding has enabled the centre to enhance its support services, including training staff in identifying and responding to signs of family violence, implementing protocols for patient safety, and expanding access to counselling and support programs. ’’If you’re experiencing family violence and unsure where to start, consider reaching out to trusted healthcare professionals like your GP, who can offer support, resources, and guidance on seeking help and safety planning,” Dr Asham said. NWMPHN is now in the process of recruiting another 30 practices to undertake the training.",

        "content": "MONTREAL — Jonathan Fortin woke up Friday morning to check on his herd of Black Angus cattle, only to find his field was empty. Fortin, who co-owns Ferme ForThe in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, said he initially thought his calves and cows might have got loose, but the presence of tire tracks and a fence that appeared to have been dismantled led him to conclude that something more sinister had occurred. “All my herd — close to 75 animals — were stolen,” he said in an interview Monday. Quebec provincial police confirmed they’re investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm in Cookshire-Eaton, Que., on Friday and finding the cattle had “disappeared.” Ruel didn’t say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but he noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals. “You can’t move that many livestock in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla,” he said in a phone interview. Fortin figures the cattle were taken between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, while he was out working his second job. He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. “There’s a lot of emotion, because even if it’s a new business, it’s still all the work and the life savings,” he said. “To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.” Fortin says it isn’t easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it’s not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he’s heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren’t insured against theft. If not, he says he’ll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. “For sure it’s very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we’re restarting at zero,” he said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

United overcame favourites City 2-1 at Wembley , with Ten Hag putting uncertainty over his future behind him to guide his team to a famous win. Following the game, Ten Hag insisted in his press conference that United were exactly where he wanted them to be, but Ladyman pushed back on this after the Red Devils recorded their worst-ever Premier League finish this season. Ladyman suggested the Dutchman should have been able to get more out of his players despite a high number of injuries, but Ten Hag refused to accept this, arguing that Ladyman must have 'no knowledge' of the game if he held this view. Reacting to Ten Hag's terse response, Sutton told Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off podcast that it was nothing more than a 'cheap shot' from the United manager, and insisted Ladyman had every right to pull him up on his disappointing campaign at Old Trafford.

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Lewis Browning Published: 20:00, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 20:02, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments The curtain came down on another Premier League season last weekend, and it was once again one that will last long in the memory. Though most of the league's outcomes were already decided going into the final weekend, the title race went down to the wire as Pep Guardiola and Manchester City made history. The champions became the first side ever to win the Premier League title for a fourth consecutive season, pipping Arsenal to success, largely in thanks to a final day win over West Ham at the Etihad. Throughout the season, the 20 teams and hundreds of players battled it out to earn success for their sides, causing plenty of drama, excitement, and unexpected thrills. Throughout every gameweek, Mail Sport provided a Power Rankings list that judged the best 10 players in the Premier League and, here, we've tallied it up to find out the outright winner.

William Saliba, James Ward-Prowse , Trent Alexander-Arnold (43 points) Read More Arsenal miss out on Premier League title but this is no false dawn... Mikel Arteta's side will be challenging for major honours for years to come, writes SAMI MOKBEL Though no trophy came his or Arsenal's way, it was a season of success for William Saliba, who played every minute of the Premier League campaign for the Gunners on the back of last season's injury woes. The defender has instated himself as one of the best in the league in his position, and was the core of the division's best defence, helping secure 18 league clean sheets and concede just 29 goals. James Ward-Prowse, meanwhile, started well for West Ham, before his form dipped and he found himself battling just to get in the Hammers' team. He picked up just two Power Rankings points after gameweek seven. On the other hand, Trent Alexander-Arnold, meanwhile, started slowly before excelling in a hybrid midfield role. He struggled with injuries and wasn't at his usual best, but incoming manager Arne Slot may help him return to the form that had him regarded as one of the world's best. William Saliba played every game for Arsenal as they took the title race down to the final day James Ward-Prowse (L) had a mixed season in his first year with West Ham, while Trent Alexander-Arnold (R) enjoyed spells in midfield 9. Alexander Isak (61 points) Alexander Isak didn't really break through in Power Rankings until the season run-in, which saw him score 11 Premier League goals in the final 12 matches of the campaign. It wasn't the perfect year for Eddie Howe's men, but Isak was certainly a bright spark and has established himself as one of the best around in his position. The Magpies may face a battle to keep him next season, with the likes of Arsenal said to be circling, but any consideration of an exit would demand a hefty fee due to his form, age and the four years still remaining on his current deal. Due to Manchester United's FA Cup win, Newcastle won't be competing in Europe next season, which may provide the opportunity for Isak to excel even further in league action. Alexander Isak hit the ground running towards the end of the season, scoring goals for fun 8. Declan Rice (74 points) Signing of the season? Maybe. Arsenal won the race to secure Declan Rice's signature last summer when it became clear he would be leaving West Ham, paying a stern £105million for his services. The England star has repaid every penny, though, and almost proved he was the missing piece the Gunners needed to win the Premier League title. Whether he played in defensive midfield or a bit further forward, Rice proved reliable as ever every week (apart from the one time he booted Ben Davies in the north London derby). Like Saliba, Rice played every Premier League game for the Gunners, scoring seven times and notching nine assists. It's possible Arsenal will sign another defensive midfielder in the summer so he can kick on further. Declan Rice has proven a raging success since his £105m move to Arsenal from West Ham 7. Ollie Watkins (76 points) A breakthrough season of sorts for Ollie Watkins has almost definitely earned him a place on the plane for the European Championships with England this summer. He scored 27 goals in all competitions for Aston Villa, playing the role of talisman as his side secured Champions League qualification under Unai Emery, who seems to have unlocked Watkins. Though goals are the name of the game - 19 of them in the Premier League without taking penalties - the 28-year-old picked up the Playmaker award for his 13 league assists. Not bad at all. His reward will be a major international championships and a run in the Champions League. Ollie Watkins had the most successful season of his career, helping Aston Villa back to the Champions League 6. Cole Palmer (86 points) Finishing sixth in Mail Sport's Power Rankings is pretty cold. Leaving your boyhood club for £42.5m, scoring 27 goals in your first season and picking up the Young Player of the Year award is also pretty cold. Now-ex-Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino was forced to deny his side were not 'Cole Palmer FC' during the campaign, but he was by far and away the Blues' best player . He had 42 goal involvements from Chelsea's 77 goals scored and Pochettino truly got the best out of him. Palmer too will be on the plane to the Euros, and his job next season will be to ensure he can replicate the form under a different manager . Beaten to the Golden Boot only by Erling Haaland, it would be a shock if he didn't. Cole Palmer's gamble in leaving Manchester City for Chelsea last year paid off in a major way 5. Phil Foden (88 points) Perhaps the biggest surprise on this list is that Foden is so far down. Winning the Premier League Player of the Year award , he enjoyed the best individual season of his career. Though it reaped just the one trophy in the form of the Premier League, he netted 27 goals as he became City's key and go-to man, finding a home as a wide player drifting centrally. At 23, he already has six Premier League titles to his name and he will likely add many more. Over to you, Gareth Southgate... Phil Foden enjoyed the most successful personal season of his career as he lifted his sixth Premier League title 4. Son Heung-min (90 points) The season was always going to be tough for Tottenham, not only with Harry Kane leaving, meaning there were a fair few goals that needed replacing, but also Hugo Lloris. Two big dressing room voices were no more, by Son Heung-min stepped up as the new club captain to help steer the transition in squad and management. He enjoyed spells both up front and out wide under Ange Postecoglou as the Australian looked to implement a more attacking style of play and, though his form dipped towards the end of the season, his presence was vital. His miss against Manchester City in the penultimate game of the season will live long in the memory of some more than others, but the 31-year-old remains one of the most devastating finishers in the league. The need for adaptation in his game remains, but Son will once again be vital for Spurs next season as they look to go one further and qualify for the Champions League. It was a year of transition for Tottenham, but they were able to rely on Son Heung-min 3. Bukayo Saka (93 points) It was a season of what could have been for Arsenal as a whole, but for Bukayo Saka it was once again business as usual. It is easy to forget he's still only 22. It feels as though he has ben around forever and seems to be the only attacker that is rarely rested or rotated. There were a couple of occasions in the season when that caught up with him - he missed the final game through injury - but it seems Mikel Arteta is leaning how to manage his workload more efficiently. Still Arsenal's key man, still important to England, he will just want to start adding those trophies to his cabinet now. Arsenal didn't win the league, but Bukayo Saka had another successful year for the Gunners 2. Erling Haaland (119 points) Last season's Power Rankings winner can only manage second on this occasion. It was another Golden Boot and Premier League title for Erling Haaland, but he faced criticism in what was a much tougher season than the last. Who could forget his infamous war of words with Roy Keane ? Or his injury-hit spell over Christmas, keeping him out the Club World Cup, that left Fantasy Premier League players reeling? Nonetheless, when he was available, Haaland was more often than not as ruthless as ever, netting 38 goals in 45 appearances. Missing out on top spot by only nine points, he surely would have retained his crown had it not been for injury. Erling Haaland won the Golden Boot and Premier League once again with Manchester City Liverpool's Mohamed Salah takes Mail Sport's Power Rankings crown for the 2023-23 season 1. Mohamed Salah (128 points) The Egyptian King is the Mail Sport Power Rankings king for the 2023-24 season. He didn't feature in the top 10 in the last seven weeks of the season, but his earlier work was enough for Mohamed Salah to cling onto top spot, having spent four weeks at the top throughout the campaign. Post-African Cup of Nations life was tough, as it often has been, but a return of 25 goals and 14 assists in all competitions is no mean feat. Unfortunately he was unable to steer Liverpool to a goodbye Premier League title under Jurgen Klopp, and his future remains unclear , but, for now, he can celebrate another successful personal year in Red.

        "content": "Srinagar, May 27: Jammu and Kashmir experienced a significant rise in temperatures on Monday with several areas recording the highest temperatures in decades. The Meteorological Department (MeT) predicted the continuation of the heatwave in the next month too. The Meteorological Centre Srinagar said that there were unprecedented heat levels in multiple locations, reflecting the intensifying heatwave conditions across J&K. Qazigund recorded its highest maximum temperature in 43 years, reaching 34 degrees Celsius. This surpasses the previous record of 33.6 degrees Celsius set on May 31, 1981. The maximum temperature in Kokernag hit 31.6 degrees Celsius, marking the second highest in 22 years with the highest on record remaining 32.6 degrees Celsius on May 15, 2001. The Baderwah town recorded a maximum temperature of 34.6 degrees Celsius, the third highest in 23 years. Notably, the second highest 34.7 degrees Celsius was recorded on Sunday. The highest ever recorded was 37.6 degrees Celsius on May 30, 2000. The maximum temperature in Pahalgam was 28.6 degrees Celsius, the second highest in 23 years with the record high remaining 30.8 degrees Celsius on May 23, 2000. Srinagar recorded 32.2 degrees Celsius, Kupwara 30.9 degrees Celsius, and Gulmarg 22.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature in Jammu soared to 42.8 degrees Celsius while Katra reached a high of 39 degrees Celsius. The MeT officials said that the heatwave was expected to persist with no significant relief in sight until a brief respite from May 30 to June 2. However, another spell of heatwave conditions is anticipated from June 3 onwards in J&K. The Meteorological Centre in Srinagar on Monday issued a detailed weather forecast for J&K for the upcoming days, indicating a persistent heatwave over the plains of Jammu division. The advisory said that from May 27 to 29, generally dry weather is anticipated across the region though there is also a possibility of isolated thundershower activity. It said that from May 30 to 31, the weather is expected to be partly to generally cloudy, with light rain or thundershowers likely at isolated places. The advisory said that from June 1 to 2, similar conditions would persist with partly to generally cloudy skies and light rain or thundershowers at isolated locations. It said that from June 3 to 5, the weather was predicted to remain generally dry. The people have been advised to avoid heat exposure and stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. This advisory is particularly important for vulnerable populations, including the elderly, infants, and children. The MeT has urged the people to take necessary precautions to protect themselves from the severe heat. As the region braces for another heatwave starting June 3, people have been reminded to remain vigilant and adhere to health advisories to avoid heat-related illnesses. The night temperature continued to hover above normal in most parts of J&K where weathermen forecast another dry and hot day on Monday. Srinagar recorded a low of 15.6 degrees Celsius against 15.1 degrees Celsius the previous night and it was 3.6 degrees Celsius above normal for this time of the year. Qazigund recorded a minimum of 12.4 degrees Celsius against 12.6 degrees Celsius the previous night and it was 1.7 degrees Celsius above normal. Pahalgam recorded a low of 7.7 degrees Celsius against 8.3 degrees Celsius the previous night and it was 1.6 degrees Celsius above normal. Kokernag, also in south Kashmir, recorded a minimum of 13.6 degrees Celsius against 13.2 degrees Celsius and it was 3 degrees Celsius above normal. Kupwara town recorded a minimum of 12 degrees Celsius against 11.5 degrees Celsius the previous night and it was above normal by 1.4 degrees Celsius for the place. Gulmarg recorded a minimum of 11.2 degrees Celsius against 11 degrees Celsius the previous night and it was above normal by 4.1 degrees Celsius. Jammu recorded a low of 24.7 degrees Celsius against 24.5 degrees Celsius the previous night and it was below normal by 0.2 degrees Celsius. Banihal recorded a low of 15.2 degrees Celsius, Batote 19 degrees Celsius, and Bhaderwah 15.6 degrees Celsius.",

        "content": "Colombo, May 27 (PTI) Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe will certainly contest the presidential poll to seek re-election and will announce his candidacy in the next two weeks, a senior government minister said on Monday. Harin Fernando, the Tourism minister and a close ally of Wickremesinghe, said. “I can say with certainty that the President will contest.” The island nation’s Elections Commission earlier this month said the presidential election would be conducted between September 17 and October 16. The ruling Sri Lanka People’s Front, commonly known by its Sinhalese name Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which has the current parliamentary majority, had pressed Wickremesinghe to hold the parliamentary election ahead of the presidential poll. Wickremesinghe, 75, is yet to announce his candidacy despite declarations by two other main opposition leaders: Sajith Premadasa the main opposition leader, and the Marxist JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Fernando said Wickremesinghe would announce his candidature within the next two weeks. Wickremesinghe, from the arch-rival party United National Party (UNP), succeeded SLPP-elected president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to become president for the rest of Rajapaksa’s term when the latter was ousted, after the island nation declared first international default, during street protests which lasted between April and July of 2022. Rajapaksa gave in to calls for his resignation due to his inability to handle the unprecedented economic crisis. Some of the SLPP members have turned into Wickremesinghe supporters while the party also saw other members split as well to form other political entities. The Rajapaksa administration announced Sri Lanka’s first-ever sovereign default as forex shortages caused long queues for essentials and fuel. Wickremesinghe since taking over has steered the economy to safety by securing an IMF bailout. Analysts, however, feel that Sri Lanka is not completely out of the woods yet.",

        "content": "Like many others who grew up with pets, we didn’t take our pets to the veterinarian often, and we certainly never took them to get their teeth cleaned. Yet dental disease in pets is hugely common— and can lead to serious problems, not to mention be painful for our beloved buddies. A couple years ago, during a routine checkup for my cat, Mischief, his vet noted he had some tartar on his teeth, and I should consider getting him a dental exam. I put it off, reasoning that he was eating normally and didn’t seem to be uncomfortable. Big mistake. The next time we were at his vet for something unrelated, she told me the tartar buildup had gotten severe. I sheepishly booked his appointment and poor Mischief ended up having two teeth extracted and two “tooth remnants” removed. The remnants were the result of a condition called “tooth resorption” that occurs when a cat’s tooth dentin erodes and is destroyed. According to the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, it affects between 25% and 75% of cats in the United States. It’s also apparently painful. I felt like the worst pet mom ever for having put this off, especially learning that he’d been in pain. Even worse than needing to have teeth extracted, neglecting dental disease can prove extremely dangerous. Inflamed gums can separate from the teeth, allowing bacteria to enter and attack the tooth at the root. At this point, bacteria can also enter the bloodstream and travel to major organs like the heart, liver and kidneys, causing serious complications. The American Veterinary Dental Society reports that 80% of dogs and 70% of cats show signs of dental disease by age 3. Indeed, dogs and cats that find their way to Marin Humane have often had their teeth neglected, so dental issues are common. Many are in constant pain, which can often show itself in behavior issues. To remedy most dental issues, the animal must be put under general anesthesia. They also need bloodwork beforehand to ensure there are no other underlying issues. Veterinarians will examine and X-ray, remove tartar, check for cavities and growths, extract diseased teeth and finally, give those teeth a good polishing, which will discourage the formation of new plaque and tartar. Extraction of problem teeth can provide tremendous relief for suffering animals and most cope very well without the missing ones. But you can take preventive measures against dental disease for your pets right at home. “Start by familiarizing yourself with the warning signs of dental disease like bad breath, yellow-brown crust on the teeth, bleeding gums or pawing at the mouth and commit to a home care regimen,” says Belinda Evans, Marin Humane’s director of shelter medicine. “Also, be sure to visit your veterinarian at least once a year for a checkup.” Just like people, pets need regular brushing along with professional care. Introduce your pets to brushing by putting a small amount of pet toothpaste (not human toothpaste, which can make your pet sick) on your finger and rubbing it on their teeth. Once they become comfortable with this, apply toothpaste on a toothbrush and allow them to lick the bristles, then begin brushing. Ideally, you should brush your pets’ teeth two times a week. Note that it will probably take some time until your pets cooperate. Don’t give up; your pets will thank you!

        "description": "A massive collision involving Kevin Magnussen, Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg brought out the red flags in Monaco...",
        "content": "The fact that a huge shunt involving Kevin Magnussen, Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg in Monaco happened on the first lap is what saved Magnussen from a race ban, claims 13-time race winner David Coulthard. Perez’s Red Bull was destroyed against the barriers after he was tagged by Magnussen’s Haas on the opening lap of the Monaco GP going up the hill out of Sainte Devote, Magnussen’s Haas team-mate Hulkenberg also caught up and eliminated in the incident to make it a triple DNF. Magnussen faced a nervous wait in the aftermath, considering he sits just two penalty points away from incurring a one-race ban, though the stewards determined that no further action was needed. Considering the circumstances, Coulthard says Magnussen should have been backing out of that move, but instead triggered the shunt by keeping his nose stuck in. Analysing the incident on Channel 4, Coulthard said: “I think given that Kevin Magnussen has a number of points on his licence, no harm in sticking your nose in, but at this point you should be backing out, because you can see that’s about as straight as, well not a very strange thing. “And once that contact was made, that is a huge energy crash at the beginning of a grand prix, car heavy with fuel as well. “You can see Perez looks in the mirror, but then at the point at which he looks ahead again, the impact was made. “The stewards have put it down as a racing incident, but that accident was caused because Magnussen stuck his nose in and the chances of outdragging him up the hill and around the outside on a non-straight, slim and none.” 👉 Revealed: The staggering cost of Sergio Perez’s Monaco Grand Prix crash 👉 Alarming footage captures F1 photographers’ lucky escape in Sergio Perez crash Coulthard was therefore asked if he felt that the shunt occurring on Lap 1 influenced the steward verdict of no further action? He was certain in his mind that it did, Coulthard saying that if that incident occurred on any lap other than the first in Monaco, then Magnussen “would be looking at a little holiday from Formula 1”. “Yeah, first lap,” said Coulthard when asked if this is why it was ruled a racing incident? “If that had been on any other lap in the Grand Prix, I think Magnussen would be looking at a little holiday from Formula 1.” Magnussen is battling to secure his future with Haas, the team already in need of one new driver for F1 2025 with Hulkenberg on his way to Sauber.

        "content": "When my mom was battling breast cancer close to a decade ago, she was so proud when she celebrated her 60th birthday. Aging didn’t scare her; it felt like a triumphant step in her cancer journey. It’s something I have been thinking about recently as my younger brother nears his graduation: how proud she would be of him, and how proud we as a family are of him. With pride on my mind, I want to know, what are you proud of? I’d love to know. Please make it a six-word story, a personal short story, with a beginning, middle and end — not six adjectives, not a cliche and not advice. Make us laugh or cry or at the least feel something. For an example, here is the famous story attributed to, but not proven to be written by, Ernest Hemingway: “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.” That’s quite the story! Need more examples? “It can’t be. I’m a virgin,” writes Kate Atkinson. “Set sail, great storm, all lost,” says John Banville. If you want your story to run in the IJ, please: • Write “Six-word story” in the subject line • Send one six-word story. Just one • Include your full name and Marin town in the body of the email, no attachments • Write your short story in the body of the email, no attachments • Use proper punctuation and spelling • Use sentence style in one line • It should not rhyme • Do not submit six adjectives — that’s not a story Please send to lifestyles@marinij.com by June 14 and look for it in the June 25 lifestyles section and online.

        "content": "credits daughters Junie, 8, and Rue, 3, for helping her stay in shape. “Dancing with my kids is really what does it for me,” Taylor, 33, exclusively reveals in the , on newsstands now. “They keep me so active and I love to dance.” She shares Junie and Rue with estranged husband . (Taylor from her ex in January 2023 after seven years of marriage, and the duo announced their separation several months later in September 2023.) In addition to staying active by chasing around her kiddos, the actress also doesn’t hold to a restrictive diet. She told in December 2023 that she “loves food” and doesn’t “think too much” about calories. After her May burlesque show in New York City, she told magazine that she didn’t do a warm up before hitting the stage — but did make sure to eat. “No stretches, I ate pizza and prayed,” she said. It seems Taylor wants to avoid getting hangry, even going so far as to bring her own food to the Met Gala. “I think the only rule I be breaking is when I be bringing my own food,” she told Access Hollywood at the Met Gala earlier this month. “I just want to be honest. When I come to the Met with food, it’s because I be so overwhelmed and I be hungry. I’m like, ‘I got to hurry up.’ And I get out the sprinter [van] and I still ain’t eat, I’m like, ‘alright, let me dump it in the bag.'” She revealed that she didn’t bring her own food this year, instead munching on chicken and French fries from Raising Cane’s before walking the red carpet in with David Yurman jewelry. Fast food chicken has been Taylor’s Met Gala meal of choice for at least three years in a row. “I was being greedy and ,” Taylor revealed during a November 2023 appearance on while discussing last year’s fundraiser. She added that she snuck in some food from Popeyes for the 2022 event. You have successfully subscribed.

That’s my girl!’ I think [Anna] said, ‘Let her sneak her food in in peace.’” Taylor clarified that she wasn’t sure the famous editor was aware of her snack situation, but after the dancer’s appearance at the 2024 event, it’s clear that Taylor is still on Wintour’s coveted Met Gala guest list.

Bay, 9-2 and Walsh Jesuit, 13-3. St. John’s path: Def. Sylvania Southview, 11-7 and Ottawa Hills, 8-5. Up next: Winner advances to the Division II Region 5 final to play (1) Wooster or (4) Olmsted Falls on May 30. Outlook: Just like Rocky River, St. John’s has been a staple program of Division II, Region 5. The Titans aim for their third straight regional final appearance in their fourth straight regional semifinal berth. St. John’s record is nearing .500, but it also plays competition in Michigan, along with Ohio. St. John’s had games against four Region 5 games this season. Their two playoff games were decided by three goals. Close games against St. John’s are grueling, forcing other teams to fight tooth-and-nail for a chance to win. It’s defense may not be as stout as it was last year, but Nicholas Bowers has recorded 149 saves. Owen Winkler is St. John’s FOGO (face-off-get-off) who’s won 62.4% of his faceoffs. Quinn Wiklendt is its main offensive threat. His ball distribution resulted in 70 assists (83 points). He has underclassmen Drew Duesing (42 goals, 14 assists) and Alexander Speer (53 goals, one assist) to pass to. Rocky River took tough losses to Olentangy Berlin (8-3), Avon (7-6) and University (18-5), but bounced back to ride to a regional semifinal with a four-game winning streak. Defense is its calling card that has allowed 90 goals all season, in a span of 19 games. It is the lowest amount of conceded goals in Region 5 by a wide margin. Wooster is second with 125 goals over 17 games. The Pirates have even played more games than the rest of the top 10 defenses. Perez’s pick: Rocky River",

        "content": "Alice Yarish was born Alice D’Alton Foley in Goldfield, Nevada, on April 25, 1909 to Judge Thomas L. Foley and Alice Dean Foley, who was the first woman to practice law in Nevada. After the family moved to Southern California in 1920, her first experience in journalism was working as a correspondent for the South Bay Breeze while she was still in high school. She went on to attend University of Southern California and reported for the Daily Trojan newspaper. She studied law at Southwestern University for two years, but after the death of her parents, the tuition money ran out. While working as a cub reporter for the Los Angeles Express, her big break came as she rode her bike down the Hermosa Beach strand and spotted a black sedan with flags just as Eleanor Roosevelt exited. She approached the first lady and introduced herself. Her story made the front page along with her first byline. During the mid-’30s, she worked as a social worker with the State Emergency Relief Administration. In 1942, she married Peter P. Yarish, who was in the United States Air Force. Yarish was eventually transferred to Hamilton Air Force Base in 1948 and the couple settled in Novato on Yukon Way. For 10 years, which she referred to as “forced domestically,” Alice Yarish focused on raising their four children and being a “military wife.” After the children were in school, Yarish became a reporter for the Independent Journal in 1952 at age 43. She moved on to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat as its bureau chief and landed at the Novato Advance in 1956. After establishing the Marin News Bureau in 1962, Yarish began covering the courts and county government along with working for the Pacific Sun and San Francisco Examiner. In 1972, these positions developed into full-time, and she closed the Marin News Bureau. Prison reform became Yarish’s beat after befriending San Quentin inmate George Jackson. Yarish wrote in a 1976 Pacific Sun column: “It was not until I met the late George Jackson that I learned about the horrors and terrors of prison life. Jackson opened my eyes and filled me with information which I had not known before. I was shocked by what I learned. ... Prisons tend to be breeding grounds of crime, generators of bitterness, destruction of men’s souls.” Yarish used her connection to Jackson to speak with the San Quentin Six during the 16-month trial. Her recognition of humanity towards all involved and her writing style became her trademark as a maverick journalist. In 1972, Yarish wrote a three-part piece on the Marin County Drug Abuse Bureau. She received tips from a judge and a friend of George Jackson’s: discovering that the bureau was planting evidence, stealing drugs and coercing witnesses — all to build up their arrest records. According to her 1993 oral history, Yarish interviewed “dope fiends, drug dealers, probation officers and cops,” along with research into court records. Corruption, entrapment and incompetence were exposed, and the article series prompted the abolition of the bureau. The article series earned a “Best Story in a Bay Area Paper” award from the San Francisco Press Club. Yarish was known for speaking out for those who couldn’t speak for themselves and inspired other people to follow her lead. Yarish died in 2005 at 96 years old, leaving a spectacular legacy behind, which also included wearing distinctive hats, peppering her speech with salty language, cruising around with friends in her red Chevrolet Cavalier convertible and celebrating life with a daily glass of champagne.

        "description": "Māori National Unity Hui moves to Hastings on Friday.",
        "content": "By RNZ Māori from across Aotearoa will gather in Hastings on Friday for the next Hui Taumata. The hui is the next in a series which began at the start of the year when Kiingi Tuheitia called for a National Hui for Unity. The mauri of that hui was then taken to Rātana Pā, Waitangi Day commemorations and continued to the National Iwi Chairs Forum (NICF) a month later. Ngāti Kahungunu chairman Bayden Barber, who is hosting in association with NICF and other tribal authorities, said the hui at Omāhu Marae would seek to identify ways Māori could unify. “One of the key themes spoken of at each of these hui was the need for iwi Māori to unify. We must come together as an irresistible force that cannot be ignored, no matter who is sitting in government.” Māori must not lose momentum, Barber said. “We need to take advantage of the energy and passion that is out there. The timing is right.” In preparation for Friday’s hui, organisers had made documents and power points available on the Hui Taumata website. The documents included discussion papers exploring the idea of a National Iwi Alliance which would function as an entity completely separately from the Crown. Ngāti Toa Rangatira chief executive Helmut Modlik, who facilitated the NCIF wānanga in Rotorua in February, said the time for talking was done. “We’ve done the talking. It’s now time to do the mahi and consider what kotahitanga could look like in the 21st century. If we are to truly achieve rangatiratanga as a people, we need to come together, but it needs form and function.” His discussion paper, titled ‘Towards a Māori Nation’, set out what an initial model for a federation of iwi Māori could look like. Barber said kotahitanga was key to gaining influence. “We have numerous existing collectives within Te Ao Māori such as the National Iwi Chairs Forum, NZ Māori Council, Māori Womens Welfare League etc, and they all play an important role, however, we are yet to achieve the kotahitanga needed to truly influence. “This Government continues to ignore us. We need to change that,” he said. ‘Prove the might of our economy’ Māori activist rōpu Toitū Te Tiriti has issued a national call to action asking Māori to go on strike this Thursday to “prove the might of our economy”. A “Save the Date” post issued on Sunday announced a “National Activation #2′′ would take place on Thursday to coincide with the reading of the Budget. Details released on Monday said the goal was to demonstrate a unified response to the Government’s “assault on Tangata Whenua and Te Tiriti o Waitangi” and included a “day of strike”, a “haka activation” in Gisborne. Thousands of people responded to a national call to action shared by Te Pāti Māori in December last year with “Carkoi” and hīkoi organised in main centres and rural communities. Organisers issued a series of posts asking “all Māori and Tangata Tiriti to GO ON STRIKE for the day to prove the might of our economy by disconnecting entirely from it”. It urged supporters to instead use the day to attend their nearest “rally/hikoi” in their region. The National Urban Māori Authority and Te Kōhao Health would co-ordinate a “Carkoi” on the Southern Motorway in the Waikato Tainui region with further action being taken at key roundabouts in Hamilton later in the afternoon. Toitū Te Tiriti - Tairāwhiti announced a “Haka Activation” event would take place in Gisborne tomorrow evening as part of the lead-up. The post included audio of the haka Te Tiriti o Waitangi composed by the late Dr Ngapo Wehi and an open invitation to anyone wanting to participate in learning and performing it. Tapeta Wehi of Te Wehi Haka would host the event at Tautua Village and organisers said the haka “carries a rich legacy and deep meaning still relevant for our mokopuna of today”.

        "description": "As we celebrate the success of Discovery Point and Camperdown Wildlife Centre, we must advocate to keep all of Dundee's treasured sites open.",
        "content": "It was fantastic to hear the amazing news that Dundee attractions had won big at the Scottish Hospitality Awards last week. Discovery Point and Camperdown Wildlife Centre won in the Tourist Attraction of the Year and Best Outdoor Venue category respectively, whilst Hotel Indigo Dundee scooped the Best Hotel Award. Discovery Point winning the coveted Tourist Attraction of the Year award was incredible. Working part time at Dundee Heritage Trust, I can see from over a mile off that the staff are dedicated and care passionately about what they do. The past couple of years have been pretty exciting for the incredible team at Discovery Point, with the opening of the Discovery Dome in 2022, then the 30th anniversary celebrations in 2023. The team winning this award in 2024 is just the cherry on the top. And it doesn’t end there. The RRS Discovery is undergoing an exciting conservation project at the moment where they are currently repairing the interior of the ship as more than a century’s worth of wear and tear is needing that care and attention. This is thanks to a £1.4 million funding award given to Dundee Heritage Trust by the National Heritage Memorial Fund. Having previously helped inspire my love for Dundee and working with a dedicated team week in and week out, seeing Discovery Point taking the most sought award was wholesome, they deserve it. The future is exciting for the Discovery! V&A Dundee received a highly commended status in the same category – but what a year they have had, from the incredible Tartan exhibition celebrating five years of the museum, to opening the amazing Kimono exhibition – the first of its kind in Europe. I also recently heard about the incredible milestone that the museum has hit two million visits. I am so delighted for the team there. I worked with them for a period of time, and like , the staff at the V&A Dundee are nothing short of amazing for the work they do. Camperdown Wildlife Centre won Best Outdoor Venue and this wee place, nested in the parklands of Camperdown Park, can at times feel like one of Dundee’s most underrated attractions. Compared to other attractions in the city, it doesn’t get a lot of attention, so to have it recognised is special. Hotel Indigo Dundee has also underwent an exciting renovation, and with the opening of the new Eighteen22 bar, it has come at the right time for the hotel. We are so fortunate to have a wide scope of attractions in Dundee which tailor to each and everyone’s taste, and we shouldn’t leave any behind. It’s clear from these that Dundee’s attractions hold a special place in the hearts of both locals and visitors. This love and dedication are evident, yet it stands in stark contrast to the looming threat of . These sites, much like our award-winning attractions, are integral to the city’s cultural and recreational fabric. As we celebrate the success of Discovery Point, Camperdown Wildlife Centre, and others, we must advocate to keep all our treasured sites open. The potential loss of these beloved institutions for saving £500,000 a year would be a disservice to Dundee’s rich heritage and vibrant community. Let’s ensure that every attraction continues to thrive and inspire future generations.",

In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

Following a triumphant major order victory, Helldivers 2 players are enjoying the fruits of their labor in the form of a new mech exosuit. But that doesn’t mean another improvement to the game’s walking war machines wouldn’t be welcome. In fact, some fans have shared their stratagem wishlists on social media, with one of the top requests being a much-needed upgrade to in-game exosuit management. Now, if you’ve been taking a break from the Galactic War, you may not be aware that the latest MO completion . Equipped with dual autocannons and a crushing stomp attack, this new stratagem gives players a much-needed alternative to the oft-criticized Patriot Exosuit. Unfortunately, its addition hasn’t addressed any of the exosuit stratagem’s main issues, like its frustratingly long cooldown and flimsiness at higher difficulties. For this reason, some players have taken it upon themselves to bring these problems to the attention of Arrowhead Game Studios since exosuits continue to be one of the game’s most underwhelming stratagems. One solution that players hope the developers introduce is an exosuit rearm feature. According to , this potential stratagem would replace a depleted mech with a new one, giving players more time to wreak havoc with the hulking bot. Although this wouldn’t entirely fix the exosuit’s durability issues, it would at least make exosuit loadouts more viable since two uses can essentially counteract its 600-second cooldown. Of course, this improvement remains a pipe dream for the player base since Johan Pilestedt, AGS’s new CCO, is focusing most of the team’s attention on . That said, AGS has often valued community output when it comes to improving Helldivers 2, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if an exosuit rearm stratagem is added in the future.

        "content": "IT is a happy family day out for Gavin & Stacey star Mathew Horne as he is pictured in public with his son for the first time since becoming a dad. The actor was spotted with the child and his wife Celina Bassili over the weekend. Mathew , 45, had kept news of his parenthood under wraps and only told his closest friends and family — including his co-stars on the hit BBC1 show. A source said: “Mathew is a brilliant dad and he and Celina love being parents. “Celina’s brother has a son who is a similar age and they loved spending time together. “Mathew also kept the news quiet because he prefers to live his life out of the spotlight, even though he’s a household name thanks to Gavin & Stacey. “All his Gavin & Stacey co-stars know about him being a dad, including James Corden and Joanna Page . “They all have kids so you can imagine the talk on set for the Christmas special is going to centre a lot on their kids.” He and Norweigian set designer Celina are believed to have become parents shortly after they got married in October 2021. The day out in London with his family comes as Mathew prepares to return as Gavin for a final time when the hit show comes back in December for the one-off special. The most reason episode aired in 2019 — nine years after the final full series had screened. Close pal James, and the show’s other writer and co-star Ruth Jones , chose to stick with the BBC for the show, following a bidding war from streaming sites. After his success with the series that debuted in 2007, Mathew retreated from the limelight after other projects fared less well. A sketch show with James, called Horne & Corden, was panned while their comedy film Lesbian Vampire Killers was described as a “witless mess”. He referred to the time as “the negativity” and said in a rare interview in 2010: “The recovery time for something like that was always going to be quite lengthy.” But he says he and James remained close — despite the latter’s success hosting The Late Late Show in the US until last year. He said: “James remains a friend and never wasn’t a friend. “We have remained friends ever since we met. We’ve done various bits of work together and now we’re both off doing other things. “Jealousy isn’t something I do — I am not a jealous person. “I’m thrilled about the success he’s having.”",

        "content": "As we've all been weathering through a seemingly endless news cycle revolving around the evils of the Pine Tree Flag it's nice to be reminded that America isn't the only country that's given to these sorts of wild mania. Over in Germany, who in fairness to them have a history of going to much, much, much more extreme forms of mania than America, the powers that be are also wringing their hands over the possible uses and symbolic meanings of stuff that to the average person would seem silly. In the case of the Germans, it seems that the song 'L'Amour toujours' by Italian DJ/producer Gigi D'Agostino has been cast as a sort of boogieman of the far right... not because of any sins committed by the song itself but because of what bad actors might dare to sing to the tune of the song if it happens to be played. As Disclose.tv reports: NEW - Song \"L'Amour toujours\" by Gigi D'Agostino is banned from the upcoming Oktoberfest in Bavaria because some Germans could sing \"Germany for the Germans, foreigners out\" to it. pic.twitter.com/aY224usqke L'Amour toujours was first released 24 years ago and has maintained lasting popularity in Europe, but we're apparently living in the age where anything touched by anyone who those in power finds distasteful becomes itself tainted like some bizarre form of symbolic leprosy. MORE - The German state security service is investigating several cases in which young people have sung \"Germany for the Germans, foreigners out\" to Gigi D'Agostino's tune at various locations. Seems like an excellent use of police resources, that. It really makes you appreciate the freedoms afforded to Americans by the Constitution... if it were up to these nanny-state types having ever flown a Pine Tree Flag would likely be a jailable offense. The 1st Amendment shows the true genius of the Founding Fathers. When you’re banning songs, you’ve lost. Something tells me they’re going to be singing it anyway. Nooooo, but it was banned! Oktoberfest Festival director Clemens Baumgärtner even said 'There is no room for all the right-wing sh** at the Oktoberfest'! Nobody's going to break the rules, right?! Like finding another tune will be hard for drunk people. thanks for solving racism! That track is an absolute banger and someone needs to be punished for this heresy But people could sing the wrong words to it, don't you understand? It's an existential threat! Liberal democracy is starting to look a lot like East Germany. https://t.co/1oqDWwp5io It's actually a very catchy tune. I was singing it most of the weekend and I am a foreigner https://t.co/MzETeN1l3z Yes, it may be catchy, but you can't have it anymore because it attracts the Wrong Sort, and rather than debate them or convince them that they're in the wrong the organizers of Oktoberfest would just prefer that they all go away or go to jail thank you. What do liberals fear most? A couple of white boys getting together to chug crispy bois while singing along to a BANGER https://t.co/jeDaTsURvj When you have to start banning random innocuous songs in order to preserve the political order, you know you’re in a regime’s last days: https://t.co/uGXzFRI6g7 There's no way it's a good sign, right? The governments of many European countries appear to be continuing to fight a read-guard action against a huge swath of their own populations, populations that seem to have become increasingly restful and unhappy about what the experiment of 'multiculturalism' has been doing to their national identities and local cultures. It's certainly an issue that has been grappled with time and time again in America, but America at least was founded on a 'melting pot' mentality that is more traditionally open to the idea that people of other cultures can be eventually folded into the overall American culture. Europe for the most part has no such legacy, but the legacy they do have is one of things going very very wrong when their governments begin to try to force ideological uniformity on their people, and when the people begin to resent the influence of outside groups within their countries.... and when things go wrong in Germany they have a way of going very wrong indeed. Let's hope the pendulum swing, when it comes, doesn't swing too far in the opposite direction this time.",

        "description": "Both World Series participants are under .500",
        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks are one win away from the NBA Finals, and the Stars are still in the mix for the Stanley Cup. It’s enough to push the Texas Rangers — the reigning World Series champions — onto the back burner in the Metroplex. Not that the Rangers have done much to compete for attention lately. In the middle of all that basketball and hockey hoopla, Texas hosts the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of the World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year, and Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65, which is in the top half of baseball. The bullpen, however, has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09, with eight blown saves in 17 chances. Offensively, the Rangers were expected to receive a boost from top prospects Evan Carter and Wyatt Langford, but Carter is batting .188. Langford is at .224, and he’s currently on the IL. The good news for Texas is that only Seattle (28-26) is above .500 in the AL West at the moment, and the Mariners lead the Rangers by just three games. The whole division is in negative territory in terms of run differential. Texas manager Bruce Bochy has shown time and time again that all you need to do is make the playoffs to have a shot at winning it all, and the Rangers have plenty of time left to turn their season around — and try to add to this impressive run for Dallas-area sports. TAKING STOCK Last year, 10 of the 12 teams that were in playoff position as of Memorial Day went on to make the postseason. The year before, it was eight out of 12. A fast start that’s lasted this long is generally enough to put a team in very good shape. The postseason odds at FanGraphs already have the Dodgers (98.7, Yankees (98.1 as near-locks to make the playoffs. The Orioles (88.8%) aren’t far behind. Of the teams not currently in playoff position, FanGraphs gives the Astros (53.1%) the best shot to get in. TRIVIA TIME The last two times both defending league champions finished under .500 were in shortened seasons: It happened to the Astros (29-31) and Nationals (26-34) in 2020 and the Blue Jays (55-60) and Phillies (54-61) in 1994. When is the last time it happened in a full season? LINE OF THE WEEK Baltimore’s Kyle Bradish struck out 11 in seven no-hit innings as the Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox 4-1 on Sunday. Bradish left after 103 pitches and Danny Coulombe immediately allowed a home run to Danny Mendick, but that was the only hit of the game for Chicago. COMEBACK OF THE WEEK Pittsburgh trailed by four runs in the bottom of the ninth against San Francisco on Tuesday night before rallying to tie it. Nick Gonzales then hit an RBI single in the 10th to give the Pirates a 7-6 win. The Giants had a win probability of 99.4% in the ninth, according to Baseball Savant. That was the start of a wild week for San Francisco. The Giants overcame deficits of 5-0 and 6-2 to beat the Pirates in their next two games. Then they beat the Mets after being down 6-2 on Friday night and 2-1 in the ninth inning Saturday. New York finally returned the favor Sunday, scoring three runs in the ninth to beat San Francisco 4-3. TRIVIA ANSWER The Royals beat the Cardinals in the 1985 World Series. In 1986, Kansas City went 76-86 and St. Louis was 79-82.",

        "content": "Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for May 27th, 2024. Holiday? What holiday? Shaun never stops! And that’s a good thing, because neither does the eShop. I’ve got a couple short reviews for you today, looking at and the latest release . After that, we have two new releases to check out. We wrap things up in our usual fashion, with a look at the lists of the latest sales and expiring discounts for the day. Let’s get to it! I found myself teetering on the line of what score to assign this game, and ultimately I’ve decided to lean towards the positive side of that line. I’m doing so because after seriously questioning myself as to what didn’t work for me with , the biggest thing I could come up with is that I’ve played too many games like it before. Not exactly the same, of course. This is the only one where I’ve played as an underworld bouncer, for starters. But broadly speaking this sort of top-down twin-stick attack-and-roll roguelite comes a dime a dozen on the Nintendo Switch, and doesn’t strike any meaningful new ground. With that said, it doesn’t do a whole lot wrong either. I think the attacks could use more oomph. I don’t like bosses with lengthy invincible stages in their patterns, and this game loves them. It takes a little longer than it ideally should to properly get cooking, but that’s getting to be a genre-wide issue of late. Otherwise, it’s fine. It plays well, the presentation is interesting, and once you start unlocking things it opens up really well. You can have a really good time playing this game. has an interesting premise that it doesn’t do as much with as you might like, but it’s a perfectly adequate take on the somewhat well-worn roguelite action genre. My time with it was largely enjoyable, even if I don’t know that I’ll remember much about it in the long run. If you’re looking for a cheeky little roguelite to pass a few days with, this will certainly fit the bill. I really appreciate these releases, but I can’t help but wish that D4Enterprise would localize them. I always have to include a caveat in these reviews, because while I think even someone who can’t read a single kana could probably brute force their way through something like with enough persistence, a lot of people aren’t going to enjoy that. And that’s a shame, because it should be an exciting occasion to have on the Switch. It’s a cult classic that most Western players know from its SEGA Master System release. Some readers of this site may remember when it was available on mobile, too. was developed by Compile, a developer probably best known for creating and its series of shoot-em-ups. It’s an action-adventure game, but it’s an odd one. Some parts are top-down sections where you peacefully talk to villagers. Some parts are side-scrolling action with ratchet scrolling. Sometimes it’s a top-down flip-screen affair in the vein of the original . Sometimes it’s vertical auto-scrolling affair, which is pretty strange. Some of that stuff works better than the rest, but it’s a fun game for its era and this MSX2 version is great. You get the usual extras here, so you can use chapter skips to tour the game even if you can’t understand the in-game Japanese text. This is becoming a pattern with releases, but is a cool game and it’s nice to see this MSX2 version made more accessible to players around the world. Unfortunately, the fact that the game in question hasn’t been localized from its original Japanese form means that a lot of folks who might otherwise enjoy playing the game will find themselves frustrated at not being able to make progress. If you’re feeling adventurous and patient, it’s worth the trip. It’s Orbin’ time! All hail the mighty Orb! This is a party-style twin-stick action game for up to four players via local or online multiplayer. Pick your toy, head out on missions, upgrade your toy, and so on. Chuck your Orbs at the enemies to defeat them. Be careful though, as you do not have infinite Orbs. It seems to be generally well-liked over on Steam, and as long as the port came through okay I’m sure it will find an audience on the Switch as well. This is a rather generic side-scrolling platformer with thirty levels spread across four different worlds. Fancy dining it is not, but four dollars it is. Your call as to whether you want this or four tasty Snickers bars. I suppose you could do both if you’re a high roller. If you’ve been waiting for the entire line of titles to be on sale, here’s your moment. You can also grab the and games at a nice discount if you’re interested in some farming fun.

We’ll be back tomorrow with more new releases, more sales, more reviews, and perhaps some news. I’m working through the last bits of right now, and it truly is an incredible experience. My review will be coming soon, but I haven’t been invested in a game’s narrative in a while. I hope you all have a magnificent Monday, and as always, thanks for reading!",

        "description": "The Taoiseach has been warned of ‘profound and systemic’ failures in pre-hospital care.",
        "content": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has said he will “listen very carefully” to pre-hospital emergency medicine consultants who have raised concerns about deficiencies in Ireland’s ambulance service. The Taoiseach said he hopes to meet with consultants who have warned that the survival and long-term health of victims of road traffic collisions and other serious medical emergencies are being put at risk by limited pre-hospital medical treatment. Ireland is an outlier in not sending specialist doctors to the scene of serious accidents to work with paramedics. Potentially life-saving interventions that can be provided on the roadside in other jurisdictions, including the UK and Northern Ireland, cannot be performed by Irish ambulance crews, which comprise paramedics and advanced paramedics whose scope of practice is more limited than that of doctors. As reported by , the Taoiseach has been warned in recent weeks of “profound and systemic” failures in such pre-hospital care, and that Irish people have potentially been “misled” about the quality of care delivered to critically ill and dying trauma patients before they reach hospital. Asked this afternoon whether he shared the doctors’ concerns and what action he planned to take, the Taoiseach said: “The first thing I intend to do is meet with that group.” “It would be the height of arrogance for someone like me to dismiss the views of people on the frontline,” Harris said. He said the government had taken steps that he was proud of to improve the paramedic and ambulance services but he was “very eager and open-eared” to listen to the doctors’ concerns. Dr William Passmore, an NHS consultant in emergency medicine and pre-hospital emergency medicine, has (HEMS) for the thousands of people seriously injured each year in Ireland. Physician-staffed HEMS services are in place across the UK and Northern Ireland. , Dr Brian Burns, an Irish pre-hospital consultant based in Australia, urged the government to work with Northern Ireland to establish an all-island HEMS. “There are time-critical interventions and decision making that must occur early in that initial golden hour [after traumatic injury] that makes the difference between life or death; the difference between return to family, friends and work versus severe long-term disability and lifetime care,” Burns wrote. Other consultants have warned that patients are dying at the scene of accidents or before they reach Irish emergency departments who could be saved with critical care at the scene, and that time-critical interventions such as emergency general anaesthetic and intubation – to prevent brain damage from lack of oxygen – are being delayed until hospital admission when they could be carried out on the roadside. The issue has come to the the fore amid a startling increase in road deaths over the past two years, with 79 lives lost so far this year, up 14% in a year, despite concerted effort by agencies such as the Road Safety Authority to reverse the trend. The Taoiseach has said reducing the number of people killed or seriously injured on the road is In a written statement provided in recent days, the National Ambulance Service (NAS) said it collaborates closely with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service where required, providing mutual support by responding on each side of the border. The NAS has declined a request for interview on the subject of pre-hospital medicine, pre-hospital and inter-hospital retrieval and cross-border cooperation. The HSE has previously said that the NAS tasked helicopters to 904 incidents last year. These incidents were attended by advanced paramedics and paramedics. Doctors sometimes attend the scene of incidents in Ireland but only on an ad hoc and voluntary basis.",

The study, \"Changes in holopelagic Sargassum spp. biomass composition across an unusual year,\" is published in PNAS.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by University of York Researchers have been working to track and study floating sargassum, a prolific seaweed swamping Caribbean and West African shorelines, and causing environmental and economic harm. The study, \" Changes in holopelagic Sargassum spp. biomass composition across an unusual year ,\" is published in PNAS . The stranded seaweed blocks fishing boats; threatens tourism; disrupts turtle nesting sites, reefs and mangroves, and releases toxic gas, which impacts human health and damages electrical equipment. First reported by Christopher Columbus in the 15th century, floating mats of sargassum have long been present in the North Atlantic. However, since 2011, a floating population has established between West Africa and South America, and increased in size to form \"the great Atlantic sargassum belt\"—a 9,000km-long macroalgal bloom, visible from space and estimated to weigh 35 million tons. The massive blooms of sargassum are thought to be down to nutrient pollution and warming seas, and vast quantities of the seaweed end up in landfill each year. The research team, from the Universities of York and Southampton, alongside colleagues from the University of the West Indies in Jamaica and Barbados, set out to learn more about sargassum's biomass composition in order to unlock its potential to be used to produce sustainable products. While the seaweed is an abundant biomass, its possible uses are limited due to its high arsenic content. First author of the study Dr. Carla Machado, a research associate in the Department of Biology, said, \"The small quantities of sargassum that used to wash ashore in the Caribbean provided a habitat for turtles, crabs and fish and contributed to beach formation as it decomposed, but the vast sargassum blooms of the past decade are a global problem that will continue to grow and have a major impact in the affected countries. \"This research project has brought together international researchers specializing in biomass composition and satellite imaging to track, sample and study sargassum, providing crucial new knowledge of this little-understood macroalgae.\" For a biomass to be utilized, it needs to be consistent in its composition; this ensures it can be processed efficiently and behave predictably during production. The results of the study showed that, overall, the biochemical composition of sargassum is consistent throughout the year. The researchers tested different processing methods for the seaweed, including shade-drying or freezing, and found the protein content of the seaweed stayed the same. However, the method of processing did affect levels of other components such as alginate, which can be processed for many applications, including biomaterials. The researchers collected samples of sargassum in Jamaica throughout 2021, which coincided with the April 2021 eruption of La Soufrière on the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent. Using drift patterns, the authors calculated that the sargassum samples they collected in August 2021 would have spent approximately 50 days exposed to ash from the eruption. They found that seaweed that had likely been in contact with volcanic ash contained less arsenic, but had accumulated other elements including nickel and zinc. Lead author of the study, Dr. Thierry Tonon from the Department of Biology at the University of York said, \"Understanding sargassum's response to environmental conditions is crucial for unlocking its biology and potential value. \"With the great sargassum belt also receiving additional nutrients from Sahara dust that blows across the Atlantic, huge quantities of the seaweed washing up on coastlines looks set to become the new normal.\" There is much more work to be done to increase understanding about sargassum and how it is going to behave in years to come, the researchers say. This will provide a body of evidence that could inform an international response to the problems it poses for people and the environment and transform it into something useful. Professor Robert Marsh from the University of Southampton said, \"The sargassum beaching around Jamaica in late summer 2021 carried distinct traces of the volcanic ash that settled upon it around four months earlier, just to the east of St Vincent; this novel 'volcanic tag' confirmed that sargassum arrives each summer at Jamaican beaches after a months-long journey drifting with currents from the central tropical Atlantic.\" Professor Hazel A. Oxenford from the University of the West Indies said, \"Volcanic ash collected in my garden from the St Vincent eruption was used to determine its chemical signature. Being able to detect those components in sargassum after it traveled more than 1,700 km across the Caribbean to Jamaica was exciting. It confirmed our predicted transport pathway for sargassum, showed that the seaweed lives for at least four months and demonstrates the marine connectivity across the region.\" Professor Mona Webber from the University of the West Indies added, \"It is very important for Caribbean Islands being affected by the sargassum inundation to be able to benefit from its valorization. Understanding how the sargassum we collect in Jamaica has changed en route to our shores and factors that could affect especially the arsenic content, will propel us towards safe use of the algal biomass.\" The study was carried out in collaboration between the Universities of York, Southampton and the West Indies.

        "description": "As our planet warms, many species are shifting to different locations as their historical habitats become inhospitable. Trees are no exception—many species' normal ranges are no longer conducive to their health, but their shift to new areas that could better sustain them has been lagging behind those of other plants and animals.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication proofread by SPUN (Society for the Protection of Underground Networks) As our planet warms, many species are shifting to different locations as their historical habitats become inhospitable. Trees are no exception—many species' normal ranges are no longer conducive to their health, but their shift to new areas that could better sustain them has been lagging behind those of other plants and animals. Now, scientists show that the reason for this lag might be found belowground. A study published in PNAS shows that trees, especially those in the far north, may be relocating to soils that don't have the fungal life to support them. Most plants form belowground partnerships with mycorrhizal fungi, microscopic, filamentous fungi that grow in the soil and connect with plant roots to supply plants with critical nutrients in exchange for carbon. Most large coniferous trees in northern latitudes form relationships with a kind of mycorrhizal fungi called ectomycorrhizal fungi . \"As we examined the future for these symbiotic relationships, we found that 35% of partnerships between trees and fungi that interact with the tree roots would be negatively impacted by climate change,\" says lead author Michael Van Nuland, a fungal ecologist at the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN). The trees most at risk of this climate mismatch in North America are those in the pine family, find the authors. Areas of particular concern are the edges of species ranges where trees often face the harshest conditions. Here, the authors discovered that trees with higher survival rate in these locations have more diverse mycorrhizal fungi , a sign that these symbioses may be critical for helping trees withstand the effects of climate change. \"Ectomycorrhizal fungi have a different relationship to climate than ectomycorrhizal trees do,\" says co-author Clara Qin, a data scientist at SPUN. \"We are finding evidence that the trees have to answer for these differences.\" The study sheds light on how climate change might be affecting symbioses. \"While we expect climate-driven migrations to be limited by abiotic factors like the availability of space at higher latitudes and elevations, we don't usually account for biotic limitations like the availability of symbiotic partners,\" says Qin. \"It's absolutely vital that we continue to work to understand how climate change is affecting mycorrhizal symbioses,\" says Van Nuland. \"These relationships underpin all life on Earth—it's critical that we understand and protect them.\" More information: Michael E.

        "content": "Anthony Smith isn’t counting out Dustin Poirier ’s chances just yet. Poirier takes his second crack at winning the undisputed lightweight title when he challenges champion Islam Makhachev at UFC 302 in Newark, N.J. “The Diamond” has held an interim title and fought Khabib Nurmagomedov in a unification bout back in September 2019, but Poirier was submitted by Nurmagomedov and is yet to claim the top spot at 155 pounds. Comparisons between Makhachev and Nurmagomedov are inevitable given that they’ve trained together for ages, so Poirier enters the June 1 clash as a significant underdog . Smith, a light heavyweight contender who also works as an analyst, sees a path to victory for Poirier. “A better chance than a lot of people are,” Smith said on The MMA Hour when asked about his confidence in a Poirier win. “I think that he’s got a lot of momentum right now. I think that there’s a lot of comparisons with Islam and Khabib, but they’re very, very different fighters. I think the biggest difference is Islam is willing to stand and strike with Dustin, and that gives Dustin a lot of opportunities to do well. If he can move his feet and force Islam-like, Khabib had a different mindset. He would just wade through whatever you were throwing, if he could get a hold of anything, he was going to start climbing it like a snake. He gets a hold of you and he just starts sinking and pulling you in and it just gets worse. It’s like quicksand, it gets deeper and deeper. “Islam doesn’t really fight like that. Does he have the ability? I don’t know, but his skill set is more diverse, so he’s willing to do more things. I think that opens up a lot of opportunities for Dustin, especially if Dustin can land early and get Islam-he needs him a little bit nervous and have a healthy bit of respect for him coming into range and I think he can be really successful. I think it starts really early, I think you’re going to know right away.” Nurmagomedov famously went 29-0 as a professional fighter before stepping away from competition in October 2020, and Makhachev has carved out a similar path of dominance with just one loss in 26 bouts. He has won 13 straight fights, including a pair of wins over featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski . Though Smith believes that Poirier’s best chance of winning is to out-strike Makhachev, few will be surprised if Poirier goes for one of his now-famous guillotine choke attempts, a submission that is yet to yield him a victory. Smith understands the urge, given that he just logged the first win via guillotine submission in his 57th pro bout, which took place against Vitor Petrino at UFC 301 this past weekend. It was a moment that Smith credits Poirier for inspiring. “The only reason I thought about was when I was in Miami and Dustin kept saying, ‘You miss every guillotine you don’t jump,’” Smith said. “Then I was just like, ‘F*ck, I don’t have any guillotine finishes in my whole career.’ I don’t even know that I’ve ever jumped one in a fight. “A few weeks ago, I was talking about it in practice and I’ve been hitting them ever since then. I just keep finding myself in these guillotines and I’ve said it probably 20 times, wouldn’t it be sweet if I got a guillotine? And here we are. Pretty crazy.”",

        "content": "Cody Ramsey has taken his first step towards an NRL return, joining St George Illawarra teammates for his first field training session in 18 months after his career was thrown into jeopardy by a severe illness. The St George Illawarra speedster has endured a series of major medical issues over the past 18 months, severely impacting his life and leading doctors to believe he would never return to the NRL. While physically Ramsey is still a shadow of his former self, his determination to prove the experts wrong was rewarded when he joined his teammates on the field in Wollongong for his first ball work session in a year and a half. “Without a doubt, it was a big step for him,” Dragons coach Shane Flanagan told the Herald on Monday. “It was amazing to see the smile on his face and how much it meant to him. Look, to be honest, he is a long way away from playing in the NRL, but for everything he has been through, it was just great to see him back healthy and with the boys.” The Dragons ruled Ramsey out for all of 2023 and 2024 in line with medical advice after his diagnosis in late 2022, but refused to cut ties with the talented outside back. Cody Ramsey returned to training with the Dragons on Monday. Credit: Dragons/Morgan Taylor The club decided to extend his contract, splitting the final year of his deal over two seasons to keep him at the Dragons until at least the end of 2025. Ramsey, a prodigious rugby league talent, has endured several major operations over the past 18 months. Complications raised doubts over his ability to live a normal life, let alone return to professional contact sport. Ulcerative colitis is often caused by an immune system malfunction, causing inflammation and ulcers on the bowel and digestive tract.",

        "content": "“Gold is money. Everything else is credit,” John Pierpont Morgan famously testified while giving evidence to a congressional subcommittee. Investors and market watchers have long regarded precious metals as the ultimate safe haven, a place to fall back on when the world seems to be going to hell in a handcart. if(window.innerWidthADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\" });';document.write(write_html);} This year, jitters around inflation, geopolitical unrest, and a potential US stock market bubble have all helped turn the gold chart into the shape of a hockey stick. An ounce of the coveted soft metal is – at the time of writing – changing hands for £1,910 (/oz), up from around £1,600/oz at the start of the year and £1,484/oz in August 2023. But what exactly is behind this major gold rally – and will it keep going? Gold’s status as a safe haven can be traced back centuries. Used as the world’s first currency in ancient Egypt and – before that – as one of the most sought-after raw ingredients for products like jewellery and sculptures, mankind has ascribed its value for as long as it has existed. Now, the asset is often viewed as useful protection against inflation and uncertainty. Its finite nature stands in stark contrast to cash, which can be devalued by central banks and governments as they decide to print more money. And, unlike its inherently worthless successors—paper cash and, latterly, numbers on a screen—that rely on trust to function, its intrinsic physical value both as a store of wealth and for practical uses further inoculates it from the same collapses of which other asset classes are capable. History also reveals it to be a particularly effective “diversification” asset – by which we mean its price does not have a close relationship to other assets, like equities or debt. This has made it a popular vehicle led by investors, savers and pessimists alike. With the inflation shocks of 2022 and 2023 now behind most major Western economies, some market commentators thought the gold price would start to mellow. Higher rates and a tighter money supply tend to make holding cash and letting it earn interest more appealing than sitting on gold, which doesn’t have a guaranteed yield. In a piece of research at the start of the year, JP Morgan – the bank, not their gold-lauding founder – claimed it was still “bullish” on gold but predicted the metal would peak at $2,300/oz (£1,808) in 2025. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} The timing of this research is noteworthy for two reasons. It was published in January, long enough ago to be at the height of rate cut speculation across Western developed economies when markets were pricing in as many as five rate cuts. Yet it was also recent enough for the inflationary events of October 7 – and the subsequent fighting in Gaza and the Red Sea shipping crisis – to have both taken place continued afoot long enough for them not to be viewed as short-term shocks. JP Morgan factored both of these major drivers into their gold forecast, and still, the gold price had shot past their estimate before the end of April 2024. Why? As ever, there is no catch-all reason to explain the rise. Rather, an accumulation of factors combining to reflect growing uncertainty has pushed up the gold price. Parochially, there are two major Western elections taking place this year. And while two British technocrats having it out this summer is unlikely to send people fleeing to their bomb shelters, the prospect of a second Donald Trump term or, worse still, a contested result that pushes the US Constitution to breaking point yet again will be playing on investors’ minds. All the while, some of the sharpest minds in investment believe that despite this week’s temporary reprieve , inflation is here to stay. The likes of investment house Ruffer and Professor Russell Napier both anticipate rising prices to be an abiding characteristic of the next few years, thanks to de-globalisation and growth in money supply. Gold is no different from any other asset in that its price is as much an indication of expected value as it is of current value – meaning that the current price of gold reflects predictions of a period of sticky inflation. With these geopolitical and economic tensions rarely out of the headlines, it’s easy to ignore another major force pushing up the soft metal’s price: central banks and individuals in the global south – namely Turkey, China, India and Kazakhstan – are buying up gold in record numbers. According to Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) bought up 735 tonnes of gold in 2023, while Chinese private sector net imports totalled 1,411 tonnes in 2023 and 228 tonnes this January alone. ADVERTISEMENT This latter camp’s interest in the precious metal has largely been attributed to the major collapse of the country’s housing market, prompting private investors to seek refuge in safer assets. Meanwhile, the Chinese state’s play is – according to economist Philip Pilkington – a sign of a growing trend towards “de-dollarisation”. In recent decades, most countries have decided to store their currency reserves in the dollar due to its consistency and robust track record. But since the US’s seizure of Russian currency reserves in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, nations like China and the likes of Kazakhstan have sold some of those dollar reserves to negate the damage wrought on their economies by a similar fallout with US.

        "content": "LEO WOODALL has already dazzled us with his TV acting skills, personality and good looks — but now he is working on getting the full Hollywood physique. I can reveal the actor, who found fame on dramas including The White Lotus and One Day, put a mini-gym on the rider of his current film, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. It is so he can always look buff when playing London gardener Rockstar, who becomes the toyboy crush of Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger. A TV insider said: “Leo is already in great shape. “But given the fact he’s supposed to be someone who spends all day doing manual work, he really wants to look the part. “So, as the consummate acting pro that he is, Leo is said to be hitting the weights between takes so he can look his best for the cameras. And judging by some of the images that have been coming from the set of the film, the hard work certainly seems to be paying off.” Leo already had viewers hot under the collar when he stripped off in the second series of The White Lotus in 2022. He played Jack, an Essex boy who was hiding an uncomfortable secret underneath his cocky exterior. Then he had audiences in tears playing the leading man Dexter in One Day , an adaptation of the romantic novel by David Nicholls. It was screened on Netflix earlier this year, and once again saw Leo lose his clothes in love scenes. But the actor admitted he had to stop working out so much because he figured the character would not be into beefing up. He said: “I remember thinking that Dex can’t be a big gym guy.” But the need for more muscle was obvious when he took on the role of Rockstar, a Hampstead Heath park attendant in Mad About The Boy. Not only have the movie’s producers put him in an extremely tight T-shirt, Leo also has to have Bridget attracted by his charms, or maybe just his arms. MALALA YOUSAFZAI may be an education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, but she likes a laugh. She was invited to feature in the second series of Channel 4 music comedy We Are Lady Parts, about a rock band. Writer Nida Manzoor said: “I had this idea for the song, Malala Made Me Do It, it’s a hype track. I was massively stressed out about how we were going to make sure Malala had a good time. “She was so laid back and easy- going. She also has a very dark sense of humour, and she’s so funny.” IS Love Island taking inspiration from fellow dating show My Mum, Your Dad? After Davina McCall's series proved daters with more life experience can create TV gold, ITV has upped its age limit for the Love Island villa. The full cast, revealed in The Sun yesterday , are the show’s oldest bunch of sexy singles yet. They include a hairdresser, mental health nurse and a sweet salesman. But they also include footballer Ronnie Vint, 27, and recruiter Munveer Jabbal, 30, who says he is mates with Piers Morgan's son Spencer. Then there’s office worker Patsy Field, 29, and make-up artist Samantha Kenny, 26, also alongside the usual clutch of those in their early twenties. It means the average age of the Islanders in this year’s line-up is 25 – more than two years older than in any other season. A source said: “Two years might not sound like a lot but in Love Island years it really is. “Having the older castmates in the mix will hopefully bring about better conversations, meatier storylines and a lot more drama.” Which is handy, because host Maya Jama has revealed her main goal for this year’s series is more war than peace. Ahead of the launch next Monday at 9pm on ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX, she said: “I’ll be honest, I’m hoping for drama. “I want loads of love and happy couples at the end but I do want to be entertained, so I’m hoping for lots of fiery moments.” I CAN reveal comedy drama This Is Going To Hurt has reached the end of its life, with no plans for a second series. The Bafta -winning BBC One show was based on real-life experiences of former NHS doctor Adam Kay and starred Ben Whishaw. Director Lucy Forbes said: “There’s zero chance of it coming back it’s categorically gone. “This Is Going To Hurt was a very popular series and it could have continued, but we told a self-contained story in a single series that was rounded off at the end of the seventh and final episode.” It is at odds with what creator Adam had shared last year, when he hinted: “If I thought of ideas for one I might do it. It remains a possibility.” JOSEPH Fiennes was more scared of having no props or a script than dangers Canada’s wilderness threw at him. He was joined by his cousin – – Sir Ranulph Fiennes – for National Geographic’s Fiennes: Return to the Wild. They retrace the steps of the explorer’s 1971 tour of British Columbia. But death-defying glaciers and mountain peaks were the least of his worries. Joseph said: “I much prefer props and moustaches, and you know, a script to hide behind. “There’s something kind of scary about being exposed and having to be yourself. It’s devised to a degree but it’s unscripted. I’d rather hide behind another persona than to be myself because I’m a little bit awkward.” The second episode is on Sunday.",

        "description": "Those painful bumps can be tough to ignore. Experts recommend the best way to soothe and prevent knots.",
        "content": "If you’ve ever had a shoulder massage or used a foam roller, you have probably found a few small painful bumps deep in a muscle. Once you’re aware of these bulges – called myofascial trigger points, or muscle knots – they can be tough to ignore. But what exactly are muscle knots, and how do they form? Can they cause any long-term issues? And what are the best ways to get rid of them? Muscle knots can form when a muscle is overloaded, either through exercise or poor posture. Credit: Getty Images What causes muscle knots? Muscle knots tend to form when a muscle is overloaded, either through exercise or poor posture. They are most commonly found in the neck, upper trapezius and upper shoulder muscles, as well as the mid-back, forearms and calves. Loading For instance, leaning over a computer for hours a day may not feel like a workout, but it can fatigue your neck, shoulder, back and forearm muscles, says Dr Josh Goldman, associate director of the Centre for Sports Medicine at UCLA Health. “Your neck is bent down staring at a computer screen for eight hours,” he says. “That’s a pretty aggressive load on the body.” When muscles are overtaxed, they can become damaged, causing certain points to shorten or tighten – and stay that way. Some researchers believe the surrounding tissue (or fascia) thickens and becomes less elastic, creating a dense ball. They theorise this may lead to decreased blood flow and fluid in the area, as well as inflammation. Why do they hurt? Scientists aren’t entirely sure why some knots hurt and others don’t, or why some hurt only when pressed while others ache all the time, says Christopher DaPrato, a physical therapist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies chronic pain in athletes.",

        "description": "Nebraska Pride, a full-tackle football team made up of women and nonbinary athletes, has players ranging in age from 17 to 40-something.",
        "content": "The fading sunlight glints off the top of Nicole Skolnick’s helmet. Her brown hair, twisted into a single braid, falls between the two words printed on the back of her jersey: Earn it. Football in her hands, Skolnick turns to the receiver to her left. “Ready, set, go,” Skolnick says. Players huddle at the start of a Nebraska Pride women’s tackle football team practice at Blackburn Alternative Program in Omaha in mid-April. The receiver begins running a route across the middle of the football field. Skolnick delivers a perfect spiral in her direction. The next receiver lines up. “Ready, set, go.” And repeat. It was mid-April and the Nebraska Pride football team was preparing for its first game of the season. In every corner of the field, offensive and defensive players were working on drills as coaches yelled instructions. As a kid, Skolnick did everything she could to get on a football field. She played flag football and playground games with the boys until her opportunities to play petered out. Now an adult, her football dreams have come true. Skolnick plays wide receiver and backup quarterback for the Nebraska Pride, a full-tackle football team made up of women and nonbinary athletes. The players range in age from 17 to 40-something. They are educators, police officers, firefighters, students and health care professionals. Nicole Skolnick (No. 15) runs with the ball during a Nebraska Pride women’s tackle football team practice at Blackburn Alternative Program. Skolnick loved football as a kid and is glad to play again as an adult. Some players also are mothers. While the players are on the field, some of their kids play along the sidelines. During the practice in April, a toddler danced to “Baby Shark” near the offensive line. Players, who pay to play, drive to Omaha from Lincoln, Oakland, Columbus, Nebraska City and Des Moines, Iowa, to be on the team. The team practices and plays its home games at local high school football stadiums. This year, the team is practicing at Blackburn Alternative Program’s football stadium and playing home games at Gale Wickersham stadium in Council Bluffs. Women’s tackle football has been around for decades, including several previous teams in Omaha. Some of the Pride players started their football careers on those teams. Now in its second season with the Women’s Football Alliance, the team has something to prove after losing in the second round of the playoffs last year. “Going into this year we have a fire burning inside of us that we want to earn it,” said head coach Nancy Javaux-Major. “And so we’ve been putting in a lot of work. We’re earning it now so we can collect our ring later.” So far this season, that fire has resulted in the absolute scorching of opponents. The Pride beat the Sioux Falls Snow Leopards 77-2, the Iowa Phoenix 62-0 and the Minnesota Minx 85-0. Javaux-Major said the team has to keep scoring in order to bolster its postseason chances because the teams they’ve played so far this season belong in a lower division. The more points the Pride puts up, the better the team will do in the long run, the coach said. The Pride also are just playing really well. “For lack of a better term, the ball has just fallen into our lap in the endzone quite a bit,” Javaux-Major said. The rest of the season should be a more of a challenge. The Pride’s remaining games are against higher-ranked opponents. The team finds its players through word of mouth or social media. Some are former college athletes in other sports while others have never participated in any sport before joining the team. “A lot of people go in with a timid approach to it and then a lot of people are like ‘Get me in there. I’m ready to hit somebody,’” Javaux-Major said. “You have a good mix of both.” The Nebraska Pride women's tackle football team practices at Blackburn Alternative Program in Omaha in mid-April. Mika Richards played wide receiver and cornerback for the team last year. How much did Richards know about football before starting in 2022? “Zero.” But Richards had just moved to Omaha and wanted to try a new sport. “Once someone was like, ‘All right, you run and tackle someone.’ I said absolutely,” Richards said. “Everything else will come.” Tiffany Wright, who plays running back and defensive back, always wanted a shot on the football field. Now, Wright said playing the game is just fun. She gets to run around on a field, catch balls and hit people. “It’s super competitive,” Wright said. “You have to really put your whole self into it or it’s not going to work. I love the team aspect of it. Everybody on the team is kind of like my family now.” The team’s name and lion mascot have a few different meanings. When people look at a pride of lions, Javaux-Major said people often think the male is the head honcho but it’s actually the female that takes care of the pride. “It just kind of brings family together for us,” she said. “Gives a bigger meaning than what we are ourselves.” Javaux-Major said she has watched her players go from struggling mentally to thriving through the confidence they build on the football field. “Honestly, as a coach, the confidence I see in women after they start playing is just mind-blowing.” Nancy Javaux-Major, head coach for the Nebraska Pride women's tackle football team, center, talks with Britt Peterson, left, and Jessica Stewart, right, during a practice. “Honestly, as a coach, the confidence I see in women after they start playing is just mind-blowing,\" she said. So far this season, Javaux-Major has watched the rookies grow more confident. They’re now making tackles and catches they missed earlier in the season. Players are getting their first touchdowns and sacks. Javaux-Major said she likes to watch the players’ elated faces as they come off the field after their first big play. Laura Hansen, a mother of two, joined the team because she was looking for a place to make new friends and to find out what her body could do. “I’ve actually never played any sports whatsoever,” Hansen said. “Ever.” A co-worker encouraged Hansen to try out for the team. She’s now the team’s center — guaranteed to touch the ball every offensive play while snapping the ball to the quarterback. “That’s the coolest thing I get to say about myself is, ‘I play center,’” Hansen said. “I start at center.” Born and raised in Lincoln, Hansen said Husker football is in her blood but she quickly discovered that playing football and watching football are completely different things. Aside from learning all the plays, how to snap the ball and move past mistakes, Hansen had to learn how to adjust her helmet to make it more comfortable. “Nobody told me how to put a helmet on,” Hansen said. “I’ve just kind of been winging it. Never played. I don’t know how to do this kind of stuff.” Along the way, her coaches and teammates helped her. When she twisted an ankle while playing, Javaux-Major and her wife showed up to mow her lawn. Hansen said football has given her a new community. She’s found people she can talk to, have fun with and do hard things with, Hansen said. “It isn’t easy,” she said of football. While women’s tackle football isn’t as popular as other women’s sports, Javaux-Major said she thinks interest is growing. She’s already had several moms reach out to her because their daughters are interested in joining the team. “I don’t think the women’s sports wave is going to go anywhere any time soon so I think we’ll catch it eventually,” Javaux-Major said of women’s football. “We’ll just be late — catching the wave as it’s starting to crest.” Ilyasah Shabazz takes a photo of the bust of her father, Malcolm X, after he was inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame during a ceremony in the Warner Legislative Chamber in Lincoln on Wednesday, May 22, 2024.

        "content": "If the tackle is the pre-eminent skill in AFL footy, then yes, ball-carriers this year are getting away with murder. One spin, two, then as the manoeuvre threatens to become a full-scale pirouette, a toe-poke of a kick or a centrifugal handball, and it is play on. The days when the 359th degree was considered to be the point at which having the ball became holding the ball are long gone. The Crows’ Jake Soligo gets caught holding the ball by Campbell Chesser, of the Eagles on Sunday. Credit: AFL Photos And the crowd howls for “ball”, and howls again at the injustice of it all when it is not paid, except the half that are cheering because it isn’t paid. The tackle is one skill, but it’s not the foremost, and there is nothing either in the letter of the laws or their spirit that says the tackler must be rewarded for the mere fact of laying the tackle. If they neither dispossess their opponent nor force them into an illegal disposal, then play on it should be. Here’s another way of looking at it: Yes, the tackle is a skill, but so is breaking a tackle. It’s the 11th commandment: Thou shall not get caught in the act. The clever ones don’t. Of course, there are layers to this perennial debate. In the way some players fall on the ball, or contrive somehow no longer to have it, or have control of it, some are getting away at least with manslaughter. They must have good lawyers. Lachlan Sullivan was controversially penalised for handing the ball to Nick Daicos, instead of the umpire. Credit: AFL Photos It is also true that in this era of concussion consciousness, players are warier of tackling their opponents to the ground because it might mean a couple of weeks or more out of the game for both of them, two headaches. Yes, it makes it harder to stick a tackle. Yes, it means developing a new technique. This should be celebrated, not mourned. Coaches say they fear protracted tackles will lead to more injuries, but this has not been proven. And if it truly leads to a reduction in the incidence of concussion, it might even be seen as the game’s necessary evolution. Otherwise, footy is just banging its head against a wall. Coaches worry about losing players. Players worry about losing their minds.",

Car washes often recommend that customers before entering a car wash tunnel because the protruding mirrors can easily become entangled in equipment and damaged. The Daily Dot contacted Halo Car Wash to learn more about its policies regarding cars that sustain damage during washes. In the comments section, many noted that car wash customers typically know that they must fold in mirrors when using the service. “I thought it was common sense to fold ur mirrors in during car washes,” user Magoditsham commented on the video. “Supposed to fold ur mirrors, girl,” another viewer said. “Free car wash ended up costing atleast $50,” another viewer wrote. Others suggested the woman try a “touch-less” car wash in the future. “Go touch-less avoid multiple scratches on your car or damage,” user baggedm5 said. The Daily Dot reached out to Hannah H by TikTok comment and Halo Car Wash via contact form for more information.

        "description": "In Facebook posts this week, a contractor for the District 177 project said he and fellow contractors are not being paid by NGC Group and Rev Development.",
        "content": "As a North Platte mall redevelopment nears completion of the first phase of construction, contractors are filing liens against the Lincoln-based developer and general contractor assigned to the project. Eric Wiezorek, owner of Kingdom Customs Flooring and Construction, posted Facebook messages Thursday saying he and fellow contractors had not been paid for work at the $75 million-plus project. NGC Group, the general contractor hired by Rev Development LLC to oversee the project, said in a Facebook response Friday that the company would fulfill contracts when inspections were completed and the tenant accepted the contracted work. NGC Group and Rev Development are both based in Lincoln. Wiezorek made his frustrations known publicly two days after the North Platte City Council advanced on first reading a proposal to increase Rev’s “enhanced employment area” tax maximum amount by $3.3 million over its maximum 20-year life. However, Wiezorek and another local contractor confronted Rev co-owner Justin Hernandez about the unpaid bills outside the council chamber before the May 21 meeting ended. Rev officials said during the meeting that the additional $3.3 million in EEA funds would help finance a second multi-use building in an undeveloped space on the south side of the property. In his Facebook posts and in telephone conversations with the North Platte Telegraph, Wiezorek said NGC Group owes almost $2 million to roughly 11 contractors, including $83,000 owed for work Wiezorek’s company did on Five Below and T.J. Maxx. According to Wiezorek, he was supposed to be receiving progress payments on the 10th of each month. “I started to notice a problem when they weren’t paying my progress payments,” he said. Wiezorek said that when he asked NGC Group why the payments had not been made, he was told the developer was waiting for T.J. Maxx to pay them. “That wasn’t the agreement,” Wiezorek said “The agreement was not to wait until T.J. Maxx pays us. The agreement is I work for you, you’re in contract with me, you pay me for work rendered.” In its Friday response, the District 177 developers said the work done by Kingdom Customs, Wiezorek’s company, “has not yet passed inspection relating to the project specifications.” “The need for extra attention and supplementation toward that work is directly impacting the tenant’s acceptance of the space and, in turn, results in a corresponding delay in the release of payment for the work completed,” the post said. “NGC will continue to work with contractors through the remaining items that are necessary to obtain approvals and close out these projects, similar to the process we have successfully employed to reach resolution on previous projects in the district.” However, Wiezorek said it was not only his business that hasn’t received payment. Other businesses that have filed liens include Aupperle Plumbing & Heating Inc., K & S Electric Inc. and Troyer Enterprises Inc., according to weekly roundups of construction liens in The New Weekly Record, an online North Platte publication. Wiezorek told The Telegraph he hired a lawyer Thursday to begin the process of also filing a lien. “They’re using the money off of hardworking contractors to build their little enterprise, and they’re pulling it off as how amazing they are and how much they love our community,” Wiezorek said. Because of the two-month delay in payment from the project, Wiezorek said, he had to pay his employees out of pocket in addition to paying for the work done at both T.J. Maxx and Five Below. “It’s crippling because it took every bit of my savings and all of my capital just to keep my doors open,” he said. “That’s how devastating this was. There were a couple weeks that we didn’t get a paycheck.” As a North Platte native, Wiezorek said, this was a devastating experience. “I love this community, and I thought one of the greatest honors I’ve ever been able to be a part of is to be able to rebuild the very center of our community,” he said. “To me, it was more than just getting paid. It was pouring into the future of this community.” City Councilman Brad Garrick, who has supported the transformation efforts for the former Platte River Mall, said he is working to find a solution for everybody. “Obviously, the contractors need to get paid,” he said. “But we also don’t want to slow down things happening, because there are amazing things happening out at the mall. So we’re just trying to mediate and find that happy middle ground that’s going to work for everybody and keep things moving.” Telegraph reporter Todd von Kampen contributed to this story.

        "content": "When Minister for Arts Catherine Martin officially launched the pilot Basic Income for Artists (BIA) scheme in 2022, she promised its outcomes would be measured against a control group of artists who did not receive the payment. Yesterday, the results of the first full year of that process, up to October 2023, were published. The numbers are promising and suggest that BIA is having a real impact on the ability of artists to devote themselves to their work. Recipients spent almost eight hours more per week on their creative practice. They invested ¤550 more per month – almost 40 per cent of their monthly payment – on equipment and materials, advertising and marketing, workspaces and work travel. Recipients were also less likely to have been unable to work in the arts or to cite low pay as a reason for not being able to do so. They spent less time working in non-arts jobs and were more likely to be able to make their living through arts work alone. Not surprisingly, they experienced lower levels of material deprivation and substantially higher levels of life satisfaction. Not everything is measurable, of course. The question of the quality of the works of art themselves can only be answered by posterity, but the report shows that the quantity has clearly increased; those who received the basic income have completed more pieces of work than those who didn’t.

But if The 2 Johnnies ‘were never ours’, why hire them? The BIA pilot is an imaginative intervention which has attracted international attention. It comes alongside a step change in State support for the cultural sector since 2020, with a near doubling of the allocation to the Arts Council and enhanced funding in other areas. Caution is advisable when discussing a direct correlation between increased funding and artistic excellence. But there is no denying the recent international acclaim for Irish artists working in literature, cinema and other fields. After decades of lip service and underinvestment, it is a new and refreshing experience to see those artistic achievements being matched by enthusiastic State support.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 4, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases.

Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Loading... Loading... DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Checkpoint had overstated its oversight of, and/or its establishment of adequate manufacturing standards and controls over, its third-party contract manufacturers; (2) accordingly, there were one or more issues with Checkpoint's third-party contract manufacturing organization (\"CMO\") for cosibelimab, Checkpoint's lead antibody product candidate; (3) all the foregoing reduced the likelihood that the Federal Drug Administration would approve the cosibelimab Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") in its present form; (4) as a result, the manufacturing, regulatory, and commercial prospects of cosibelimab were overstated; and (5) as a result, Checkpoint's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

        "description": "The United States and the State of Iowa allege that for five years the surgeon submitted false claims for health care services to government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid.",
        "content": "A former plastic surgeon from Iowa is denying allegations that he defrauded taxpayers and falsely billed Medicare and Medicaid for procedures he never performed. Dr. Adam B. Smith, also known as “Adam Bryant,” is being sued by the United States and the State of Iowa, which allege that for five years Smith submitted false claims for health care services to government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, from August 2014 to August 2019 Smith was practicing plastic surgery at Sioux City’s Tri-State Specialists. While there, the DOJ claims, Smith engaged in a “concerted pattern of fraudulent behavior in order to obtain or increase government reimbursement.” Smith is accused of using templated medical records in which he repeatedly reported false, contradictory, or even fabricated information about the patients’ health status, the care he provided and the procedures he performed. The DOJ alleges Smith routinely attempted to mask the true nature of the surgical procedures he performed, in some cases by performing non-covered cosmetic procedures while documenting that the procedures were, in fact, medically necessary surgeries for which he could bill Medicare or Medicaid. “Smith’s records are replete with instances in which he billed government payors for complicated and highly compensated procedures that were performed in impossibly short amounts of time,” the DOJ claims. “As a result, Smith and his practice were paid hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars in excess of what they were entitled to.” As an example, the government claims Smith performed what’s commonly called a “tummy tuck” on one patient and then billed it to Medicaid as a medically necessary hernia repair. By doing so, the DOJ claims, Smith collected $3,750 he wasn’t entitled to receive. Smith recently filed a response to the allegations, denying any wrongdoing. The United States alleges Smith submitted more than 1,000 false claims for payment. Under the federal False Claims Act, the United States is entitled to a judgment of between $13,000 and $27,000 for each false claim, as well as a judgement that’s equal to three times the total cost of the false claims. Court records indicate that well before Smith began practicing as an Iowa-licensed physician, he was, in the view of the DOJ, fraudulently billing Medicare for services. From May 2011 through January 2014, Smith practiced plastic surgery in Traverse City, Michigan. In December 2021, the United States filed a civil suit against Smith alleging that during his time practicing in Michigan, he routinely billed Medicare for procedures he did not perform. That case resulted in a default judgment against Smith and his practice. Court records indicate that Smith’s colleague at Tri-State Specialists, Dr. Matthew Steele, blew the whistle on Smith after becoming familiar with Smith’s billing practices. In 2019, Steele initiated litigation against Smith through the False Claims Act. As the individual who initiated the case against Smith, Steele can now share in any money that might be recovered through the Department of Justice’s pursuit of the case. In 2021, Smith voluntarily surrendered his Iowa medical license after the Iowa Board of Medicine filed charges against him related to his billing practices. That same year, the United States entered into a settlement agreement with Smith’s Sioux City employer, Tri-State Specialists, for $612,501. Heightened demand made nursing a high-paying profession over the last decade, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Nationally, registered nurses today earn more than $45 per hour on average—about $14 more than the average wage across all occupations in the United States. Traveling nurses with the same skills and credentials can earn another $16 more per hour, on average, compared to staff nurses. A typical contract for a traveling nurse is about 13 weeks but can be much shorter or longer. In some states, the pay discrepancy between travel and staff nurses is even more dramatic. Vivian Health leveraged its own proprietary data, along with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , to analyze pay differences between staff and travel nurses in Iowa as part of a broader national analysis . Data from both sources was last updated in May 2023. BLS data on registered nurses is conflated with staff nursing positions in this analysis, though the numbers would technically include travel nurses, as well. However, travel nurses comprise a small portion of the overall RN workforce, and their wages won't affect the overall averages too much. The pandemic exacerbated existing nursing shortages, driving high demand for RNs who could temporarily fill gaps. While COVID-19-related demand has eased, travel nurses remain a vital solution for ongoing nursing shortages. Get local news delivered to your inbox!",

        "content": "If gun laws currently being debated in Western Australia had taken effect before a Perth man murdered two women, he may not have owned so many guns, or the one he used for the killings. But it remains to be seen whether the new laws would have been more effective in enabling police to confiscate his firearms when his ex-wife both described to them his previous acts of domestic violence, and made it clear to police that she feared him. On Monday Police Minister Paul Papalia detailed how the new laws would have applied in the aftermath of 63-year-old Mosman Park man Mark Bombara murdering Jennifer Petelczyc, 59, and her 18-year-old daughter Gretl in their Floreat home on Friday, as he hunted for his ex-wife. He then turned the gun on himself. Premier Roger Cook and Police Minister Paul Papalia talk about gun laws. Credit: Hamish Hastie Bombara used a handgun he legally owned under a collector licence. It was one of two handguns he owned under this licence. WAtoday understands at least one of those handguns was a Glock. “He was a law-abiding firearm owner right up until he wasn’t,” Papalia said. Parliamentarians will debate the state’s biggest-ever overhaul of its gun laws, known as the Firearms Bill, in the upper house this week in the shadow of this crime. Papalia said the Floreat tragedy had demonstrated how inadequate the current laws were, and detailed how the new laws might have impacted an owner such as Bombara. Removal of recreational licences Bombara owned 13 guns, 11 on a recreational licence and two collector-licensed guns, including the murder weapon.",

        "description": "Jorvik Viking Centre has launched a new Viking history trail for the May half term for children in York.",
        "content": "A new trail has been launched for the May half term for children in York. The Viking history below York’s streets is the subject of a new free trail being launched by Jorvik Viking Centre. A Journey through Viking York is a new free audio tour created by the team to highlight significant places in the 10th-century Viking city. The audio tour has been created as part of the centre’s 40th anniversary celebrations, and takes participants on a walk through York’s city centre, exploring key locations in the city’s history. A different Viking tells their story at each location, adding colour and depth to the stories of the Norse settlers who settled, farmed, crafted and traded in the capital of the North, from AD 867 until AD 1080. “This is a fantastic way to explore the city using your mobile device as your guide,” said Gareth Henry, head of digital engagement for York Archaeology. “Many people don’t realise just how extensive the Viking-age city was – at its peak, its population was estimated at 8,000 to 10,000 people, so much of the contemporary city centre would have also been part of the Viking city. It is the perfect introduction to the city’s rich Norse heritage and a great way to prepare ahead of a visit to Jorvik Viking Centre itself.” The Jorvik Centre in Coppergate Walk is celebrating its 40 anniversary Characters narrating their stories along the way include a warrior from the Great Heathen Army, a trader, a skald – the Norse word for a storyteller – and a priest, who tells how the old pagan religion made its way to Christianity during the Viking period. The story continues beyond the defeat of the Vikings at the Battle of Fulford, with the first Norman Sheriff of Yorkshire and a moneyer. The trail starts at St Helen’s Square, outside the Mansion House, taking in York Minster, King’s Square, Ouse Bridge, Bishophill, York Castle and finishing in Coppergate. The audio on the tour lasts an hour, so with walking between venues, the trail should take just under two hours to complete. The route between stops on the tour is fully wheelchair accessible, and visitors are guided along the way on Google Maps. The trail starts in St Helen’s Square A Journey Through Viking York has been created as part of Visit York’s Year of Trails, which has included the Ice Trail, Snook trail and the current Trailblazers. It will be available free of charge until the end of March 2025 from jorvikthing.com/vikingtrail. For further information, please visit jorvikvikingcentre.co.uk",

        "content": "Minister of Digital Affairs Huang Yen-nun speaks to reporters at a meeting of the legislature’s Transportation Committee in Taipei yesterday.Photo: Lo Pei-de, Taipei Times CHECK AND REPORT: People can submit messages they believe to be scams, and the system would use artificial intelligence to analyze the content, the digital minister said By Shelley Shan / Staff reporter The Ministry of Digital Affairs aims to establish within three months a platform for people to report suspected fraudulent information found online, Minister of Digital Affairs Huang Yen-nun (黃彥男) said yesterday, as lawmakers questioned the ministry’s response to fraudulent advertisements. In his first presentation to the legislature’s Transportation Committee since being sworn in last week, Huang laid out his three policy goals of fighting fraud, bolstering national digital resilience and developing the digital economy. Huang made a series of ambitious pledges, from training 1,000 cybersecurity specialists within two years to generating NT$1 trillion (US$31.07 billion) in output value from the digital economy. However, legislators on the committee focused mostly on the government’s progress in curbing online fraud, particularly that which involved fake products or ads using the names or likenesses of celebrities without their consent. Citing National Police Agency data, Taiwan People’s Party Legislator Lin Kuo-cheng (林國成) said that the number of fraud cases has risen from about 23,000 in 2019 to about 38,000 last year, while the amount of money lost through fraud during that period soared from NT$4.29 billion to NT$8.944 billion. Lin asked Huang if he can offer better solutions to deter fraud. Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lin Chun-hsien (林俊憲) said that even though the Criminal Police Bureau had issued 107 administrative rulings asking online platform operators to remove more than 100,000 investment fraud advertisements, the same ads later reappeared. “This shows that operators are only passively tackling fraudulent ads on their platforms. They forgot that they have a responsibility toward society apart from selling ads for money,” Lin Chun-hsien said. Currently, only advertisers of political content are required to register with their real names, but that rule does not apply to those posting commercial ads. “The ministry needs to ask platform operators to regulate themselves. You need to toughen up on this matter, or they would not be afraid of you. You have nothing to fear because justice is on your side,” Lin Chun-hsien said. Huang said he hoped lawmakers would quickly pass a draft act on fraud prevention and control during this legislative session, which would provide the legal basis for the ministry to require companies such as Facebook, Google and Line to have legal representatives in Taiwan and comply with the government’s anti-fraud regulations. Platform operators who fail to comply could face a fine of up to NT$25 million or the suspension of their business if it is a serious offense, the draft act says. Meanwhile, the ministry would within three months build a platform for people to report suspected fraudulent text messages or e-mails, he said. “We would then use artificial intelligence to analyze the content. If the content is deemed to be suspicious, we would relay them to other government agencies, depending on the content of the messages,” he said. The Taiwan Network Information Center can also help block fraudulent Web sites, he added. “People can continue to use the 165 anti-fraud hotlines to report fraud if they have been scammed or if the information they received has been confirmed to be a scam. If they are not sure whether a message they receive is fraudulent, they can post it on the platform we are creating to check it,” Huang said. “If the message turns out to be fraudulent, we will forward it to the police. People would not need to report it to the police again.” Since amendments to the Electronic Signature Act (電子簽證法) have been passed, online platform operators can only display ads if they have secured electronic signatures from the advertisers, which would help prevent people from being deceived by ads fraudulently using the likenesses of celebrities. Deputy Minister of Digital Affairs Lin Yi-jing (林宜敬) said that in a meeting with platform operators last week, they told him that they need to follow laws stipulated by the countries in which their parent companies are based and need about a year to update their systems. “I also told them that they need to follow laws in Taiwan if they are doing business here,” he said. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

This week’s epic instalments will finally see Lauren Bolton’s (Cait Fitton) killer be unmasked, following her disappearance at the end of February . Since then, Roy has been prime suspect and having been refused bail twice , has been spending time at His Majesty’s Pleasure ahead of the trial date. The residents of Weatherfield have, understandably, been desperate to free him and have been on their own search for answers. In tonight’s (27th May) episode, Sarah Platt (Tina O’Brien) was on her own warpath, and set her sights on ensuring vile paedophile Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) was arrested . To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Finding one of Lauren’s hair bobbles at No. 8, she headed down to the building site Nathan is working on and planted it in his van. However, he quickly caught her in the act and detective Kit Green (Jacob Roberts) ensured her that his team were working around the clock to find the culprit.

        "content": "We brought word last week that former prime minister Scott Morrison had sought to bathe his overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal leader in a divine light. But it now looks like ScoMo might need some help from on high with the underwhelming local sales of his memoir. Loading The blaze of free publicity accompanying the publication of Plans For Your Good: A Prime Minister’s Testimony of God’s Faithfulness , had CBD thinking the man dubbed “Scotty from Marketing” had not lost his touch. So you’d think after that deluge of free plugs in print TV, radio and online, copies of the thing would be flying off the shelves, right? Well, chatter among publishing types that the book has been a flop in Australian mainstream retail and online outlets, sent us searching for hard data. According to the most authoritative sales index, Nielsen BookScan, in the week to May 18 Plans sold 218 copies in the 1300 Australian booksellers monitored by the global analytics giant, putting the nation’s 30th prime minister at 827th spot on Nielsen’s bestseller list for the week. Oh, and the hardback notched up one sale on the Nielsen index. Scott Morrison says his prayers.

Morrison certainly made no secret, prior to publication, that he was targeting the massive evangelical book market in the US, worth about $1.14 billion in 2022.

        "content": "Cranes, containers and an Evergreen cargo truck are pictured at the Port of Kaohsiung on May 8. The government’s business climate monitor last month returned to a “yellow-red” signal after a two-year hiatus, indicating steady growth, the National Development Council said yesterday.Photo: CNA By Chen Cheng-hui / Staff reporter The government’s business climate monitor last month was “yellow-red” for the first time in two years, as strong industrial production, increasing imports of machinery equipment, robust domestic commercial activities and stock investments boosted the momentum of local businesses, the National Development Council said yesterday. Prior to last month, the business climate monitor had maintained a “green” signal for three consecutive months. The council measures the nation’s economic situation using a five-color system, with “blue” signaling a recession, “green” suggesting steady growth and “red” indicating a boom. “Yellow-red” reflects a slight boom, while “yellow-blue” shows sluggishness. The total score of the monitor’s composite index rose four points from the previous month to 35, indicating steady growth for six months in a row, the council said in a report. Meanwhile, the index of leading indicators, which gauges the economy’s direction in the next six months, moved up by 0.5 percent month-on-month to 102.09, rising for the seventh consecutive month, it said. The index of coincident indicators, which tracks the current pace of economic activity, climbed 0.93 percent to 102.82, increasing for the 13th consecutive month, the council said. “Benefiting from the growing demand for artificial intelligence and other tech applications, indicators such as industrial production, machinery and electrical equipment imports have turned to flashing red. Coupled with continued advancement in the leading and coincident indicators, the domestic economy is steadily recovering,” the council said. Of the composite index’s nine components, the subindices on imports of capital equipment and sales of trade and food services increased by two points each and changed from “green” the previous month to “red,” the report said. The subindex on industrial production rose by one point, going from “yellow-red” a month earlier to “red,” while the subindex on manufacturing sales increased by one point, changing from “green” to “yellow-red, it said. However, customs-cleared exports decreased by two points and flashed “green,” compared with “red” a month prior, the report said. There were no changes in the signals of the other four subindices, including money supply, the TAIEX, non-agricultural employment and sentiment of the manufacturing sector, the report said. Looking ahead, the council expects exports to continue showing steady growth, on the recovery of global trade and growing opportunities linked to emerging applications related to artificial intelligence. It also said it expects domestic investment to continue gathering steam thanks to demand for advanced technologies, digital transformation and net zero carbon emissions, in addition to government projects for public works. Meanwhile, private consumption is expected to retain strong momentum on the back of stable employment, higher minimum wages, a vibrant stock market and more government subsidies for housing and education, it said. “However, uncertainties such as potential interest rate cuts in major economies, continued geopolitical risks and the intensifying rivalry between the US and China still exist, and their future developments deserve close observation,” the council said. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

After receiving a report of the fire at 10:55pm on Sunday, firefighters at the scene found that cables in a pipe room were burning and emitting thick smoke, the bureau said. Using two water pipes, they brought the blaze under control at about 11:35pm, although residual smoldering continued, it said. Firefighters Lee Yung-chen (李詠真) and Chou Li-hsin (周立鑫) had entered one of the buildings where the power had gone out to rescue the people trapped inside, the bureau said. The pair were taking the stairs to the third and eighth floors, where people were reportedly trapped, when they discovered they had insufficient oxygen, a firefighter said. More firefighters were dispatched to rescue them after receiving distress signals, and found Lee and Chou collapsed on the third-floor stairwell, the firefighter said. The thick and sticky smoke from the burning cables might have made it harder for them to escape, they said. Due to the heavy smoke more than 100 people remained trapped in the complex yesterday morning, while firefighters worked to vent the smoke. The complex consists of four 28-floor buildings. One resident said her family waited on their balcony until about 7am yesterday before being rescued by a ladder truck. The last of the 351 residents were evacuated from the complex in the early afternoon. Some children inhaled smoke and needed to be hospitalized, the bureau said, but no other deaths were reported. The cause of the fire and the deaths of the firefighters had yet to be determined as of yesterday. Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an (高虹安) early yesterday morning visited rescued residents and family members of the deceased firefighters at a hospital, offering her condolences and gratitude. She said the city government would handle the affairs for Lee’s and Chou’s families. Lee, 39, had served in the fire bureau for 19 years and Chou, 34, for 14 years, the bureau said. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

Sports Turf returned in 2023 and into 2024 to complete the artificial turf baseball and softball facilities. “We are honored to continue our work at Valdosta High School providing state-of- the-art surfaces for their student-athletes,” Sports Turf Company President Todd Wiggins said. “The Wildcats’ staff is committed to giving its athletes the best facilities, and we’re grateful to continue providing surfaces that provide unparalleled safety, performance, and durability.” The new surface at Bazemore-Hyder will feature AstroTurf’s RootZone 3D Blend HD, Brock shock pad and organic BrockFILL.

        "content": "Perth has ranked as one of the most car-dependent cities in the world, out of nearly 800 cities across 61 countries. Based on new research from the EAFIT University in Medellin and the Complexity Science Hub, globally around 51 per cent of commutes are made by car, a proportion that rises to almost 92 per cent in American and Canadian cities. Perth is one of the least walkable cities in the world. Credit: iStockphoto In Perth, 82 per cent of commuters use cars, 12 per cent public transport and 4 per cent walk or cycle. European cities were ranked least car-dependent, with Spanish cities featuring most in the top 10. Researchers Rafael Prieto-Curiel and Juan Ospina collected data on different transportation modes (cars, public transport, walking and cycling) across 794 cities with a combined population of almost 850 million people. The research found that for cities in Australia, the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, most of their mobility depended on cars, regardless of city size; however, it found broadly that smaller cities tended to be less car-dependent and wealthier cities more car-dependent. Prieto-Curiel said cars presented significant challenges to cities due to their resource requirements and environmental impact. “The increase in the motorisation rate is a massive burden worldwide, leading to issues such as unsafe roads, noise, inefficient use of public space, and costly infrastructure,” he said. “Rapid urbanisation and car-centric infrastructure have resulted in sprawling low-density suburbs, contributing to longer commuting distances.",

        "content": "Calls have amplified in recent weeks for Australian social media age limits to be raised from 13 to 16. South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas announced the state would examine legal and technical pathways around imposing a ban. The e-safety commissioner has recommended age verification on social media through the Online Safety Act. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has weighed in . To add to the momentum, activist parent groups such as 36 months have come out saying a ban is the only way to protect our kids. But is it? The proposed ban would mean that youths under 16 wouldn’t be able to create accounts on social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat or TikTok. For many Aussie parents this horse has already bolted, because kids as young as 10 already have accounts on the sly. Credit: Cameron Myles/ iStock/ Supplied As a parent of two teen boys I understand the fear attached to social media, but because I also work in the industry, I believe this will be like kryptonite to teens. We all remember being told we couldn’t have something as kids and that made us want it even more... right? But the real question is, should a ban be passed, how on earth would we enforce it? Especially if the rules are different state by state. Spain currently has a ban in place, which needs proof-of-age documents such a student ID or a passport to sign up to social media platforms, and parents can also request their child’s profile be removed. But for many Aussie parents, this horse has already bolted, because kids as young as 10 already have accounts on the sly. Kids are clever, and they’re much more clever than their parents when it comes to social media. They will always look for a way around a ban, and they will find it – in the form of fake accounts and pseudonyms.",

        "content": "Woolworths’ $586 million bet on man’s best friend has triggered a shift in Australia’s pet store landscape, allowing a family-owned business from Sydney to triple its business and scoop up 66 new retail stores and vet clinics. The dominant supermarket’s bid to acquire 55 per cent of pet goods business PETstock was scrutinised by the competition regulator and ultimately approved in December after PETstock offered to divest 41 stores and 25 vet clinics. All of these have now been bought by PetO, a network of 17 stores that began in Sydney’s northern beaches, for an undisclosed sum. Co-founder brothers of pet retailer PetO Nick Greenhalgh (left) and David Rowe. Credit: Edwina Pickles But PetO co-founders and brothers Nick Greenhalgh and David Rowe are not done: the ink has barely dried on the paperwork and the pair is already looking at future expansion to be a “credible third player” to compete against market incumbents Petbarn and PETstock. “If we can put another 100 stores on it from 60, let’s say to 160, we still wouldn’t be the equivalent of number two. So there’s a lot of runway,” said Greenhalgh, who co-founded PetO with Rowe in 2006. “There’s a real excitement that we’re not going to hit a ceiling for a long, long time.” Australians spend an estimated $33 billion every year on pets, which has been one of the faster-growing categories of spending , a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic as many people sought furry companions during lockdown and remote work. Pet ownership rose from 63 per cent to 69 per cent after the pandemic. Supermarkets and major retailers including Bunnings have been moving into the space to capture a growing slice of the revenue pie. With PetO’s acquisition, its revenue triples to about $200 million and its store footprint expands out of NSW to Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the ACT. Many of these stores currently trade under the Best Friends, My Pet Warehouse and Pet City brands, which PETstock had previously acquired. The brothers have not yet decided whether to rebrand all the stores to PetO or retain some existing brands. The Our Vet pet clinics will continue to trade under that name.",

        "description": "Meric Gertler, appeared before a House of Commons committee, along with other school administrators, to talk about antisemitism on campuses and what measures they are taking to deal with it.",
        "content": "Shortly after a was held at the encampment at the University of Toronto, the school’s president and chancellor, Meric Gertler, appeared before a House of Commons committee, along with other school administrators, about antisemitism on campuses and what measures they are taking to deal with it. At the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, Gertler made a statement and then took questions from MPs, on the weeks long encampment at the school. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multi-faceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large must be no,” said Gertler. “Ultimately, we believe that the most effective way to respond to this challenge is to focus on our core mission of education and research.” Appearing alongside the presidents of University of British Columbia, McGill and Concordia, Gertler and his compatriots all agreed that antisemitism is currently a serious problem on campus. Thornhill MP Melissa Lantsman asked specifically about the U of T encampment, inquiring whether the hundreds of protesters are holding the rest of the 97,000 students hostage to their beliefs. “We have been meeting with student representatives in our discussions about how to end the encampment peacefully,” said Gertler. “We have a very clearly articulated policy for considering divestment proposals which we have used in the past. And we are saying to the protest group, the policy is there. It lays out the steps and you’re free to use it. And we hope that they will because that is the only way that we can actually address this.” Lantsman held up an image of a pro-Palestinian symbol that was reportedly taken from the encampment, and asked why this antisemitic symbol was visible on the campus. “We have asked the student organizers of the encampment to remove signage and language which is offensive. And they have complied on occasion. Not in every instance,” said Gertler. “In other instances, we have reported hateful acts and hateful speech to Toronto Police Services.” Gertler said there had been approximately 38 incidents which may qualify as hate speech or hateful acts that are being investigated. Lantsman pressed him on whether any U of T students have been suspended or expelled for their role in protests and the encampment. “The encampment has been in place for three and a half weeks. And so, we have not yet (but) those processes are underway,” said Gertler.",

Save articles for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size I was an interior designer for many years, but always spending all day working in front of a screen. So nine years ago I decided I needed a change and bought a coffee van. Best decision I ever made. When I started I’d do a school one day, another one the next, and then a business. I was hopping all over the place. And I tended to say “yes” to everything. I would travel a long way just to make 10 coffees. I soon figured out that was not the way to do things. So when the guy who used to have this spot retired, the City of Melville asked me if I wanted to take it over. While I was looking for something more permanent I still enjoyed working in different locations. I bit the bullet and two years later I’m still enjoying it. You’re meeting people every day and getting to know them. I’m not just serving coffee; I’ve become part of a community. Many of my customers have become my friends. I even get people opening up to me, like a bartender. I get into all kinds of conversations in which I recommend this doctor or that garden centre. It’s the perfect job for someone who is sociable. I’ve always been a coffee drinker, but had no idea how to use an espresso machine. So I went to classes run by one of the coffee suppliers. You don’t realise how complex it is until you are taught by the experts. Advertisement The best thing about owning and operating a coffee van is that you are your own boss. If I’m not feeling in the mood to make coffee or there is somewhere else I have to be, I can shut up shop early. It’s wonderful to work outdoors, but the weather can be challenging. One day a storm came up out of nowhere and the boys in the gym had to come racing out to help put away the canopy, otherwise it would have been in Garden City. But this year the biggest problem hasn’t been the wind or the rain. It’s the heat. Several times I’ve had to close early because it’s been so hot. I’ve never seriously considered branching out into a cafe. You have all the responsibilities of running a business with employees. I occasionally bring someone else in to help when I do an agricultural show — usually my son — but all the things I do in the van I can do on my own. You can’t beat the independence. Dylan at Modus in Victoria Park. Credit: Mark Naglazas Dylan: ‘The only way to learn to make a good coffee is by doing it over and over’ I moved in and out of barista and bar work since I was 19. I always preferred working in cafes because of the hours. And you get more time to engage with people in the mornings. And you get more regular customers in a cafe than a bar, so you get to know your customers and build relationships. Advertisement I completed a degree in business management, but I couldn’t see myself working in an office. I prefer to be involved in the day-to-day running of a business, so I would have been better off going to TAFE and doing entrepreneurship. Loading In the nine years since leaving school I have worked at five or six different cafes. I gained a lot of experience. So when the guys who started Modus asked me to manage their Victoria Park location I was ready to take on the responsibility. As a manager I like to lift people up and upskill them in ways you don’t expect in this industry. It is an industry that many people pass through on the way to other careers and lives, so it’s a privilege to get to know them. Many people enter the industry by doing a barista course, which is fine to pick up the basics. The only way to learn to make a good coffee is by doing it over and over until you build up muscle memory. The product is very important in a cafe, but we’re fundamentally a service industry. So the most important thing is to engage with people. You need to make it a good experience or they won’t come back. You can put all the emphasis you want on the building and the decor and the procedures, but in the end it’s all about the personal experience — being able to read the customer and giving them what they want. Advertisement I like working for Modus because of its business ethos. The owners bypass the big coffee distributors and seek out farmers in places like Ethiopia, Colombia and Nicaragua who pay a liveable wage. It means that we can be transparent about how we produce and sell our coffee. One of the great things about working in Victoria Park is the incredible food and beverage culture that has emerged in the past few years. It is a wonderfully vibrant place, with so many different food and drink offerings and such a diverse clientele. It’s a pleasure to come to work every day. Europeans would probably think the way we do coffee here in Australia is a little too new-age. But I think we have some of the best coffee in the world. They prefer their espresso, which is what I prefer. Coffee purists like it without milk. When I open my own cafe, I want it to be embedded in a community. I think this is the key to the success of any coffee shop. You are not just serving coffee; you are building relationships with your customers. They don’t just want a great coffee: they want to be comfortable in the environment you create. Ruth at Pound Coffee Roastery in O’Connor. Credit: Mark Naglazas Ruth: ‘A coffee shop is all about community’ I come from a big foodie family and I grew up in Adelaide, which has a great food culture. So food was very important when we gathered on the weekends. I’ve spent time in kitchens ever since I was a child. Advertisement Initially, I did a commercial cookery course at TAFE and worked in kitchens. One day I got talking to people who worked front-of-house and transitioned from the kitchen to making coffee. I’ve now been doing it for two decades. Loading Over the years I have worked with many great people who showed me there was more to coffee than just pumping out cappuccinos and flat whites. They taught me the nuances of roasting and brewing coffee. While the quality of coffee is important, what really interests me about working in this industry is the community that has grown around it. I love how coffee brings people together and the relationships that are forged with the customers. A coffee shop is all about community. I’ve been very fortunate to work in a number of businesses who really care about their staff. If they care about you, you care in return, which ensures that a business will be successful. But I do also enjoy the technical side of making coffee – weighing the coffee and understanding how extraction works and the different brewing methods and how the age of the coffee makes a difference. Coffee-making courses are a great place to start if you have no idea and want to get into the industry. But you don’t learn properly until you get a job. You get shoved into the deep end. You make lots of bad coffee and mistakes but that’s how you learn. Advertisement As you can see this is not a cafe. It is a roastery. The guys who own the business decided they didn’t want to run a roastery and a cafe. So we condensed the two into one. It gives us a chance to showcase our product and show people what we do. It has also put the cafe part of the business in an interesting environment. This is an industrial area, so we get people from all the surrounding businesses as well as regular customers who drive here because of the quality of the coffee. They all come for the beans and a bit of a bit of a chinwag and a therapy session. When I closed my previous cafe to come here several of my customers followed me because they like my coffee so much. That is such a beautiful thing, and it makes me feel really special. Start the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

        "content": "Taiwanese barber Chiu Yen-chung, left, cuts the hair of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves at the Grand Hotel Taipei on Tuesday last week.Photo: CNA / Staff writer, with CNA Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves is known as a strong supporter of Taiwan on the international stage. The longest continuously serving head of government since his country became independent in 1979, Gonsalves has visited Taiwan 12 times since becoming prime minister in 2001. His most recent visit was last week to attend the inauguration of President William Lai (賴清德) on Monday. During his dozen trips to Taiwan, he has met four different presidents — Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁), Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and now Lai, who he called “my brother William.” However, none of them have had a more enduring friendship with the Vincentian prime minister over that time than an individual who Gonsalves has met on almost every one of his trips to Taiwan and continues to call his good friend: his Taiwanese barber Chiu Yen-chung (邱炎鐘). Chiu, 82, has been working for decades as a barber at the Grand Hotel Taipei, a iconic history-laden hotel where foreign dignitaries often stayed during the second half of the 20th century. Chiu has served two late presidents, Chiang Ching-kuo (蔣經國) and Lee Teng-hui (李登輝). Gonsalves said that when he first visited Taiwan in 2001, he needed a haircut, and as he was staying at the Grand Hotel, he was introduced to Chiu. “He told me about the stories, about his history [in cutting the hair of former presidents], and we became friends,” Gonsalves said. Since then, he has visited Chiu on almost every one of his trips to Taiwan, even if he was not staying at the Grand Hotel. Gonsalves said that he had his hair cut before visiting Taiwan to attend Lai’s inauguration, but he still booked a slot with Chiu on Tuesday last week to see his old friend. Chiu said he cut many other world leaders’ hair decades ago at the Grand Hotel, when Taiwan had more diplomatic allies, but Gonsalves is the only foreign political leader he has regularly served in recent years. “He is very easy-going even though he’s the prime minister,” Chiu said, adding that most other senior politicians are more serious-looking. The two have maintained an relaxed relationship often punctuated with laughs over the past 12 years, even though Chiu cannot speak fluent English. The two have communicated through an interpreter assigned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs over the years, but Gonsalves said Chiu’s “English has improved,” a compliment that Chiu did not buy. Chiu said the ministry pays Gonsalves’ barber fee but the prime minister always gives him a “very generous tip” himself, although Chiu would not say how much. Asked about his role as an unofficial diplomat for Taiwan and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Chiu said he was simply doing his job as a barber and offering the best service he can. Now in his 80s, Chiu said he would continue to do his job “as long as his health permits.” 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "content": "Rishi Sunak has been ordered to publish secret documents showing the impact of his cut to Universal Credit . As Chancellor, the PM ignored pleas from campaigners including footballer Marcus Rashford by scrapping the £20-per-week uplift introduced during the pandemic. The government has refused to release an analysis examining the impact of not extending the support. But in a victory for the Mirror , the Information Commissioners' Office (ICO) has now ordered the Treasury to disclose the details. The support - worth around £1,000 a year - was introduced in March 2020 as a temporary measure to help the most vulnerable families through the Covid crisis. But it came to end in October 2021 - despite warnings removing the \"lifeline\" in support could plunge 800,000 people into poverty. Labour leader Keir Starmer also warned the Government would be \"turning on the poorest\" and six ex-Tory Work and Pensions Secretaries - including ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - even wrote to Mr Sunak urging him to make the increase in Universal Credit permanent. At the time one Whitehall official claimed an internal government analysis showed cutting the support would be \"catastrophic\". Last summer the Treasury refused to release any analysis of ending the support when requested by the Mirror. They argued it would \"not be in the public interest due to the harm it would cause to policy development and delivering for welfare benefit claimants\". But in a decision notice - sent to The Mirror just hours before the General Election was called - the ICO ordered the Treasury to publish the information \"within 30 calendar days\". It means the Government has until June 21 to publish the details - just two weeks before the country heads to the polls. Lib Dem Work and Pensions spokeswoman Wendy Chamberlain told The Mirror: \"This is a shocking cover up and proof Conservative Ministers are hiding the truth from the public. “Conservative Ministers should come clean about this damaging decision. There are also questions to be answered about the refusal to give the uplift to those on legacy benefits. This information has to be published before the country goes to the polls.\" In its judgement, the ICO said: \"The Commissioner has concluded, that the public interest favours disclosure of the request information. In reaching this view, the Commissioner has given particular weight to the fact that the policy to which the statistics relate is no longer live. \"He has also given weight to the fact that the policy was one which was developed in the unique circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a strong public interest in knowing as much as possible about what information the government was considering in that unprecedented and challenging period.\" During the investigation, the Treasury told the ICO it did not conduct \"a formal impact assessement relating to the conclusion of this temporary policy\". But they admitted information was held \"that details our analysis on the impacts of further extensions, which can be used to show the impact of not extending the uplift\". They added: \"The uplift was initally put in place temporarily between April 2020 and March 2021. In March 2021, the Chancellor of the Exhequer announced it would be extended for a further 6 months. This policy was always designed as temporary so the information in scope relates to analysis completed prior to the 6-month extension\". The Treasury declined to comment due to the pre-election period. Join our FREE Mirror Election WhatsApp community for latest on race for No 10",

        "content": "LEO WOODALL has already dazzled us with his TV acting skills, personality and good looks — but now he is working on getting the full Hollywood physique. I can reveal the actor, who found fame on dramas including The White Lotus and One Day, put a mini-gym on the rider of his current film, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. It is so he can always look buff when playing London gardener Rockstar, who becomes the toyboy crush of Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger. A TV insider said: “Leo is already in great shape. “But given the fact he’s supposed to be someone who spends all day doing manual work, he really wants to look the part. “So, as the consummate acting pro that he is, Leo is said to be hitting the weights between takes so he can look his best for the cameras. And judging by some of the images that have been coming from the set of the film, the hard work certainly seems to be paying off.” Leo already had viewers hot under the collar when he stripped off in the second series of The White Lotus in 2022. He played Jack, an Essex boy who was hiding an uncomfortable secret underneath his cocky exterior. Then he had audiences in tears playing the leading man Dexter in One Day , an adaptation of the romantic novel by David Nicholls. It was screened on Netflix earlier this year, and once again saw Leo lose his clothes in love scenes. But the actor admitted he had to stop working out so much because he figured the character would not be into beefing up. He said: “I remember thinking that Dex can’t be a big gym guy.” But the need for more muscle was obvious when he took on the role of Rockstar, a Hampstead Heath park attendant in Mad About The Boy. Not only have the movie’s producers put him in an extremely tight T-shirt, Leo also has to have Bridget attracted by his charms, or maybe just his arms. MALALA YOUSAFZAI may be an education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, but she likes a laugh. She was invited to feature in the second series of Channel 4 music comedy We Are Lady Parts, about a rock band. Writer Nida Manzoor said: “I had this idea for the song, Malala Made Me Do It, it’s a hype track. I was massively stressed out about how we were going to make sure Malala had a good time. “She was so laid back and easy- going. She also has a very dark sense of humour, and she’s so funny.” IS Love Island taking inspiration from fellow dating show My Mum, Your Dad? After Davina McCall's series proved daters with more life experience can create TV gold, ITV has upped its age limit for the Love Island villa. The full cast, revealed in The Sun yesterday , are the show’s oldest bunch of sexy singles yet. They include a hairdresser, mental health nurse and a sweet salesman. But they also include footballer Ronnie Vint, 27, and recruiter Munveer Jabbal, 30, who says he is mates with Piers Morgan's son Spencer. Then there’s office worker Patsy Field, 29, and make-up artist Samantha Kenny, 26, also alongside the usual clutch of those in their early twenties. It means the average age of the Islanders in this year’s line-up is 25 – more than two years older than in any other season. A source said: “Two years might not sound like a lot but in Love Island years it really is. “Having the older castmates in the mix will hopefully bring about better conversations, meatier storylines and a lot more drama.” Which is handy, because host Maya Jama has revealed her main goal for this year’s series is more war than peace. Ahead of the launch next Monday at 9pm on ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX, she said: “I’ll be honest, I’m hoping for drama. “I want loads of love and happy couples at the end but I do want to be entertained, so I’m hoping for lots of fiery moments.” I CAN reveal comedy drama This Is Going To Hurt has reached the end of its life, with no plans for a second series. The Bafta-winning BBC One show was based on real-life experiences of former NHS doctor Adam Kay and starred Ben Whishaw. Director Lucy Forbes said: “There’s zero chance of it coming back it’s categorically gone. “This Is Going To Hurt was a very popular series and it could have continued, but we told a self-contained story in a single series that was rounded off at the end of the seventh and final episode.” It is at odds with what creator Adam had shared last year, when he hinted: “If I thought of ideas for one I might do it. It remains a possibility.” JOSEPH Fiennes was more scared of having no props or a script than dangers Canada’s wilderness threw at him. He was joined by his cousin – – Sir Ranulph Fiennes – for National Geographic’s Fiennes: Return to the Wild. They retrace the steps of the explorer’s 1971 tour of British Columbia. But death-defying glaciers and mountain peaks were the least of his worries. Joseph said: “I much prefer props and moustaches, and you know, a script to hide behind. “There’s something kind of scary about being exposed and having to be yourself. It’s devised to a degree but it’s unscripted. I’d rather hide behind another persona than to be myself because I’m a little bit awkward.” The second episode is on Sunday.",

        "content": "Representatives from a coalition of civic groups in Kaohsiung yesterday hold a banner calling for legislative reform bills to be sent back to committee for deliberation.Photo: CNA By Hsieh Chun-lin and Kayleigh Madjar / Staff reporter, with staff writer Dozens of legal experts yesterday released a statement calling on lawmakers to return five controversial legislative reform bills to committee for deliberation, and to consult more broadly with experts and the public to establish a consensus before passing the bills. The Legislative Yuan is today scheduled to vote on a set of reform bills proposed by opposition lawmakers. All but one have already been voted through to the third and final reading, which might be held today. The bills seek to expand the legislature’s powers of investigation, including imposing fines on government officials, civil organizations and private individuals for failing to cooperate at hearings. Another provision would impose a prison sentence of up to a year on public officials for lying during legislative hearings. Procedural flaws and the unconstitutional content of the bills have led to heated conflict in the legislature and mass protests nationwide, the letter’s 39 signatories said. “As legal experts, we call on the legislature to halt the second reading of the five reform bills and return them to committee for thorough review,” they said. The Constitution does not explicitly grant the Legislative Yuan investigative powers, which are instead governed by four constitutional interpretations: Nos. 325, 585, 633 and 729, they said. No. 585 states that the legislature “may exercise a certain power of investigation,” but “under the principles of separation of powers and checks and balances, the scope of the targets or matters subject to the Legislative Yuan’s investigative power does not grow unchecked.” The bills not only involve the balance of power between the legislature and executive, but also restrict the rights of the general public, the statement says. The interpretation addresses this. “The constitutional principles of proportionality, clarity and definitiveness of law, as well as due process of law, must all be complied with where such procedures may involve any restrictions imposed upon the rights of the people,” it says. The bills’ proposed methods of forcing people to cooperate with investigations infringe on their personal liberties, the experts said. They also lack sufficiently clear explanations of the scope, purpose, means, procedural guarantees, remedies and other necessary details, they said, adding that this would lead to numerous problems. There is also a difference between the legislature’s powers of interpellation and investigation, they said. The former is intended to provide lawmakers information on which to base votes or statements, while the latter is for the legislature to obtain facts necessary to carry out its constitutional responsibility of passing laws and budgets, the experts said. Whether they merit the same level of punishment for disrupting should be carefully considered, they added. The experts called on lawmakers not to rush to a vote this week so that opinions from all sectors can be considered to craft a more complete set of bills. However, if they are passed, the experts asked the Cabinet and president to return the bills to the legislature for reconsideration. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "description": "Sorry to rain on Rishi Sunak’s parade, but this is a bold idea for an unpopular government to stake its future on.",
        "content": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last week found a new and ridiculous way to announce a national election by standing in front of No.10 Downing St in drenching rain, without an umbrella. But the campaign quickly grew more serious. Sunak’s first election promise was that his government would reinstate compulsory national service for all 18-year-olds. This is a bold idea for an unpopular government to stake its future on. Did Sunak do this because of the seriousness of the military threats to Britain or because of the desperation of the British Tory party to win votes? Illustration by Dionne Gain Around 40 per cent of all nations on earth have some form of national service for young people, and the percentage is growing. Such schemes vary enormously. Not all are compulsory; not all involve a military element. The plan Sunak proposes for Britain, for example, is a hybrid. It’d be compulsory for all 18-year-olds, but only one in 10 would do military service for a year. The other 90 per cent would perform some community service. The concept of national service for young people had been passing out of fashion with the end of the Cold War but today is building momentum as the threat from autocratic regimes has returned. In Europe, for instance, in the last half-dozen years, France, Sweden, Latvia and Lithuania have announced the reintroduction of such schemes, and Germany is considering it. After two centuries of peace in Sweden, the country’s Minister for Civil Defence, Carl-Oskar Bohlin, in January said: “Have you considered whether you have time to join a voluntary defence organisation? If not – get moving.” And, of course, Ukraine introduced compulsory military service in great haste, but only when Russian missiles slammed into its cities two years ago. Britain’s General Patrick Sanders, chief of the general staff, used Ukraine as a case study to support his own call for British citizens to be trained and ready for war: “Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars – citizen armies win them.”",

        "content": "Warning: this story contains graphic content A teenage boy in the middle of the night found his father holding a brick over his unconscious mother on the kitchen floor. “I’m not going to stop until she’s dead,” the father, in his late 30s, told his son. One man attacked his ex-wife in the bedroom. Another attacked his wife in the kitchen. Credit: Marija Ercegovac The man had repeatedly smashed his wife’s face into kitchen tiles because he suspected she was cheating on him. The man had no prior criminal record. However, he did have an apprehended domestic violence order (ADVO) imposed on him. Sixteen days earlier, the woman had sought the ADVO against her husband of 18 years after a phone smashing episode. He was not allowed to assault, threaten, harass, stalk or intimidate her, damage her property or approach her within 12 hours of drinking alcohol. But the ADVO did not work. The man, who had temporarily moved out home, embarked on an alcohol-fuelled bender with a friend, repeatedly telling him that he intended to kill his wife, court documents show. The friend was so alarmed by the threats that he texted a warning to the man’s wife. The woman immediately locked her front door.",

        "content": "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, third left, holds a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, third right, in Seoul on Sunday.Photo: Kyodo News via AP TRILATERAL MEETING: The Japanese Prime Minister said that Japan would continue unofficial exchanges with Taiwan, as per the China Joint Communique of 1972 By Liu Tzu-hsuan / Staff reporter Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated the importance of stability across the Taiwan Strait while Chinese Premier Li Qiang (李強) said Taiwan issues are “a red line” for China. Kishida and Li traveled to Seoul for the first China-Japan-South Korea trilateral summit since 2019, which was held yesterday. Before the three leaders met, Kishida, Li and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol held bilateral meetings on Sunday. During the meeting with Li, Kishida “reiterated that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is extremely important to the international community, including Japan,” the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Japan is closely monitoring developments across the Taiwan Strait, including “the recent military situation,” it said. Kishida was referring to the “Joint Sword-2024A” military exercise Beijing launched around Taiwan on Thursday and Friday last week, Sankei Shimbun cited a source traveling together with the prime minister as saying. Kishida also expressed “serious concerns” about China’s increased military activities around Japan, including the Senkaku Islands, called the Diaoyutai Islands (釣魚台) in Taiwan and China, and the East China Sea, while asking for the immediate removal of buoys that China set up within Japan’s exclusive economic zone, the ministry said. Li said that issues regarding Taiwan and history are “matters of principle related to China’s core interests and also matters of faith,” Kyodo News reported on Sunday. “In particular, the Taiwan issue is the core of China’s core interests and is a red line,” Li said, which Kyodo News said was an attempt to “keep Japan in check.” Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) and Kishida reached an important agreement to promote a “mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests” when they met in San Francisco in November last year. “It is hoped that Japan would keep its promise and create a positive atmosphere for the continuous development of bilateral relations,” China News Service cited Li as saying. Kishida said that Japan’s position regarding Taiwan as stated in the Japan-China Joint Communique of 1972 has not changed, it reported. The document states that Japan would sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan, with which it would deepen non-governmental practical cooperation mainly in the economic field, Kyodo News said. After the trilateral meeting yesterday, the three leaders said they agreed to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN countries and countries in the Middle East as a response to international issues such as the threats posed by North Korea and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The issue about the Taiwan Strait was not mentioned in the joint statement issued after the meeting. Additional reporting by CNA 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "description": "Two key statistics indicate that Australia’s housing affordability crisis will continue to worsen, even as governments scramble to ease supply constraints.",
        "content": "A blowout in building costs combined with high interest rates has discouraged new development of apartment towers, and the constrained supply is putting upward pressure on rents, according to experts. Though building approval numbers are low, the total value of those approvals remains high, indicating building costs are continuing to climb, which is deterring developers of medium and high-density housing and adding to housing costs, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) economist Harry Ottley said. Residential building approvals were at near decade-lows, CBA analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics data found, despite a slight uptick in the March quarter. Multi-unit residential buildings were down 23 per cent in a year, while house approvals rose 2.9 per cent. “This explosion of building costs has been unprecedented,” Ottley said. “Normally if you see approvals come down, you would see the value come down as well.” When developers are uncertain about building units and townhouses, it affects supply, he said, which then puts huge pressure on the rental market. “What really drives rents and the rental market is those multi-unit dwellings,” Ottley said. “It’s the big developers really that need to build these big apartments, and they need certainty over a period of years to ensure that their project is feasible.",

        "description": "Fragrances, custom hair care, and a handful of carefully selected anti-aging workhorses, right this way.",
        "content": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Robb Report may receive an affiliate commission. The best Father’s Day gift you can get dear old dad is the Rolex he’s been eyeing for years. But if your AD isn’t coming through for you, the next best option is one of the highly effective grooming products below, which will help him do everything from preserving his youthful glow to getting the closest shave he’s ever experienced. Consider them the ultimate way to thank him for the rakish good looks he passed along to you, or to make his morning routine go more smoothly. Oh, but one suggestion: Try to avoid anything too “anti-aging” with dads, unless they’ve got the sense of humor to handle it. In case he does, we’ve included a handful of options that’ll make him smile below. Nobody makes combs quite as cool as Machete’s, the Atlanta-based brand known for using Italian acetate in inventive ways. We think a majority of dads would dig this blue dual-toothed number, which definitely has more flair than anything they’ve seen at the barber shop. Buy Now on Machete: $45 This set includes a deliciously aromatic fougère cologne, a shaving cream with a rich lather, and one of the best shaving brushes on the market. You’ll score big points for the thoughtful combination of tonsorial essentials, and the incredible scents and high-quality brush will remind him of you every time he steps into his bathroom. Buy Now on Claus Porto: $120 This supremely well-made safety razor, crafted in Japan from a mix of wood and stainless steel, is sure to wow anyone who likes a clean shave. Bonus points—it comes with a stand that’ll look attractive on nearly any bathroom counter. Hopefully he doesn’t mind shaving his jaw after it’s been on the floor. Buy Now on Fendrihan: $599 If he rocks a polished dome, then this electric shaver will help him get the job done in mere minutes each time. And it’s even waterproof, so he can use it in the shower and avoid sprinkling the rest of his bathroom with clippings. Buy Now on Amazon: $99.99 As far as we’re concerned, Trudon’s candles are worth their weight in gold. But the French company’s “De Oro” (meaning “From Gold”) scent epitomizes this quality with a bergamot blast of citrusy optimism. It’ll complement the warmer months and boost the mood in colder months. If it lasts that long. Buy Now on Trudon: $140 A perfect “buffer gift” to appetize ahead of any centerpiece presents: If he’s ever (or always) complaining about chapped lips, then get him this heroic fix: Doctor Rogers’ remedy is the shortest way to pillowy-soft and pain-free smoochers. Buy Now on Amazon: $24 If the gift recipient in question is your romantic partner, then this massage oil is a nice way to spice things up and help them wind down. If he is not your romantic partner, then maybe think twice about the message this sends. Buy Now on Amazon: $60.53 This four-piece manicure kit is enclosed in a supple leather travel envelope. It includes a nail file, scissors, clipper, and tweezers, and you can even monogram it for an extra $30 to really land the perfect grooming gift. Buy Now on Aspinal of London: $130 Even the man who has everything probably doesn’t own a marble toothpaste squeezer. Selahatin, a Robb Report Grooming Awards winner in 2023, turned out just such an implement. It marries a green marble base with a chrome-plated squeezing mechanism, and it’s arguably the most stylish way to get every last drop out of your tubes. Buy Now on Selahatin: €340 (About $370) Cleanser, moisturizer, SPF. If he’s a bare-bones kind of guy, he should have these three products at an absolute minimum—and few brands do them better than The Grey. We especially enjoy the charcoal-based cleanser, which is great for guys with oily or combination skin. And the sunscreen absorbs into the skin in a flash. Buy Now on The Grey: €179 (About $194) A lot of brands like to call themselves “the Ferrari of [insert industry here],” even when their products aren’t muscled up and moving at lightning speeds. So let’s call Bolin Webb’s R1 the BMW of razors instead—a true enthusiasts’ tool that has a cult following, is high quality but accessible, and even uses Gillette Mach 3 razors so it’s not too exclusive. He’ll feel pretty damn special with this on his sink ledge and will think of you each time he freshens up. Buy Now on Saks Fifth Avenue: $136 Giving someone a fragrance is a veritable minefield—you don’t want to waste money on a full bottle of something he might not like. Instead, consider services such as LuxSB – Luxury Scent Box (a monthly subscription that sends samples so he can find new favorites, or simply occasionally switch up his roster) as well as the sample section of LuckyScent , where you can curate an offering, let him pick a favorite, and then gift him the full size. And don’t forget that many fragrance brands offer curated sample sets. Maison Francis Kurkdjian’s Fragrance Wardrobe for Him is among the best of these, and offers eight best sellers from the luxury brand’s assortment, all in 0.37-oz. vessels. He can either rotate through them depending on the occasion or use the experience to find a new favorite among the roster. Our money is on Gentle Fluidity Silver EDP, but let’s see where he lands. Buy Now on Neiman Marcus: $275 Every beard needs its brush, and the luckiest of them get one from Murdock London. Its bristles are vegan, and it tackles short and medium beards with aplomb. It has enough longevity to stay on his bathroom countertop for years to come. Buy Now on Amazon: $30 Braun poured the entirety of its glittering history in the world of industrial design into the Series 9 Pro+ shaver, which has been meticulously crafted to help your gift recipient look clean-shaven for longer. It comes with the sharpest foil razor the company has ever put into a shaver, a cleaning base designed to keep that razor sharper for longer, and a travel case that’ll keep the device charged for weeks on the road. If you’re shopping for someone who can’t grow a beard, look no further. Buy Now on Amazon: $429.99 There’s nothing quite like a reed diffuser to help turn any space—including your bathroom—into a more soothing place to spend time. The design of this one from Soho Home will add a hard-edged, masculine element to any room. Its leather and oud scent are comforting year round, but will especially be appreciated in the colder months. Buy Now on Farfetch: $170 Talk about a personalized gift. Prose’s custom hair care products let him fill out his personal statistics, grooming needs, and geographic details, and uses the data to formulate products that play to all of these factors. The company considers everything from the air and water quality in his zip code, his natural oil levels (or lack thereof), as well as his hair density (or lack thereof). Buy Now on Prose: $50+ Finally, a bath mat that ages well, not to mention, casts an aromatic hinoki scent when it gets wet. The wood famously resists mold, and this one comes straight from Japan. (Just like everything that luxe bath brand Amayori offers.) BUY NOW: $230 Remember that comment we made about brands calling themselves “the Ferrari of ____”? Well, this superhero toothbrush comes close to that distinction. Beyond the Bluetooth integration, the paired tracking app, and the LED brush-head replacement reminders, this one also has a terrific charging case that allows you to keep it juiced up on the go. (Not that its long-lasting battery risks running low within the week.) Buy Now on Amazon: $324.99 More guys could stand to bring some color into their bathrooms. Bathing Culture’s colorful Turkish cotton makes for a great functional statement piece, and an ultra-soft one at that. Buy Now on Bathing Culture: $80 He could walk into the office wearing this gorgeous robe instead of a topcoat, and people would still have to respect him. It’s that soft, beautiful, and stylish. This follicle-saving gel won a Robb Report Grooming Award in 2023 , thanks to its ability to absorb steadily into the dome, where it can fight follicle-shrinking hormonal byproducts. Best of all, it does so without disrupting the actual hormones in his body, since he’s applying the ingredients topically instead of ingesting it orally. One caveat: He will have to help fill out the submission form here, and provide photos so that Xyon’s doctors can help supervise the process and tailor his mailed prescription properly. Read more about topical finasteride for hair loss here . Buy Now on Xyon: $99+/Month This one is for the guy who will have a chuckle after getting an “anti-aging” gift. This full-on skincare regimen has everything he needs to face the new year—save, of course, sunscreen. It includes a foaming cleanser, a face cream for day and night, an eye cream, a lifting serum, and an anti-aging firming serum. And in its bundled format, it saves you a little money so you can buy something nice for yourself. Buy Now on Dr. Barbara Sturm: $850 Part body trimmer, part body shaver, this double-ended manscaper puts both options into the palm of his hand, so that he can customize his body hair any which way he likes, in every place he sprouts hairs. Buy Now on Amazon: $69.96 Here’s a crossover gift that we also suggested giving women this year. It’s both an anti-aging LED mask and an eye-area massager in one. Not to mention, it looks very Jason Voorhees-esque, so horror film fans will appreciate that. Luckily, he can’t do any hilarious sneak-ups on you with this mask on, it’ll be glowing when he uses it. Oh, and most importantly: It’s going to help him look younger, longer. Read more about it here . Buy Now on TheraBody: $599 If you don’t like the idea of going full Friday the 13th to get the benefits of an LED mask, Solawave’s 4-in-1 wand is your next best option. In addition to red light therapy, it also offers galvanic current, facial massage, and therapeutic warmth. The before-and-after pictures indicate a variety of results, including less hyperpigmentation, smoother skin, and even less acne. Buy Now on Solawave: $189 It’s difficult not to make this one passive aggressive, but it’s also going to generate a few yuks when he opens it—which will then lead to far fewer yucks permeating the household. Thank you, Aesop, from all of us. Buy Now on Aesop: $35 CurrentBody’s hair regrowth helmet might look like something from outer space, but it’s the perfect device for him to stimulate some serious hair density. For 10 minutes a day, he can pop this on, hook it up to his Bluetooth device, and get lost in a podcast or music streaming while the LEDs do their thing to fortify follicular growth. (Women can benefit greatly too—just note that there are two sizes to choose from, so unless everyone gets their own, it’s smarter to err on the side of large.) Read more about it here . Buy Now on CurrentBody: $859 There are a lot of dopp kits out there, but we chose this embossed, full-grain leather one for a damn good reason: it’s sexy. Don’t be surprised if he carries it outside of his luggage—it deserves to be shown off, after all. Buy Now on Mr Porter: $975 The ultimate low-cost, high-reward gift for any guy who’s ever complained any chafing or foot sweat. This cream has a cheeky name, but its efficacy is serious. Trust us here: Happy Nuts is proof that the best gift doesn’t need to cost a ton of money. Buy Now on Amazon: $15 If he’s not one for regular pedicures, then this gift will put some serious pep in his step. Plus, it’s always fun (if not weird) to experience the weeks-long peeling process that results from using Baby Foot’s masks, in all its painless and molting glory. Few things feel as blissful as the smooth skin it reveals, or the fuzzy and cloudlike levity that these give the feet in the first hours post-soak.

        "description": "Premier Jacinta Allan once said the Western Intermodal Freight Terminal should be the ‘first cab off the rank’ to be built. Her government has deferred it indefinitely.",
        "content": "A long-promised freight hub for Melbourne’s west has been deferred indefinitely, prompting fears hundreds of trucks will be added to local roads despite years of campaigning from councils, industry and even Premier Jacinta Allan – who once declared that it must be the “first cab off the rank”. The state government told industry earlier this month that the Western Interstate Freight Terminal (WIFT), which was first proposed in 2018 and recommended as an urgent priority since 2021, will be “deferred until it is needed”. The former Morrison government’s choice of the Beveridge Intermodal Freight Terminal, in Melbourne’s north, will be prioritised instead. An artist’s image of the proposed Beveridge terminal, which would handle goods moved on the Inland Rail. Victoria has already spent $400 million on compensation for landowners in the path of the proposed Outer Metropolitan Ring Road, which it is hoped will one day connect the now-delayed western freight terminal by car and train. The delay is a significant change of plan for the state government, which has for years fought for the Truganina site to be delivered before or at the same time as Beveridge, clashing with the Morrison government over the issue. It is the latest Victorian project to face serious or indefinite delays, with Airport Rail and school upgrades put on hold as the budget grapples with the highest debt-to-revenue ratio in the nation and taxpayers face a $25 million-a-day interest bill by 2027. The WIFT received $740 million in Commonwealth funding in the budget delivered before the 2022 federal election, compared to $1.62 billion for the Beveridge option. Loading When that funding was announced, Allan, in her former role as transport infrastructure minister, said Melbourne’s west needed the facility immediately and it had to be the “first cab off the rank”. “The Victorian government made it very clear, and has made it very clear on a number of occasions, that our priority for the establishment of an intermodal freight terminal for our city and state is in the western suburbs of Melbourne,” Allan said in 2022. “There’s a very good logical reason for this. It’s because the western suburbs of Melbourne is the heart of Australia’s freight and logistics industry.”",

        "description": "Commissioned by the Moray Climate Action Fund, talks in Dufftown and Forres will look at improving local food systems.",
        "content": "ANYONE interested or involved in agriculture and food production is invited to sustainable food systems workshops across Moray this week. Commissioned by the Moray Climate Action Fund, the ‘Moray Good Food Good People’ series organised by PhD Researcher at the University of Strathclyde, Lin Batten and Just Transition research fellow at UHI Moray, Kerry McInnes, and aim to refocus conversations about the 'Just Transition' framework of the Scottish Government towards a local and sustainable food system. Lin explained: “A transition in the food system is necessary. The workshops will offer space to share knowledge, concerns, and connections within the agri-food community. They will give a clear, community-led and bottom-up approach to a Just Transition in the food system. We will discuss what this means for Moray's agrarian and rural communities and how that is to be accomplished. “We will try to find out how we can create a more localised food supply and what type of funding, infrastructure or collaboration is necessary to support it.” Lin believes a sustainable food system in Moray would include producing food in an environmentally-friendly manner, with fair-pay and meaningful labour. She added: “It would also contribute to community-wealth building by keeping the supply chain from farm to fork within the region. “However, I do not know what type of ‘sustainable food system’ might come out of the workshops – this is just my vision and keen to find out the visions of the other participants.” The workshops will entail a brief introduction to Kerry and Lin’s research, the project, and the Scottish Government's Just Transition framework. Following that, a Scottish-based film on the local food system will be screened. After discussing the film, attendees in groups will be asked to draw up what should be included in a local, environmentally-friendly food system, which actors are key, and how this is achievable. Participants will be able to network in the hope that they will collaborate in the future. “Part of the organisation and workshop will also be Maria de Lima,” added Lin, “a ‘Talbot Rice Resident’ based in Glasgow who uses visual mapping as a tool to generate meaningful conversations in the community. “Following the workshops, we will make a film with local company Connecting Images run by Diana Mosterd about Moray's Good Food System. “We plan to interview local farmers embarking on agrarian transition, showcasing best practice and sharing experiences.” The organisers point out that buying local produce in local shops supports local farms. However, the system has to change to make prices as affordable as in major supermarket chains. Lin said: “As long as local and environmentally-friendly food is driving up consumer prices compared to cheaper imported food, local food will always remain the alternative luxury, rather than the norm and a necessity. “That does not equate to farm profitability, as they still have to cope with high land prices, high rents, increased input costs. They struggle to remain economically viable by cutting costs and increasing yields. “There needs to be a systemic and dramatic shift in the way in which our food system operates, our subsidy and funding system is arranged, and how decisions are made from a policy and governmental level in order to achieve a real 'Just' transition in the food system where no one is left behind.” Moray Good Food Good People is on from 7.30-9.30pm in Mortlach Memorial Hall in Dufftown on May 28 and from 7.30-9.30pm in Forres Town Hall on May 30.

        "description": "Nebraska's Daniel Kaelin hasn’t shied away from embracing the competition with his fellow quarterbacks every day in practice and spring camp. “It’s only going to elevate my play.”",
        "content": "While five-star freshman Dylan Raiola has taken much of the spotlight in Nebraka’s quarterback battle, Daniel Kaelin focuses on approaching every day like he’s already the starter. The freshman quarterback wrapped up his first spring camp with the Huskers and has already noted growth in his game through the coaching staff and the quarterback competition. He hasn’t shied away from embracing the competition with fellow quarterbacks every day in practice and spring camp. “That only pushed myself and all the guys to improve,” Kaelin said. “It’s only going to elevate my play.” Kaelin noted how new quarterback coach Glenn Thomas has helped him work to attack every play. He added that defensive coordinator Tony White’s ability to disguise things in the defense has helped him learn to read coverages and different schemes better. The knowledge passed down from the coaching staff, from coach Matt Rhule to the assistants, has made the biggest impression on Kaelin after his first spring camp. “Sometimes they don’t even try to and it’s just stuff that they know that’s just helping myself learn more about the game of football,” Kaelin said. As a freshman, Kaelin has many goals, but a short-term objective is reaching 218 to 220 pounds by the start of fall camp. Looking forward to this season, he aims to get on the field and make as much of an impact as he can in whatever action he gets. Kaelin was a three-star recruit who played at Bellevue West before he arrived at Nebraska. On Saturday, he returned to the school to help quarterback coach John Teigland with a quarterback development camp for players in fifth through 12th grades. He worked with fellow college quarterbacks Zane Flores, who is at Oklahoma State, and Nate Glantz, who is at Lindenwood. Kaelin and Flores have known each other for six years. The biggest aspect of their relationship is how they’ve pushed each other. They’ve grown close over the years through working together and their battles in high school. Kaelin noted how he’s looked up to Flores and wanted to follow in his footsteps as a successful high school quarterback. Their relationship also goes beyond the football field. Their competitive nature extends into other sports like golf, where Flores and Kaelin both said Flores was the better of the pair. Kaelin did make it clear that he was the only one to get a birdie when they played golf Friday. Teigland, who hosted the camp, started working with Kaelin when he was in seventh grade. Teigland noted the growth he’s seen in Kaelin, and earning a spot with the Huskers was no mistake. “The guy is a professional,” Tiegland said of Kaelin. “He lives and breathes this stuff.” Nebraska's Luke Longval looks to the sideline as he calls a play in the fourth quarter during the Red-White Spring Game, Saturday, April 27, 2024, at Memorial Stadium.

        "description": "Tens of thousands of Australians are unaware they carry genetic mutations that can cause aggressive cancers and require them to make life-changing – or life-saving – decisions.",
        "content": "When Alisha Mangan was told that her family history of cancer was not significant enough for her to qualify for genetic testing under Medicare, she felt she was being pushed away. Her mother died at 58 of breast cancer, and her grandfather and his siblings had died of prostate cancer in their 60s, but the system used to determine her risk found Mangan’s was not great enough to qualify for investigation. Alisha Mangan, with sons Parker, 4, and Riley, 12, discovered generations of her family had carried a relatively common cancer gene mutation. Credit: Edwina Pickles “My doctor sent me to a genetic specialist, and they basically said even with all your family history – even though my grandfather and his brothers all died of prostate cancer – you’ve got to be a 30 per cent risk to get funded through Medicare, and I wasn’t,” she said. Mangan and her husband – the parents of three boys – decided to pay the $550 for genetic testing, and the results that came back in April 2023 shocked two generations. It showed Mangan had inherited a BRCA2 (breast cancer gene 2) mutation, which gives women a far higher chance of developing aggressive breast and ovarian cancer and men an elevated risk of prostate cancer. The twist was that her 68 per cent chance of breast cancer was due to a mutation inherited from her father, not her mother. Doctors told Mangan her decision to get tested had saved her life. Credit: Edwina Pickles “My dad was absolutely shocked and said, ‘I’m so sorry, darling’. He was in disbelief and assumed the BRCA gene [mutation] was a female kind of thing.” Within a couple of months, Mangan had her fallopian tubes out and a preventive double-mastectomy, after which it was discovered she had very early stage breast cancer – ductal carcinoma in situ.",

        "content": "Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan speaks at an international news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday.Photo: screen grab from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’s Facebook page By Lee I-chia / Staff reporter Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan (邱泰源) yesterday again called for the international community’s support as he urged the WHO to let Taiwan participate as an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA). The annual meeting of the WHA, the decisionmaking body of the WHO, began in Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday and ends on Saturday. As Taiwan has not been invited to attend the WHA as an observer for the eighth year in a row, a delegation of health officials and experts led by Chiu arrived in Geneva on Friday to speak up for Taiwan and take part in bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the WHA. Joined by four legislators from across party lines, Chiu held an international news conference at the Geneva Press Club to speak about “How Taiwan’s participation in the WHO can contribute to a comprehensive global health network.” “We are calling for the international community’s support and urging the WHO to act in line with this year’s WHA theme — ‘All for Health, Health for All’ — by including Taiwan in the proceedings of the WHA as an observer, and allowing Taiwan’s regular participation in WHO meetings, activities and mechanisms,” Chiu said in his opening remarks. Taiwan supports actions that can save lives — promoting health and well-being, advancing primary healthcare, ensuring universal health coverage and meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals, but the WHO continues to exclude Taiwan for political reasons, he said. “I would like to reaffirm that neither UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 nor WHA Resolution 25.1 mentioned Taiwan or provide legal authorization for the People’s Republic of China [PRC] to represent Taiwan in the UN system,” he said. “Precluding Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the WHO based on these resolutions cannot be justified,” Chiu said. “Neither the Republic of China [Taiwan] nor the PRC is subordinate to the other,” he said, adding that that is “the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and an internationally recognized objective fact.” “China has no right to interfere with or restrict Taiwan’s participation,” he said, stressing that only the democratically elected government of Taiwan can represent its 23 million people in the WHO and other international forums. “We sincerely appreciate the support extended by diplomatic allies and like-minded countries for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the WHO,” he added. Taiwan, being a force for good, has the capability and willingness to contribute to global health and well-being, and the whole world would benefit from its inclusion to the WHO and WHA, Chiu said. Asked what name Taiwan would use to join the WHO, Chiu said. “Taiwan is Taiwan, and our country name is the Republic of China (ROC), so using ‘Taiwan’ or ‘ROC’ for joining the WHO or the WHA is what we will insist.” Asked if Taiwan would find alternative ways to join the WHO or the WHA, aside from winning support from diplomatic allies and like-minded countries, Chiu said that, in the past few decades, Taiwan has educated and trained many outstanding healthcare professionals, and they have not only elevated the quality of domestic healthcare, but also participated in many international organizations. Many Taiwanese healthcare professionals also play important roles in international organizations, such as the Taiwan Medical Association, which helped draft the World Medical Association’s statement on health emergency responses, he said, adding that Taiwan has more than 100 professional healthcare groups and their efforts would be the foundation of Taiwan’s successful WHO and WHA bid. Many Taiwanese healthcare professionals are getting further education or training in other countries and building friendships with local professionals, who might eventually also hold key positions in world organizations, so the government would continue to provide more resources to professional healthcare associations to encourage international participation, he said. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attends the World Health Assembly at the UN in Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday.Photo: Reuters 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "description": "This Indigenous Partnerships Success Showcase discussion happens on June 6, 2024",
        "content": "An economy simply cannot be assessed – or survive – on the weight of dollars and cents alone. Given the fluidity of both economic and environmental conditions, it’s imperative that Canada moves away from its long-standing reliance on fossil fuels to bolster the economic opportunities of the 21st century. And an upcoming panel discussion in Vancouver will examine how to do just that. Held as part of the upcoming 2024 Indigenous Partnerships Success Showcase (IPSS) on June 6, this discussion, entitled Indigenous Opportunities Across B.C.’s Electrification Value Chain, will center around the necessity of electrification due to increasing household and industrial demand, policy objectives, and the imperatives of reconciliation. The panel will be sponsored by KPMG, joining event patron sponsor GCT Global Container Terminals. The panelists include: Josie Osborne, minister of energy, mines and low carbon innovation; Kwatuuma Cole Sayers, executive director of Clean Energy BC; and Michelle Mungall, senior advisor with Energy Storage Canada and Woodfibre LNG, and former provincial minister of energy, mines and petroleum resources. “Having both the present and past ministers of energy, along with the participation of Kwatuuma Cole Sayers, I think is really important because we need to greatly increase the amount of electrification that powers society – we can’t continue to just have fossil fuels powering our society,” says IPSS founder Stewart Muir. To lead off the discussion, Sayers will emphasize the significance of energy transition opportunities for Indigenous communities, stressing economic reconciliation; Osborne, meanwhile, will outline government steps to ensure Indigenous participation in energy transition and asset ownership. Regarding ease of involvement, Sayers will present feedback from Indigenous communities and businesses, and address capacity challenges. The discussion will shift to energy storage, emphasizing its importance in grid reliability and resiliency. Osborne and Sayers will explore how BC Hydro can diversify energy storage in partnership with Indigenous communities. Mungall will highlight the gradual nature of the energy transition and economic reconciliation processes, stressing the need for stability amidst political changes. The panel will conclude with audience questions and closing remarks focusing on collaboration, government policy, and long-term planning for societal shifts. “All of these future growth opportunities are going to require First Nations to be leading, not just a part of or just consulted, but to be really leading in developing those resources,” Muir says. “We can’t have an electrified, clean, future economy without First Nations being at the front of it.” Running June 5 and 6 at the Vancouver Convention Centre, IPSS has become the West Coast's premier conference on partnerships between Indigenous peoples, the business community, and Canadians in general. IPSS stands out from competitors because it is not primarily a B-to-B conference, but what organizers call a \"business to Canadians\" conference. The key theme for this year’s IPSS is on Reconciliation in Action, and responding to the growing demand for practical guidance on how First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities and their enterprise partners can work together, in common purpose, for shared success. “I think these values are shared by many in the community, especially by those who want to contribute toward reconciliation in all spheres of business or cultural life but may not feel equipped,” Muir says. “IPSS will provide guidance, inspiration and networking opportunities to fuel practical steps toward reconciliation.” Tickets for this year’s IPSS are available at www.indigenoussuccess.ca .",

        "description": "Australian airline passengers will soon, for the first time, be able to bring their pets on board with them. I’m surprised it has taken so long.",
        "content": "When my dog, Roxy, was a puppy, I flew her to Hobart with me to visit my parents. I’ll never forget peering out the window of the plane from my comfortable seat inside and seeing her in her crate, stalled on the runway, looking forlorn. Prefers the window seat – how will Virgin and the airports handle flying pets? Credit: iStock There were a couple of larger dogs in crates and they were noisily expressing anger and fear at their imprisonment. That seemed to make her more nervous, and I wondered how on Earth she was going to survive the noise of the engine when we took off. Except for the return journey, I never did that again. I’m not sure that any being with consciousness deserves to be in the hold of a plane. We humans have trouble enough calming nerves over the bumps, strange noises and nerve-racking accelerations and decelerations when we’re strapped inside those hurtling cigars. And we understand the concept of flying. Imagine how a dog or cat feels – unless they’re medicated, they’re frightened. And while I’m sure every care is taken by baggage handlers to get the animals on to the plane more gently than inanimate luggage, there have been a number of incidents over the years when pets have died in transit, most frequently by being left on sweltering tarmacs when the flight has been delayed. No wonder animal owners have been agitating for some years to be able to take their pets inside the cabin. Now Virgin Australia has announced that the airline will allow pets in the cabin on some flights within the next 12 months, subject to regulatory approval. The service will be limited to small cats and dogs on some domestic routes only, so you can’t take your rabbit or guinea pig, apparently. Pets will be limited to assigned rows and they must be small enough to fit into a carrier, which fits below the seat in front. No pets on laps or animals freely running around the aircraft.",

        "content": "This article is part of Traveller’s Holiday Guide to Affordable Travel. See all stories . Denmark, Sweden and Norway are expensive, but there are ways to save money in these amazing travel destinations. To save money before you even arrive, familiarise yourself with Scandinavia’s geography. If you’re visiting south-west Sweden, for example, you’ll get better value by flying into Copenhagen airport, which is far closer than Stockholm airport – and also offers many more budget flight options from other European countries. Similarly, hotels in Malmo in Sweden are considerably cheaper than those in Copenhagen, yet the train commute takes just 40 minutes across the spectacular Oresund Bridge. The remarkable Oresund Bridge connecting Sweden and Denmark. Credit: iStock Plan well ahead. Regional airline and train tickets are much cheaper the further in advance you book. Consider a single-country Interrail pass for train travel; value is especially good if you’re younger than 28 or older than 59. Summer (June-August) is the most expensive time to travel. As long as you don’t mind cooler temperatures, April-May and September-October are fine months, and you’ll enjoy lower prices on hotels and transport. Credit: Greg Straight Don’t rule out winter either for a different experience, but pick the right weeks. Christmas is high-season, so are school holidays in the second half of February, during which Scandinavians head off on ski trips and family visits. If you don’t mind basic travel, you can camp out almost anywhere you like in Norway and Sweden, and many wilderness cabins are free. All of Scandinavia has a great network of hostels, as well as a lively volunteering scene where you can swap light farm work or household chores for a free bed and some meals. It’s a great way to meet locals. Eating out is expensive. If ever you’re going to book self-catering accommodation such as a hostel or Airbnb, do it in Scandinavia. Stock up at suburban supermarkets – preferably budget ones such as Aldi, Netto or Lidl – rather than downtown convenience stores.",

        "content": "LEO WOODALL has already dazzled us with his TV acting skills, personality and good looks — but now he is working on getting the full Hollywood physique. I can reveal the actor, who found fame on dramas including The White Lotus and One Day, put a mini-gym on the rider of his current film, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. 6 Leo Woodall is going above and beyond for his Hollywood body Credit: Getty 6 The actor has even put a mini-gym on the rider of his current film, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy Credit: Getty It is so he can always look buff when playing London gardener Rockstar, who becomes the toyboy crush of Bridget, played by Renee Zellweger. A TV insider said: “Leo is already in great shape. “But given the fact he’s supposed to be someone who spends all day doing manual work, he really wants to look the part. “So, as the consummate acting pro that he is, Leo is said to be hitting the weights between takes so he can look his best for the cameras. And judging by some of the images that have been coming from the set of the film, the hard work certainly seems to be paying off.” Leo already had viewers hot under the collar when he stripped off in the second series of The White Lotus in 2022. He played Jack, an Essex boy who was hiding an uncomfortable secret underneath his cocky exterior. Then he had audiences in tears playing the leading man Dexter in One Day , an adaptation of the romantic novel by David Nicholls. It was screened on Netflix earlier this year, and once again saw Leo lose his clothes in love scenes.

Bridget Jones's greatest moments He said: “I remember thinking that Dex can’t be a big gym guy.” But the need for more muscle was obvious when he took on the role of Rockstar, a Hampstead Heath park attendant in Mad About The Boy. Not only have the movie’s producers put him in an extremely tight T-shirt, Leo also has to have Bridget attracted by his charms, or maybe just his arms. 6 Leo will star in Bridget Jones alongside Renee Zellweger Credit: Getty Malala loves a laugh MALALA YOUSAFZAI may be an education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, but she likes a laugh. She was invited to feature in the second series of Channel 4 music comedy We Are Lady Parts, about a rock band. Writer Nida Manzoor said: “I had this idea for the song, Malala Made Me Do It, it’s a hype track. I was massively stressed out about how we were going to make sure Malala had a good time. “She was so laid back and easy- going. She also has a very dark sense of humour, and she’s so funny.” Olden age of Love Island IS Love Island taking inspiration from fellow dating show My Mum, Your Dad? After Davina McCall's series proved daters with more life experience can create TV gold, ITV has upped its age limit for the Love Island villa. 6 ITV has upped its age limit for the Love Island villa, pictured the newly released cast Credit: ITV The full cast, revealed in The Sun yesterday , are the show’s oldest bunch of sexy singles yet. They include a hairdresser, mental health nurse and a sweet salesman. But they also include footballer Ronnie Vint, 27, and recruiter Munveer Jabbal, 30, who says he is mates with Piers Morgan's son Spencer. Then there’s office worker Patsy Field, 29, and make-up artist Samantha Kenny, 26, also alongside the usual clutch of those in their early twenties. It means the average age of the Islanders in this year’s line-up is 25 – more than two years older than in any other season. A source said: “Two years might not sound like a lot but in Love Island years it really is. “Having the older castmates in the mix will hopefully bring about better conversations, meatier storylines and a lot more drama.” Which is handy, because host Maya Jama has revealed her main goal for this year’s series is more war than peace. Ahead of the launch next Monday at 9pm on ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX, she said: “I’ll be honest, I’m hoping for drama. “I want loads of love and happy couples at the end but I do want to be entertained, so I’m hoping for lots of fiery moments.” So this is going to end I CAN reveal comedy drama This Is Going To Hurt has reached the end of its life, with no plans for a second series. The Bafta-winning BBC One show was based on real-life experiences of former NHS doctor Adam Kay and starred Ben Whishaw. 6 Comedy drama This Is Going To Hurt is coming to an end, pictured star Ben Whishaw Credit: Rex Director Lucy Forbes said: “There’s zero chance of it coming back it’s categorically gone. “This Is Going To Hurt was a very popular series and it could have continued, but we told a self-contained story in a single series that was rounded off at the end of the seventh and final episode.” It is at odds with what creator Adam had shared last year, when he hinted: “If I thought of ideas for one I might do it. It remains a possibility.” Joseph's terror JOSEPH Fiennes was more scared of having no props or a script than dangers Canada’s wilderness threw at him.

        "content": "All eyes are on the social media giants at the moment. With Instagram’s minimisation of political content, Facebook’s step away from news and TikTok facing a possible ban in the US, the digital triumvirate has been making global headlines for months now. Yet amid all this noise, another platform used by nearly a third of Australians is flying under the radar: Snapchat. Snapchat has insidious features that would harm young users. Credit: Bloomberg A younger sibling to behemoths like Facebook and Instagram, Snapchat boasts over 8 million Australian users. According to its own user data, 80 per cent of Australians aged between 13 and 24 are on the platform , and they open the app an average of 40 times a day. But to a huge number of Australians, Snapchat remains relatively unknown, despite being around since 2012. For those unfamiliar, it’s an instant messaging app that deletes communications after 24 hours unless they are saved. Users send “snaps” (often selfies) either to individual users or to their entire following. A “best friends” list ranks the eight people with whom you communicate most, and if you opt in, a “Snap Map” displays the location at which you were last active. I’ve grown up with Snapchat. I know its influence, aimed at younger users, to be both toxic and underreported. In my adolescence, I saw the platform encourage vanity and promote a raft of social pressures. I noticed the strains and anxieties this caused, both in myself and in friends. Remarkably, though, and unlike its competitors, Snapchat is rarely pinned as a driving enabler of these issues, even though the app’s culpability is undeniable. Loading Take, for example, the Snap Map. For many kids, having their locations displayed creates a pressure to socialise. They might not want to be seen alone on a Saturday night or at home when others are spending time together, and so social activity turns from recreation to necessity under this level of scrutiny. The ability to see if your friends are together and socialising without you has the power to drive insecurities and comparison culture. It is also exhausting. Young people look at the Snap Map to see who’s at a party before deciding whether to go, to see who’s down the street before picking their outfit. Sure, some users don’t display their location or access the feature. But from my experience the vast majority do, including kids in their formative and most vulnerable years.",

        "content": "A handout photo made available by the Presidential Office shows President William Lai, right, reacting with US Representative Michael McCaul during their meeting at the Presidential Office in Taipei yesterday. Photo: Shu Fu, EPA-EFE RELIABLE PARTNER: Washington is ‘fully committed to deterrence by supporting Taiwan militarily, diplomatically and economically,’ US Representative Andy Barr said By Liu Tzu-hsuan / Staff reporter The US is a reliable partner of Taiwan and committed to providing resolute support to the nation, visiting US lawmakers said yesterday, adding that China’s recent military drills sent a strong signal for the US to accelerate the delivery of weapons to Taiwan. US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul is leading a cross-party congressional delegation to Taiwan that arrived on Sunday. On behalf of US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the visit is to congratulate President William Lai (賴清德) on taking office and “celebrate a victory for democracy,” US Representative and cochair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus Andy Barr told a news conference yesterday. The US is “fully and completely committed to deterrence by supporting Taiwan militarily, diplomatically and economically,” he said, adding that its resolve to maintain the “status quo” and peace in the Taiwan Strait should not be doubted. “The resoluteness which the United States Congress has behind Taiwan is extremely strong,” McCaul said. Taiwan’s importance lies in its people, democracy, freedom, prosperity, science and technology, and innovation, he said. “And it’s because the people of Taiwan are just like the people of the United States,” he added. McCaul highlighted repeatedly that “deterrence is key,” pledging to “get the weapons you purchase to you as soon as possible.” Asked about the delays in the delivery of weapons by Washington, McCaul said: “We are moving forward on those weapons systems.” It is crucial to let Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) understand that “the risk outweighs the reward” when considering taking military action against Taiwan, he said. McCaul said he hoped the deterrence provided by the US and the support the delegation has shown through its presence in Taiwan would help prevent military conflicts in the region and make Xi realize that “it’s simply not worth it.” Bejing’s military exercises around Taiwan last week sent “a very strong message” to the US, which the delegation would convey to the US Congress and US President Joe Biden, he said. As the US is holding its presidential election in November, McCaul assured Taiwan that “regardless of ... which candidate wins the presidential [election], I do not see that support [for Taiwan] wavering whatsoever.” “We are stronger when we stand together,” he told Lai when the delegation met with the president earlier yesterday. “America is and always will be a reliable partner and no amount of coercion or intimidation will slow down or stop the routine visits by the [US] Congress to Taiwan,” he said. Congratulating Lai on winning the election and taking office, McCaul said that he looked forward to working with the new administration. “I think Taiwan has the right man at the right time in the right place,” he said. Lai thanked the delegation for showing its firm support for Taiwan through the visit and vowed to continue to deepen cooperation with the US and other like-minded countries to safeguard regional peace, stability and prosperity. While Taiwan is bolstering its national defense capabilities, Lai said he hoped the US Congress would continue to assist Taiwan in the effort through legislative actions. “I’m confident that Taiwan-US relations will steadily deepen, leading to ever more fruitful exchanges,” Lai said. The other members of the visiting delegation are Republicans Young Kim and Joe Wilson, and Democrats Jimmy Panetta and Chrissy Houlahan. 新聞來源: TAIPEI TIMES US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul speaks during a press conference following a meeting with President William Lai in Taipei yesterday.Photo: Ben Blanchard, Reuters 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法",

        "description": "Israel's army said the strikes had killed two senior Hamas operatives, and that it was investigating reports of civilians killed in a fire.",
        "content": "Gaza’s civil defence agency said Monday that the death toll had risen to 40 from overnight Israeli strikes that set ablaze tents of displaced Palestinians in Rafah, an attack that sparked condemnation across the Arab world. Israel’s army said the air strikes late Sunday, hours after a rocket attack had targeted Tel Aviv, had killed two senior Hamas operatives, and that it was investigating the reports of civilians killed in a fire. ALSO READ: ‘It’s shocking to see Israel has no compassion for human life’ − Pandor The Israeli attack sparked strong protests from Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait and from Qatar which warned it could “hinder” budding steps to revive stalled truce and hostage release talks in the Israel-Hamas war raging since October 7. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Monday that many bodies were “charred” after the strikes triggered a fire that ripped through a displacement centre in northwest Rafah. “The massacre committed by the Israeli occupation army in the refugee tents northwest of Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip has left 40 martyrs and 65 wounded,” said agency official Mohammad al-Mughayyir. “We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs ... We also saw cases of amputations, wounded children, women and the elderly.” Footage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic night-time scenes of paramedics in ambulances racing to the fiery attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. “We had just done with the evening prayers,” recalled one survivor, a Palestinian woman who declined to be named. “Our children were asleep ... suddenly we heard a loud sound and there was fire all around us. The children were screaming ... the sound was terrifying.” The ICRC said that one of its field hospitals was receiving an “influx of casualties seeking care for injuries and burns” and that “our teams are doing their best to save lives”. ALSO READ: Hamas hails ICJ order for Israel to halt Rafah assault AFP images after sunrise showed the charred remains of makeshift tents and vehicles as Palestinian families looked at the blackened destruction. Israel’s army had said overnight that its aircraft had “struck a Hamas compound in Rafah”, killing Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both senior officials for the Palestinian militant group in the occupied West Bank. It added that it was “aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.” Mughayyir said the rescue efforts were hampered by war damage and the impacts of Israel’s siege on the territory amid the over seven-months-old conflict. “There is a fuel shortage ... there are roads that have been destroyed, which hinders the movement of civil defence vehicles in these targeted areas,” he said. “There is also a shortage of water to extinguish fires.” – ‘Dangerous violation’ – Egypt deplored the “targeting of defenceless civilians” and labelled it part of “a systematic policy aimed at widening the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip to make it uninhabitable”. Jordan also expressed its condemnation, accusing Israel of committing “ongoing war crimes”. Kuwait charged the attack exposed Israel’s “blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world”. And Qatar condemned the Israeli bombing as a “dangerous violation of international law”. The strike came hours after Hamas had on Sunday, for the first time in months, launched a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv and other areas of central Israel, sending people running into bomb shelters. ALSO READ: WATCH: ICJ orders Israel to immediately stop attacks in southern Gaza city of Rafah Although Israeli air defences took out most of the rockets and no casualties were reported, the attack was seen as an effort by Hamas to signal that it remains undefeated. Hamas’s armed wing said it had targeted Tel Aviv “with a large rocket barrage in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians”. Israel invaded Gaza in late October, but its ground forces are still battling Hamas in northern and central areas where Hamas has regrouped, as well as around Rafah. Israel’s top ally the United States has strongly urged all sides to resume truce talks, with efforts underway in recent days toward new talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators. After the latest violence, Qatar’s foreign ministry voiced “concern that the bombing will complicate ongoing mediation efforts and hinder reaching an agreement for an immediate and permanent ceasefire”. Hamas said, after the overnight strikes, that Palestinians must “rise up and march”. – ‘Justice for the Palestinians’ – The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,984 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry. The Israeli military said Monday that its jets had over the past 24 hours struck and destroyed “over 75 terror targets” across the Gaza Strip. The United Nations has warned of looming famine in besieged Gaza, where most hospitals are no longer functioning. The bloodiest ever Gaza war and the spiralling civilian death toll have sparked a growing global backlash against Israel, including cases before two international courts in The Hague. ALSO READ: WATCH: ‘Israel intent on destroying Palestinian life’ – SA pushes for urgent ICJ action On Tuesday, Spain, Ireland and Norway are due to formally recognise a Palestinian state — a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few western powers. Israel, which charges the move amounts to “rewarding terrorism”, on Monday announced punitive steps against Madrid, ordering its consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering consular services to Palestinians from June 1. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that “whoever gives an award to Hamas and tries to establish a Palestinian terrorist state will not be in contact with the Palestinians”. Spain’s Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares had on Sunday said Madrid saw recognition of statehood as bringing “justice for the Palestinian people (and) the best guarantee of security for Israel”. © Agence France-Presse",

        "content": "British number one Cameron Norrie slumped out of the French Open in the first round to Russian Pavel Kotov. Norrie, stuck on a sparsely-populated outside court on a cold and breezy Paris afternoon in a match delayed by rain, lost in five tight sets 4-6 6-3 3-6 7-6 (5) 6-2. The 28-year-old, seeded 32, won five games in a row after trailing 4-1 to take the first set. Twice Norrie led by a set but twice world number 56 Kotov hit back, taking the match to a decider in a tie-break. Kotov raced into a 4-0 lead and Norrie was unable to peg him back as he bowed out at the first-round stage for the first time since 2020. Norrie was joined on the British scrapheap by Harriet Dart, who lost 7-6 (3) 6-4 to Czech 27th seed Linda Noskova. Defeats for Andy Murray and Jack Draper on Sunday means Britain’s hopes in singles now rest with Katie Boulter and Dan Evans, who play their first-round matches on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, has advocated for the abolishment of state Independent Electoral Commissions (INECs). Fagbemi led discussions during Monday’s National Discourse on Nigeria’s Security Challenges and good governance at the local government level in Abuja. Despite constitutional provisions aimed at safeguarding the autonomy of local governments, instances of arbitrary dissolution, abolition, or fragmentation by higher tiers of government, especially State Governments, persist. The provision of the constitution, specifically under Section 162(5-8), regarding the State Joint Local Government Account, has been cited as empowering state assemblies to determine local government revenue allocations. This has led to concerns about state encroachment on local revenues. “Since 1999, there have been numerous cases of state governments hijacking local government revenues. Due to weak constitutional provisions, the existence of local government councils is often controlled by state governments.” “Local government elections lack consistency across Nigeria, with some State Governors dissolving their Councils and appointing Caretaker Committees instead. Moreover, there are numerous instances of abuse of the Joint Account system by various State governments.” “The erosion of financial autonomy within local governments has hampered their capacity to fulfill statutory obligations. Under a genuine federal framework, ensuring robust autonomy for local governments is imperative. Regarding identified implementation challenges of constitutional/legal provisions, this highlights the pressing need for reform.” “One enduring challenge facing Nigeria’s federalism is the continual neglect of granting autonomy to local governments, which constitute the third tier of governance. Despite being constitutionally designated to serve as a vital institutional framework for grassroots service delivery and national development, local government authorities in Nigeria have consistently underperformed in providing essential services to citizens, largely due to their lack of autonomy.” “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria did not provide adequately for the political autonomy of the local governments. The resultant effects of these inadequacies are that the state governments have the discretion to determine the nature, content and direction of local government elections and political activities. “The failure of the constitution to articulate a clear line of authorities to both the state and local authorities and the continuing debate over the involvement of state governments in distributing local government allocation from the Federation Account has affected the capacity of LGAs to provide essential services at the grassroots.Rather than function as a tier of government, LGAs have been operating as an appendage of the State governments in Nigeria. “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria falls short in delineating the political autonomy of local governments, leading to significant consequences. State governments wield disproportionate influence over local government elections and political affairs, undermining the intended independence. “This ambiguity has blurred lines of authority, fueling ongoing disputes over the allocation of funds from the Federation Account. Consequently, local government authorities struggle to fulfill their mandate, functioning more as extensions of state governments rather than autonomous entities. This structural deficiency hampers the effective delivery of essential services at the grassroots level, perpetuating a system where local governments lack the agency to govern effectively.” “Local government chairmen are always imposed on the people by the State Governors. This erodes the three elements of good governance at the local government level, which are citizens’ participation, transparency and accountability. The imposed chairman will be accountable only to the Governor rather than the people. This results in lack of transparency and non-involvement of the citizens. “High level and rampant corruption.The absence of administrative and fiscal autonomy to LGAs created a dependency situation than independent one conceptualized under a true federal system of Govt. The local governments in many instances have continued to suffer fiscal emasculation in the hands of state governments. In all these unwholesome abuses, Sections 7 and 162 of the 1999 Constitution among others have been an escape route for many State Governments to manipulate the Local government and reduce same to a mere department in the Governors’ office. “State joint local government account (SJLGA) has been the anti-development instrument used to frustrate every progressive and patriotic action to make the Local Government work since the return of the Country to democracy in 1999.And finally, what are the solutions/recommendations to the observed problems/challenges: LGAs are created by the Constitution. ” Accordingly, in a tiered system like ours, constitutional amendment is imperative before a new system of local government administration can be instituted.Good governance at any level of governance is not possible without the transfer of authority, responsibilities, capacity and resources. “This is even more so for the LGAs.Accordingly, constitutional reforms should, among other things, aim to: increase fiscal and administrative autonomy of Local Govt system to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency; fiscal autonomy should be balanced with fiscal restraint by strengthening the internal controls system, processes and infrastructure for public financial management;ensure inclusiveness and citizens participation in the governance of LGAs.allow the legislative arms of local governments to decide what they should do with revenue accruing to them;need to capacitate LGAs for effective governance. Capacity building involves equipping local government officials with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties effectively. control corruption and institute transparency and integrity in financial accountability of LGAs. ” Transparent and accountable governance fosters public trust, while efficient service delivery enhances legitimacy and stability.Investing more in local government administration with institutionalised internal and external oversightEnsure adherence to the rule of law by upholding the principles of justice, fairness, and accountability Conclusion: “The ability of LGAs to perform developmental functions, particularly in a federal system like Nigeria revolves around the nature of the relationship between the federal, state and local government any major reform of the Local Govt System will invariably require the alteration of the Constitution and other incidental legislations touching on Local Government administration.On the other hand, constitutional alteration can only be achieved through consensus building and commonality of purpose between the three tiers, as with the three arms of Government. “We are therefore challenged to play our respective roles, when called upon to do so. The best time to act is now.To achieve this, many experts have proposed that there is need for the scrapping of the state independent electoral commission. Their functions and powers should be transferred to the independent national electoral commission because the state independent electoral commission remain an appendage to every incumbent governor. “I applaud the House of Representatives for taking decisive action to address the core issue affecting local government administration in Nigeria. “This bold initiative reflects a commitment to revitalizing our governance structures, offering hope for resolving persistent security and governance issues. I eagerly anticipate ongoing collaboration with the House leadership and members, as well as with the broader National Assembly, on this vital matter.”",

Residents can expect wind gusts of up to 40 mph. \"At 2:51 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm near Findley Lake, or 21 miles east of Erie, moving northeast at 25 mph,\" states the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\" Locations impacted by the alert include Jamestown, Dunkirk, Fredonia, Westfield, Lakewood, Silver Creek, Falconer, Mayville, Clymer, Long Point State Park, Jamestown West, Chautauqua Institution, Lake Erie State Park, Findley Lake, SUNY Fredonia, Chautauqua, Portland, Sheridan, Ripley and Stockton. This includes the following highways: Interstate 90 between exits 58 and 60. Interstate 86 between exits 4 and 14. According to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with this storm. Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe shelter inside a building or vehicle. This storm may intensify, so be certain to monitor local radio stations and available television stations for additional information and possible warnings from the National Weather Service. If on or near Chautauqua Lake, get out of the water and move indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 10 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.\" Each year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away. To ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, keep these recommendations in mind: 1. Lightning safety plan: 2. Indoors safety measures: 3. Wait for the all-clear: When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. Heavy rainfall may lead to flooding if prolonged or if there is excessive runoff. Excessive runoff can be a result of saturated ground and/or rainfall intensity. Follow these recommendations from the weather service to stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of rapid water flow: Maintain safe driving distances: Reduce speed and drive cautiously: Choose your lane wisely: Visibility matters: Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down.

        "content": ": The Andhra Pradesh High Court has reserved its verdict for Tuesday on Macherla MLA Pinnellii Ramakrishna Reddy’s plea for anticipatory bail. A single judge bench headed by Justice Venkata Jyothirmai Pratapa held the hearing here on Monday on an implead- petition filed by advocate Posani Venkateswarlu on behalf of petitioners/complainants Namburi Seshagiri Rao and Cherukuri Siromani. He argued that the legislator’s criminal history must be taken into consideration and allowing the accused to enter the counting centre on the counting would not be good. If the legislator was granted anticipatory bail, he would threaten the witnesses and even tamper with the evidence, the court was told on behalf of the petitioners. Public prosecutor for the police argued that there was a chance the legislator would resort to violence at the time of counting of votes as he broke the EVMs on the day of polling. The legislator was involved in nine cases and even flouted the court directions and evaded the police vigil, the court heard. He added, “The police filed a memo in the court at 8pm on May 23, stating that the legislator was an accused in the attack on CI Narayana Swamy.” Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy’s counsel Niranjan Reddy submitted to the court that his client was supposed to appoint agents for counting of votes on June 4 and sought temporary relief from his arrest. He argued that though the HC had given protection to the legislator from arrest in a case of breaking the EVMs, the police subsequently booked several cases against him “in order to arrest him.” He urged the court to give an interim order providing the legislator protection from the arrest up to June 6. After hearing both the parties, the court decided to deliver its order on Tuesday.",

        "content": "A MISSING boy's mom had a sharp temper and once warned she was capable of doing anything when she wasn't on her medication, his family says. Amy Fry-Pitzen died by suicide in May 2011 after embarking on a three-day road trip from Aurora, Illinois, with her 6-year-old son, Timmothy Pitzen . The 43-year-old, who had long suffered from mental health struggles, was found dead in a $40-per-night motel room in Rockford. But there was no sign of Timmothy in the room and many of his belongings were missing as well, including toys and his beloved Spider-Man backpack. The only clues as to his whereabouts were shared by Amy in her parting words, writing in a suicide note that she'd given him away to someone who loved him and he would never be found. Amy and Timmothy's dad, Jim Pitzen, had hit a rough patch in their marriage before her death, with Jim seeking to divorce her and take full custody of their son. In her suicide note – which has never been released publicly – Amy voiced several derogatory remarks about Jim and said she intended to hurt him \"worse than you hurt me,\" he previously shared . In the days after her death, two more letters arrived in the mail addressed to her mom and a friend, in which Amy wrote that she was sorry and did not feel like she \"ever belonged in the world.\" \"I've taken him somewhere safe,\" she wrote in the letter to her mom. \"He will be well cared for and he says that he loves you. Please know that there is nothing you could have said or done that would have changed my mind.\" Timmothy's family members on both sides have spent the last 13 years torturing themselves to decode the meaning of Amy's cryptic last words. One thing they all resoundingly agree on is that Amy would never hurt her son. Both Timmothy's grandma, Linda Pitzen, and aunt, Jen West , told The U.S. Sun in separate interviews that Timmothy was Amy's world and they believe she gave him away to another family. However, they both also shared that Amy had a quick and fearsome temper, with Linda remembering a particularly chilling remark Amy once shared with her that disturbs her in hindsight. \"Amy had a very sharp temper,\" said Linda. \"Sometimes I could be playing with [Timmothy] and doing something that was fine and the next time it wasn't fine, but I think that had a lot to do with her mental depression. \"She once told me if she wasn't on her meds then she was capable of anything, which kind of frightened me. \"She was trying to find something happy and I think Tim did that for her until he started growing up and becoming more independent, and then the depression came back. Linda continued, \"But she always put Timm first. \"I think she was searching for answers in herself and just wasn’t able to find what she was looking for.\" The last known images of Timmothy alive were captured on a surveillance camera as he and Amy checked out of a water park hotel resort in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin , on May 13, 2011, an hour north of Madison. Two days before, Amy had taken Timmothy out of school early, telling administrators there had been a family emergency. The pair then spent the next two days embarking on a road trip, visiting zoos and water parks across state lines. While it appeared Amy had been planning the trip for some time, it came as a complete surprise to her husband Jim who arrived at the school on May 11 to collect the boy, only to be told he'd already left with Amy. For 48 hours, Amy aired dozens of frantic calls and texts from Jim and other family members who were trying desperately to track them down. She finally broke her silence on the afternoon of May 13 when she called her mom, and Jim's brother, informing them both she'd be home soon. Timmothy was heard chattering in the background of the calls and even spoke over the receiver. In her call with Jim's brother, Amy asked, \"What, don't you trust me?\" \"Timmothy belongs to me [...] I'm not going to hurt myself. I'm not going to hurt Tim.\" Moments later, Amy's phone would be turned off for the last time. The last cellphone ping from Amy's phone was registered in Sterling, Illinois, a small rural town about 80 miles west of Aurora. Records from Amy's I-Pass would later reveal that she made two prior trips to Sterling in February and March 2011. There’s 13 years that have passed, and those would’ve been very formative years. But there’s a lot left if we could just find him. Or if he can find us. Where she headed after Sterling remains a mystery, as do the reasons for her prior visits to the remote town, to which she had no known connections. Had Amy found someone to illegally adopt Timmothy and arranged to meet them near Sterling? Or had she done something to the boy that she never wanted anyone to find out about and buried the evidence where nobody would ever find him? Police have explored both theories extensively but are no closer to proving either hypothesis. A forensic examination of Amy's computers, phones, and financial records yielded no evidence of a secret adoption. But despite the lack of evidence, and the fact there have been no concrete sightings of Timmothy in the years since, Linda Pitzen believes her daughter-in-law was telling the truth when she said she'd given the boy away. Linda can't be sure where Timmothy is now, but she believes whatever happened may have had something to do with Amy's Mormon beliefs . \"I think she wanted Timm to be raised Mormon,\" said Linda. \"The rest of us aren't Mormon and I think this was her way of making sure he was after she'd gone. \"She never pushed it on anyone apart from Jim. But he was reluctant and I think her church may have been pushing her a little, I don't know. \"But she went to a Mormon church. She wasn't raised that way, she was a convert – and that was before Jim had met her.\" One of Timmothy's elementary school classmates, Hannah Soukup, told The U.S. Sun earlier this month that she believes Timmothy is being kept in a remote religious commune with limited access to the internet and the outside world. \"I believe she dropped him off somewhere – I don't know if it was in a religious area, or something like that – but I think she dropped him off and gave him to people she knew would keep him safe and hidden,\" theorized Soukup. \"And I think she made it clear that either his identity had to be changed or that he had to stay away from the internet so he'd never know he was missing.\" Linda Pitzen said she has long shared the same theory. \"I’ve agreed with that theory from the beginning,\" said Linda. \"I read that suicide note, and if you read that note and you know her, I would guess she probably gave somebody to live in a compound. \"I have to hope that's true because it'd be a lot better option for me to deal with, as opposed to what the other options are.\" Authorities have admitted they have very few leads to go on in their initial search for Timmothy, with the trail of their investigation quickly growing cold. By Luke Kenton, senior exclusives reporter, who has been covering the Pitzen case for five years. It was on April 3, 2019, when I was first made aware of Timmothy Pitzen's puzzling case. There was news breaking out of Newport, Kentucky, that a young and distressed-seeming individual had approached a lady on the street and identified himself as Timmothy, a 14-year-old boy who'd vanished from Illinois almost eight years ago. 'Timmothy' would later tell police he'd managed to escape from two sexually abusive kidnappers who'd been holding him hostage and \"passing him around\" since 2011. He described his captors as white with \"body-builder\" physiques and claimed the men had recently been holding him at a Red Rock Inn motel in Cincinnati, Ohio. The individual correctly stated Timmothy's full name, date of birth, and details about his upbringing. He said he spotted an opportunity to escape his captors, ran across a bridge connecting Ohio and Kentucky, and didn't stop for two hours before alerting a woman in Newport. News of the remarkable development filled family members with hope that Timmothy was finally about to return home after an agonizing years-long wait. \"We hope it’s true,\" Amy's sister, Kara Jacobs, told local media. \"What’s hard is the story that he escaped from his captors. And your mind goes in too many directions that you don’t want to think about. \"'And what I’ve prayed about since he’s been gone is that God will keep him close and take care of him and that maybe by some stroke of luck, he was with people who would love him. And if that’s not the case, it will be heartbreaking to get through.\" But the family's burgeoning flame of optimism was suddenly extinguished in a cruel and sudden gust. After being questioned by police, the individual was taken to a local children's hospital for a DNA test. There he admitted to his true identity; he was not the missing boy as he'd claimed but instead a mentally disturbed 23-year-old named Brian Rini who had a lengthy criminal record and a history of lying to police. Rini – who had twice before made false claims of being a juvenile sex trafficking victim – was initially charged with identity fraud and lying to the FBI for his sick Pitzen ruse. The delinquent later admitted to having recently learned of Timmothy's case during an episode of ABC's 20/20 and memorized his full name, date of birth, and other details to dupe investigators. His reason for doing so, he claimed, was that he \"wished he had a father like Timmothy's because if he went missing, his father would just keep drinking,\" court documents show. Rini struck a plea deal with prosecutors which saw his lying charge dropped in exchange for an admission of guilt. Timmothy's grandma, Linda Pitzen, and his aunt, Jen West, both told The U.S. Sun that Rini's hoax was devastating and difficult to process. However, they found a silver lining in the dense cloud of grief cast by Rini because their beloved Timmothy was thrust back into the limelight and his name and likeness into the public consciousness. \"It was hard but I still feel like that sick hoax helped our case,\" said Linda. \"I think when we put out the information each year, it gets out and people still recognize him as that little boy from Aurora, even though he'd be a grown man now.\" Similarly, Jen remarked, \"Now I'll speak to anyone about the case because you never know which interview, TV show, or other communication will be the right one that sets everything into motion and brings him home. \"It's a s**tty lottery but we kind of won the lottery of sensationalism and people want to know about the case. \"Keeping his story and name alive is half of the battle [...] we know he's out there somewhere.\" Hundreds of officers, a canine team, and a search plane had descended on Sterling in the aftermath of his disappearance but came up empty-handed. Law enforcement likened the search to a hunt for a needle in a haystack and admitted they lacked any solid evidence to help narrow its scale. In a statement to The U.S. Sun last week, Aurora police said its officers remain committed to solving the case. \"Over the years, the department has received and investigated several tips and theories from the community. Unfortunately, none of those have resulted in Timmothy being located,\" wrote Lieutenant Joseph Howe, adding the case is active and ongoing. \"The case is assigned to an APD investigator who continues to review the case to ensure all leads have been pursued and all evidence has been properly evaluated.\" The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children also helps the Aurora Police Department sift through leads and investigate any reported sightings. This year, the organization released a new computer-generated image showing what Timmothy might look like today. If he is still alive, Timmothy would be 19 years old. Seeing the computer-generated image of her grandson for the first time stirred deep emotions for Linda, who wanted to reach through the screen to embrace him. \"I like the fact that he's got reddish brown hair because he had reddish brown hair and he had [...] light freckles. So I like that a lot,\" she said. \"He's handsome. Very handsome. I would love to hug him but I don’t know if that’ll ever happen. \"There’s 13 years that have passed, and those would’ve been very formative years,\" added Linda. \"But there’s a lot left if we could just find him. \"Or if he can find us.\" May 11, 2011: Timmothy's mom, Amy Fry-Pitzen, picked him up from school at Greenman Elementary in Aurora, Illinois, at around 8:15 am citing an unspecified family emergency. The boy's dad, Jim Pitzen, appeared at the school to pick him up at the end of the day and was confused when he was told by administrators Timmothy had been collected by Amy that morning. Calls and texts to Amy's phone went unanswered and Jim began to panic. In the meantime, Timmothy and his mom went to Brookfield Zoo and later headed to Key Lime Resort in Gurnee, a hotel and waterpark. May 12, 2011: Amy and Timmothy went to the Wisconsin Dells and the pair checked into the Kalahari Resort, stopping to buy clothes and other items along the way. Jim reported Timmothy missing to police in Aurora after failing to make contact with Amy for almost 24 hours. Police did not issue an Amber Alert because Amy hadn't yet committed a crime and Timmothy wasn't suspected of being in danger. May 13, 2011: Amy and Timmothy are captured together on surveillance video for the last time, checking out of the Kalahari resort. While driving toward Sterling, Amy contacted various family members but not her husband. She assured them Timmothy was fine and nothing appeared odd in her behavior, those contacted would later tell police. The boy was heard in the background of the call and on at least one occasion spoke on the line. Amy then turned her cellphone off after driving 170 miles along the Rock River and her movements for the next several hours remain a total mystery 13 years on. She finally re-emerged several hours later, alone, at a grocery store in Winnebago near Rockford at 8 pm, where she stopped to buy supplies that would be used to craft her cryptic suicide note. May 14, 2011: Amy is found dead in a hotel room at the Rockford Inn by a maid just after 12:30 pm. She left behind a suicide note apologizing for the mess and warning that Timmothy was safe but would never be found. The boy's beloved Spider-Man backpack was missing from the room, along with a handful of his belongings. May 19, 2011: More than 70 volunteers begin searching for Timmothy in the Sterling and Rock Falls area but come up empty-handed. June 14, 2011: Police conceded they have very little evidence to go on in their search for Timmothy and began examining dirt found beneath Amy's car. August 11, 2011: Police confirm a small amount of Timmothy's blood was found in Amy's SUV but state it could've been the result of a bloody nose. December 28, 2011: A sighting of Timmothy in a car was reported at a Denny's in North Aurora but the report turned out to be false. Another tip earlier in the month also falsely claimed the boy had been spotted in Massachusetts. Aurora police said they fielded dozens of possible sightings, all of which were false and most were easily dismissed. April 3, 2019: A boy wandering the streets alone in Newport, Kentucky, claimed to a passerby he'd just escaped his two captors and he was Timmothy Pitzen who vanished from Illinois eight years earlier.

        "content": "Char Dham Deaths Updated: May 28th, 2024, 00:29 IST in Edit 0 A view of Yamunotri Dham during Char Dham Yatra in Uttarkashi district. (File: PTI) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin D istressing news has come from Uttarakhand that 58 pilgrims have died in the last 16 days while on the Char Dham Yatra. Government sources have put daily 3 deaths on an average. The religious fervor spreading across India seems to have had its negative impact even though the religious minded are unwilling to accept these stark realities. The deaths are not isolated nor are they a rare occurrence. Take for instance the Madhya Pradesh Navaratri stampede in Ratangarh in 2013 which took the lives of 115 people and injured 110 and the Morbi bridge collapse during Diwali in Gujarat in October 2022 which killed 141 people and injured dozens. In a stampede at a fair in Gangasagar, six pilgrims died in a stampede in 2017. In another stampede at the Vaishno Devi temple in J&K, 12 people lost their lives and many others were injured on 1st January 2022. These few instances are but samples and there are numerous other incidents where large number of people have lost their lives and many have had near fatal injuries. The Char Dham Yatra, like a few others across the country, is government sponsored and managed to infuse more religiousity amongst the citizens. According to Uttarakhand state government, as published in news reports, nearly three pilgrims have died per day during this current season of the Char Dham Yatra. It is undoubtedly a noble effort on the part of the people to take this ardous journey to liberate their souls by getting absolved of all sins committed during their lifetime. For people with such a high aspiration, the government seeks registration and a health certificate to distinguish who is physically fit to endure this pilgrimage. Also Read Dubious Deals 3 days ago Wheels of Justice 6 days ago Unfortunately, many pilgrims have been observed to be forging their health certificates which are a pre-requsite for availing this difficult journey. We have to keep in mind that they take all this trouble to get rid of their past sins. And yet many knowingly lie about their health condition on record. This disproves their keenness about the religion that they profess. Data shows that in 2022 in this same Char Dham Yatra, 300 people had died while 250 people had lost their lives in 2023. This means these huge number of deaths should ring a warning bell for the government that can, under present circumstances, be held responsible for those lives lost. Therefore, the Char Dham Yatra consisting of Jamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, Badrinath and similar pilgrimages should not involve the government machinery at any stage. Originally known as Chota Char Dham Yatra, which became bigger due to government sponsorship after 1962 China war, is a torch bearer of such pilgrimages. Seen in this background, the government has two options. First is to altogether stop approving such perilous journeys. Second, applicable only if religion overpowers, should be a complete withdrawal of government intervention in any religion linked journeys such as this Chota Char Dham Yatra or even Haj pilgrimage.

        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology could offer companionship to lonely people amid an international epidemic of loneliness, says a robotics expert.",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology could offer companionship to lonely people amid an international epidemic of loneliness, says a robotics expert. Tony Prescott, a professor of cognitive robotics at the University of Sheffield, argues in his new book \" The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence \" that \"relationships with AIs could support people\" with forms of social interaction. Loneliness has been found to seriously impair human health , and Professor Prescott makes a case that advances in AI technology could offer a partial solution. He argues that people can spiral into loneliness, becoming increasingly disconnected as their confidence plummets, and that AI might help people to \"break the cycle\" by giving them a way to practice and improve their social skills. Loneliness—or social disconnection—is more harmful to human health than obesity, according to a 2023 report . A 2015 study showed it can increase the risk of premature death by 26% and is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, depression and anxiety. The extent of the problem is striking: In the U.K. 3.8 million people are experiencing chronic loneliness. A Harvard study in the U.S. found that 36% of US adults—and 61% of young adults—experience serious loneliness. Professor Prescott says, \"In an age when many people describe their lives as lonely, there may be value in having AI companionship as a form of reciprocal social interaction that is stimulating and personalized. Human loneliness is often characterized by a downward spiral in which isolation leads to lower self-esteem , which discourages further interaction with people. \"There may be ways in which AI companionship could help break this cycle by scaffolding feelings of self-worth and helping maintain or improve social skills. If so, relationships with AIs could support people to find companionship with both human and artificial others.\" He does suggest this is not without risk, however, as it could be \"designed to encourage users to interact for longer and longer periods and to keep them coming back,\" and suggests regulation may be needed. Prescott is a leading expert on the relationship between the human brain and AI, combining expertise in robotics and AI with psychology and philosophy. He contributes to the scientific understanding of the human condition by researching the re-creation of perception, memory, and emotion in synthetic entities. As well as researching and teaching cognitive robotics at the University of Sheffield, Prescott is also the co-founder of Sheffield Robotics, which is a hub for robotics research . In \"The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence,\" Prescott explores the nature of the human mind and its cognitive processes and compares and contrasts this with the way AI is developing. The book explores questions including: He concludes, \"As psychology and AI proceed, this partnership should unlock further insights into both natural and artificial intelligence . This could help answer some key questions about what it means to be human and for humans to live alongside AI.\" More information: Tony Prescott, The Psychology of Artificial Intelligence (2024).

        "content": "Dear Readers: Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for honoring and mourning the U.S. military personnel who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. “Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night” by Walt Whitman “Vigil strange I kept on the field one night; / When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day, / One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I shall never forget, / One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the ground, / Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle, / Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my way, / Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) / Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate night-wind, / Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading, / Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night, / But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed, / Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands, / Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade -- not a tear, not a word, / Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier, / As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole, / Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death, / I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,) / Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear’d, / My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form, / Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet, / And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited, / Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim, / Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) / Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten’d, / I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket, / And buried him where he fell.” “The Fallen” by Randall W. West, courtesy of Family Friend Poems “Fragile is a single life the brave so freely give. / Bound for immortality, their souls will surely live. / Death, don’t be proud for what you took, they freely gave away. / Their quest for freedom far outweighed the fear that you convey. / They joined the ranks of warriors, staying vigil day and night. / They often skipped a meal or two, but they never missed a fight. / God bless the men and women whose fighting days are done. / Say a special prayer at night for each and every one. / Rest assured that you will find throughout the coming years / These fallen warriors will return in the hearts of all their peers! / If we forget their sacrifice, their deaths will be in vain. / Let’s stand beside their loved ones as we sing their last refrain: / You’ve come upon our heaven’s gate / You surely won’t have long to wait. / The saints will take good care of you, / But there is still a lot to do. / You’ve joined the ranks of everyone / Who fought so freedom could be won. / Although your job on earth is done, / Your work in heaven’s just begun.”",

        "content": "Revealed: American TV presenter whose flirty interview with Rory McIlroy sent tongues wagging gushed over football coach husband in engagement announcement two years ago READ Rory McIlroy and sports journalist Amanda Balionis spark romance rumors By Alison Boshoff and Daniel Bates Published: 19:43 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 20:08 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail 14 View comments Almost exactly two years ago, rising TV star Amanda Balionis could not possibly have looked any happier. Showing off an impressive diamond engagement ring, and with her arms wrapped around her long time boyfriend, she wrote: 'Hey @BrynRenner. Forever sounds kinda perfect.' She and Renner, a sports star turned football coach, had a beautiful beach wedding on December 3, 2022 in La Jolla – San Diego's 'jewel by the sea.' At the lavish wedding they posed in front of a neon sign reading 'The Renners' and the bride and groom wore matching Nike hi-top sneakers in the colours of his football team. She even used their hashtag 'Go Heels' in honour of her groom. Spool forward 14 months, though, and quite surprisingly given those recent romantic declarations her wedding ring was off. Her hyphenated family name – 'Balionis-Renner' – was also no longer being used. Plain Amanda Balionis went on a girls trip to Las Vegas and then two skiing trips in quick succession, again in an all-girls gaggle both times. Almost exactly two years ago, rising TV star Amanda Balionis could not possibly have looked any happier in her engagement photo Rory McIlroy and CBS reporter Amanda Balionis are pictured together And then on May 12, beneath an Instagram picture of her interviewing golf superstar Rory McIlroy on CBS, a friend, Camille Stroud, wrote: 'You two' alongside a heart emoji. It was at this point, that suspicions started to take root about just what was going on between sparkly Balionis, who has worked across CBS' golf input since 2017, and the just-divorcing Rory McIlroy, a £225 million sportsman. He announced on Monday May 13, quite unexpectedly, that his seven year marriage to pretty Erica Stoll had irretrievably broken down. They have a three-year-old daughter, Poppy. But it seems that while he and Stoll were on the outs – while he and Amanda Balionis were apparently drawing ever closer. So who is the woman who has caught Rory's eye? Balionis is the daughter of Tony, who died in 2019, and Dana, both avid golf players. She used to take her father on in putting games – playing for quarters. Mother Dana told Fore magazine a year ago: 'She'd say, 'I like it, but volleyball is more exciting. She was just so active. Golf was never active enough for her.' She added: 'She's never loved golf more than she does now.' She made her debut for CBS Sports show The 19th Hole at the 2017 Genesis Open at Riviera CC, and now she does interviews and analysis at all of the tour events for the network. She has also done NFL and college football sideline reporting, and was CBS's first-ever social media reporter for the Superbowl. The flirty banter was evident during the Wells Fargo Championship on Mother's Day, May 12 She has a degree in broadcasting from Hofstra University in New York and worked her way up to the big leagues by covering high school sports on digital platforms and on cable. Her big break came when she was working in the media department of the sporting goods manufacturers Callaway and was asked to present a slot on CBS. She said: 'The nerves were insane, but there was also this feeling that I had worked so hard for this. I had kind of given up on the dream, and I thought, 'I'm going to be live on CBS for at least one time, so, technically, I achieved my dream.' The chairman of CBS Sports Sean McManus believes she is a breath of fresh air who adds a 'different perspective.' He went on: 'She has a lot of credibility with golfers, and they respond well to her.' Read More EXCLUSIVE Rory McIlroy and CBS sports journalist Amanda Balionis spark romance rumors in wake of his divorce from wife Erica Stoll with flirty TV interviews after married reporter ditches her ring The job is to interview live without a prompter or notes, and to strike a friendly enough tone to put the golf stars at their ease. A source at CBS who knows Amanda well said: 'Amanda has always wanted to be on television. It's her dream. She's very likeable but one of the most ambitious people I've met. I've known her for a long time. She won't mind having her name linked to the story because of the profile it's giving her. I know she'll be loving it. I don't mean that cruelly. She's a nice girl, but she's ambitious. This will give her a leg up.' The source added: 'Before all this, I wouldn't have said they were any closer than she is with other players. She's got a flirty nature, which works well on television. She has chats with the players. I guess she and Rory get on well, but I don't know whether they're in a relationship or not.' Her mum Dana told Fore: 'It's really been amazing. Just all of the twists and turns to get to where she is. It's been one crazy thing after another. The stars just kept lining up.' In April this year, two months after Balionis apparently split from her husband, McIlroy took time out of his busy schedule to film a short video supporting Puppies & Golf, the non-profit founded by Balionis in 2020 and aimed at advocating for rescue dogs, rehousing and in some instances retraining them as support animals for veterans. Then on Sunday May 12th, the two seemed warmly at ease in each other's company, even flirtatious. Balionis asked him in a TV interview: 'What gear did you have to find to assert your dominance once more over Quail Hollow?' Later, she asked him to tell her: 'Physically how good your game feels.' It was an account on Twitter which first made explicit the inference of coupledom hinted at by Balionis' pal Camille Stroud. On May 16th a post ran: 'So Rory was possibly getting with Amanda Balionis from CBS. It's a rumour I heard from the divorce. That would be a spicy meatball if true. I like both of them. Maybe I made it up.' This was followed the next day by a blind item on the gossip site DeuxMoi which then started circulating widely on Twitter including via the anonymous' LIV insider' account. The anonymous DeuxMoi item said that the golfer had been spotted: 'all around San Diego. More specifically...the Crown Point neighborhood of Pacific Beach.'The neighborhood, more than 2,500 miles from McIlroy's home in Jupiter, Florida, is where Balionis lives in a two-bed home she bought for $789,000 in 2020. According to the source: 'My sister was at a restaurant, and he came in to pick up a 'to go' and used the name 'Amanda' as the pick-up. He paid cash – only a few people noticed him, and he was out!' Initially, people couldn't quite believe that it was true. However as time passes, without any comment from McIlroy's management or Ms Balionis' flack at 42 West, the rumours have started to be treated as fact. McIlroy, pictured with his now estranged wife Erica Stoll at the Rider Cup in September, recently announced he has filed divorce after seven years of marriage It would be normal for untrue reports to be denied. This week Dottie Pepper, a pro golfer who now works alongside Balionis covering the sport, said: 'No! Absolutely not! No!' when asked if she had any comment on her colleague being an item with Rory McIlroy. Darren Heitner, a lawyer who plays golf with Balionis estranged husband Bryn Renner similarly declined to comment rather than issue any denial. One senior source on the golf tour says: 'It was totally news to the TV crowd if it has been going on. Her co workers are as surprised as anyone else. Clearly they have kept it extremely discreet.' He added: 'It's not one of those affairs where everyone knows about it and you are just waiting for it to come out. 'The first anyone was really aware was from a Tweet. It was from an anonymous source so nobody really was sure how much notice to pay to it, but then it got bigger and bigger online until it came out as a story in the end. 'That's not to say that nothing was going on, but just that this was no Tiger Woods type situation. Everyone was actually quite surprised that the marriage had broken down in the first place. He is not one of the golfers who has a reputation for womanising at all.' You might think that's a curious thing to say as McIlroy famously broke tennis player Caroline Wozniaki's heart when he dumped her just after she had sent out wedding invitations. Balionis was last pictured wearing her wedding ring on Instagram in early February He also had a high profile romance with model Nadia Forde, and was linked even to Meghan Markle, pre Prince Harry. But in the context of the bunkers and bunk ups world of international golf, that makes him pretty much one of the innocents. Take Tiger Woods. The golfer reportedly confessed to sleeping with 120 women during his marriage to former nanny Elin Nordgren. Apparently she only decided that she was going to leave him almost a year after the first scandal erupted ...when the daughter of their neighbours was named as his 15th mistress. A veteran writer said: 'I could name you three players who have been the best players in the world who had that exactly the same lifestyle, the same numbers and everything as Tiger Woods. Actually, two of them used to compete with each other to see how many women they could sleep with. It's nothing new in golf. They are young rich good looking and on the road for months, and many of the golf wives just turn a blind eye.' As the late golf commentator Peter Alliss sardonically put it: 'Tiger failed the eleventh commandment 'Thou shalt not be found out'. During golf tournaments, there is a lively social scene. The players and their entourages can be found in hotel bars or local restaurants as the tour moves internationally. Organisations like the PGA habitually employ pretty young golf fans to do administrative roles. Sponsors similarly send teams of attractive women who orbit the players. Some wives insist on coming with their husbands so that they can keep an eye on what goes on at the bar, but often once there are children who need to be in school, this falls away – meaning that the husbands spend most of the year separated from their wives and families. No wonder that the sport is such a matrimonial graveyard. Rory McIlroy met New York born wife Erica Stoll through the game. He overslept during the 2012 Ryder Cup and nearly missed his tee time. Erica, who was working on PGA transportation, arranged a police escort to get him to the course in Medinah, Illinois, in time. They kept on bumping into each other as Stoll continued to work for the PGA and the couple started dating at the end of 2014, after his split from Wozniacki. They got engaged in Paris a year later and were married in 2017 at the 13th-century Ashford Castle in County Ma y o , with guests including actor Jamie Dornan, who grew up in the same town as McIlroy, One Direction's Niall Horan and Coldplay musician Chris Martin. Ed Sheeran and Stevie Wonder provided the entertainment. The celebrations were said to have cost £400,000. Home was a £7 million nine-bedroom, ten-bathroom mansion in Florida's exclusive Bear's Club gated community, founded by golf legend Jack Nicklaus, where basketball star Michael Jordan and tennis sisters Venus and Serena Williams are neighbours. There was also property in Wentworth, Surrey, the home of European golf, where he and Erica were said to have spent £10million on renovations. The thinking was that the family would take up full-time residence there when Poppy was ready for secondary school. Sadly, it has all fallen apart long before she reached that milestone. A source told US Weekly magazine said that Stoll felt 'lonely' in the marriage as they were effectively leading separate lives. The source said: 'She knew what she was getting into with his profession, but once they had Poppy, things really changed, and she had a new perspective. Erica was usually absent for most of his tournaments and was really focused on Poppy.' Another potential factor in the end of the marriage - other than the constant travelling and temptations – is McIlroy's role in the schism which split the game, when the Saudi-backed LIV golf set up as a rival to the PGA tour in 2022. McIlroy was the figurehead for the PGA, and strongly backed the tour. In the second series of the Netflix documentary Full Swing, filmed last summer, you see McIlroy sacrificing his own game in order to stand up for what he believes in. He muses on how 'off' his game is, confessing: ': 'I s**t myself with left pins. My technique isn't anywhere near where it used to be.' And he tells the documentary: 'It's all consuming. It's a full time job playing golf and having all the other stuff. You get fatigued. I had to ask myself a lot of questions. It's so difficult.' Just before the US Open he discovers that the warring sides have come to an agreement – and he didn't even know that the announcement was coming. 'Why did I waste 12 months of my life to fight for something that was always going to come back together again?' he says. There was widespread sympathy for Rory McIlroy on the circuit – and its no surprise that some of it came from Amanda Balionis. She tells the doc: 'It's so rare that PGA tour players take on the responsibility that we've seen Rory McIlroy take on. 'How can he be so invested into what's going on between LIV and the PGA Tour and go out there and beat the other 150 best players in the world? That's not a sustainable place to live of an already full plate and putting the PGA Tour on your back.' Did this sympathy blossom into love? Certainly there are signs that they started to become more closely aligned. Another source who is close to McIlroy said: 'No one will be surprised that Rory has someone else lined up. It's textbook behaviour. Look back at his love life. This isn't a guy who likes to be alone. The next conquest ALWAYS appears before the current one goes. I've known the guy a long time, and there is always an overlap. He added: 'I think he and Amanda are close, and there are lots of rumours circulating, but I've not seen them together. I tell you what, though, I wouldn't be surprised – she's his type. 'She's blonde which is his preference. I was very close to Rory when his relationship with Caroline ended, and we were telling him not to be rash. But he was desperate to move on once he'd made the decision. He'd decided he wanted someone who was homely and not dashing around all over the place at sports events. Now he's bored with homely and is bound to go for someone dashing around all over the place and going to sports events. It's funny, really. Caroline must be laughing her socks off.'

        "content": "White Sox manager Pedro Grifol didn’t back down. His players held their position, too. Grifol on Sunday said his team was ‘F—ing flat in a loss to the Orioles. On Monday, he was asked to revisit his take when told his players didn’t agree. “I’m doubling down on what I said yesterday,” Grifol said. “I thought we were flat. And that’s where I’m going to leave it. We have to make adjustments today, OK. And go out there and play the game as hard as we can.” The Sox took a 15-39 record into their Memorial Day game against the Blue Jays Monday, a history-making won-lost subjecting Grifol to critics even though injuries to Luis Robert Jr., Yoan Moncada and Eloy Jimenez have depleted his ranks. Those three comprised the core of a lineup that wasn’t expected to push the Sox out of 100-loss territory even if healthy. Grifol’s calling out players is a reversal of the second-year skipper’s normal tactics, though, especially when it comes to veteran players. This holiday weekend back-and-forth and the questions of player-manager dynamics is testing the sturdiness of the Sox’ on-field operation. Players say they’re unified. Grifol said there is unity between his office and the players’ room. “This is a close clubhouse,” second baseman Nicky Lopez said. “They have their opinions. I have mine,” Grifol said. \"[But] this is not divided by any means. This is not them against Pedro, Pedro against them. It’s just a situation. I thought we were flat. They didn’t think we were flat. It’s over.” After Korey Lee and Garrett Crochet echoed the prevailing feeling in the room, however – that the Sox ran into a buzzsaw in Orioles right-hander Kyle Brandish, who tossed seven innings of no-hit ball at them – Gavin Sheets and Lopez suggested it wasn’t completely over by saying the same thing. “I thought we ran into a pretty good pitcher yesterday with really good stuff,” Sheets said Monday. “[Orioles catcher James] McCann was like ‘he was as good as I’ve seen him.’ I thought we attacked. We had a game plan.” Grifol’s take did not go over well in the clubhouse. “I just know that I’ve been fortunate enough to be in this league for five years now, I’ve had four different managers and all of them are different,” Lopez said. “The way they handle things is obviously going to be different. “Obviously it’s been a tough year for all of us, so some people handle that differently, as players do, as managers do, as coaches do. I think that’s just one of the things. We’ve battling and grinding, busting our butt, and yesterday we didn’t have much going. He’s the manager, he’s entitled to do what he wants to do. It’s our job to go out there and play.” Grifol said he has extreme patience when it comes to development, improvement and adjustments, “but I don’t have any patience for not cherishing every single day you get to put on a major-league uniform. Zero.” Asked to be more precise about what he meant by flat, Grifol wouldn’t get into specifics. “Look, I’m not going to get into what flat looks like and it doesn’t look like,” he said. “Everybody who saw the game yesterday is going to have their own opinion. I had mine. Ok. That’s pretty simple. I’m done with the flat. I’m done with the energy. I’ve already addressed it. They’ve addressed it. I’m not going to continue to address that. “You can’t take days off. You can’t do it. Mentally and physically. “We’ve had games where we started off a little slow and then we just pick it up. I’m OK with that, because that’s part of the grind. And I’m OK with maybe an individual going through something and it takes him a little bit and then OK, we pick it up. But you’re playing one of the best teams in baseball [the Orioles], and you’ve got a guy on the mound that’s really damn good [Garrett Crochet] for us. And he’s giving us an opportunity to win. And it’s not about losing the game, it’s about doing whatever it takes to try to win the baseball game, energy-wise, and I didn’t feel we had it. That’s it.”",

RCMP say they received several reports Saturday afternoon about a man with a knife near an intersection south of the Deep Cove neighbourhood. A statement issued by police spokesman Cst. Mansoor Sahak says the man damaged a number of cars before striking the motorcyclist on the helmet and causing him to fall off his bike near Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road. Sahak says a passing motorist helped the rider, who suffered minor injuries. The statement says numerous officers arrived on the scene within minutes and took the suspect into custody, where the man allegedly assaulted an officer. Police say the man from North Vancouver has been charged with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assaulting a police officer, and weapon possession.

        "description": "Several concert-goers said they aren't going back to the music festival until their safety concerns are addressed.",
        "content": "For some Boston Calling concert-goers, the last day of the festival quickly turned from a fun day to a safety concern. Aubrey Kelly and Samantha Baron — who only attended on the sold-out Sunday — said they felt unsafe trying to watch the performances. “There was just nowhere to go. So everyone was just kind of being like moved in a wave. And all I could think was, if God forbid there was some kind of panic that we were going to get trampled,” Baron said. There were around 40,000 attendees compared to roughly 16,000 on Saturday, according to Boston.com . Boston Calling, Harvard University police, Boston Emergency Medical Services and Boston Police didn’t respond to requests for information or comment. Kelly said they were shoved and body slammed while in the crowd. At the same time, Baron said she witnessed security trying to get through but were unable to. The sold-out day had several notable acts including Hozier, The Killers, Megan Thee Stallion and Chappell Roan who all performed on two main stages next to each other — some only a few minutes apart. Baron, who has gone to the festival in 2015 and 2023, said there was a notable difference in attendee size compared to years past. Kelly and Baron said that even though they weren’t close to the stage for Megan Thee Stallion, they felt unsafe and tried to get out of the crowd to hear The Killers from far away. “We were too scared to get much closer. We stayed in the back the rest of the time. We stayed closer to the exit. We were more careful,” Baron said. Baron and Kelly said they also had trouble accessing restrooms and water stations because of not being able to move throughout the festival grounds. POV: You leave Boston Calling after a soldout show 😳 #masslive #boston #bostoncalling Saffron Donovan, a seven-year Boston Calling volunteer, said she has never seen Boston Calling so crowded. “I’ve never seen it as crazy unsafe packed as it was yesterday. Even a couple years ago we had Metallica headline one night and that brought in a massive massive crowd but that was nowhere near as unsafe feeling as between Megan Thee Stallion and Hozier yesterday,” Donovan said. Donovan said she didn’t think Boston Calling was fully prepared for how many people would attend the festival. Donovan said Saturday looked completely different with the ability to freely walk around the festival grounds and enough space for concert-goers to be able to cartwheel. She said there weren’t any additional safety trainings or precautions given to her besides the basic training manual for the day. “I don’t think they were purposefully not giving us information. I think it just wasn’t expected,” Donovan said. Donovan said Boston Calling has “outgrown” the Harvard Athletic Complex and needs to transition to a bigger venue space. She said if the festival were to stay there, it would need more designated exits and more planning would be necessary to ensure that bigger acts aren’t on stages next to each other. For Donovan, her safety concerns are likely to make this year’s Boston Calling her last. “That’s really sad to say because I’ve gone to the last seven years or something like this now. But it was a little too scary in that crowd. I couldn’t breathe for a minute. We lost Aubrey for a minute. It was nuts,” Donovan said. Baron and Kelly agreed. “The tickets were like $200 and we couldn’t see anything. We could hear the music, but we couldn’t see anything,” Baron said. Kelly, Baron and Donovan weren’t alone. Dozens of comments were left on Boston Calling’s Instagram page, pointing to unsafe conditions. One person wrote “vibes were high until about 4 when the crowds were unbearable and people were passing out left and right from claustrophobia.” Comments compared the festival to Astroworld Festival — a music event in Houston, Texas, in 2021 that was hosted by rapper Travis Scott — where 10 people died from a crowd crush. Some concert-goers claimed comments they made on Boston Calling’s Instagram page complaining about overcrowding were deleted. One person wrote, “Seeing how my previous comments about how unsafe this was are now deleted, I will say it again. There was nothing sweet about being trapped at the red stage and nobody doing anything about it. The artists were amazing but this was organized so poorly. 5 years and I haven’t seen anything like that. I am so disappointed, do better.” Kelly said she saw more comments on Instagram posts last night but this morning there were only a couple dozen. “They don’t want to be blamed. They don’t want to discourage people from going in the future,” Baron said. More boston calling",

        "content": "VANCOUVER - Police say a man has been charged with attempted murder and other offences after he allegedly used a knife to slash cars, then attacked a motorcyclist riding in North Vancouver, B.C., over the weekend. RCMP say they received several reports Saturday afternoon about a man with a knife near an intersection south of the Deep Cove neighbourhood. A statement issued by police spokesman Cst. Mansoor Sahak says the man damaged a number of cars before striking the motorcyclist on the helmet and causing him to fall off his bike near Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road. Sahak says a passing motorist helped the rider, who suffered minor injuries. The statement says numerous officers arrived on the scene within minutes and took the suspect into custody, where the man allegedly assaulted an officer. Police say the man from North Vancouver has been charged with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assaulting a police officer, and weapon possession.

        "content": "Writing a cover letter may seem passé in today’s world of zapping resumes electronically to potential employers, often via the black hole of job boards. But a cover letter can pack more punch than you think. While job openings have fallen more than 30% from their peak in March 2022, there were roughly at the end of April. To score one of those positions, you'd still need to cut through the blitz of applicants. One way to do that is to write a captivating cover letter. I talked to several career coaches about the advice they’re giving their clients and have included my own expert tips. Here’s what you need to know: Opinions are mixed. “The maddening thing for job seekers is that there are a million different opinions out there about cover letters,” career coach told Yahoo Finance. “You hear everything from people who are adamant they're never read to hiring managers saying it's the first thing they look at when evaluating a candidate. I tell my clients that if they're very excited about the role, then it's worth the time to write a letter.” I agree. For many hiring managers, it's what first spurs a flicker of curiosity about a candidate. “Worst case? It doesn't get read,” Axtmayer said. “Best case? It's a chance to demonstrate your skills for the role. Applying for something that requires strong writing skills? A cover letter can be a place you demonstrate that on the spot.” Look at it this way: Your cover letter is the appetizer for your resume. So, unless the job posting states otherwise or you’re submitting your resume on a site without an option for a cover letter, always include one. A well-written cover letter instantly represents who you are and what you bring to the table that’s relevant to the employer’s needs. If you can’t send it along with your resume when you apply electronically, one option is to send it directly to the person who is interviewing you ahead of time. Be clear, direct, and succinct. Use short sentences and active verbs. Your letter should be no longer than one page. Think of it as a written version of your elevator speech: a short, snappy summary of who you are and what kind of job you’d like to find. It’s a sales pitch you will tap again and again as you network and interview your way to your next position. “To write a great cover letter, I recommend my clients first know what matters to them and research to determine what they admire and appreciate about the organization, whether it's their mission, their culture, the values, their reputation,” Maggie Mistal, a said. “It's a great way to see how an organization is a match (or not).” “If you’ve found something about the company that truly speaks to a cause and interest that you care about,” she added, “this is your moment to put that front and center.” Start by reading the job description with a sharp eye. “If you're trying to figure out what is important to include, read the entire job description,” Axtmayer said. “Don't just skip to the qualifications.” Pay attention to the words used repeatedly. Those are clues as to what is important to the organization. The header of your cover letter contains your contact information. Include your telephone number, professional email address and links to your LinkedIn profile, and personal website if you have one. Use the same heading with your contact info in the same style as your resume and send it as a PDF, Axtmayer said. Research to find out the hiring manager’s name and address your cover letter to that person. If it isn’t listed in the job post, research LinkedIn or the company website to identify the right person. The idea is to try to avoid generic greetings, such as “To Whom It May Concern.” Mention the name of the company and the job title to which you are applying. It should also briefly mention why you are applying for that job. “The No. 1 thing I've seen left out of letters in my years of career coaching is people failing to include why that organization,” Axtmayer said. “It doesn't have to be anything long, but showing the organization what makes them stand out to you and why you want to contribute your skills there can turn a good letter to a great one, and show you've done your homework.” And, if applicable, note in this section who referred you or how you heard about it. Employers like to hire people they know or know of. Expand on the most relevant parts of your experience or education in one to two paragraphs. Use this section to show recruiters the impact your work has had and what you will bring to the table if hired. “I tell my clients the cover letter is where you show vs. tell,” Axtmayer said. “It's a space where you can have a narrative approach to showing how you align with a position and you can also share information that just doesn't get captured easily in a resume. “If you describe a specific example where you demonstrate multiple skills the employer is looking for, it can entice them to look at the rest of your background on your resume,” she said. “Don't assume employers will understand how you fit. Connect the dots for them.” Refer to your resume and express enthusiasm to meet with the hiring manager. For example: “For additional details, please see my resume (attached). I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you to discuss the position and my qualifications in greater depth.” Always end with gratitude: “Thank you for your time and consideration.” Here are a few mistakes to steer clear of in your letter. This is not all about you. “I find a big mistake most people make in the cover letter is using ‘I’ too many times,” Mistal said. “They focus only on what's great about themselves. But I suggest they focus the majority of their cover letter on what is great about the company they want to join. But they need to be sincere. It has to ring true with them, or it will ring hollow in the cover letter.” Tailor each letter (like your resume) to the specific position. Include keywords and phrases in your letter that match those used in your resume in case the organization uses an automated system for screening cover letters and resumes. No one wants to read something stilted like: “As was mentioned in the job description for this position, your company is in need of a team-oriented individual with a background of 10 years or more in the fields of marketing and communications. My qualifications make me perfectly suited to that position.” Write, “Your company needs a team player with experience in marketing and communications. I’m that person.” . Unless the organization specifically requests this information, save the salary conversation for when you’re near to being offered the job. A bonus for your efforts: “By doing a cover letter, you’re also doing your interview homework so you can clearly and specifically answer why you want to work at that company, in that job, and how you've demonstrated the success factors that are important in that environment,” Mistal said. For those making a career shift, you need to be up-front about your “why.” “Cover letters are very helpful for career changers — people whose resumes don't have all the requisite experience,” Mistal said. “In these cases, the cover letter can not only talk about what one loves about the organization but also how their skills and experience can transfer or translate.” Deal with that in the first paragraph by answering these questions: Why are you making this transition? What is it about this job or field that you enjoy? Why this particular employer? How can you help this employer succeed with your current skill set?",

        "content": "1 of 1 2 of 1 This Saturday (June 1) is BC Trails Day —and what better way to celebrate than by enjoying the great outdoors? In British Columbia, we’re blessed with many stunning hikes and trails. While amplifying the abundance of the province’s outdoor spaces, the Outdoor Recreation Council of BC also promotes and coordinates events with local communities in conjunction with BC Trails Day. Events include cycling clubs, trail clean-ups, outdoor hangouts, and more. For a complete list of events, see here . Here are a few of our favourite trails, all doable in a day trip from Vancouver. Joffre Lakes Provincial Park At the top of many hiking lists, the trail to Joffre Lakes in Pemberton is a popular choice for a reason. It is considered a more challenging hike, but the reward is a picturesque view of turquoise water nestled among the mountains and forest. Lynn Canyon Loop There’s a lot to take in at Lynn Canyon, like the Suspension Bridge and the Ecology Centre, but this North Vancouver park is also home to one of our favourite trail loops. The hike is famous for bird-watching and is dog-friendly, as long as your four-legged pals stay leashed. Grouse Grind North Vancouver’s famed Grouse Grind is known for being Mother Nature’s Stairmaster. A gruelling 2.5-kilometre trail up the mountain leads you to a gorgeous 360-degree view of Metro Vancouver (and our namesake, the Strait of Georgia). Whistler Train Wreck Trail For a unique viewing experience requiring no stairs and little elevation, the Whistler Train Wreck Trail is an easy trail with high rewards. The short walk offers views of the Cheakamus River before reaching the train wreck site, which features multiple graffitied box cars that date back to the 1950s. Stawamus Chief A choose-your-own-adventure type of hike, the Chief in Squamish is often recommended to tourists because it offers stunning views of the Sea to Sky corridor and has three distinct peaks (some of which involve fun ladders and chains to get to). Afterwards, burgers and beers in downtown Squamish are a must.",

        "content": "It's been a busy bank holiday weekend for Exmouth RNLI as crews rescued a lone sailor who had fallen overboard and five people stuck on a vessel which had lost power. The two incidents happened on Saturday, May 25 and Sunday, May 26. Exmouth RNLI’s inshore lifeboat George Bearman II was launched on Saturday within five minutes of being alerted by a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) to a person who had fallen overboard. It was followed rapidly by the all-weather lifeboat R & J Welburn and five crew members. The Coastguard also broadcast a Mayday alert to all nearby vessels requesting any possible assistance. Both lifeboats made their way to the location, along with a passing private motor vessel.

Exmouth RNLI said he was then transferred, via the inshore lifeboat, to the safety to the all-weather lifeboat. Once the crew were happy that the casualty required no further medical attention, they made their way back to his sailing vessel and deployed a crew member onboard to help get it back under control. The casualty skipper then felt he was well enough to re-join his vessel, so accompanied by a crew member and escorted by the lifeboat, made his way back to the River Exe and the boat’s original mooring. Exmouth RNLI volunteer Deputy Coxswain, Roy Stott said: \"It was a great outcome for everyone involved, as when a person is in the water things can very quickly deteriorate with tragic consequence. The casualties' life was almost certainly saved by the combination of his safety equipment including his Personal Locator Beacon and lifejacket. \"It gave us an accurate location of where he was, whilst keeping him afloat until help arrived. Also a sincere thanks to the skipper of the motor vessel that responded and pulled the individual from the water. A real one crew effort and a life saved.\" ⚠️ Want the latest Devon breaking news and top stories first? Click here to join our WhatsApp group.

If you’re curious, you can read our Privacy Notice ⚠️ The following day on Sunday (May 26) at approximately 12:40pm, Exmouth’s all-weather lifeboat was launched to a 17m (55ft) motor vessel that had issued a PanPan call having broken down 26 miles east of Berry Head. Upon arrival, the volunteer crew assessed the situation and established that the vessel’s automatic fire suppression system had triggered, preventing the engine from operating. Given the challenging weather conditions with 3m swells and the vessel not able to use its engine, there was no way for the family onboard (two adults and three children) to return safely to shore. They were also suffering with sea sickness. So, the Coxswain decided that towing to the nearest point of safety was the most appropriate course of action. It was a lengthy 26m trip back to Torquay at a speed of four knots, taking over five hours. Upon arrival, the vessel was safely secured alongside and the crew then made the journey back to Exmouth to refuel and prepare the lifeboat again for service. The very tired volunteers finally left the lifeboat station after a gruelling 11 hours from the first page. A spokesperson for Exmouth RNLI said: \"Some of the volunteer lifeboat crew who responded to the call on Sunday were taking part in a cricket match at the Exmouth Cricket Club Charity Day. There were still enough volunteers to muster a team to play and heavy showers did not deter them, as they’re well used to being out in poor weather conditions. \"All proceeds from the event were being donated to the lifesaving charity. Everyone at Exmouth RNLI thanks Exmouth Cricket Club for arranging the day and to the other cricket teams who joined from Exmouth Cricket Club, Exmouth Rowing Club and Exmouth Rugby Club. It was a family friendly day with live music, bars, food and included free cricket coaching for local children.\"",

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "description": "Emmerdale fans breathed a sigh of relief when Belle Dingle went to psychiatric hospital, but viewers soon turned their concerns to another villager who Tom King could hurt next",
        "content": "fans are convinced they have worked out who Tom King (played by James Chase) will hurt next after his wife returned to her psychiatric hospital. Over the past few months, the show has been tackling the sensitive topic of domestic violence through Belle Dingle’s (Eden Taylor-Draper) marriage to Carl King’s son. The junior vet has tried to exert control over his wife by gaslighting her and keeping an eye on her every day. More recently, Tom took his abuse to a whole new level when he punched her in the stomach after spying on her whilst at work. But this isn’t the first time he has hit Belle after he slapped her when she rejected his proposal last year. Last week, viewers watched the blonde bombshell snap at her husband as she pushed him over in the middle of the village as residents looked on in shock. It was at this point that the Belle called her crisis team for help and moved back into her psychiatric hospital. While Belle receives treatment, her abusive husband has been forced to hold down the fort and keep his distance. But during Monday’s visit (May 27) to the village, viewers learnt that her close friend Lydia will be paying her a visit. It didn’t take long before Tom found out when Lydia paid him a visit and dropped off a box of eggs. Now viewers have turned their concerns to another beloved resident after Lydia admitted how much Belle loves her furry friend, Piper. During the show, Lydia paid a visit to the vet to thank him for checking over her beloved pets. And she didn't come empty handed as she dropped off a box of eggs for him. As she handed over the goods, she greeted Belle's beloved dog with a coo. She gushed: \"Aww hello! Are you missing your mummy? I bet she's missing you too, she hates being away from you.\" It was at this point that Tom looked off into the distance as if he had come up with another evil idea just as Lydia offered to walk the perfect pooch for him. Tom insisted he would walk Piper because it would \"do him good to get some fresh air.\" But it was clear the cruel husband had more sinister plans in place, as the show ended moments after he pulled out a syringe filled with medicine. He told the teeny dog: \"Hold still, this will hurt you more than it will hurt me\" before he added: \"Actually, I'm not sure it will.\" After watching the distressing scenes, fans flooded to X - formerly known as Twitter - to share their fears online. One user penned: \"Tom better not harm a hair on that wee dog's head!!!!\" as another fumed: \"If that p***k takes it out on that dog, then I'm switching off #Emmerdale.\" A third agreed: \"Right, just keep the dog out of it. We know things happen with pets. But ffs, don't do this [angry emoji] #Emmerdale.\" A fourth chimed in with: \"If Tom hurts that dog I'm showing up to the Emmerdale studio tour with a vengeance #emmerdale.\" Viewers will have to stay tuned to find out what will happen to Piper while Belle is away.",

        "content": "An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel’s assault. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.3 “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by the international media outlet, Reuters, showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. Medics later said an Israeli airstrike on Monday on a house in Rafah had killed seven Palestinians, with several others wounded. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Egypt also condemned Israel’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt’s military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange.",

        "description": "The IEC says as of Monday afternoon an estimated 201 000 voting station visits of special votes were processed in 22 000 service points.",
        "content": "The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) says over 201 794 voting station visits were processed on the first day of special votes on Monday, 27 May. Special votes started on Monday and will end on Tuesday , 28 May, for qualifying voters. IEC REPORTS GOOD PROGRESS ON THE FIRST DAY OF SPECIAL VOTES The Commission said at 14:00, an estimated 201 794 voting station visits of special votes were processed in 22 626 service points. Over the two days, a total of 624 593 voters will be visited 62 000 officials from the Commission, accompanied by political party agents and observers, where they are available. “The Commission reminds those who qualified for special votes that they will only be visited at the given address once. If the voter is not present at the given address, they will be able to cast their vote at the voting station where they are registered,” the IEC reiterated. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE ON THE BALLOT PAPER? Additionally, the IEC clarified that if a voter has made two transactions, the last will override the first. This is reportedly done to protect the integrity of the elections and prevent voters from voting twice. Notably, those who applied to cast a special vote at their voting station must do so between 9:00 and 17:00, which is different from the voting hours of 7:00 to 21:00 on Election Day. The Commission said that after casting votes, the ballots must be inserted in an unmarked envelope, which will then be inserted in a second envelope with the voter’s details. “The special voting process is subject to all the security and integrity protocols of regular voting, including scrutiny by party agents and observers where present. Special votes will be reconciled against the voters’ roll and the list of approved special votes. “Additional checks include the double envelope system, which allows us to still preserve the secrecy of the voter’s ballot. All special votes collected are stored securely overnight on 27 and 28 May. They will be transported to voting stations on 29 May, where they will be opened, reconciled, and added to the ordinary ballots cast on 29 May before counting begins. As 29 May draws near, the Commission also warned South Africans to beware of misinformation and phishing scams on social media and other digital platforms.",

        "content": "BOGOTA (Reuters): The international community should insist to Israel and its allies that the country negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict in Gaza, Colombia’s foreign minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said. Murillo said actions in Gaza, where Israel’s military campaign has killed some 36,000 people according to local authorities, constitute genocide. Israel has energetically rejected South Africa’s accusations before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that it is committing genocide, arguing the operations are in self defense and targeted at Hamas who attacked Israel on Oct 7. “We must really insist, not just to the government of Israel but to its most important allies, many in the global north,” Murillo told Reuters over the weekend. “It is they who have the chance right now to convince (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu that it is important to reach a ceasefire, that it is key to permit humanitarian aid for Gaza and that it is central to sit down to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict,” Murillo said. Murillo did not name the Israeli allies he was referring to, but the country has received military aid from the United States for decades and is still due to get billions of dollars of US weaponry, though the Biden administration has said it remains concerned about the possible use of heavy bombs against civilians in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel in October, while another 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. ‘INEFFECTIVE MEASURES’ Judges at the ICJ, the top United Nations court, ordered Israel on Friday to immediately halt its military assault on Rafah, in a landmark emergency ruling. While the court has no means to enforce its orders, the ruling was a stark sign of Israel’s global isolation over its campaign in Gaza. Measures adopted by the United Nations have been ineffective so far, Murillo said, and the international community should redouble its pressure on Israel. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has heavily criticized Netanyahu and earlier this month broke relations with Israel, before ordering the opening of an embassy in the Palestinian city of Ramallah. Colombia is open to reestablishing relations if there is a ceasefire and access to humanitarian aid, Murillo said. Colombia is closely watching Venezuela’s presidential election process, he added. The Venezuelan opposition is participating in the contest for the first time in a decade, though it was forced to replace its candidate after the winner of its primary was barred from office in a decision the opposition says is illegal. “We have confidence the process will go well,” Murillo said.",

        "content": "When Balu Natarajan became the first Indian American champion of the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1985, a headline on an Associated Press article read, “Immigrants’ son wins National Spelling Bee,” with the first paragraph noting the champion “speaks his parents’ native Indian language at home.” Those details would hardly be newsworthy today after a quarter-century of Indian American spelling champs, most of them the offspring of parents who arrived in the United States on student or work visas. This year’s bee is scheduled to begin Tuesday at a convention center outside Washington and, as usual, many of the expected contenders are Indian American, including Shradha Rachamreddy, Aryan Khedkar, Bruhat Soma and Ishika Varipilli. Nearly 70% of Indian-born US residents arrived after 2000, according to census data, and that dovetails with the surge in Indian American spelling bee champions. There were two Indian American Scripps winners before 1999. Of the 34 since, 28 have been Indian American, including three straight years of Indian American co-champions and one year (2019) when eight champions were declared, seven of Indian ancestry. The experiences of first-generation Indian Americans and their spelling bee champion children illustrate the economic success and cultural impact of the nation’s second-largest immigrant group. As of 2022, there were 3.1 million Indian-born people living in the US, and Indian American households had a median income of $147,000, more than twice the median income of all US households, according to census data. Indian Americans also were more than twice as likely to have college degrees. Indians received 74% of the H-1B visas for specialised occupations approved in fiscal 2021, and a record total of nearly 269,000 students from India were enrolled at US colleges and universities in 2022-23, according to the Institute of International Education. Those numbers paint a picture of a high-achieving demographic that is well-suited for success in academic competitions. Ganesh Dasari, whose daughter and son each made multiple appearances at the Scripps bee, holds a doctorate in civil engineering from the University of Cambridge and was recruited to the US to work for ExxonMobil on an H-1B visa. He quickly obtained a green card. “Me and my wife, we came from a similar background. We both benefited from having the education ... so we put a lot of emphasis on educating our kids,” Dasari said. “We basically introduced them to anything academic, and a couple of sports, but clearly there was a bias in our thinking that education is a higher priority than sports.” In his 2016 address to Congress, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned “spelling bee champions” among his country’s contributions to the US while that year’s co-champs, Nihar Janga and Jairam Hathwar, watched from the gallery. Even among Indian American spellers, a particular subgroup is overrepresented: families from the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where Telugu is the primary language. Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, is India’s information-technology hub and the region supplies many H-1B visa recipients. “Whenever we go to the spelling bee events, everybody speaks that language,” Dasari said. “We realised there are so many people from the same state.” Deval Shah, the father of last year’s champion, Dev Shah, grew up in the northwestern state of Gujarat and proudly noted Dev was the first spelling bee champion of Gujarati descent. The parents of the 2022 winner, Harini Logan, are from Chennai in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Shah is an engineer, his wife is a physician, and both of Harini’s parents were trained as software engineers. Indian-born parents of kids with an affinity for spelling have a network of similar families to provide guidance and support, as well as access to organisations like the North South Foundation, which offers academic competitions aimed at the Indian diaspora. “The reason Indian American immigrants really dominate, the main reason is the North South Foundation,” Shah said. When Harini won her first NSF spelling competition, Ganesh Dasari was one of the judges, and “he was literally chasing us down” to tell them “Harini has tremendous potential to be on the national stage,” said Rampriya Logan, Harini’s mother. Ishika, a 13-year-old from Spring, Texas, who will be competing at Scripps this year for the third time, woke her parents at 6 am the day after she lost a third-grade classroom spelling bee, saying she wanted to participate in more bees. Her mother, an IT manager who immigrated to the US in 2006, then reached out to ask advice from other families from the Houston area whose children were high-level spellers. The relative wealth and stability of Indian American households could lead observers to conclude their children are benefiting primarily from a privileged upbringing. The truth is more nuanced, said Devesh Kapur, a professor of South Asian Studies at Johns Hopkins University and a co-author of The Other One Percent: Indians in America. “It is important to note that the children participating in the spelling bee competition come from striving middle-class immigrant families, often in occupations like IT, and not from wealthier Indian American households in finance or tech start-ups or consulting,” Kapur said. Natarajan, a Chicago-based physician and health care executive, now serves as the volunteer president of the NSF, and he experienced the spelling bee as a parent when his son, Atman Balakrishnan, competed. He said he sometimes feels out of place because he was born in the US and he admires the grit of Indian-born parents and their children. “It’s hard to describe, but it’s a very specific mindset that just drives effort and in many ways drives outcomes and sustainable success,” Natarajan said.",

        "content": "The National Information Technology Development Agency has vowed to implement its Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan 2.0, to transform Nigeria into a digital innovation powerhouse. The agency said on its X platform on Sunday that it held a 2-day retreat for top management staff to facilitate the implementation of the strategic roadmap. It noted that the primary objective of the retreat was to digitally empower Nigeria and promote inclusive economic growth, aligning with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda. The Director General of NTDA, Kashifu Inuwa, and top and middle management staff were in attendance, brainstorming innovative ideas to drive the country’s digital transformation. “This endeavour aligns with the agency’s overarching mission to spearhead Nigeria’s digital transformation agenda, which is closely tied to the eight priority areas outlined in President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda,” part of the statement read. According to the agency, its efforts are expected to have a positive impact on the country’s digital landscape, promoting economic growth and empowerment for all Nigerians. The NITDA Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan (SRAP 2021–2024) is a comprehensive strategy developed on seven key elements to drive digital transformation and innovation within the country. It focused on areas such as digitisation, capacity building, and the promotion of a digital economy. The SRAP 2021–2024 was designed to align with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for a Digital Nigeria, which includes pillars like developmental regulation, solid infrastructure, digital literacy, and the promotion of indigenous content. According to the NTDA, one of the primary goals of the plan is to achieve 95 per cent digital literacy by 2030 and to build the capacity of one million technology developers over the next eighteen months.",

        "content": "The tribunal dismissed the petition filed by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka. Presided over by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, the three-member tribunal panel affirmed Ododo’s victory, rejecting the SDP’s challenge to the election results. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had previously declared Ododo, the candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), as the winner of the November 11, 2023, Kogi State Governorship Election. Ododo secured 446,237 votes, surpassing his closest rival, Murtala Ajaka of the SDP, who garnered 259,052 votes, with Dino Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) trailing behind with 46,362 votes. The petitioners sought to annul the election results and demanded a fresh election in five LGAs, alleging forgery, voting irregularities, and non-compliance with the Electoral Act. However, the tribunal dismissed these claims, citing the petitioners’ failure to submit witness statements along with the petition and questioning the credibility of the witnesses presented. Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu deemed the evidence provided by the petitioners as “hearsay” and insufficient to prove their allegations. Consequently, the tribunal upheld Ododo’s election victory, emphasizing the lack of evidence to support claims of forgery or irregularities. With the tribunal’s ruling, Ododo remains the governor of Kogi State, succeeding former Governor Yahaya Bello. Ododo, a former Local Government Auditor-General in Kogi State, is entrusted with leading the state and overseeing its affairs, including financial management and governance.

        "content": "High-income earners have a 32% lower risk of dying after a stroke compared to low-income earners. The equivalent for high education is 26% lower risk. The differences in stroke survival linked to socioeconomics are striking, according to a study at the University of Gothenburg. The results will be presented on Wednesday at the European Stroke Conference ESOC 2024 in Basel, Switzerland. Katharina Stibrant Sunnerhagen, Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, and the lead researcher behind the study, will be present. The register-based study analyzed data from 6,901 stroke patients at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg. The aim was to investigate the influence of what are called social determinants of health on stroke survival. Four factors were in focus: place of residence, country of birth, education and income. Disadvantageous factors included living in an area classified by the authorities as a vulnerable area, risk area or particularly vulnerable area, being born outside Sweden or Europe, having a short education and low income. In addition to the association between income, education and stroke survival, the study shows a worrying trend in the combined effect of various factors. With one disadvantageous factor, the risk of death after a stroke was 18% higher, and with two to four disadvantageous factors it was 24% higher, compared with no disadvantageous factors. \"This shows the reality that an individual's socio-economic situation can be a matter of life and death within the context of stroke, especially when several disadvantageous factors come into play,\" says Sunnerhagen. The study also found an association between increased risk of death after stroke and additional risk factors such as physical inactivity, diabetes, alcohol abuse and atrial fibrillation. Clear gender differences also emerged when the characteristics of patients were studied. Among those with no disadvantageous social determinants of health, 41% were women, while women made up 59% of the group with two to four disadvantageous factors. In the latter group, smokers and former smokers were also overrepresented. \"The number of people suffering from stroke in Europe is expected to increase, making the need for effective interventions more important than ever. Targeted strategies are crucial, policy makers need to tailor legislation and consider specific circumstances and needs in different parts of society, while health care providers should consider identifying patients at higher risk of fatality from stroke,\" says Sunnerhagen. \"By addressing disparities, we will not only support the principles of health equity, but also have the opportunity to significantly improve overall public health,\" she concludes.

Some have even said that widespread use of the drugs could lead to , as poor health imposes significant economic costs. But many people who have started using these medicines aren't obese and turned to them for their short-term effects. If patients stop taking the medicine, they will likely gain back much of the weight that they lost, especially without careful changes to their diet and exercise, NPR reported. One study released earlier this month suggested that Ozempic and Wegovy users could minimize that weight gain by gradually weaning themselves off of the drugs instead of quitting suddenly. But the single study used a small sample size, indicating that more research is needed to confirm the approach, . Besides drugmakers like Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, food company Nestlé has also gotten in on the weight loss frenzy. The company said last week, that , a new frozen food brand from Nestlé, will offer small-portioned meals designed for GLP-1 users starting later this year. Read the original article on",

        "content": "Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United. Coach John Herdman said Laryea will travel with the MLS team for Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia but won’t take the field until Saturday. With two away games this week, Toronto plans to stay south of the border after the mid-week game. Laryea, one of Toronto’s designated players along with Italian stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, underwent surgery March 23 in London, England. At the time, his recovery time was said to be three months. Herdman said Laryea won’t be on the active roster for the Philadelphia game. “The expectation is Richie will play minutes against D.C. United,” Herdman said after training Monday. “That’s been the plan, so this week he’s ramping up. He’ll hit all his sort of final check boxes and put a real intense training week in but will travel with the team so he’s ready to go against D.C.” The 29-year-old Laryea and TFC captain Jonathan Osorio were included Monday in Jesse Marsch’s first roster selection as Canada coach for friendlies June 6 and 9 against the Netherlands and France. “I’m proud for those lads,” said Herdman, who stepped down in August as Canada coach to take over Toronto. “I know what it means to them to represent their country. “Richie’s had a tough run so I’m pleased Jesse put the trust in him, because he’s a guy who loves playing for Canada. He gives his everything and I’ve seen him reach special levels in that Canadian jersey. While he plays in MLS, when he plays for Canada he’s able to show he’s got world-class ability. And I’d say the same for Osorio.” While Toronto does not have any games scheduled while Laryea and Osorio are away for the friendlies, Herdman will feel the pain during Copa America, which runs June 20 to July 24. “(Copa America) comes at time for us in June where you’d love to have had that full squad available,” he said. “But having been the guy that took players away from MLS clubs and not worry too much about it, being on the other end you’ve just got to pat these boys on the back and wish them all the best.” Laryea, who has 48 caps, last played for Canada in November’s CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal series against Jamaica. Osorio has 71 caps. Rookie wingback Tyrese Spicer, who came off in the 58th minute of Saturday’s 4-3 loss to visiting FC Cincinnati, is questionable for Wednesday’s game with a gastrointestinal issue. “We’re just learning whether it’s muscular or something different,” Herdman said. Forward Prince Owusu is being monitored for a tight calf. Midfielder Brandon Servania (knee) and defender Shane O’Neil (thigh) remain on the injured list. Bernardeschi returns this week after missing the Cincinnati game due to yellow card accumulation. Toronto (7-7-1) goes into mid-week play in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, two places and four points ahead of Philadelphia (4-4-6). TFC has won just one of its last four league matches (1-0-3). But it has won seven of its last 10 (7-3-0) in all competitions.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.
