        "content": "PERTH, Australia — In an industry first, Rio Tinto and BHP will collaborate on the testing of large battery-electric haul truck technology in the Pilbara, Western Australia, to accelerate the potential for its future deployment. The two companies will work with manufacturers Caterpillar and Komatsu to conduct independent trials of their battery-electric haul trucks, including testing of battery, static and dynamic charging systems, to assess performance and productivity in the Pilbara environment. The collaboration reflects the individual commitments made from BHP, Rio Tinto, Komatsu and Caterpillar to support Rio Tinto and BHP’s shared ambition of net zero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of the collaboration, two Cat 793 haul trucks will be trialled from the second half of 2024, and two Komatsu 930 haul trucks tested from 2026 at mine sites in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Caterpillar and Komatsu will each provide one truck each to both BHP and Rio Tinto for these trials. BHP will trial the Caterpillar trucks, while Rio Tinto will trial the Komatsu trucks. Outcomes of the trials will be shared between BHP and Rio Tinto. These trials represent the first stage of battery-electric haul truck testing at BHP and Rio Tinto’s Pilbara operations. Ongoing testing, development and refinement of truck and battery design is anticipated with each manufacturer. This will inform the approach for testing a larger number of haul trucks and the potential deployment of battery-electric haul truck fleets into each company’s operations. Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Simon Trott said: “This collaboration brings together two leading global miners with two of the world’s biggest manufacturers of haul trucks to work on solving the critical challenge of zero-emissions haulage. “There is no clear path to net zero without zero-emissions haulage, so it’s important that we work together to get there as quickly and efficiently as we can. Testing two types of battery-electric haul trucks in Pilbara conditions will provide better data, and by combining our efforts with BHP we will accelerate learning. “As we work to repower our Pilbara operations with renewable energy, collaborations like this move us closer to solving the shared challenge of decarbonising our operations, and meeting our net zero commitments.” BHP President Australia Geraldine Slattery said: “Operational decarbonisation relies on breakthroughs in technology and partnerships like this will help drive our industry forward. We are thrilled to work with Rio Tinto, Caterpillar and Komatsu on these trials. “Replacing diesel as a fuel source requires us to develop a whole new operational ecosystem to surround the fleet. We need to address the way we plan our mines, operate our haulage networks, and consider the additional safety and operational considerations that these changes will bring. This is why trials are so critical to our success as we seek to test and learn how these new technologies will work in practice and integrate into our mines. “We’ve already seen a step-change reduction in Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse gas emissions through switching some of our supply to renewable electricity, and we are looking to build on that progress through development of battery-electric technology to reduce diesel usage across our operations.” Note to editors In 2021, Rio Tinto and BHP worked with both Caterpillar and Komatsu to support the development and validation of their prototype battery-electric haul trucks. The trucks included in these trials are based on these prototypes. Carbon emissions from diesel consumption in our mining equipment and rail fleet accounted for 12% of Rio Tinto’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2023. Carbon emissions from the combustion of diesel accounted for around 40% of BHP’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2020. Press release from Rio Tinto .

        "description": "The airline entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and has a five-year restructuring plan.",
        "content": "GOL Linhas Aéreas of Brazil is working on its exit from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and earlier today announced a five-year recovery plan. is a low-cost carrier in Brazil that operates a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, one of several airlines worldwide to do so. It is the second Brazilian airline to enter the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy process in recent years and hopes to exit soon. According to a report today from , the airline will receive more than $1 billion in capital injections. Earlier today, GOL revealed its 5-Year Financial Plan to restructure and put the airline back on its feet. The plan outlines that by 2026, GOL hopes to return to its pre-pandemic capacity. Additionally, the airline aims to expand its network domestically and internationally, something that already happened last week through the announcement of a codeshare with Azul Linhas Aéreas on some routes. By 2029, GOL expects to have 169 planes in its fleet, a net increase of 31 aircraft based on the current fleet. In the coming years, many aircraft will be retired, and GOL will modernize its fleet. The airline's order book currently has 88 planes, 63 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 25 Boeing 737 MAX 10s (which have not been certified). A significant portion of GOL's five-year plan is to inject $1.5 billion in capital by issuing new shares and refinancing nearly $2 billion of its debt. After the new plan was announced, shares in Brazil dropped up to 3.5%, and GOL said there was a significant chance its shares would hit \"minimal value upon emergence\" from bankruptcy. \"We are pleased to reach another important milestone in our financial restructuring process. Since the beginning of this process, GOL has continued to operate without interruptions, demonstrating solidity in executing our commercial strategy and cost management. We have successfully renegotiated agreements with our lessors for most of our aircraft and are investing in our engines and expanding our operational fleet.\" - Celso Ferrer, Chief Executive Officer, GOL Linhas Aéreas Last week, GOL and Azul Linhas Aéreas took a step that fed rumors of a merger. The airlines announced a codeshare agreement to expand their domestic networks. Their respective codes will only be placed on routes operated by one of the airlines. According to Azul's president, Abhi Shah, this creates more than 2,700 one-stop connection opportunities. Brazil only has three major players in the domestic market: GOL, Azul, and LATAM Brasil (formerly TAM). Between GOL and Azul, the two have 52% of seats available in May. Two big airlines joining forces in Brazil is not standard and feeds the rumors that Azul is trying to purchase GOL and merge the two airlines. Though neither airline has openly discussed the merger, Azul's CEO, John Rodgerson, has been straightforward about the airline's interest in consolidating the Brazilian market. When LATAM went through its Chapter 11 process, there were plenty of rumors that it would merge with Azul.",

        "description": "The dog stepped in when the owner couldn't move after he fell and obstructed his breathing.",
        "content": "A day after a dog was adopted from a New Mexico animal shelter, the employees received an unexpected call from the person who adopted the canine. Instead of potentially bad news shelters often get about adopters changing their minds about the pet they brought home, Andrew Budek-Schmeisser wanted to share nothing but praise for the dog who saved his life. Budek-Schmeisser adopted Peanut on March 9 from the Animal Welfare Department after a friend suggested getting a dog tall enough for him to lean on. He has a service dog, but a larger, more sturdy dog would help him as he has difficulty walking. He told that he has a number of illnesses, including cancer and heart problems, and his walking is shaky. The next day after bringing Peanut home, Budek-Schmeisser was outside getting to know the Great Dane and pit mix when he fell and hit his head, obstructing his airway. Peanut immediately stepped in to help. \"I couldn't do anything about it, but Peanut could,\" he said. \"Peanut cleared my airway, and when I was breathing well enough again, he sat me up. He and another dog helped move me to a chair where I could recover.\" Budek-Schmeisser assumes that Peanut and his service dog, Belle, communicated with each other during the incident. Belle is a wolf hybrid, so she doesn't have the strength and height Peanut possesses, he explained. Peanut cleared his airway and got him into a position to breathe again. Then, the two dogs helped move him to a chair. Peanut sat with him, his head against Budek-Schmeisser's chest, making sure he was still breathing and not going to fall again. \"I would not have expected a dog to understand within 24 hours what to do or to have the initiative to do what was necessary,\" he said. \"When I realized what he was doing, I had to put my life and future into his hands, I had to trust him.\" Between that incident and learning the ropes from Belle, Peanut stays by his side constantly. Peanut forgoes what he wants to do, which is chasing lizards, and instead always focuses on keeping Budek-Schmeisser safe. Budek-Schmeisser's biggest takeaway from this incredible moment was not that his life was saved. Instead, Budek-Schmeisser reflected on the fact Peanut waited in a crowded for five months, and instead of giving up, the shelter kept him and saw he could make a difference in someone's life. \"Many dogs and cats waiting out there in shelters that can make a difference in people's lives. All they need is an opportunity,\" he said. \"Healing may come on four paws.\" The shelter was touched to hear about the incredible rescue, which further proves that adopting animals is a win-win for everyone involved. \"A faithful companion is gained, a friendship is formed and a life is saved,\" marketing manager Desiree Cawley told . \"In this circumstance, they both saved each other.\" The Animal Welfare Department currently houses over 700 pets patiently waiting for their forever homes. Cawley said the adoption fee is waived for all pets at the city shelters, including spay or neuter, microchip, I.D. tag, and vaccinations. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 6.3 million pets enter U.S. shelters each year, an average of 17,260 a day. The number of dogs and cats taken in by pet shelters hit 46,807 during January 2023, an increase of 1,744 compared with January 2022, the 24Pet Shelter Watch Report found. Around 920,000 surrendered animals are euthanized every year. Shelters are striving to minimize euthanasia rates by promoting adoption campaigns, spaying and neutering programs, and behavior rehabilitation.

        "description": "They came for 'Jaws' — and got more than a mouthful.",
        "content": "A theater in Beverly, Massachusetts, is apologizing to patrons who attended a screening of “Jaws” over the weekend, after star Richard Dreyfuss allegedly made comments many patrons considered to be sexist and homophobic. The Cabot Theater hosted “An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening,” where attendees were likely fans of the Steven Spielberg classic, hoping for anecdotes about the film. However, Dreyfuss, 76, reportedly went on a rogue rant that ranged from talking about Barbra Streisand, to his opinions on transgender youth and gender affirmation, as well as the Academy Awards’ inclusivity rules. Attendees took to social media to express their disappointment. “We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic rant,” one person commented on The Cabot’s recent Facebook post . “Richard Dreyfuss is an embarrassment to society. I walked out tonight because of his small minded bigoted view of women and choice,” another wrote. One commenter shared that the audience thought the event would be “a light, fun evening listening to stories and anecdotes about RD’s time on the Vineyard making Jaws.” They wrote, “This was disgusting. How could the Cabot not have vetted his act better. Apparently (I found out too late), he has a reputation for spewing this kind of racist, homophobic, misogynistic bullcrap...We did NOT get what we paid for.” The venue sent out an apology email to attendees and expressed their regret in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter . “We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film ‘Jaws’ at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons,” a representative wrote. “We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons.” “We are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.” The Post has reached out to representatives for Dreyfuss for comment.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — A former business associate of James Biden has agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud Medicare of $51 million through a lab-testing company linked to the first brother. Keaton Langston, 39, admitted to using pharmacies, durable medical equipment companies and a laboratory in which he had a financial interest to bill for unnecessary tests and orders, the Justice Department disclosed last week in court filings. James Biden, 75, has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing and has sought to distance himself from Langston, whose father Joey Langston also was associated with the first brother. Keaton Langston founded Fountain Health, a lab company, in May 2017 and offered its services to rural hospital operator Americore Health, which later went bankrupt. Records show James Biden was involved with Fountain Health in 2017 before connecting with Americore, which provided him in $600,000 in loans in 2018 as he allegedly vowed to use his political connections to secure foreign investors . James passed $200,000 of the funds to Joe Biden in an alleged loan repayment. Shortly after the lab firm launched, Joey Langston emailed James Biden and his son Keaton and three others on July 12, 2017, about an upcoming “meeting for Fountain Health partners,” Politico reported in February. “Jim will report to the group the results of his discussions earlier today with a contact at [Blue Cross Blue Shield],” the elder Langston wrote. “There will also be discussion about how to proceed with the Union contacts that have been made by Jim and Keaton, within the last two weeks.” Paul Fishman, an attorney for James Biden, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but previously said his client “conducted himself ethically and honorably in all his business dealings.” Keaton Langston agreed in September to repay Americore $240,000 in a civil settlement. James Biden agreed in 2022 to repay Americore $350,000 . The Bidens and the Langstons have been linked financially for years. The elder Langston hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden when he was a senator, ProPublica reported . Joey Langston also loaned James Biden $800,000 , with most of the installments coming toward the end of the Obama-Biden administration in 2016, and ended up only being repaid $400,000 of the amount, he told House impeachment investigators in February. The wealthy Mississippi lawyer pleaded guilty in 2008 and was sentenced to three years in federal prison for being part of a plot to bribe a judge in an asbestos legal fees dispute. He was seeking to overturn his conviction when he made loans to the then-vice president’s son. Joey Langston’s alleged co-conspirator in the bribes case, attorney Dickie Scruggs, was involved in a second prosecution for attempting to bribe a different judge. James Biden was wiretapped by the FBI in 2007 as part of its investigation of the second bribery case, the Washington Post reported in December. James was in talks at the time with Scruggs and conspirator Tim Balducci about setting up a law firm that would have employed himself, his nephew Hunter Biden and James’ wife Sara. Then-Sen. Biden went from an opponent of federal legislation to sanction tobacco companies for lying about the addictiveness of cigarettes to a supporter after Scruggs — who planned a multibillion-dollar lawsuit — paid James Biden’s lobbying firm $100,000 in 1998, the Washington Post reported. “I probably wouldn’t have hired him if he wasn’t the senator’s brother,” Scruggs told the paper. Morning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Scruggs also flew Joe Biden to a fundraiser on his private plane, the Washington Post reported. Joe Biden has consistently claimed he “never” discussed business with his son or brother and said in December and again in March that he “did not” interact with their partners, including foreign associates in countries where he held sway as vice president. Evidence including photos, emails and witness statements indicate that Biden actually interacted with his son and brother’s associates from two Chinese government-linked business ventures and their patrons from Kazakhstan , Mexico , Russia and Ukraine . James Biden was a partner with first son Hunter in many ventures and allegedly wasn’t always coy about the angle he was pushing to investors. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden,” James allegedly said in the early 2000s as he and Hunter were in the process of acquiring investment bank Paradigm , according to a 2021 book by Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger.",

        "description": "After his French Open first round exit Rafael Nadal has indicated he will not be playing at Wimbledon, focusing instead on a return to Paris for the Olympics.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has pledged to carry on playing as long as he is enjoying his tennis, despite a first round exit at Roland Garros at the slam he made his own, but strongly hinted he will not be playing at Wimbledon this year. Nadal said the rigours of switching to grass for the London showpiece, then reverting to clay for the Paris Olympics, would probably be too demanding given his age and recent injury issues. The 22-time grand slam champion lost in straight sets to No.4 Alexander Zverev on Monday - but showed enough flashes of brilliance to suggest he would have beaten most opponents. Having only recently returned from a near 18-month absence that has encouraged him to keep going - and to target more gold. Nadal won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and doubles gold at Rio 2016. That this year's tennis tournament will be on his favourite court, where he won 14 French Open singles titles, has further tempted him. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. However, that does mean Wimbledon, where he won in 2008 and 2010, is likely to be sacrificed. He has only competed in SW19 once in the last four years - in 2022 when he had to withdraw through injury ahead of his semi-final with Nick Kyrgios. \"It looks difficult, honestly, to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" said Nadal. \"I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, [but] I don't think it's a positive idea right now. \"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\" Nadal, 38 next week, missed most of 2023 with a hip problem and this year's comeback was hampered by a muscle tear, then a series of minor issues affected his Paris preparation. \"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal added. \"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. \"Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. My main goal now is to play the Olympics.\" Longer term, sounding much like his old friend and rival Andy Murray who also lost in the first round in Paris, he said he wanted to carry on playing while he was healthy and having fun. And even in defeat on the clay where he had so rarely lost before, he had fun. \"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"",

        "content": "Watch the trailer for NCIS' Ducky tribute episode WARNING: This article contains spoilers from NCIS. NCIS season 22 will follow-up on that cliffhanger ending which put Jimmy and Jessica’s relationship in jeopardy. When season 21 ended earlier this month, Jessica Knight (played by Katrina Law) was offered a promotion working as the new REACT chief training officer at Camp Pendleton. This meant that she would have to relocate to the other side of the country and following a particularly terrifying mission, she decided to take it. Her relationship with Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen) has been a little shaky as of late and this could be the final nail in the coffin if they decide long distance won’t work for them. And now a CBS viewer has shared that this could open a door for Jimmy to get himself a new girlfriend. Read more: NCIS season 22 could see Agent Sam Hanna take over from Jessica Knight NCIS season 22 to see Jimmy find ‘someone else’ as fan predicts end of him and Jessica. (Image: CBS) Sharing their theory with the Reddit community, they wrote: “I believe that Palmer will find someone elsewhere at the office, and Jess comes back on a case to find out Palmer moved on.” They went on to add that Jessica would be “distraught” at the thought of Jimmy falling in love with someone else “but would come to accept it” if she did choose to return. If season 22 is going to start with Jessica leaving the team, then her spot as an agent would need to be filled, meaning a potential new cast member. Jessica’s particular role has always been filled in by a feisty female agent as well, from Caitlin “Kate” Todd (Sasha Alexander) and Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), to Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham).

Even though this theory is plausible, not everyone on Reddit seemed to be on board with the idea. In response, a fellow viewer wrote: “First NO Jess will not leave all is a plot and cliffhanger out of storyline. “Somewhere Nick will ask her ‘Are you sure? You got us and you have a family and [are] a step-mum to Victoria!’ And no Jimmy will not find someone else like people think!” Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Series 21 was the shortest outing yet for the police procedural with just 10 episodes thanks to the Hollywood actors and writers’ strikes. Season 22, however, is expected to consist of around 24 episodes, which is roughly how long each NCIS series lasts for. NCIS is available to watch on CBS and Disney+.

        "content": "fans are convinced they have worked out who Sarah Barlow will fall into bed with next on the cobbles. Over the past years, the blonde bombshell’s (played by Tina O’Brien) love life has been following her separation from her husband Adam Barlow. The couple separated after she dated and fell pregnant with TV bad boy Damon Hay (Ciaran Griffiths) behind his back. After he discovered her infidelity, the couple separated with the solicitor demanding a divorce. Since then, she has had an on-off relationship with Gary Windass behind his partner Maria Connor’s back. But viewers believe the TV favourite may have set her eyes on another resident in the village. During Monday’s visit (May 27) to the ITV cobbles, Sarah was caught red-handed trying to plant evidence that could get her daughter Bethany Platt’s assailant arrested for her murder. At the start of the episode, Nathan Curtis (Chris Harper) drove past the journalist, breaking her restraining order on him. But the builder argued that he didn’t break her order because he believed she still lived in London. When Bethany reported him to the police, PC Craig Tinker confirmed that there was nothing they could do. It was at this point that Sarah decided to take matters into her own hands when she found one of Lauren’s bobbles in the Barlow family home, wrapped in strands of her hair. As she stormed over to the builder’s yard, the doting mum was caught red handed by new detective Kit Green moments before she hid the evidence. Thankfully, the newcomer was kind to the heartbroken mum and let her off with a warning as they had a heart-to-heart in his car. Before he let her go, he swiped the incriminating evidence as she insisted that Nathan was responsible for Lauren’s murder. Later on in the episode, Sarah checked in on her daughter, but her day quickly turned around for the better. Just as Sarah brought Bethany in for a comforting hug, her boyfriend Daniel Osbourne announced that her assailant had been arrested and taken away in handcuffs. It was at this point that fans flooded to X – formerly known as Twitter – to share their suspicions online. Many are convinced that Sarah will fall in love with the hunky new detective on the street in a matter of days. One user penned: “How long till Sarah starts making her bedroom eyes at Bernie’s son [cry0laughing emoji] #Corrie.” Another agreed: “I loved Adam/ Sarah together but... I like Kit & Sarah together... #corrie.” A third echoed: “Sarah will end up bedding Kit... I can sense it #Corrie” as a fourth chimed in with: “Is this the start of Sarah and the copper getting it on keep on watching [shifty eyes emoji, cry-laughing emoji] #corrie.”",

        "content": "Clothes dipped in toxic have been sent to inmates, says a shock report into a prisoner’s death. Burglar Jamie Tate, 33, was found dead at Strangeways in Manchester in March 2021, after allegedly being supplied with some of the socks. The report by Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Sue McAllister said: “Intelligence suggested prisoners were having clothes sent into them by friends and family that had been soaked in psychoactive substances and then smoking the ripped-up fabric.” A fellow inmate had told his mum to dissolve 50mg fentanyl tablets – an opiate painkiller – in water and soak socks in it. He then gave some to Tate. The report added: “The inmate distributed it on the wing and it had led to prisoners collapsing.” Prison bosses have been warned by Ms McAllister: “More needs to be done to reduce both the supply of, and demand for, psychoactive substances.” A e for allowing inmates to get rid of their most irritating or troublemaking cellmates. The Category B prison, meaning its home to highly dangerous prisoners for whom an escape must be made very difficult, allows fellow cons to kick out misbehaving roommates by way of a vote cast during regular \"wing meetings\". Glendon Prison, in Buckinghamshire, generally only accepts well-behaved cons from other jails. The inmates must then adhere to strict rules and if they fail to do that they can be exiled from the place by their peers, If booted out, they are made to return to the jail they originally came from.",

Two acts from each semi-final this week will make it through to Sunday's grand final – with one decided from a public vote and the second decided by the judges. Ant's wife Anne-Marie Corbett gave birth to their son Wilder Patrick last Tuesday, and the showbiz legend made an allusion to his first child on stage tonight. Dec started reading off a checklist of items supposedly needed for BGT, which included nappies and other baby essentials, before Ant cut in laughing: \"No that's my list!\" He also shared a bit of banter with the panel of judges after Simon paid tribute to the new dad, saying: \"Can i just say congratulations to you Ant, I really am happy for you.\" The TV presenter replied: \"Thank you. thank you very much. Thank you for your lovely gift. Judges - still waiting on yours!\" Dec is said to have been coaching his co-host and best friend through being a dad for the first time.

        "content": "Smartphone ban for kids 'worth considering' - MPs 3 days ago Nathan Standley , Vanessa Clarke Share BBC / Ann Gannon Schoolboy Jasper says having social media is important for 'finding people you can connect with' The next government should consider proposals to ban smartphones for under-16s within its first year, a committee of MPs has said. The Education Select Committee report outlined some of the \"serious dangers\" posed to children online. Government guidance to bar phone use in schools in England earlier this year prompted a debate on how much screen time children should be having. But children's charity the NSPCC said that so far, the voices of the young people themselves had been \"glaringly absent\" from it. The report, published on Saturday, said the risks of increased screen time for children and young people significantly outweighed its benefits. Committee chairman Robin Walker said its inquiry had heard \"shocking statistics on the extent of the damage being done to under-18s\". The report found there had been a significant rise in screen time in recent years, with one in four children now using their phone in a manner resembling behavioural addiction. The report said almost all children own a phone by the age of 12, and that 79% had encountered violent pornography before the age of 18. It said the Online Safety Act, which puts responsibility on social media firms to protect children from some legal - but harmful - material, would provide some protection, but not until the law was fully implemented in 2026. The committee says that without urgent action, more children could be put in harm's way. It recommended the next government should work with the regulator, Ofcom, to... Nathan Standley",

Scottish leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, accused the SNP and Conservative governments either side of the border of \"neglecting\" services and turning parts of the UK into \"dental deserts\". UK leader Sir Ed Davey joined him at a campaign event in North Queensferry, and predicted the Lib Dems would make gains in Scotland and become the UK's third largest party. He said his party would not form a coalition with the Conservatives, but did not rule out an agreement with Labour. \"There are lots of hypotheticals but I'm going to focus on the campaign,\" Sir Ed told BBC Scotland News. Sir Ed said electing Lib Dem MPs would help to \"send a message\" to the SNP government, who he accused of \"failing\" on NHS dentistry. Although he acknowledged dentistry was a devolved issue, the party leader said UK-wide measures, such as cutting VAT on children's toothbrushes and toothpaste, would have an impact in Scotland. He told BBC Scotland News the NHS was the biggest issue for voters north of the border. \"It is things like GPs and dentists and hospital times and cancer waiting times,\" Sir Ed said. \"And then issues like sewage and the state of the economy. \"This is an election...

        "content": "What is the Tory national service plan and how might it work? 13 hours ago Sean Seddon , BBC News Share Reuters The Conservatives have set out a plan to require 18-year-olds take part in a form of national service if the party wins the general election on 4 July. Rishi Sunak said the scheme would promote a \"shared sense of purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country\". Labour has labelled the plan a \"gimmick\" and other parties have criticised the government for its record on cutting troop numbers. However, there is still much we do not know about how it would work. Here is the detail we have so far. What is the national service scheme? The proposed new scheme would not be conscription, where people are legally required to join the armed forces for a period. But it would compel people by law to complete a community programme over a 12-month period, or enrol in a year-long military training scheme, when they turn 18. The name is taken from the mandatory military training British men aged 17-21 had to undertake between 1949 and 1960. Then, national service meant 18 months of military training and spending four years on a reserve list, meaning they could be called up to fight at short notice. The scheme being proposed now would not force anyone to do military training, Home Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC. It would be made up of two broad streams for 18-year-olds to choose from: Community volunteering: Spending one weekend every month - which equates to 25 days over a 12-month period - volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance, search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure Spending one weekend every month - which equates to 25 days over a 12-month period - volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance, search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure...

The Conservatives have pledged that, if they win the general election, 18-year-olds will have to take part in a scheme involving military or non-military service. Mr Cleverly said it would \"address the fragmentation in society\" - but added that sending people to jail for not taking part was not being proposed.

Mr Cleverly told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the move was about \"coming together\". \"Too many young people are living in their own bubble, whether that's a digital bubble or a social bubble. \"We want to get back to a situation where young people are mixing with people - in different areas, different economic groups, different religions - to try and find a way of addressing the kind of fragmentation that we see too much of,\" he said. The Conservatives say the scheme would involve 30,000 selective military placements where \"the brightest and best\" volunteers would get involved in cyber security, logistics, or civil response operations full-time for a year.

The SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats held events across the country in the early stages of the campaign. John Swinney, Anas Sarwar, Douglas and Alex Cole-Hamilton have 41 days to make their case to voters before they head to the polls. The vote will take place on 4 July after prime minister Rishi Sunak's surprise announcement earlier this week. The first minister used his event in Glenrothes, Fife, to hone in on the SNP's anti-austerity message. He accused the Conservatives of presiding over a \"punishing and damaging process\" of reduced public spending, adding only his party could exert enough influence at Westminster to ensure the policy is reversed. However, Mr Swinney denied his handling of the Michael Matheson expenses scandal threatened to overshadow his campaign. The first minister took aim at the makeup disciplinary panel that recommended a 27-day suspension after the former health secretary racked up an £11,000 charge on a parliamentary iPad during a family holiday.

        "content": "oozes confidence when she's on stage and has millions of fans around the world who look up to her. What's more, the award-winning singer's life wasn't always this way, and her personality has changed a lot since her early years too. During a rare interview, her mom, Tina Knowles, gave an insight into what Beyoncé was like as a child, making the heartbreaking revelation that she was bullied for a while. Tina also disclosed that the Texas Hold 'Em hitmaker was incredibly shy as a child. The 70-year-old told Vogue: \"Beyoncé, she was very shy and she got bullied a bit, but the day that she stood up for someone—she didn't stand up for herself she stood up for them. I'm getting emotional talking about it. I was just, I couldn't have been more proud of her.\" Tina also spoke about her other \"girls\", daughter Solange and Kelly Rowland, who she often refers to as her third daughter. She said: \"Solange, was her signing a petition in school, she was only in, like, fifth grade and she was out getting petitions signed. So she's always been an activist. \"And Kelly was always this kid that just tried to protect everybody. I have a memory of her with her best friend Barbara and her being a mediator and just being this little peacemaker.\" Tina adores her family and recently gave an insight into her grandchildren's personalities too. During a chat with E! News, she gave a rare insight into the lives of Beyoncé's twins Rumi and Sir, six, who unlike their sister Blue Ivy, 12, have kept a lower profile in their young lives so far. She said: \"Rumi is amazing—an amazing artist, painter, and creator.\" Reflecting on the twins' flourishing creativity, Tina mused, \"How could they be anything else growing up in that environment?\" She emphasized that their family life is steeped in discussions about creativity and fashion, nurturing their innate talents from a very young age. Sir, on the other hand, shares more similarities with his father, Jay-Z. \"Sir is very quiet,\" Tina noted, revealing that he gravitates more towards numbers than fashion. \"He does all of the numbers stuff, so he's not into fashion as much,\" she explained, but quickly added that Sir is \"very, very smart,\" hinting at the diverse talents the twins possess. Beyoncé shares her three children with husband Jay-Z. Despite being one of the most famous couples, they are notoriously private when it comes to their personal lives. However, in the last year, the family have been in the news more and more thanks to Beyoncé's numerous projects, from her Renaissance World Tour - which saw daughter Blue step into the spotlight and join her mom on stage - to the release of her new country music album, Cowboy Carter. During the same interview, Tina spoke of her pride for Beyoncé stepping into the country music scene, which saw her recently make history as the first Black woman to top the country charts. \"We're from Texas,\" Tina explained. \"We’ve been part of that culture for a long time, and I was very excited about it.\" She described Cowboy Carter as a \"nice history lesson\" for fans, applauding Beyoncé’s ability to educate subtly through her music. \"She has this way of doing things subtly but educating, and so I’m really proud of that,\" Tina shared.

        "content": "Indigenous leaders were in Ottawa on Monday to call on the federal government to follow through on a commitment to fund a new hospital in Moosonee, along Ontario's James Bay coast. They say the federal government promised to set aside $1.3 billion to help build the hospital, but that money wasn't included in the last federal budget. The hospital would replace a 74-year-old facility in neighbouring Moose Factory, which is Canada's oldest, non-renovated hospital. \"It's not just a building, it is a symbol of the enduring colonial legacy our people are forced to confront daily,\" said Lynne Innes, CEO of the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority, which runs health-care services in the region. The Moose Factory hospital was built in 1950 as a tuberculosis sanitorium, where children who were taken from their home communities were isolated from their families and culture. Built in 1950, the Weeneebayko hospital in Moose Factory is set to be replaced by a new regional James Bay hospital currently under construction in Moosonee. (Erik White/CBC) Because Moose Factory is on an island, patients have to be transported by helicopter to receive care. Dr. Elaine Innes, the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority's chief of staff, said patients from James Bay communities often have to travel south to Kingston, Ont., for care. \"We struggle with providing specialty services,\" she said. \"We can no longer provide obstetrical care because we no longer have the health human resources.\" James Bay health authority says 'huge surprise' in federal budget could halt hospital construction New Moosonee hospital to replace 74 year old facility in Moose Factory Moose Cree First Nation Chief Peter Wesley extended an invitation for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to visit Moose Factory and see the state of the hospital. \"There's no other hospital where you walk down the hallway and the roof is caving in,\" Wesley said. \"This would not be tolerated in any other urban community. This would not be tolerated in Ottawa. This would not be tolerated in Toronto, or Sudbury. Why do we have to tolerate it as First Nations people?\" National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak says that in 2007, the federal government committed to help fund a new hospital in Moosonee. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) Assembly of First Nations National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak thanked the provincial government for its support on the Moosonee hospital project, but said the federal government has fallen short. \"Now we need the feds to come back to the table,\" she said. Woodhouse Nepinak and others noted that the federal government agreed to support the new hospital in 2007, when plans were first unveiled. 'I'm not walking away from that commitment' Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu previously said in the House of Commons that she remains committed to the project. \"I'm not walking away from that commitment and we will get that hospital built,\" Hajdu said. In an email to CBC News, Indigenous Services Canada spokesperson Ryan Tyndall said the federal government's 2018 budget included $158.4 million for the construction of the hospital. But Tyndall added that health care is a provincial responsibility. He said the federal government has \"significantly increased\" health transfers to the provinces to support them in delivering health care. In Ontario, those transfers went from $13.1 billion in 2015 to $20.3 billion in 2024.",

        "content": "The Esan South East Local Government Council of Edo State, led by Hon. Louis Imhandegbelo has been given kudos for being the first local government council in the state to pay the new minimum wage of N70,000 to workers. The council’s implimentation of the new minimum wage has drawn widespread jubilations across the length and breadth of the local government area. The council workers were seen singing and dancing on Monday at Ubiaja, the council headquarters, praising governor Godwin Obaseki soon after receiving the month of May salaries. Some of them were said to have been dumbfounded on receiving the unexpected bank alerts reflecting the newly established N70,000 minimum wage in Edo State from their various banks. Governor Godwin Obaseki in his speech on May 1st, 2024, to mark this year’s workers day announced N70,000 new minimum wage for Edo State workers which was paid this month by the state government. The development has garnered accolades both within and beyond the borders of Nigeria. The chairman of Esan South East Local Government Council, Louis Imhandegbelo while expressing his gratitude to Governor Godwin Obaseki said, “today, May 27, 2024, my council has paid the new minimum wage to workers and praises should go to God and the governor who believed that the workers were no longer getting things easy since the removal of fuel subsidy by the Federal government”. “As you can see, upon receiving their May salaries, which reflected the new wage structure, the workers are very happy and are jubilating, I asked them to continue to pray for the governor to end his tenure successfully”. Hon. Imhandegbelo however affirmed his commitment to fostering policies that enhance workers satisfaction, promote community development, and bring joy to the people of Esan South East.",

        "content": "The Moroccan Ambassador to Ghana, Her, Excellency Ambassador Imane Ouaadil on 25th May 2024 led the African Group of Ambassadors in Ghana to celebrate this year’s African Union Day. The event also brought together dignitaries and prominent personalities in the country to witness the display and exhibition of the various African tradition, culture, and dishes. Addressing dignitaries and guests at the event, Ambassador Imane Ouaadil said “This year’s celebration acquires particular historical significance –the 61stAnniversary Celebration of the Founding of our continental organization under the theme Educate an African fit for the 21st Century: Building resilient education systems for increased access to inclusive, lifelong, quality, and relevant learning in Africa.” According her Commitment to education has marked the continent’s progress since the 1960s era of independence. “Now more than ever, this resolve must transform Africa into the world’s powerhouse for the 21st century. The AU Year of Education is a unique opportunity to recommit member states to achieving the Continental Strategy for Education in Africa, Agenda 2030 and SDG 4, as well as Agenda 2063. Ambassador Imane Ouaadil emphasized that “If knowledge is power, then education is the key to unlocking that power. Education is now front and center of the development debate – and with good reason. Today, 40% of all Africans are under 15. Another 100 million children will be born here by 2050. Yet, of the 1 million Africans entering the labour market every month, fewer than 25% find a job in the formal economy. This demographic dividend should offer a tremendous opportunity for Africa to build a valuable base of human capital that will serve as the engine for the economic transformation of our continent.” She noted that “The time has never been more auspicious to focus on education, particularly in science, technology and mathematics. The burgeoning youth population of Africa will drive the growth and prosperity of the continent into the next generation, but only if we equip them to do so.” “Allow me use this opportunity to express our profound gratitude and appreciation to the Government of Ghana for celebrating this unique day with us. As the Principal Representatives of our respective countries, it is part of our cardinal responsibilities to promote political, economic, and socio-cultural partnerships that will lead to the realisation of mutual benefits.” She added .",

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) By KRISTIE RIEKEN (AP Sports Writer) HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts , students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center . “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center . “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

On Monday (May 27), the RM shared the Pennacky-directed clip for “Groin,” which finds the singer and rapper decked out in a dark Adidas track jacket while dancing and rapping in the streets. The three-minute video arrives on the heels of RM’s second solo album, Right Place, Wrong Person , which was released on Friday (May 24), and topped Billboard ‘s latest weekly new music poll featuring artists in various genres of music. Right Place, Wrong Person brings with it 11 new tracks for fans to enjoy amid BTS’ military obligations. Led by the dream single “Come Back to Me,” the album also features the alternative-based songs “Nuts,” “Heaven,” “LOST!” and more. Overall, the project reflects a “raw and honest presentation of RM’s distinctive sensibility, aesthetics, and beliefs,” per a BigHit news release, and follows the South Korean artist’s 2022 debut album, Indigo , which reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Right Place, Wrong Person includes collaborations with British rapper-singer Little Simz (“Domodachi”) and singer-guitarist Moses Sumney (“Around the World in a Day”). “Come Back to Me” features lyrics by RM, with guest musicians OHHYUK from South Korean band HYUKOH, and guitar and bass from Kuo of Taiwanese band Sunset Rollercoaster, as well as contributions by singer-songwriter JNKYRD and San yawn of Balming Tiger. RM and his BTS bandmates Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook are currently serving in the South Korean military, which mandates an 18-month military enlistment for all able-bodied men by the time they turn 28. A few of the members have pursued various solo projects amid their service, and the full group is planning to reconvene for band activities in 2025. Watch RM’s “Groin” video below.",

        "description": "Larson was trying to run both the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600, but rain delayed the start at Indy and ended the Cup Series races before he could get in the car.",
        "content": "Kyle Larson waves to fans as he leaves the track after the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. Larson was trying to make it to to the NASCAR Cup Series race in Concord, North Carolina in time to race, but rain prevented that from happening. Darron Cummings/Associated Press CONCORD, N.C. — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s quest was to complete – if not win – the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson’s team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane, and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That’s when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. “So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,” Larson said. “I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.” Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson’s focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can’t participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn’t been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting “The Double” was one of the best experiences of his life – right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. “I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream,” Larson said. “I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try ‘The Double’ but if it is I guess it was memorable.” Success.

        "content": "Voting at one of the busiest voting stations in Nelson Mandela Bay proceeded at a snail's pace during the special voting sessions on Monday. At Sherwood NG Kerk, in Gqeberha, the voting station was still packed an hour after the gates closed at 17:00, with close to 200 cars still parked on and outside the premises. For a visibly upset Johan Theron, 59, the \"nightmare\" was too much. \"We spent four-and-a-half hours waiting to vote,\" he said, pointing to his watch. \"This whole process was a nightmare because the people here are pathetic. They don't have their ducks in a row and wasted precious time.\" According to Theron, some voters who arrived when the voting station opened at 09:00 only left around 17:00. He said there were several delays, one of which was a voters' roll not in alphabetical order, leading to a chaotic search for voters' names. \"They tried to search for people's names and went through 79 pages to find it, but were unsuccessful anyway. At one point, the machines were offline, and they just sat there and did nothing.\" READ | Elections 2024: Smooth start to the casting of special votes, says IEC Theron said at 16:00, an hour before the voting station was supposed to close, there were still around 200 people waiting in the queue. \"We registered for special voting, thinking it would go quicker, but not at all. If I had to describe this day in one sentence, I would say it was a waste of time.\" Valerie Theron added: \"We heard that things went better at other voting stations but, at this one, there were too many names on the list that they couldn't find. \"They had three ballot boxes, and only added two more around 14:00.\" For Sonja York, the situation was made worse as her children were waiting for her. She said she had arrived at the voting station around 16:00 and, two hours later, she had still not entered the building. \"I have no choice, but to stay in the queue until my turn because I can't come tomorrow. I'm just worried about how long it will take since my children are at home waiting for me.\" York said she looked forward to voting and having her voice heard, but when it came to \"poor planning\", it did not feel worth it. \"I was at Sunridge [voting station], and it was empty there, but I can't vote there because I live here in Sherwood.\" ROLLING COVERAGE | Elections 2024: Anticipation builds as all stations prep for voters making their mark York said she had parked her car across the road at the shopping complex, thinking she would be back soon. However, she rushed to her car as soon as it became dark otherwise the complex's gate would close, leaving her stranded. \"The long wait was irritating. I have a family and kids at home. I have responsibilities to take care of.\" No party agents were present outside the voting station. News24 was not allowed inside the venue after 17:00. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) reported a smooth start to the casting of special votes on Monday, despite some glitches resulting in voting stations opening late in parts of the country. The first official day of voting inside the country was marred by isolated protests - in the Eastern Cape and parts of Gauteng - and there were reports of voting stations failing to open, but the IEC indicated that only 0.1% of those casting their votes experienced problems doing so. Special votes continue on Tuesday, ahead of the election day for the rest of the country on Wednesday, with polls opening at 07:00.",

        "content": "SHOPPERS have announced a new list of demands as a grocery store threatens to shut down and leave residents in a food desert. Customers are continuing to protest the closure of a Hy-Vee location in Ceder Rapids, Iowa , following the grocer's announcement that it would be coming up with alternatives to ease the transition. A dozen people were seen protesting the closure, which would leave the town in a food desert. Shoppers were holding signs that said \"You deserted us,\" and \"Boycott Hy-vee\" in front of the Oakland Road location. “By educating our entire community of Cedar Rapids we’re hoping more people will show up for those who are directly impacted by the first avenue Hy-Vee closure,” Angelina Ramirez, the vice president of Advocates for Social for Justice, told local ABC affiliate KCRG. Hyvee announced that its 1st avenue store will be one of three that will be shutting down in Iowa. The announcement has left many residents in the are nervous, as they could possibly become a food desert. This occurs when there are no nearby stores for people to get healthy, fresh food. To help shoppers in the area, Hy-Vee announced that it will be providing a shuttle service from the closed location to the nearest location three days a week until September 1 The location will also continue to offer free pharmacy deliveries and free grocery deliveries to those located within a mile radius from the store. However, protesters are still not happy with the change. They have demanded the store stay open until September, pay the local activist to canvas the surrounding area, and guarantee another grocery store will go into the Hy-vee location. As of now, the grocery store has not commented on the group's recent demands. The store will officially shut down on June 23, and the company has released a statement ahead of the closure. \"No business wants to close a location and that certainly includes Hy-Vee,\" a spokesperson for the company wrote. \"Over the past several weeks, we have listened to community leaders and residents about the impact of our store closures After a meeting with the Mayor, Hy-Vee has announced how it could help the community moving forward. \"Unfortunately, these three stores have each been losing significant amounts of money for several years, and they are simply not feasible for us to operate any longer.” Community leaders have applauded Hy-Vee for how it handled the closure. \"Our meeting with community leaders last week identified priorities to ensure residents can continue to access essential services after the store closes,\" Mayor Tiffany O’Donnell said in a statement \"We brought these concerns to our meeting with Hy-Vee, focusing on things like grocery delivery charges, no-cost pharmaceutical deliveries, and partnerships with transportation providers and local food-access services for additional assistance during the transition. \"It was a positive meeting. We will continue to support efforts to address these challenges and meet our community’s needs.” City Manager Jeff Pomeranz also praised the company for its collaborative efforts. \"They focused on supporting our community members during the transition, and the discussion led to several promising solutions,\" Pomeranz said in a statement. \"Hy-Vee also indicated they are working with the property owner to avoid vacancy after the store’s closure and they will not place any use restrictions on the location, which is a positive sign. \"We are encouraged by their cooperation and hope we can continue working with them to ensure a smooth transition for our residents.”",

        "content": "As a basketball player, he was sublime, until slowed by injuries. But he was an iconoclastic, distinct presence off the court as well, in his broadcasting and activism. The announcement Monday that Bill Walton had died at 71 after a lengthy battle with cancer evidently came as no surprise to the NBA community, but to San Diegans who were unaware of his condition, his death was shocking. The lifelong resident — born in La Mesa in 1952 — has been a part of the community’s fabric since the late 1960s, when he emerged as a basketball prodigy at Helix High School. Walton’s hoops prowess continued at UCLA, where he was an all-time college great who won two NCAA titles. As a lanky, 6-foot-11 20-year-old, he had arguably the greatest championship-winning game ever in 1973 against Memphis State — making 21 of 22 shots, scoring 44 points and posting 13 rebounds and seven blocks. When healthy, his prodigious ways continued in the NBA — with Portland and Boston, where he won one NBA title with each team and was the MVP with the Trail Blazers. In his short prime in his mid-20s, he was an absolutely dominant defensive presence with few historic peers, winning reverential praise from Bill Russell, the greatest defender in NBA history. In 1985-86, after finally mostly recovering from chronic foot injuries, he was arguably the best sixth man ever for an all-time great Celtics team. And until the recent emergence of three-time Denver MVP Nikola Jokić, Walton was considered the greatest passing center of all time. When NBA historian Bill Simmons published his sprawling, encyclopedic “The Book of Basketball” in 2009, it was beyond telling that the closing pages featured Simmons traveling to San Diego to meet with Walton and tell him he was one of a handful of superstar players who understood “the secret” of the sport: that for all the focus on individual greatness, an alchemy generated by collective unselfishness was the key to team success. But Walton was also a vivid presence off the basketball court — as an anti-Vietnam War protester while at UCLA, as a quirky but often riveting TV basketball commentator, as a huge fan of bands only starting with the Grateful Dead, and locally as an activist with strong, sometimes controversial takes on San Diego issues, especially those involving his beloved Balboa Park. Alas, Walton is already being remembered in reductive ways. This was the initial headline on The New York Times’ obituary: “ Bill Walton, one of basketball’s most eccentric characters, dies at 71.” Walton deserved far better than having “eccentric” be the sole adjective in the headline about his death in the most powerful publication in the world. Simmons ends his book on a much more appropriate note: his sadness that Walton’s “mangled feet” had so marred not just his NBA career but his post-NBA life. But he took consolation from the fact that Walton had come to peace with all the what-might-have-beens about his career and learned to live with chronic pain. So should we all. Bill Walton was wonderful, special and unique. We offer our condolences to his family and to all those who were close to him. He was — is — will always be — a San Diegan for the ages.",

        "content": "DALLAS — Nicholas Kirton scored 51 runs and Ravinderpal Singh added 41 to help Canada defeat Nepal by 63 runs in a warm-up match Monday ahead of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Kirton slammed four fours and two sixes in his 39-ball innings. Opener Navneet Dhaliwal contributed 32 runs. Nepal, ranked 17th among T20 teams compared to No. 23 for Canada, won the toss and elected to field at the Grande Prairie Cricket Stadium. Canada finished at 183 for seven in its 20 overs and then dismissed Nepal for 120 with three balls remaining. Dillon Heyliger led the Canadian bowling attack with four wickets while Jeremy Gordon and captain Saad Bin Zafar each took two. Nepal was at 57 for one at one point, before batsmen starting falling in quick succession. The Canadians will open play at the same Texas venue Saturday, facing the co-host U.S. in the opener of the tournament that runs through June 29 in the U.S. and West Indies. Earlier this year, Canada lost a three-match one-day international series 3-0 to Nepal before defeating Nepal A 2-1 in another three-game series. Canada is scheduled to face the 15th-ranked Netherlands in a final warm-up Thursday, also in Dallas. The Canadians have been drawn in Group A with No. 1 India, No. 7 Pakistan, No. 11 Ireland and the 19th-ranked U.S. After the Americans, Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men's T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41). The Canadians failed to qualify for the eight previous editions of the T20 World Cup, which has expanded to 20 teams in 2024. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 The Canadian Press",

The city also had a ceremony honoring veterans that afternoon at Powers Park. “It builds pride in our city; it builds pride in our neighborhoods,” first-year Mayor Carmella Mantello said on why they needed to bring it back. “Yes, parades are great, but it’s also what’s behind that parade, and today (it’s a) very very special meaning to really — we hope we do it every day — but to go out of our way to say thank you to all of our veterans.” The parade started at Knickerbacker Park and ran through the streets of Lansingburgh before ending at Powers Park, with residents of all ages on the street to meet them. Though it started to rain as the procession reached Powers Park, the sun managed to stay out for most of the journey. Fire trucks, police cars, sports clubs, and bands made their way, tossing candy, blowing bubbles, and waving American flags as they went. The mostly local groups and schools were also joined by Canadian infantry — the Lincoln and Welland Regiment from the Niagara Region of Ontario. The group has a history with the Veterans of Lansingburgh and attended the Memorial Day Parade for 20 years before its pause prior to the pandemic. The paraders ranged from local politicians and officials to the Ancient Order of Hibernians — joined on their float by Uncle Sam and Betsey Mann — to someone from Joseph’s House & Shelter in a dinosaur costume walking a dog. There was also, of course, a van coated in New York Giants memorabilia down to an inflated player on the back that got some cheers as it went by. “I think we haven’t had any, much exposure down in Lansingburgh, you know, and think it’s just a great opportunity,” said Sidewalk Warriors Troy President Robin Fontanelli about why they and their new refrigerator van were taking to the streets. “It’s really exciting so we wanted to be part of the excitement, The parade at 1 p.m. was just one of the events arranged for the day, starting with a street sign unveiling and ending with a block-party cookout at Forty-One Sports Bar & Grille. The street sign was for Peter Guenette Lane, the street next to Knickerbacker Park dedicated to a fallen soldier who sacrificed his life in Vietnam. A 20-year-old Specialist Fourth Class machine gunner in the Army, Guenette dove on an enemy grenade thrown toward his company while under heavy fire, saving four men. Born in Troy and a Medal of Honor recipient for his act, Mantello said the city was alerted the sign was missing a few months ago, and they unveiled a new one on Monday morning with members of Guenette’s family. “You (hear) the story of Peter, and you know there’s a million stories similar to Peter,” Mantello said. “(Memorial Day) it’s to really take time out of our day to say thank you, to say thank you for our freedom.” A Lansingburgh native, Mantello said she remembers hearing about Guenette and understanding even at her age the weight of a young person giving their life. The parade itself, she said, also brings back memories of watching and being in parades. There is so much pride tied into the day and pride in the city of Troy for themselves, for their city, and for the men and women who have served for them, she said. It brings a feeling of camaraderie and family to Troy. “We’re so proud to bring back Memorial Day, not just the parade but more importantly our veterans ceremony and to really pay respect to the folks who just gave us what we have today,” Mantello said. “We’re proud of our city, we’re proud of our veterans and, you know, today is going to be a great day for Troy.”",

        "content": "The sports world was met with sad news today, May 27: Bill Walton, basketball hall-of-famer and NBA legend, after a battle with cancer. This is a noteworthy loss for the music world, too: If you know two things about Walton aside from his basketball achievements, one is that he had an unceasingly optimistic and offbeat personality. The other is that he was perhaps the world’s biggest (both in terms of enthusiasm and physical size) Grateful Dead fan. Naturally, when — an offshoot band featuring some original Grateful Dead members, , and others — launched nearly a decade ago, Walton was all in. This means Mayer has gotten to know Walton a bit, and back in 2023, he spoke about his experiences with the sports icon. Mayer was Walton’s guest on an interview-style NBA broadcast in January 2023, and he reminisced about Walton speaking to him before taking the stage for a Dead & Company show. It was very Bill Walton. Mayer said, “You know, it’s really just him being very laser-sharp. When Bill gives you advice, he looks you dead in the eye and everything stops, and he speaks with this cadence: ‘Go out there, give it your absolute all. Don’t be shy, they are here to watch you play. Go play to the greatest of your ability.'” \"Some of the greatest compliments I've ever been given were from Bill Walton.\" John Mayer on the advice and support Bill has shared with him over the years. 📲 — NBA (@NBA) Mayer also noted that Walton gave him “some of the greatest compliments I’ve ever been given,” including “some very nice things that sent me on stage with a lot of confidence.” Dead & Company, by the way, is in the midst of . Check out the Mayer/Walton clip above and revisit more of the broadcast below. Basketball fans have also been sharing their favorite clips of Walton, so find some of those .",

        "content": "JAZZ Jennings has shown she's confident in her body as she flaunted her body transformation in new photos. The TLC star posted a couple of snapshots on Instagram of her donning a swimsuit while enjoying the warm weather. In one pic, Jazz, 23, captured an up-close shot of her sporting a plunging black bathing suit while basking in the sunshine. She stared directly at the camera with her long brunette locks flowing down her back. A second pic showed Jazz smiling alongside her friend, Sam, while seemingly at a playground. Sam also rocked a black outfit and her brown hair fell to her shoulders. \"Radiate Love,\" Jazz wrote in her caption before giving a shoutout to her \"best friend.\" \"Oh god u r magnificent,\" one fan commented, while another gushed over her \"beautiful\" appearance. The YouTuber has been regularly flaunting her thinner figure on social media since dropping 70 pounds. Last month, the Florida native showcased her smaller waistline , by sharing a full-body photo of her sporting tiny shorts and a t-shirt. She noted in her caption that she was \"improving every day,\" which fans, including her older brother Sander, praised in the comments. \"Looking amazing! So proud of you for reaching towards your progress goals and continuing to work to be the healthiest and happiest version of you,\" her 26-year-old sibling wrote. The I Am Jazz star has been vocal about her health journey after gaining weight due to binge eating. Jazz previously revealed she packed on more than 100 pounds after turning to food to deal with her depression battle. \"I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 lbs. heavier, here I am today,\" the TV personality said during a 2021 confessional interview on her show. \"I do experience fat-shaming from my family,\" she admitted, and added that it made her \"feel really humiliated.\" I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 lbs. heavier, here I am today. Earlier that year, Jazz opened up on Instagram about her \"addiction to food\" and how she would typically \"eat in large quantities.\" The TV star appears to have a much better relationship with her body . In January, she beamed in another Instagram pic that she was \"feeling sexy\" while wearing a revealing black and white top. Shortly before, Jazz confessed to her followers that she was ready to be in a relationship after being single for five years. \"I'm so open to finding love, and I know it'll come,\" she shared after a fan inquired about her love life. \"I'll continue to be patient in the knowing that it'll happen when I'm ready,\" the spokesmodel added. Jazz rose to fame after starring in TLC's reality series, I Am Jazz, which documented her navigating through her teenage years as a transgender female. She also wrote about her experiences in her memoir, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen, and is an LGBT rights activist.",

        "content": "RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) – Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) said Republicans “were right about HB2” as he spoke to supporters at a recent campaign event. Robinson made the comments at a private lunch hosted by RNC National Committeeman Ed Broyhill. Broyhill posted an 18-minute video of . Robinson, who is running for governor, was referring to the controversial House Bill 2, which the Republican-led General Assembly passed in 2016. It required people to use the bathroom that corresponded to their gender at birth and blocked municipalities from passing non-discrimination ordinances. The law sparked national backlash as some companies dropped plans to bring jobs to the state and some major events, such as the NBA All-Star Game, were moved out of North Carolina. A few months after Gov. Roy Cooper (D) was elected in 2016, the legislature partially repealed the law. An found the law cost the state more than $3.76 billion over 12 years in lost business. “We were right about HB2. We told them. You start letting these men go in these bathrooms, the next thing you know. What’s the next step after that? That’s exactly what we said. What’s the next step after that? Guess what the next step was: your daughter losing her scholarship to a biological man in swimming, volleyball, basketball,” Robinson said. “We were right on HB2 and continue to be right on it. The ideas that the left has is a bunch of foolishness. We don’t need to be ashamed to say it.” Robinson’s comments on HB2 came as he was trying to draw a contrast with Democrats, including his opponent in the race Atty. Gen. Josh Stein. Robinson said his campaign would focus on issues like lowering taxes, improving the business climate and education, while he said “the left” would “try to drag him into issues” like House Bill 2. “These folks are coming after you. I say, ‘I’m not worried about them.’ They say, ‘Well, you don’t look worried. Why are you not worried?’ Why in the world should I be worried about what somebody who thinks that there’s 257 genders thinks of me? I don’t care what you think of me. I don’t care,” said Robinson. When asked if Robinson would support reinstating provisions of House Bill 2, campaign spokesperson Mike Lonergan said, “Radical leftists like Joe Biden and Josh Stein want to force women and girls to share restrooms and locker rooms with men. That’s dangerous and extreme. As governor, Mark Robinson will not allow that to happen. It’s just common sense.” Stein campaign spokesperson Morgan Hopkins responded, “Mark Robinson would repeat the failures of HB2: thousands of jobs lost, companies fleeing the state, and billions in losses for North Carolina’s economy. We’ve been down this road before, and it’s a dead end. Josh Stein’s vision for North Carolina is forward-looking and will create a welcoming economic climate for workers and businesses.”",

        "description": "Iran has bolstered its supply of enriched uranium, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog reportedly warned in a confidential report Monday.",
        "content": "Iran has reportedly further built up its supply of enriched uranium , the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog warned in a confidential report Monday. Tehran has about 313.2 pounds of uranium that is enriched up to 60%, marking a 45.4-pound increase since the last report from the International Atomic Energy Agency back in February, the Associated Press reported . Once a nation stockpiles roughly 92.5 pounds of uranium that’s enriched up to 60%, making a nuclear becomes theoretically possible, according to the agency. That is not far away from the weapons-grade level, which generally is pegged around 90% purity. Overall, Iran’s stash of enriched uranium is believed to be around 13,671.5 pounds, up from 1,489.8 pounds in the prior agency report, according to the AP. Iran has long strenuously denied allegations that it is pursuing a nuclear weapon, with top officials citing a supposed fatwa — or ruling in Islamic law — from its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Western experts have long questioned that alleged fatwa and raised concerns that Tehran could have its sights set on becoming a nuclear power. Should Iran obtain a nuclear weapon, it could spark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, as many Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia have suggested they would scramble to develop one in response. Iran has pushed the envelope when it comes to nuclear development as it suffers under the weight of an onslaught of crippling economic sanctions and the end of a US-backed nuclear deal. The Obama administration reached the deal in 2015, but former President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact in 2018. That deal entailed the easing of sanctions in exchange for Iran setting limits on its nuclear program that would be phased out over time. President Biden’s administration has long been rumored to be eyeing a revival of that deal, but so far, nothing has come to fruition. Instead, relations have been strained amid the Israel-Hamas war. Both Iran and Israel exchanged attacks last month after the US ally allegedly took out a senior Quds Force commander as well as other Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers during a strike in Syria. Recently, Iran has been reeling from a helicopter crash that killed President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian incident earlier this month. Upon the death of Raisi — who was widely seen as a top contender to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader— Mohammad Mokhber became Iran’s acting president. The death of Raisi paused the agency’s talks with Iran on getting better cooperation, according to the AP account of the most recent report. The watchdog is reportedly still seeking answers about the origins and location of undeclared manmade uranium particles in Iran. Agency officials also claim that no additional progress has been made in trying to install more robust monitoring equipment inside Iran, since they had been taken down in June 2022 . Back in September 2023, Iran prohibited multiple nuclear inspectors. Tehran has yet to reverse that decision. With Post wires",

        "content": "For police, the lowest pay rate for a sworn officer was $75,063 - the lowest level since 2007 compared to CPI. File photo: RNZ By Susan Edmunds Police and teachers are currently being paid their lowest rates compared to the minimum or average wage in at least 20 years. Infometrics economists have crunched the numbers on pay for teachers, nurses and police. Earlier in the year, chief forecaster Gareth Kiernan had noted that MPs were being paid their lowest salary compared to the average wage since the 1970s, before their latest pay increase. The data showed all three sectors' pay was comparatively lower on a range of measures compared to the past, too. \"Compared to historical norms, police pay looks particularly poor, and teachers don't look that good, either,\" Kiernan said. \"Nurses don't appear to be quite so bad, although the recent figures are inflated by the pay equity settlement. If you exclude that from the figures, on the basis that nurses were previously being underpaid because it was a female-dominated profession, then their pay isn't great either.\" For police, the lowest pay rate for a sworn officer was $75,063 - the lowest level since 2007 compared to CPI. Compared to average wages, it was at the lowest point of any time since 2003 and possibly since 1969. It was 41 percent lower than the high point in 1981. Compared to the minimum wage, it was lower than at any time since 2003 and possibly since 1967. It was 63 percent lower than in 1981. Police officers have been involved in a pay dispute but were expected to have a new pay offer confirmed by the end of August. Kiernan said secondary school teachers' income relative to the CPI was the lowest in June last year - just before their latest pay increase - since 2006. The post-primary teachers association (PPTA) said most of its teachers were paid at the top of the pay scale, which was $99,216 a year, going up to $103,085 in December. \"Over the longer-term, teachers' pay has been reasonably stable compared to the CPI, and the pay increase set to come into effect from December this year should push inflation-adjusted pay up to a level that is higher than was seen at any time between December 1986 and June 2020,\" Kiernan said. \"That outcome sounds great for teachers, but if we compare teachers' pay to either the average wage or the minimum wage, it's a different story. In June 2023, teachers' pay relative to either of these variables was at its lowest on record, since 1980. Even with the subsequent pay increases that have occurred and/or will occur in December this year, teachers' pay relative to the average wage or the minimum wage will still be lower than at any time before June 2019.\" He said the teacher pay situation could be leading to wider problems. \"New Zealand's poor educational outcomes and persistently poor productivity results, in combination with pay rates that are continuing to decline relative to other wages and salary, potentially become something of a chicken-and-egg problem. \"One can't expect good educational outcomes without good teachers, but good people won't be attracted to the profession or retained as teachers without good pay either - and primary and secondary education doesn't seem to be an area where investment in capital equipment, automation, or economies of scale are going to make a significant positive impact. Of course, there are other big issues as well such as the curriculum, assessment methods, and the incentives to teach to the median student's ability rather than taking a more tailored approach to student needs.\" Kiernan said before the pay equity boost that started in 2021, nurses' pay was at its lowest level compared to the minimum wage in all of the available data. \"The pay equity boost pushed nurses' pay in 2022 up to its highest level, relative to the average wage, on record. However, relative to the minimum wage, it was only at its highest level since 2016.\" The nurse pay cited was $75,773. \"I wonder whether one of the key aspects of each of these professions is that there is limited scope for improved labour productivity and/or greater capital intensiveness,\" Kiernan said. \"At its simplest, a teacher can only achieve significant 'productivity' improvements by having more students per class; a nurse by having more patients under their care; a police officer by covering a wider area. I can think of how technological advances might have made some of these changes possible - electronic monitoring of patients would require less human supervision of patients in hospital, for example. \"But my impression is that the advances will have been more constrained than across many other occupations, where computers have had a significant effect on people's output over the last 40 years,\" he said. \"As a result, average wages at an economy-wide level might have been able to lift faster because people have been more productive, and the mix of jobs in the economy has also changed towards higher-skilled and higher-paid ones. This trend might have meant that specific occupations with a high human element to them have been left behind a bit, relatively speaking, in terms of their pay rates. \"It's a difficult situation, because as we saw during Covid-19, people seem to implicitly value the human nature of those roles when the going gets tough - but the pay rates don't necessarily reflect that.\"",

        "content": "KUWAIT: Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullah Al-Yahya on Monday held in-depth discussions with Chinese officials dealing with means of boosting relations in execution of mega development ventures. The minister, according to a statement released by the foreign ministry, received Chinese Ambassador to Kuwait Zhang Jianwei, with the attendance of the head and members of a Chinese government delegation tasked with completing consultation on joint development projects. The meeting with the visiting Chinese officials was held at the ministry headquarters, the official statement said, noting that the two sides explored the close bilateral relations and strategic cooperation between Kuwait and China, where they also broached “frameworks of boosting and promoting the relations in various sectors and at diverse levels”. The two sides held in-depth discussions, focusing on the necessity to cement technical, development and economic ties in the realm of executing mega development projects in Kuwait. Moreover, they addressed the need to offer proposals and the aspired perceptions for attaining aspirations of the supreme political leadership to press ahead with laying the foundations of a future plan to launch common strategic ventures, namely Mubarak Al-Kabeer Port. — KUNA China will host a number of other Arab leaders in Beijing this week, its foreign ministry said Monday. The leaders will from Tuesday to Saturday “pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. Among the delegation will be Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li said President Xi Jinping would attend the forum and deliver a keynote address on Thursday. Xi would also “hold talks with the four heads of state respectively to exchange views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern”, Deng said. The forum would aim to deepen “consensus between China and Arab countries”, Deng said, and would be co-chaired by top diplomat Wang Yi and his Mauritanian counterpart. They would also “issue a common voice between China and Arab countries on the Palestinian issue”, he said. China has sought to build closer ties with Arab states in recent years, and last year brokered a detente between Tehran and its long-time foe Saudi Arabia. The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China seeks to position itself as a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and the Zionist entity. China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Zionist-Palestinian conflict. And Xi has called for an “international peace conference” to resolve the fighting. – Agencies",

        "description": "They were the headline picks for NZ's Olympics sailing team. But a secret selection policy suggests the pair weren't eligible.",
        "content": ", Sports Correspondent YachtingNZ is accused of mishandling its Olympic selections afterone of its star crews was picked for the Paris Games,despite failing to meet the required performancestandard. Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, who paired up inthe 49erFX class at the beginning of 2022, headlined theannouncement of the New Zealand sailing team for the Gameslast month. With five previous Games appearances and threeOlympic medals between them, the pair are the mostexperienced of the . But according to YachtingNZ's selection documents, the duo were not eligible to beconsidered for nomination, having failed to achieve a top 10placing at one of the designated selection regattas. Theselection was signed off by the New Zealand OlympicCommittee (NZOC). Both organisations are adamantproper process was followed in the nomination and selectionof the pair. However, Yachting NZ's apparentwillingness to contort its criteria for Aleh and Meech,along with a perceived inconsistent application of the\"emerging talent\" clause, has led to several disputes overits handling of selections and allegations ofbias. Yachting NZ has long maintained a cloak ofsecrecy around how it selects its athletes for the OlympicGames. It is the only national body that does not publiclyshare its nomination criteria - contravening the NZOC'snomination and selection regulation - and sailors wishing tobe considered for the pinnacle event must agree to keep itconfidential. However, RNZ has obtained a copy of theselection documents. New Zealand's sailors must clearan even higher bar than the NZOC's already lofty \"top 16\"criteria to be nominated for selection. Under its primaryselection criteria, Yachting NZ selectors will only nominateathletes deemed capable of winning a medal. To beeligible, sailors and crews must have, as a baseline,achieved a top 10 placing in at least one selection regatta,or have medalled at a world championships during thatOlympic cycle. There is a second pathway for sailorsor crews that Yachting NZ selectors consider to be \"emergingtalent\" and have the potential to medal at the next Olympicsin Los Angeles in 2028. Under these criteria, sailors needto finish in the top 16 nations at one of the selectionregattas to be eligible. Aleh and former sailingpartner Polly Powrie, affectionately known as Team Jolly,won gold in the women's 470 in London and silver inRio. Meech was also , alongside teammate Alex Maloneyin the 49erFX class. The popular duo went their separateways following a disappointing 12th place finish inTokyo. Meech then linked up with Aleh at the beginningof 2022 to form Team Jolly 2.0. Despite theircredentials, the new pairing have produced mixed results onthe international circuit. In the first of twoselection regattas, Aleh and Meech placed 34th at theEuropean Championships in Portugal last year - well outsidethe top 10 benchmark - before recording a 12th at the WorldChampionships earlier this year. Prior to being namedin the Games team last month, the duo had recorded just onetop 10 result at a major international regatta intwo-and-a-half seasons - a . It isunderstood selectors relied heavily on this result, despiteit not being an official selection regatta. Under thecriteria, selectors can also consider \"a sailor or crew'strack record of success at past Olympic Games\". However,those familiar with the policy say these factors only comeinto play in final deliberations once sailors have met theunderlying eligibility criteria. RNZ has spoken withseveral past and present members of the NZL sailing team,who expressed concern about Yachting NZ's handling of thisyear's selections. None wanted to go on the record for fearof being seen to diminish Aleh and Meech. All made apoint of saying they would not have wanted to see the 49erFXpair left out of the Olympic team, but a recurring theme ofthe conversations was that Yachting NZ's perceivedinconsistent approach to its selections has created distrustin the system. Aleh did not want to be drawn into thedebate over the merits of her inclusion in the team, buttold RNZ via text message that she is \"very pro-selection,having had close friends impacted by selection policies inthe past\". \"In terms of the YNZ policy we were happyto be selected and for us it was just a little step on theway to what we are trying to do in Paris. So our focus isvery much on making sure we are doing everything we can overthe next few months,\" she wrote. Since being named inthe Olympic team, Aleh and Meech had a breakthrough resultlast month at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, claiming thebronze medal - a promising sign the pair are beginning toperfect their partnership. But it is clear on anyone'sreading of the criteria that Yachting NZ have applied anextraordinary amount of discretion to include Aleh and Meechin the team. In a brief statement provided to RNZ,Yachting NZ boss David Abercrombie said the organisationdoes not publicly comment on individual nominations, but allsailors and crews were selected in line with its policies.The nomination of athletes \"follows a rigorous process ledby an independent panel with a wealth of sailing expertiseand experience\". NZOC secretary general Nicki Nicolalso asserted proper process was followed. \"Allselections are made by an experienced selection panel.Decisions are evidence based and athletes nominated by[national sports organisations] are assessed by the NZOCselectors against the agreed nomination criteria and theNZOC selection policy,\" she said in astatement. The discretion used to pick Aleh and Meechappears not to have been as readily available toothers. RNZ understands at least one sailor -kitefoiler Lukas Walton-Keim - has lodged a formal appealwith the Sports Tribunal over his non-nomination in the newOlympic class. Walton-Keim is the partner of Olympicpole vaulter Eliza McCartney, who last weekend spoke outabout the NZOC's controversial \"top 16\" selection policy,arguing qualified athletes should not be denied entry to theOlympics. It is understood Walton-Keim's case will beheard this week, unless a resolution can be reached in themeantime. All parties agree to confidentiality when acase is before the tribunal, but it is understoodWalton-Keim is seeking nomination under the \"emergingtalent\" clause. Two athletes have been selected underthis criteria - boardsailor Veerle ten Have in the women'sIQ foil, and Greta Pilkington, who is expected to beconfirmed in Ilca 6 at an official announcement on Tuesdaymorning. Ten Have finished 22nd and 21st overall ather two selection events, but was easily inside the top 16nations for both events. Pilkington had a shaky startto her campaign, recording 53rd and 44th placings in thefirst two selection events earlier this year, before pullingit out of the bag in the final event in Hyeres last month.There the 20 year-old finished 16th, and 14thnation. It is expected Walton-Keim's case will focuson the inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\"clause. Walton-Keim finished 28th, 17th, and 27th athis three selection regattas. His 17th placing at theEuropean Championships last year put him inside the top 16nations. While not official selection regattas, the 28year-old is also tracking strongly at recent events. Hefinished 11th at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, or ninthnation, and 17th at the Formula Kite world championships(15th nation) earlier this week. Following the event,Walton-Keim posted on Instagram: \"I'm not sure what's next,I'd like to do some more racing in 2024 ... let'ssee.\" One former international sailor said thegoverning body's flexibility is at odds with its \"rigid\"approach in the past to not only Olympic nomination, butalso funding decisions and selection to its \"Fast Track\"development programme. \"YNZ will follow the rules tothe absolute letter when it suits them. We're always beingtold, 'Well, the policy is very clear,' but then when theywant to get someone in the team, suddenly there is all thisgrey area,\" they said. Abercrombie did not directlyaddress questions related to whether he has concerns aboutperceptions of bias and growing distrust in the system. Butin a statement, he said Yachting NZ's policies are\"transparent and available to every athlete throughout theircampaigns\". The long-serving chief executive of theorganisation also said the current policy was \"developedafter an athlete-led review following the Tokyo OlympicGames\" and athletes will continue to be involved in refiningthe policy for future cycles. Nicol also ignoredquestions about whether the NZOC had any concerns aboutYachting NZ's handling of selections. \"While we arenot able to comment on individual cases, we do understandhow tough it is for athletes that may not have beennominated by their sport for selection to an NZTeam.\" It is not the first time questions have beenraised about Yachting NZ's approach to selections forpinnacle events. In 2016 Sara Winther (laser radial) andNatalia Kosinska (RS:X) over their non-nominationfor the Rio Games. While the tribunal ultimately ruledin favour of Yachting NZ, the then-chair of the arbitrationbody Sir Bruce Robertson was highly critical of the sport'shandling of selections. \"I have concerns about theinadequacy of communication by YNZ to both athletes. Whilethe selection policy is drafted to provide huge discretionto YNZ, this does not obviate its obligations to abide bythe rules of natural justice and to ensure basic fairness inits implementation,\" Sir Bruce wrote in hisdecision.",

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft 22 years apart, landing on last-place teams.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But the former UConn women’s basketball all-time great knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark’s Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don’t have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what’s been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.",

        "description": "Love Island star Ekin-Su Culculoglu was one of the stars taking part in ITV's 2024 season of Celebrity Big Brother - but things did not turn out well for her during her time on the show",
        "content": "Ekin-Su Culculoglu has addressed the fact she failed to turn up to the grand final of ITV ’s revived Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year. The 29-year-old Love Island star was one of the 13 celebrities that entered the Most Famous House In Britain in March and she had high hopes of being able to show a new side of herself to fans. Plans backfired somewhat, however, as Ekin-Su sparked bitter arguments in the house, appeared obsessed with not being recognised for her Love Island fame, and clashed with show hosts AJ Odudu and Will Best after she was voted out of the house as she tried to blame producer’s editing the show to make her look bad. Now Ekin-Su has opened up about her disastrous turn on the series and says she couldn’t make it to the live final as she was struggling to cope with bombshell news that ex-boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti, 29, had cheated on her. The British-Turkish actress has conceded that her time in the house was nothing short of a disaster, but has rejected the suggestion that this was the reason behind her finale no-show. In the last episode of the season, where Ibiza Weekender star David Potts , 31, was crowned winner, former housemates were invited to return to review their time on the show. Businessman Gary Goldsmith was also absent from the finale, but there is speculation his decision to not appear was down to his niece, Catherine, Princess of Wales , battling cancer. Ekin-Su's time on the reality show was tarred by bitter arguments ( Image: ITV1) Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Speaking to The Sun, Ekin-Su said: “I should never have gone into the Big Brother house. I was angry, hurt, maybe a bit bitter, definitely insecure – Big Brother is not where you go to heal heartache, let me tell you. I went into the show thinking that I could rebuild myself after everything that happened with Davide, but I came off worse. My guard was up.” She continued: “I blame myself for making a poor choice in my career. People could see that I wasn’t myself, and I can understand why they thought I was being fake.” And she added: “I never wanted to believe the allegations against Davide but people would tell me I was being cheated on all the time. I was so scared of being alone, and I didn’t know who the hell Ekin-Su was meant to be without him.” Cheating accusations have ruined the once strong romance on both sides. As fans will already be aware, Ekin-Su and Davide won the eighth season Love Island in 2022 and their romance flourished outside of the house. However, their relationship turned sour after 11 months and they broke up. Davide has accused Ekin-Su of cheating on him with a fellow contestant on the USA version of The Traitors which sees celebrities taking on tasks and trying to avoid betrayal. It has been alleged that Ekin-Su developed a romance with The Bachelorette star Peter Weber on the show - an accusation she has fiercely rejected. Hitting out at the suggestion on Monday, Ekin-Su said: “It’s absolutely not true. I made friends with a lot of people I was with on Traitors. I’ve always been a faithful to Davide.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.",

Council chiefs face having to repay up to £1.2million in LEZ penalties after a judge ruled they should have been sent by recorded delivery. 2 Drivers may be able to claim back LEZ fines Credit: Alamy 2 Council chiefs face having to repay up to £1.2million in LEZ penalties Credit: Alamy Lord Lake’s verdict last week upheld a decision in favour of Allan Hamilton, from Ayrshire . The motorist took the authority to a tribunal, insisting his £60 fine was invalid because it had been sent by standard mail. After a law chief backed his claim last October, council officials began sending out their penalty notices by tracked post. But the blunder means at least 20,000 fines issued from the start of the scheme last June until November could be challenged. READ MORE LEZ LEZ OF THAT Over 1 MILLION cars to be banned from Scots roads in weeks under hated new laws GRIDLOCKED Hundreds of drivers use our street as car park to avoid LEZ fines - it's a mess Mr Hamilton claimed legal protocol was not followed when he was fined for driving his van into the city. First-tier tribunal adjudicator Alexander Green agreed a record of delivery was a “mandatory requirement”. The council appealed to the Upper Tribunal for Scotland. But Lord Lake told them the service of notices must be “verifiable”. LEZ rules punish drivers of vehicles that don’t meet strict emissions rules with fines rising from £60 to a maximum of £480.

Locals slam 'idiot' quad biker after shocking near miss on Scots roundabout WHEEL DEAL Car expert reveals 3 used luxury motors to buy for under £10k including Maserati A Glasgow council spokesman said: “Since November all LEZ penalty charge notices have been issued by tracked delivery.” It comes after we revealed that Glasgow's pollution is now WORSE despite the introduction of the widely-hated LEZ. Glasgow city centres Low Emission Zone explained New data has revealed that Glasgow City Council's aim for the LEZ was to reduce emissions by cutting down on vehicles that omit a key pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) into the atmosphere. But fresh stats have shown emissions have actually INCREASED since controversial green-scheme was introduced in June 2023 to prevent older and more polluting motors from entering the city centre. The new data shows how the NO2 level at a key monitoring station for Glasgow has risen in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period - before the LEZ was introduced. CAB FEARS WE told last month how hundreds of black cabs could be forced off the road in a matter of weeks over the LEZ rules. Scottish Tory transport spokesperson Graham Simpson said : \"Nearly a year on from the roll-out of the SNP-Greens' shambolic LEZ, it is clear it is not even meeting its main objective to improve air quailty.\" A Glasgow City Council spokesperson said: \"Levels of air pollution , in particular nitrogen dioxide and particulates, are influenced by a number of factors, including weather patterns. \"The LEZ's initial impact will be assessed as part of a statutory annual progress report later this year, with detailed analysis from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.\" Across January, February and March on Glasgow’s Hope Street the NO2 levels were 44.2 microgrammes per cubic metre, up from 42.5 for the same period in 2023, reports the Mail on Sunday . Another monitoring station near a school in Anderston, on the edge of the LEZ, shows NO2 up by 35 per cent, sparking fears that pollution is simply being \"displaced\" to around the car ban area. These concerns were made in the local authority's own reports ahead of the introduction of the zone.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts, students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center. “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Advertisement Advertisement",

        "description": "As ministers have a public spat over Rishi Sunak’s national service plan, Boris Johnson ally Zac Goldsmith has claimed that Tory MPs’ ‘complicity’ is to blame for the election chaos",
        "content": "Zac Goldsmith, who resigned from Rishi Sunak ’s government last year, has hit out at the “complicity” of most Tory MPs in allowing the party to descend into complete chaos less than a week into a general election. The Tory peer, who is a friend and ally of former prime minister Boris Johnson , posted a comment on X (formerly Twitter) warning that most Conservative MPs will lose their seats but that“it is hard to feel sorry for them”. It came as ministers were furiously briefing about their anger over the prime minister calling a snap election without consulting his cabinet first. Only common sense minister Esther McVey and Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris expressed opposition at the cabinet meeting last week when Mr Sunak announced he had been to see the King but others since have privately expressed their anger. Similarly, a public spat has broken out between ministers over Mr Sunak’s weekend announcement that he will reintroduce national service , 61 years since it was scrapped again without consulting his team. First, as revealed by The Independent , Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker publicly distanced himself from the policy in a message to his constituents. Then foreign minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan appeared to contradict home secretary James Cleverly by suggesting 18-year-olds may face fines or imprisonment if they do not agree to join the military or do weekend community work. Deputy chairman James Daly hit back saying that Ms Trevelyan is “not responsible for the policy” and claiming that there will not be any criminal sanctions. But the chaos followed the start of a general election campaign already branded “the worst in history”, where a series of gaffes by the prime minister included giving his address to the nation in the pouring rain without an umbrella while being blasted with the anthem for Tony Blair’s 1997 campaign. He also managed to be interviewed under an exit sign, did an election event at the Titanic Museum in Belfast, and saw scores of Tory MPs run to the exit door to avoid standing again, including cabinet minister Michael Gove. Lord Goldsmith made it clear that he struggled to feel sympathy for a leader who should not have been in office as a result of the downfalls of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. He said: “I understand the anger towards Sunak who has damaged the party almost beyond repair and all but guaranteed the majority of his MPs will lose their job next month. “But it’s hard to muster much sympathy given that none of this would have happened without the complicity of a majority of the party and what is now unfolding was entirely predictable – indeed predicted. “The hope is that when Sunak disappears off to California in a few weeks there are at least some decent MPs left around which to rebuild.” Meanwhile, Labour mocked the Tories for the chaos over the national service policy. Jonathan Ashworth, shadow paymaster general, said: “The Tory campaign is in absolute chaos, with more positions on their flagship policy than the Kama Sutra . “Now, Tory MPs are arguing among themselves about whether they are going to arrest parents, whether it will apply to Northern Ireland and how much it will cost. “It is a shambles, total chaos, and the country deserves so much better.” However, Tory deputy chairman Jonathan Gullis, responded: “Jonathan Ashworth tried desperately to criticise our national service announcement because he knows his party are on the back foot on big ideas. \"As always, Labour are all too happy to snipe from the sidelines, but still haven’t said whether they support or oppose our children getting more skills and better opportunities. Ashworth should speak to his own shadow foreign secretary who praised national service as a ‘worthwhile’ idea. “With no plan, Labour have to resort to dodgy criticism and analysis. No wonder they can’t cost their policies, meaning taxes would rise by £2,094 for every working household.”",

        "content": "Participants take part in the annual cheese rolling at Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, England, Monday, May 27, 2024. The traditional event attracts people from around the globe who come to chase a 7-pound Double Gloucester cheese down the steep Coopers Hill. Jacob King/PA via AP LONDON — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Tom Kopke from Munich, Germany won one of the three men’s races. He said attitude was more important than technique. “You start and then the adrenaline takes over and you just go, go go,” Kopke said. “Look at this event, look at this hill,” added the muddy, breathless winner. “England is mad. I love it.” Local competitor Josh Shepherd and Dylan Twiss from Perth, Australia won the other two men’s downhill races. Abby Lampe from North Carolina triumphed in the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. “You just have to roll,” said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. “There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.” Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds over a 240-yard course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

        "description": "“Mr Lamorde's demise comes at a time when the EFCC and Nigeria greatly needed his wealth of experience to tackle emerging law enforcement challenges,” Mr Olukoyede The post EFCC mourns Lamorde appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ola Olukoyede, has expressed sadness over the passing of one his predecessors, Ibrahim Lamorde, a retired deputy inspector general of police. In a statement by EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, Mr Olukoyede said Mr Lamorde, who led the EFCC from 2012 to 2015, passed away at the age of 61 in Egypt on Saturday. “The loss of this distinguished law enforcement officer whose ideals and accomplishments we have long respected, is painful coming at a time the EFCC and indeed Nigeria still needed his wealth of experience to deal with emerging challenges in the law enforcement environment,” he said. He said Mr Lamorde made significant contributions to the EFCC and the Nigeria Police, where he spent his most productive years. “Mr Lamorde’s demise comes at a time when the EFCC and Nigeria greatly needed his wealth of experience to tackle emerging law enforcement challenges,” Mr Olukoyede noted. He said Mr Lamorde’s tenure at the EFCC included roles as director of operations, acting chairman, and substantive chairman. The statement explained that he was instrumental to establishing EFCC’s investigation machinery and mentoring the corps of officers who are now pivotal to the commission’s investigative activities.

He was also a reformist, and his legacy in the Commission includes the establishment of the Department of Internal Affairs, recently renamed the Department of Ethics and Integrity, and the Department of Public Affairs to drive the Commission’s corruption prevention mandate,” Mr Olukoyede stated. The EFCC chairman said Mr Lamorde renamed the EFCC’s Training and Research Institute in Karu to EFCC Academy, expanding its mandate to train all cadres of officers from the EFCC and other law enforcement agencies across Nigeria and Africa. He said the EFCC Academy has become a central hub for anti-corruption training in West Africa. The EFCC Chairman noted that Mr Lamorde’s lifetime of service as a police officer and statesman would remain a legacy of inspiration. “All of us in the EFCC feel deeply the loss of this soldier of anti-corruption. Our hearts are with his family and all those whose lives he impacted in his remarkable career. We share your bereavement in the loss of this icon. You can be assured that our thoughts and prayers are with you in your grief,” he stressed. The commission prays for the repose of Mr Lamorde’s soul and comfort for his family, the EFCC, and the entire nation. President Bola Tinubu, earlier on Sunday, expressed condolences to the family of Mr Lamorde. In addition to offering sympathies to the family, President Tinubu extended his condolences to the associates of the former anti-graft czar as well as to the EFCC, the Nigeria Police Force, and the government and people of Adamawa State. The President prayed for the repose ofthe soul of the deceased and comfort for his family during this difficult time. Mr Lamorde was born on 20 December 1962 in Mubi, Adamawa State. He attended Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Sociology in 1984. He joined the Nigerian Police Force in 1986. When the EFCC was created in 2003, Mr Lamorde was appointed the pioneer Director of Operations. He served as EFCC Acting Chairman in January 2008, holding the position until Farida Waziri was appointed Chairperson and confirmed by the Senate in June 2008.

        "description": "In response to an unprecedented surge in bear attacks, Japan is looking for ways for humans and animals to co-exist.",
        "content": "On 18 October 2023, in Kita-Akita, a regional city 700km north of Tokyo, local candy store owner Keiji Minatoya was starting his day when a young woman came running from his backyard screaming: \"There's a bear!\" \"I’d lived here for many decades but never seen a bear inside town,\" 66-year-old Minatoya thought and went back inside to continue working on making his butter mochi (a sweet treat). But when he finished work for the day and opened his garage door, he found himself face-to-face with an Asiatic black bear. Staring into the eyes of the 1.8m tall animal, Minatoya's survival instinct kicked in. He ran as fast as he could, but the bear caught up to him and pinned him to the ground before clawing at his face and body. \"I thought I was going to die,\" Minatoya recalled. \"The attack was vicious, so fast, so powerful — it was terrifying.\" Then suddenly the bear stopped its attack, and Minatoya was able to get into his house and call for help. On the same day, a record six people were attacked in Kita-Akita, sending shockwaves across the country. Most frightening of all was that these attacks were not isolated incidents. Source: SBS / Dateline Japan is experiencing an unprecedented surge in bear attacks, with the highest number reported in more than a century. Last year alone, 212 people were attacked by Japanese black or brown bears resulting in six deaths. The Akita prefecture has been particularly hard-hit, with 70 attacks recorded last year, more than anywhere else in the country. The alarming rate of attacks has authorities scrambling to find solutions to keep communities safe. Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology is one of Japan’s leading experts on bears. His team has been tasked by the government with determining why there were so many attacks in 2023. He says unseasonably high temperatures in autumn last year caused a dramatic decrease in the harvest of the acorns and fruits that bears need to survive in winter. \"With bears, usually the most vital time of year is September. It is a very important period when they consume a lot of food to accumulate their body fat before hibernation,\" Yamazaki explained. Desperate and starving, bears travelled unusually close to towns and villages in search of food. \"If bears eat food scraps that are left near human dwellings, they come back.\" \"Bears also want an easy life like humans. Once they learn an easy way, they won’t give it up.\" Source: Getty / Petesphotography/iStockphoto Another factor contributing to the increasing encounters between bears and people is Japan’s population decline. The Japanese term 'satoyama' refers to areas between mountains and arable flatlands, traditionally used for rice cultivation and forestry. But as more people abandoned agricultural practices and moved away, it has become easier for bears to come closer to villages and towns. \"Mountainous regions, in particular, have seen progressive depopulation and aging population. As a result, bears have more space for their activities,\" Yamazaki said. As the borders between humans and bears blur, the Japanese government has responded by launching a nationwide bear safety program. From public safety videos teaching people how to survive bear attacks to utilising AI technology to monitor bears’ movement patterns, Japan has committed to a variety of measures to inform and keep citizens safe. However, one of the more controversial courses of action is the Japanese government’s new mass culling campaign. In April this year, black bears were placed on the animals designated for control list in the Akita prefecture, meaning hunters can kill bears without restriction and for a bounty. The government has also introduced subsidised ammunition and carcass removal for bear hunters. While the initiative has been welcomed in towns like Kita-Akita, where bear encounters have become particularly common, other communities are searching for solutions that embrace humans and the natural world living in harmony together. Source: SBS / Dateline In Karuizawa, a town 150km west of Tokyo, Picchio Wildlife Research Center has introduced an innovative bear dog program that allows bears and humans to coexist in their respective territories. First developed at the Wind Bear Institute in the United States, the bear dog program aims to make bears afraid of humans by tracking bear movements and when they get close to human dwellings use the dogs to chase the bear away by barking. \"Because humans and bears live so close, in order to coexist, we need to separate our respective territories,\" said dog handler Junpei Tanaka. Tanaka works with Tama, his Karelian Bear Dog, a breed native to Finland known for its ability to hunt brown bears. \"With the help of dogs, we teach bears that humans are dangerous so that the bears that live here stay away from humans.\" Source: SBS / Dateline Since the program’s launch in 2004, it has reported an extraordinary reduction in the damages and incidents involving bears. There have been no bear attacks in town for over a decade, according to Amelia Hiorns, a researcher from Picchio. \"Our management system involves a variety of mitigation techniques. So, the bear dogs, electric fences, bear-proof bins and a community engagement program so that people can understand how to kind of interact and coexist with nature as well,\" Hiorns said. \"We have to accept the bears as much as we can. And obviously [bears] have to accept humans to an extent as well. \"Then I think it is possible to coexist. It's not necessarily going to ever be like perfect harmony, more of a compromise. And that's probably the best way we can do it,\" she said. Share facebook twitter instagram youtube Dateline is an Australian award-winning international documentary series.

        "description": "Landscape photographer Dani Watson realised she was creating a roadmap to dangerous locations for tourists and influencers, who she saw do \"horrific\" things for the sake of a selfie.",
        "content": "Landscape photographer Dani Watson loved posting photos of stunning, remote and unusual locations. Then she realised she was fuelling a dangerous selfie-taking culture. Within hours of posting an image on social media, she would receive a flood of messages from followers. \"They’d ask: 'where did you take it?' 'How did you get there?' 'Can you pinpoint it on Google Maps?'\" she told Insight. \"I realised I was sort of creating a roadmap for tourists and influencers.\" While she may have taken the photo with a drone, having got all the right permissions, the average person trying to replicate such a picture could be putting their lives in danger, she said. \"Photographers like me were taking photos and geotagging and hashtag tagging them, which was creating a wave of popularity in certain locations with tourists or others who wanted to go and capture those images. \"I was part of the problem.\" Monique Sherar knows all too well the perils of accessing dangerous places to take a photo. One beautiful day after lots of rain she was at Empress Falls in the NSW Blue Mountains. She wanted to capture the view but didn't plan to take a selfie. In the end she fell before she even had the chance to take a photo. \"One minute I was walking on the track and the next minute I was tumbling through the air,\" she told Insight. \"I just remember hitting the ground and having this full-body burning sensation. Just like a pain that I never felt before.\" After an eight to 10-metre fall, Monique landed in water at the base of a waterfall. \"It was this compounding pain, water, cold, fear and just anxiety of this overwhelming thing that had happened in a split second.\" Monique had friends with her who were able to get help quickly. While she miraculously avoided any internal bleeding or head injuries, she sustained multiple fractures. She had to have a hip replacement and now has only 50 per cent movement and strength in her left arm. Source: Supplied She says she's become more cautious since the accident. \"I think that I'll always still want to get those photos and get that nice view but now I have a calculated approach to adventure. That thrill-seeking nature of me has left.\" Sergeant Dallas Atkinson, who leads the Police Rescue team in the Blue Mountains, says he's noticed an increase in the volume of people getting out in nature. “I guess it’s a by-product of COVID and being locked away for so long. People are pushing the boundaries a bit more and going into remote locations, without the full appreciation of the dangers,\" he told Insight. Atkinson says the internet and social media now make it easy for people to get directions, though many are ill-prepared for what they may find. “Unfortunately, some people who are going down that path don’t have adequate experience or knowledge ... Nature is also unpredictable so if things go pear-shaped people can be stuck in the middle of nowhere without a lifeline, waiting and hoping to be rescued.\" Source: Supplied / Dani Watson Last year, Samuel Cornell from the University of NSW published the first Australian study of selfie-related deaths, with 379 recorded between 2008 and 2021. \"There's a strong allure on social media for people to get content ... and there's an intrinsic reward for doing so,\" he said. \"Many of these places are in beautiful locations, but also quite hazardous locations. They're hard to rescue people from.\" Cornell believes taking selfies in dangerous places isn't just foolish, it's a public health hazard in the same category as smoking or road traffic accidents and needs to be taken seriously. He has researched the effectiveness of using location-based social media safety messaging to reduce injuries and fatalities at certain locations, and suggests social media influencers could also be useful in sharing the risks. \"We might need to look at using social media influencers to convey safety messages on TikTok and other platforms,\" he said. Photographer Dani's realisation that she was part of the problem led her to start a research project at Melbourne's RMIT University called InstaFame. In it, she documented the risks photographers and tourists were taking in the quest for the perfect pic. As part of her project, she was photographed in dangerous locations, including at the Grampians National Park in Victoria. “Even though weather conditions were perfect, there was no wind and I had a rope nearby ... I remember saying to the friend who was with me that I don’t think I’ve ever felt so uneasy about something. There was nothing under me. I don’t think that enters some people's minds.\" Dani also recognised the toll that so-called selfie tourism was taking on nature. “When I re-visited a location at Trentham Falls in Victoria where I’d taken photographs two years earlier, it was evident the entire spot was decimated. All the lush ferns were gone and walking paths had been carved through the landscape.\" Source: AAP / PR IMAGE But one of the more \"horrific\" things Dani witnessed was at the Sea Cliff Bridge, a popular tourist attraction in the NSW Illawarra region that has become a notoriously dangerous selfie spot and the scene of numerous rescues over the years. \"This guy had rented a minibus and was doing selfie tours. He just parked at the bottom of Sea Cliff Bridge, pointed the way up, and these tourists with no knowledge of the area walked up this goat track to take selfies. \"They walked back down the same way, slipping and sliding, some were only wearing thongs or barefoot. It seemed to me that the tourist operator was profiting from this selfie culture”. A group of photographers took Dani up the same way through the steep cliffs. \"Once I got to the top I was like, 'why?' It’s a great view, but why would you take that risk?\" 22/02/2024 01:00 Share facebook twitter instagram youtube Insight is Australia's leading forum for debate and powerful first-person stories offering a unique perspective on the way we live. facebook twitter instagram youtube 6 min read",

        "content": "Around 30 British parliamentarians and Lords sent a letter this Friday to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, David Cameron, in which they call, in a bipartisan approach, on the British executive to support ”officially and without delay” the plan of Moroccan autonomy as the ”only solution” to the artificial conflict around the Moroccan Sahara. In addition to being the “most pragmatic” path, the autonomy initiative proposed by Morocco for the Sahara, which “respects local traditions and democratic aspirations, offers a viable solution to achieve peace and lasting stability,” underlined the deputies and members of the House of Lords. While recalling that the initiative is “widely supported” by London’s allies and more than 80 countries around the world, the signatories specified that the rallying around this plan, which constitutes “the only realistic solution”, testifies to the desire of international partners to promote regional stability and prosperity, “thus reinforcing the central role of the autonomy initiative in advancing peace efforts”. “There must be no room for more separatism or division,” they insisted, assuring that on the contrary, Morocco’s “proactive commitment to promoting regional security and stability must be reinforced”. “Remaining neutral or attempting alternative resolutions can only perpetuate a harmful status quo that endangers the security of the region,” they argued. While several of them visited Morocco and its Southern Provinces, where they had the opportunity to meet local leaders, representatives of civil society and human rights organizations, the signatories said their observations, coupled with those of respected academics such as Professor Marc Weller, Chair of International Law and International Constitutional Studies at the University of Cambridge, reinforce their “belief that the UK must provide proactive support to Morocco’s autonomy plan. Additionally, the Sahara region has the potential to significantly improve energy opportunities, secure supply chains, and enable access to new markets, they wrote, citing strategic infrastructure, for example of the “impressive” port of Dakhla, as proof of sustainable progress, allowing the region to establish itself as a pole of innovation and international cooperation. To fully realize this potential, “London must provide support from its financial institutions, such as UK export finance (UKEF) and British international investment (BII)”, they continued, recalling that this approach, adopted in particular by the United States and France, is compatible with the association agreement concluded between the two countries (UK and Morocco), which covers the Moroccan Sahara region and which was deemed legal by the High Court in London. The MPs added that the United Kingdom must strengthen its alliances with stable, like-minded nations “in order to promote regional stability and international security”, ensuring that among these partner nations, Morocco “occupies a preponderant place”. “It is a leading strategic ally in North Africa, which shares crucial values and perspectives for our two countries,” they continued. The forthcoming strategic dialogue between the UK and Morocco represents a unique opportunity for the UK to redefine its role and influence in the region, the signatories noted, assuring us that “Morocco deserves our full and unequivocal support”.",

        "description": "\"I believe marijuana has helped me in so many regards, with my anxiety,\" the country crooner added.",
        "content": "Country star Jelly Roll has credited marijuana with keeping him away from hard drugs. “I think a world without weed, Jelly Roll’s drinking codeine and popping Xanax and snorting cocaine again, but a world with weed, I’ll be alright,” he told Taste of Country in an interview published Friday. “I get in trouble for this, all the time, but my stance on marijuana will always be the same: I believe marijuana has helped me in so many regards, with my anxiety,” he added. “This is a hot button topic, but, truly, marijuana has kept me sober.” Jelly Roll, born Jason DeFord, has been open about his past struggles with addiction and substance abuse. He even landed himself in the slammer at 23 years old for drug dealing, according to his June 2023 interview with Billboard . While the 39-year-old “Wild Ones” hitmaker isn’t fully sober, he is passionate about helping people stay away from dangerous drugs. In January, he addressed the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and urged legislators to take action against the supply and distribution of fentanyl in the U.S. “At every concert I perform, I witness the heartbreaking impact of fentanyl,” he candidly explained. “I see fans grappling with this tragedy in the form of music ... that they seek solace in music and hope that their experiences won’t befall others.” “I’m not here to defend the use of illegal drugs, and I also understand the paradox of my history as a drug dealer standing in front of this committee,” he went on. “But equally, I think that’s what makes me perfect to talk about this. I was a part of the problem. I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.” Last December, Jelly Roll told People that it was of utmost importance to him to use his platform for good and give people who are struggling with drug abuse a chance at living a fulfilling life.

Hooked on Housewives? “I always said that if I ever got in this situation, I would do everything I could to give back,” he explained. “The fact that just me showing up places can make people happy is such a gift, and I feel like if God gave me that gift, I should show up.” Jelly Roll — who recently admitted he hates most of his tattoos — was incarcerated several times for drug-related charges before he became a successful ACM-winning artist. His troubles with the law even lost him the privilege to vote. However, he earned his GED while locked up at the age of 23 and has worked to make his life meaningful and full. In addition to crediting weed with helping him stay sober from hard drugs, he has also praised his wife of eight years , Bunnie XO, for helping him stay on a positive path and be able to raise his daughter, Bailee, and son, Noah. “You’re talking about a woman that came in and took a child that was soon to be born and a child that [we were] soon to have full custody of,” he raved to Billboard. “I would have never got custody of my daughter without her. I wouldn’t have had the stability or the money.” Bunnie XO, 44, has also been by Jelly Roll’s side as he focuses on his physical health. In 2018, he revealed he lost about 200 pounds after tipping the scale at over 500. Last month, she revealed he quit social media after repeated negative comments about his size “hurt him.” “Don’t bully people, because you never know where they are mentally,” she pleaded. “There are a lot of people who are not as strong as me, that are on the internet, and they don’t deserve to f—kin’ be bullied.”",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that there are similarities in the works of great poet ONV Kurup and Odia novelist Pratibha Ray. He was inaugurating the award presentation ceremony of ONV Sahitya Award organized by ONV Cultural Academy on the occasion of ONV's 93rd birthday. \"Both of them who won the Jnanpith Award have depicted the miseries of women and stood for their upliftment. Both spoke for the environment as well. I am proud to present the award named after ONV, a staunch advocate of the progressive movement, to a writer who has brought her mother tongue Odia to the world,\" said the Chief Minister. Adoor Gopalakrishnan, film director and president of the academy, presided over the function. Pratibha Ray was awarded the Literary Award by the Chief Minister for her original contribution to the field of literature. The award consists of three lakh rupees, a sculpture and a citation. Durga Prasad received the Yuva Sahitya Award, which includes Rs 50,000, a sculpture and a citation. Poet Prabhavarma read the citation.

He came to honour me at a function in the past. He came as a sign of respect for me despite having many physical disabilities. From there he went straight to the hospital. A writer has no free language, love is his language,\" said Pratibha Ray.",

        "content": "HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts, students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center. “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name (required) Your email (required) Report a typo or grammatical error (required) Submit Δ Suggest a Correction",

Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist.

While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter,” the Asuza Police Department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Los Angeles, police said. Azusa police Lt. Jake Bushey said Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group.

Speaking after she inspected the worksites, Dr Noura Al-Mashaan, also Minister of Municipality, said 92.2 percent of the project has been executed, affirming that the venture is in line with the state’s approach to provide citizens with top-notch public services. “This is a bright stage in our efforts to attain the objective of providing an excellent infrastructure,” said Mashaan, referring to the Cairo Street project that covers the construction of three tunnels and six causeways. It also includes building seven pedestrian bridges, water and rain networks, phone communications, lighting, traffic signs and urban greenery. Mashaan, who also examined works for developing the Second and Third Ring Roads, said that up to 97 percent of the renovation works have been accomplished in these locations. She also praised efforts exerted by the personnel of the Public Authority for Roads and Transportation. Cairo Street links several residential districts and regions. Kuwait’s domestic transport network is distinguished, with up to seven ring roads accessible to all residential districts and workplaces. — KUNA",

Physicians, healthcare workers and volunteers will be stationed throughout the event to assist cancer survivors and their caregivers. For information, call 217-876-4749.",

        "content": "The 2 Johnnies have said the reason behind their shock 2FM exit is probably not as juicy as people want it to be and they just want lives back. The lads were working seven days a week and their hit podcast earns more money and has more listeners than their radio show, according to Johnny B, one half of the iconic duo. The Tipperary natives will release their debut album this Friday ahead of a summer of gig across Ireland, Australia and America. Read more: The 2 Johnnies open up about their 2fm show being taken off air for misogynistic comments Read more: Johnny Smacks lifts lid on relationship with wife Annie and their Christmas wedding Johnny B told RSVP Live: \"The reason is probably not as juicy as people want it to be. We’re working seven days a week and our podcast earns more money and has more listeners than radio. \"We’re putting a lot of energy into our Patreon podcast, which has become very special. That’s another community and a lot of people don’t understand what’s going on there and how important it is to us. \"As much as we love radio, it’s not the biggest thing in our world. It’s not the second biggest thing in our world either! \"As much as we loved the team and our listeners, we can’t keep working seven days a week. I want my life back.\" It has been speculated that The 2 Johnnies left 2FM because of the new register of interests and because they would have to declare their outside earnings. Johnny said: \"Not really. That’s still all a bit unclear in terms of what people will have to declare. \"I’m not sure what way that’s going to play out. That’s not a main concern for us.\" Would they have stayed on 2FM for more money? Johnny said: \"No, money was never an issue.\" Two weeks after announcing their surprise exit, Johnny B and Johnny Smacks will front their afternoon radio show for the final time. The same day their album is released. He said: \"It will be emotional, it will be sad. We have come to love our team; Aifric, Aindriu, Caroline and Anita have been so supportive. \"Working with us has probably been different to working with other DJs because we have so much going on. They’ve been brilliant and they’ve adapted with us. \"We love our listeners and we really feel like we’ve created a bit of a community. \"There is a big crossover between our radio show and the podcast and the journey lives on in a different form. It’s been a brilliant two and a half years.\" The 2 Johnnies' often talked about, long-promised and much sweated-over debut album \"Small Town Heroes\" is released on 31st May 2024. Johnny said: \"We’re finally releasing our debut album. We’ve been going since 2016 and music is what really got us going. \"Younger people really took to them and they’ve taken on a life of their own. The songs on this album are an extension of the podcast, it’s about riding, shifting, drinking, fighting, farming, living in a small town, acting the maggot and driving around in a lowered Honda Civic.\" Johnny wants the album to be a summer hit. He said: \"You don’t know how an album is going to be received, we hope that it will become the soundtrack to people’s summers.\" Their album will be followed by a summer of big gigs in Dublin , Galway and Limerick as well as Australia and America . Their unique festival Pints in a Field will have Craig David and Five as special guests. Johnny said: \"We love doing Pints in a Field and who would have thought we’d have Craig David and Five playing with us. The acts we book for the festival are based on the podcast. \"We had Basshunter last year because we had so many stories about him sent in to us. Whoever people are talking about over the next few months, that’s who will be playing with us next year.\" The album will be available to stream and to buy from Irish retailers on Vinyl and CD from 31st May. To celebrate the release the lads will be hitting the road to meet the fans and will be signing copies of their album in record stores around the country. Anyone who pre-ordered the album will also have access to a free gig.",

        "description": "O'Hoppe, 24, has still caught just 98 games in the majors. Refusing to use his inexperience as an excuse, O'Hoppe said he hasn't lived up to his own expectations in terms of helping the pitching staff.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM — A month ago the Angels were swept by the Minnesota Twins , allowing 11 runs in the series finale. It was one of the lowest points of a mostly disappointing two months. For more than a half hour after that Sunday afternoon game, catcher Logan O’Hoppe sat in the Angels dugout conferring with bench coach Ray Montgomery. O’Hoppe then spoke to reporters and took responsibility for the flood of runs and hits they allowed. “When there’s a crooked number under hits on the scoreboard, it’s not fun and you do feel guilty about it,” O’Hoppe said that day. “You do a lot of work to make sure that doesn’t happen. It’s part of my job. That’s why I’m here, to win games and get these guys through it, and I’m not happy with how I’ve been doing it.” Since that day, the Angels pitching has shown a few more encouraging signs, although the results still aren’t what the Angels need them to be. The same can be said for O’Hoppe’s role in the process. “I’m not gonna sit there and tell you that I feel like I’m doing more good than bad right now,” the 24-year-old catcher said this weekend. “I feel like I’m definitely feeling the inexperience and opportunities to grow more than I am confirming the things that work. It’s just something I’m trying to be patient with. I’m not gonna lie. It’s taken a toll on me mentally.” Any discussion of O’Hoppe’s role the performance of the Angels pitchers requires some nuance. First, no one would suggest that the primary responsibility for pitching strategy falls on anyone but the pitcher who has the ball in his hand. Also, no one who has spent any time around O’Hoppe has any doubt in the work he puts in toward learning his pitchers and devising a game plan. In fact, one of the reasons the pitchers like O’Hoppe so much is because they feel how invested he is in their performance. That said, O’Hoppe acknowledges that he hasn’t lived up to his own expectations in terms of handling the pitching staff. “I think it’s all a learning process,” O’Hoppe said. “I know this position carries a lot of weight and a lot of responsibility, and that’s the part I really do love. It’s heavier than I expected. I’m sure some of that is self-inflicted. It’s just it’s not fun looking up and seeing crooked numbers on the board. Then you have a start like (José) Soriano’s in Cleveland and it all balances out. I know I’m inexperienced. I know I have a lot to learn, but at the same time, I’m trying to stick to what I know works personally and work with them.” O’Hoppe was behind the plate when Soriano threw six scoreless innings on May 3 at Cleveland, just a few days after that nightmare against the Twins. He was the catcher for all three of the Angels shutouts, including the Soriano start in Cleveland, a Reid Detmers start on April 12 in Boston and a Patrick Sandoval start on May 7 in Pittsburgh. Left-hander Tyler Anderson, who has been the Angels most consistent starter all season, said last week in an interview on MLB Network Radio that O’Hoppe has improved. “From where he was last year to this year, he’s made massive strides on the catching side,” Anderson said. Still, the Angels have a 4.64 ERA, which ranks 27th in the majors. According to some in and around the clubhouse, there have been times when pitch selection has been an issue, as well as execution. Since the establishment of the pitch timer last year, it’s more difficult than ever for pitchers to shake off a sign until they get what they want. Mound visits are now limited to four per game, further impacting the ability of a pitcher and catcher to get on the same page when there are disagreements. Back in 2022, the Angels ranked ninth in the majors in ERA. Most of the pitch calling that season was handled by veteran catchers Max Stassi and Kurt Suzuki. Stassi’s unplanned absence last year left O’Hoppe as the No. 1 catcher, and then he missed four months of the season rehabbing from shoulder surgery. O’Hoppe said he felt like he was trying to take in so much information in such a short time that it was like “drinking out of a fire hose.” Over the winter the Angels’ front office decided not to provide O’Hoppe with a veteran mentor. Catchers Austin Hedges and Martin Maldonado, for example, were both available as free agents. Instead, the Angels are trying to speed up the learning curve by giving O’Hoppe every inning he can handle. He’s started 41 of the Angels’ 53 games. His 369-1/3 innings behind the plate are tied for the fourth most in the majors. Even with a heavy workload this season, O’Hoppe has caught just 98 games in the majors, which is not even one full season for a No. 1 catcher. O’Hoppe acknowledges that he’s still learning, although grudgingly. “I pride of myself for not making excuses,” he said. “Because I’m here; I need to win games and be the best I can be. I do tell myself that (I’m inexperienced) but I don’t think that’s any reason to justify any poor performance or excuse.” Instead of shrugging off the disappointment and chalking it up to growing pains, O’Hoppe said he brings the games home with him. He analyzes the games long after they’re over to see what he could have done differently. “It’s tough to wind down some nights,” O’Hoppe said, “but I know it’s part of it.” O’Hoppe is also going through all of this with a new staff around him. Pitching coach Barry Enright and bullpen coach Steve Karsay, as well as run prevention coordinator Alex Cultice, are all new to the mix of voices in O’Hoppe’s head as he decides which pitches to call more than 120 times a night. Without a veteran catcher to help, O’Hoppe said he’s frequently communicated with Suzuki — now a member of the Angels’ front office — as well as catching coach Jerry Narron and backup catcher Matt Thaiss. Manager Ron Washington neither blamed nor absolved O’Hoppe for the performance of the pitching staff. It is a simple fact that the catcher and pitcher work together, and in this case there’s plenty of inexperience on both sides.

        "description": "O'Hoppe, 24, has still caught just 98 games in the majors. Refusing to use his inexperience as an excuse, O'Hoppe said he hasn't lived up to his own expectations in terms of helping the pitching staff.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM — A month ago the Angels were swept by the Minnesota Twins , allowing 11 runs in the series finale. It was one of the lowest points of a mostly disappointing two months. For more than a half hour after that Sunday afternoon game, catcher Logan O’Hoppe sat in the Angels dugout conferring with bench coach Ray Montgomery. O’Hoppe then spoke to reporters and took responsibility for the flood of runs and hits they allowed. “When there’s a crooked number under hits on the scoreboard, it’s not fun and you do feel guilty about it,” O’Hoppe said that day. “You do a lot of work to make sure that doesn’t happen. It’s part of my job. That’s why I’m here, to win games and get these guys through it, and I’m not happy with how I’ve been doing it.” Since that day, the Angels pitching has shown a few more encouraging signs, although the results still aren’t what the Angels need them to be. The same can be said for O’Hoppe’s role in the process. “I’m not gonna sit there and tell you that I feel like I’m doing more good than bad right now,” the 24-year-old catcher said this weekend. “I feel like I’m definitely feeling the inexperience and opportunities to grow more than I am confirming the things that work. It’s just something I’m trying to be patient with. I’m not gonna lie. It’s taken a toll on me mentally.” Any discussion of O’Hoppe’s role the performance of the Angels pitchers requires some nuance. First, no one would suggest that the primary responsibility for pitching strategy falls on anyone but the pitcher who has the ball in his hand. Also, no one who has spent any time around O’Hoppe has any doubt in the work he puts in toward learning his pitchers and devising a game plan. In fact, one of the reasons the pitchers like O’Hoppe so much is because they feel how invested he is in their performance. That said, O’Hoppe acknowledges that he hasn’t lived up to his own expectations in terms of handling the pitching staff. “I think it’s all a learning process,” O’Hoppe said. “I know this position carries a lot of weight and a lot of responsibility, and that’s the part I really do love. It’s heavier than I expected. I’m sure some of that is self-inflicted. It’s just it’s not fun looking up and seeing crooked numbers on the board. Then you have a start like (José) Soriano’s in Cleveland and it all balances out. I know I’m inexperienced. I know I have a lot to learn, but at the same time, I’m trying to stick to what I know works personally and work with them.” O’Hoppe was behind the plate when Soriano threw six scoreless innings on May 3 at Cleveland, just a few days after that nightmare against the Twins. He was the catcher for all three of the Angels shutouts, including the Soriano start in Cleveland, a Reid Detmers start on April 12 in Boston and a Patrick Sandoval start on May 7 in Pittsburgh. Left-hander Tyler Anderson, who has been the Angels most consistent starter all season, said last week in an interview on MLB Network Radio that O’Hoppe has improved. “From where he was last year to this year, he’s made massive strides on the catching side,” Anderson said. Still, the Angels have a 4.64 ERA, which ranks 27th in the majors. According to some in and around the clubhouse, there have been times when pitch selection has been an issue, as well as execution. Since the establishment of the pitch timer last year, it’s more difficult than ever for pitchers to shake off a sign until they get what they want. Mound visits are now limited to four per game, further impacting the ability of a pitcher and catcher to get on the same page when there are disagreements. Back in 2022, the Angels ranked ninth in the majors in ERA. Most of the pitch calling that season was handled by veteran catchers Max Stassi and Kurt Suzuki. Stassi’s unplanned absence last year left O’Hoppe as the No. 1 catcher, and then he missed four months of the season rehabbing from shoulder surgery. O’Hoppe said he felt like he was trying to take in so much information in such a short time that it was like “drinking out of a fire hose.” Over the winter the Angels’ front office decided not to provide O’Hoppe with a veteran mentor. Catchers Austin Hedges and Martin Maldonado, for example, were both available as free agents. Instead, the Angels are trying to speed up the learning curve by giving O’Hoppe every inning he can handle. He’s started 41 of the Angels’ 53 games. His 369-1/3 innings behind the plate are tied for the fourth most in the majors. Even with a heavy workload this season, O’Hoppe has caught just 98 games in the majors, which is not even one full season for a No. 1 catcher. O’Hoppe acknowledges that he’s still learning, although grudgingly. “I pride of myself for not making excuses,” he said. “Because I’m here; I need to win games and be the best I can be. I do tell myself that (I’m inexperienced) but I don’t think that’s any reason to justify any poor performance or excuse.” Instead of shrugging off the disappointment and chalking it up to growing pains, O’Hoppe said he brings the games home with him. He analyzes the games long after they’re over to see what he could have done differently. “It’s tough to wind down some nights,” O’Hoppe said, “but I know it’s part of it.” O’Hoppe is also going through all of this with a new staff around him. Pitching coach Barry Enright and bullpen coach Steve Karsay, as well as run prevention coordinator Alex Cultice, are all new to the mix of voices in O’Hoppe’s head as he decides which pitches to call more than 120 times a night. Without a veteran catcher to help, O’Hoppe said he’s frequently communicated with Suzuki — now a member of the Angels’ front office — as well as catching coach Jerry Narron and backup catcher Matt Thaiss. Manager Ron Washington neither blamed nor absolved O’Hoppe for the performance of the pitching staff. It is a simple fact that the catcher and pitcher work together, and in this case there’s plenty of inexperience on both sides.

        "description": "Luciana Lourencao, 37, was the first woman to finish the May 5 half-marathon.",
        "content": "He really was entitled. The Brazilian mom whose kids almost stopped her from winning a half-marathon has defended her husband from getting all the blame — saying he was merely following her wishes, which unexpectedly changed when she found herself in first place. Luciana Lourencao, 37, posted a video Sunday to explain the now-viral moment when her husband, businessman Pedro Lourencao, shoved their young daughters her way as she raced to the finish line of the Presidente Prudente race on May 5. “We decided to take the girls to the race so that I could cross the finish line with them,” the personal trainer said, according to a translation by Newsflash. “I wasn’t competing for money, it was a race in my city, and I thought it would have been really nice and cool to create this moment with the children,” she said, insisting the decision was hers. To her surprise, however, Luciana found herself just seconds away from being the first woman to cross the finish line – with another female runner hot on her trail. That was the only reason she ran aside her kids as they rushed out with open arms — not because she was angry at them or her husband, whom online critics ripped as being “entitled” and worthy of divorce. “I needed to get there and that was it. I saw the girls quickly, but I couldn’t stop,” the running mom said in her Instagram update. “The children understood and were not upset. I explained to them that it is very tiring and difficult to run a half marathon,” Luciana maintained. Pedro, 43, said he finds it too painful looking at the comments to their now-viral video. “They kept calling me a saboteur. But they should know that it was this ‘saboteur’ who made two calls so that Luciana could participate in the race, since registration had ended,” he said. “I did everything to get her to go. On Sundays, when she goes to train, we are without her, and I am the one who stays with the girls, and I do so with the greatest pleasure,” he said. Critics were even further off the mark with wild guesses about a bald man Lourencao was seen hugging at the end of the race before turning back to her husband and kids, the shocked mom said. It was not a secret lover — just her brother. “He ran with me just to give me support and encouragement,” she said of her supportive sibling. “He ‘braked’ just before the finish line, so as ‘not to steal my shine’. He was the one I hugged.”",

        "description": "Following the death of NBA legend Bill Walton, Magic Johnson, Julius Erving and more are paying tribute.",
        "content": "It’s rarely ever easy when fans must say goodbye to a beloved sports icon, and today is such an occasion. We have confirmation that legendary NBA center Bill Walton has sadly died at the age of 71. Per the news, the beloved athlete passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer and was surrounded by family and friends at the time. Since the news of Walton’s death broke, numerous fans, sports pundits, current and former players alike have reached out and paid tribute to the hall of famer. And among them are the likes of Magic Johnson Julius “Dr. J” Erving. Magic Johnson, one of the NBA GOATS , is certainly someone who’s had a fair amount of encounters with Bill Walton during his lifetime. The revered athletes played each other more than a few times throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s. And, even after their NBA stints ended, the two remained good friends. Upon learning of his comrade’s passing, Johnson took to X to pay tribute: Rest in peace to a friend, 2X NBA Champion, Hall of Famer, and one of the most skilled centers we’ve ever seen Bill Walton! His NCAA Championship performance as a UCLA Bruin against Memphis is by far the most dominate NCAA Championship performance ever - he shot 21 for 22 and had... May 27, 2024 Julius \"Dr. J.\" Erving also crossed paths with the late basketball player during those aforementioned decades. He paid tribute with an Instagram post that included a sweet photo and caption: A post shared by Julius Erving (@juliuserving) A photo posted by on Born in La Mesa, California on November 5, 1952, the late 6’11” star played college basketball at UCLA, where he led his team to two consecutive championships in 1972 and 1973. While in school, he also won other honors, including three National college player of the year titles. He was ultimately drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers as the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft. As a Blazer, he became an NBA champion in 1977, even earning Finals MVP honors. Additionally, he was named league MVP, made two All-Star teams and reached other benchmarks while in Portland. After leaving the team in 1979, Bill Walton would have a six-year stint with the San Diego Clippers and spend three seasons with the Boston Celtics, where he’d win his second championship. The center retired in 1988 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. Since then, many continue to admire his heroics on the court, his work ethic and character. ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith, who’s known to reach out amid personal matters involving NBA players, shared his own tribute to Walton on X. Take a look: ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith, who’s known to reach out amid personal matters involving NBA players, shared his own tribute to Walton on X. Take a look: Incredibly sad to hear of the passing of my buddy, Bill Walton. His game was ahead of its time, truly one of the greatest big men who ever played. Yet, nothing compared to his passion and love of life, itself. I can hear him now imploring me to “smile......cherish... pic.twitter.com/IBI7Enjr5K May 27, 2024 The former Sixth Man of the Year receives a lot of respect from fellow centers, many of which he blazed a trail for (no pun intended). Fellow Celtic Kendrick Perkins – who works with Stephen A. Smith at ESPN – shared a message of admiration on X following the basketball legend’s death: Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Rest in Peace to the Legend Bill Walton!!! 🙏🏾 Bill Walton’s passing was confirmed by the National Basketball Association via a press release. It also included a statement from league commissioner Adam Silver, which was shared on Instagram . And he shared some respectful thoughts on the late Walton: Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. Of course, the player-turned-sports analyst ( who was hilarious on TV ) also garnered respect from athletes known for other sports. Former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman dropped a message of his own on X and added a sweet flourish to the message that alludes to the player’s past status as a Celtic: An absolute legend. RIP Bill Walton☘️ While it’s tough to have to bid farewell to such a beloved man of great character, it’s wonderful when people come together like this to pay tribute. It’s similar to how stars and fans memorialized the late Bill Russell after his passing, and paid tribute after Kobe Bryant's death . Bill Walton may be gone, but he surely won’t be forgotten. And we here at CinemaBlend extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and loved ones at this time.",

        "content": "AMERICA'S Got Talent has added to an important aspect on the show. Host Terry Crews praised the change and said it was necessary as Season 19 begins. The new season of AGT kicks off on Tuesday, May 28. Terry, 55, sat down with Great Day Hollywood to talk about the judges , the contestants, and the changes they will have this season. After saying that the current judges are the \"dream team,\" he opened up about how the Golden Buzzers will be different this season. The judges - Howie Mandel , Heidi Klum , Sofia Vergara , and Simon Cowell - along with Terry all get a Golden Buzzer. This sends an act that they deem worthy enough to go straight to the live shows without having to go through the rest of the auditions. Typically, the judges and host each get one, and some seasons, they do a group Golden Buzzer. But, for Season 19, there will be nine total Golden Buzzers. The judges will each have two while Terry has one. Terry explained why they upped the number of them. \"What would happen would be the judges would see all this tremendous talent and they would end up apologizing,\" he said. \"They're like, 'Man, if I had another one, I would hit it.'\" \"We said, 'Give them another one!\" Terry shouted. \"And what we found is that there was not one Golden Buzzer wasted because there's so many deserving talents out there.\" \"It's so incredible. I think that the show needed more and now we finally got it and I think everyone is going to be happy,\" Terry ended. What we found is that there was not one Golden Buzzer wasted because there's so many deserving talents out there The host also teased that this season will have the youngest ever contestant at 2 years old. Fans can watch the new season on Tuesday on NBC at 8/7c and the next day on Peacock . This new twist was first announced in March. Simon, 64, opened up about the change when he and his fellow judges were filming the current season. \"In the first two days we’ve used more Golden Buzzers than we’ve ever used - that’s got to be a good sign!” he told People . Simon also serves as the executive producer on the show. Season 19 will feature \"some of the wildest acts to ever grace the AGT stage,\" according to their logline.",

While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter,” the Asuza Police Department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Los Angeles, police said. Azusa police Lt. Jake Bushey said Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group . He was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Judge Judy Sheindlin is outraged by how out-of-control crime has engulfed some major cities in the United States — but it isn’t a surprise to her, either. “We got here because a small group of people who have very loud voices created a scenario where bad people got rewarded,” Sheindlin told Fox News . “And the victim got punished by the system.” The “scenario” the TV judge is referring to involves actor Steve Buscemi, who was randomly attacked in Manhattan earlier this month by an alleged assailant who would later be identified as a 50-year-old homeless man. While Sheindlin admitted that there are situations why some criminals become criminals, she argued that it shouldn’t always justify their actions, Fox News reported. “There is always a reason for criminal behaviour — didn’t have a good upbringing, didn’t have two parents in the house, didn’t have one parent in the house, there’s always a reason.” She continued: “You’re mentally ill. That’s a reason. You took drugs. That’s a reason. You took alcohol, your brain is fried... Whatever it is.” But she insisted there is “never an excuse for bad behaviour.” Sheindlin added: “And when society started to make excuses for bad behaviour, and react to criminality based upon the excuses, it fell apart.” A post shared by Judy Justice (@judyjustice) She then used New York as an example, after the state raised the minimum age to 18 from 16 for defendants to be prosecuted as adults in criminal cases. The judge called the age change “ridiculous,” adding that if a 17-year-old kills someone, they should “never be allowed to walk the street again because society can’t take a chance.” Sheindlin was also critical of some district attorneys. “When you have district attorneys who are charged, whose job it is to do justice but to keep the community safe... When you have elected district attorneys who don’t know what their job is, they should go find another job,” she said. “Fill ice cream cones someplace. But don’t ruin cities,” she added. “What’s happened around New York City, Portland, San Francisco, you had district attorneys who didn’t know what their job was. And the cities are ruined, people are leaving.” Sheindlin added: “I think we better get smarter before we get lost. Permanently lost.” Sheindlin is currently in her third season of Judy Justice, following her 25-year Judge Judy run. She recalled an interview she did with Morley Safer on 60 Minutes in 1993 where he asked her what family court would be like in the future. “I said, ‘worse. A lot worse,’” she recounted. “And that’s what happened.” She added: “Here we are, 30 years later, and are we in worse shape as a country, as a world, than we were in 1993? You bet your bottom we are.”",

        "content": "SAN DIEGO ( KSWB/KUSI ) — A Carnival cruise ship responded to calls for help and detoured from its normal vacation route on Saturday to help two dozen people stranded at sea off the coast of Mexico. Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

        "content": "High Power Charging (HPC) available from 0.26 EUR per kilowatt hour (kWh) New IONITY PASSPORT MOTION and IONITY PASSPORT POWER tariffs are designed to cater flexibly to individual charging needs, especially during the upcoming travel season Competitive charging prices and growing IONITY network with up to 350 kW accelerate sustainable mobility across Europe Munich, Germany — IONITY is making High Power Charging (HPC) with up to 350 kW affordable for everyone.

        "content": "DALLAS — Karl-Anthony Towns had seemingly bested his postseason demons through the first two rounds of this year’s playoffs. Sure, there were a few offensive clunkers mixed in, but in general, the all-star big man was great on defense — where he took on marquee matchups — and on the glass and delivered offensively when needed. He helped slam the door on Phoenix in Game 4 of the first-round series sweep. He shot 51 percent from the floor and 39 percent from deep against Denver in the Western Conference semifinals. ADVERTISEMENT After his fair share of past playoff struggles, Towns had apparently found a comfort level on the sport’s biggest, brightest stages. But the Western Conference Finals have told a different story. Through three games — all Wolves losses — Towns is shooting 28 percent from the field and 14 percent from 3-point range. His offensive struggles bottomed out in Sunday’s Game 3 when the big man went 0 for 8 shooting from 3-point range. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch admitted it was “hard to watch” Towns struggle at times Sunday. “He had enough buckets here and there. Defensively, in the second half, I was really pleased with the way he played, rebounding pretty well,” Finch said. “But yeah, he’s struggling. There’s no doubt in that right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Finch felt Towns was rushing his shots earlier in the series. He didn’t think that was the case Sunday, which makes the results all the more inexplicable. One of the NBA’s premiere 3-point shooters missed the rim on multiple good looks from beyond the arc. “He had a couple of good looks and needed those to go down, particularly earlier in the game,” Finch said. And Towns assumed they would. “I feel every shot’s good. I’ve shot a lot of basketballs in my life. I’m the first one in the gym. I definitely am working. I’m shooting. Every time I’m shooting, it feels good,” Towns said. “I’m just having these very unfortunate bounces all the time. It’s annoying. The last game, first shot of the game goes in-out, in-out, in-out. This game, my first shot is a free throw and it goes in-out. I don’t mean to smile, but I’ve just got to laugh at it right now. It’s very disappointing.” ADVERTISEMENT Towns said his confidence level remains “extremely high.” He noted he’s putting up “1,500 shots a day,” a fact the Inside the NBA television crew vehemently disputed after Game 3. Regardless, Towns has a large body of work upon which he can rely to know future shots will fall. Wolves forward Kyle Anderson agreed 3-point shots will go down for Towns. But there are certainly other ways he can get himself going in the meantime. That was evident in the third quarter Sunday, when — after Dallas big man Dereck Lively left the game due to injury — Towns started to go downhill aggressively in an effort to attack the rack. “Put me in spots where I was getting the ball in the mid-post, Dallas action,” Towns said, “and I was utilizing that one-two step to the basket for my advantage.” Perhaps more of that will be required until Towns regains his shooting touch. Because this much is apparent – if Towns can’t find ways to be an offensive contributor, it will be difficult for the Wolves to extend their season. There simply aren’t enough shooters or offensive creators for Minnesota to survive these major lulls from its all-star big man. ADVERTISEMENT Take the second half Sunday, for example. When Towns was 3 for 4 from the field with nine points in the third period, the Wolves dropped 35 points in the quarter — their most impressive offensive segment of the series. When Towns is rolling, it opens up the floor for everyone else — starting with Anthony Edwards. But, in the fourth quarter, Towns regressed again, going 0 for 4 shooting from the field, and Minnesota scored just 20 points in the period en route to another crushing defeat. If Dallas doesn’t have to account for Towns on offense, the floor shrinks for Minnesota in short order. Towns has shot below 35 percent from the floor in nine of his 30 career playoff games, and the Wolves are 0-9 in those games. ADVERTISEMENT “I think KAT gotta just do a better job of maybe getting back to his old self, of finding himself around the basket more. Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "DALLAS — Karl-Anthony Towns had seemingly bested his postseason demons through the first two rounds of this year’s playoffs. Sure, there were a few offensive clunkers mixed in, but in general, the all-star big man was great on defense — where he took on marquee matchups — and on the glass and delivered offensively when needed. He helped slam the door on Phoenix in Game 4 of the first-round series sweep. He shot 51 percent from the floor and 39 percent from deep against Denver in the Western Conference semifinals. ADVERTISEMENT After his fair share of past playoff struggles, Towns had apparently found a comfort level on the sport’s biggest, brightest stages. But the Western Conference Finals have told a different story. Through three games — all Wolves losses — Towns is shooting 28 percent from the field and 14 percent from 3-point range. His offensive struggles bottomed out in Sunday’s Game 3 when the big man went 0 for 8 shooting from 3-point range. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch admitted it was “hard to watch” Towns struggle at times Sunday. “He had enough buckets here and there. Defensively, in the second half, I was really pleased with the way he played, rebounding pretty well,” Finch said. “But yeah, he’s struggling. There’s no doubt in that right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Finch felt Towns was rushing his shots earlier in the series. He didn’t think that was the case Sunday, which makes the results all the more inexplicable. One of the NBA’s premiere 3-point shooters missed the rim on multiple good looks from beyond the arc. “He had a couple of good looks and needed those to go down, particularly earlier in the game,” Finch said. And Towns assumed they would. “I feel every shot’s good. I’ve shot a lot of basketballs in my life. I’m the first one in the gym. I definitely am working. I’m shooting. Every time I’m shooting, it feels good,” Towns said. “I’m just having these very unfortunate bounces all the time. It’s annoying. The last game, first shot of the game goes in-out, in-out, in-out. This game, my first shot is a free throw and it goes in-out. I don’t mean to smile, but I’ve just got to laugh at it right now. It’s very disappointing.” ADVERTISEMENT Towns said his confidence level remains “extremely high.” He noted he’s putting up “1,500 shots a day,” a fact the Inside the NBA television crew vehemently disputed after Game 3. Regardless, Towns has a large body of work upon which he can rely to know future shots will fall. Wolves forward Kyle Anderson agreed 3-point shots will go down for Towns. But there are certainly other ways he can get himself going in the meantime. That was evident in the third quarter Sunday, when — after Dallas big man Dereck Lively left the game due to injury — Towns started to go downhill aggressively in an effort to attack the rack. “Put me in spots where I was getting the ball in the mid-post, Dallas action,” Towns said, “and I was utilizing that one-two step to the basket for my advantage.” Perhaps more of that will be required until Towns regains his shooting touch. Because this much is apparent – if Towns can’t find ways to be an offensive contributor, it will be difficult for the Wolves to extend their season. There simply aren’t enough shooters or offensive creators for Minnesota to survive these major lulls from its all-star big man. ADVERTISEMENT Take the second half Sunday, for example. When Towns was 3 for 4 from the field with nine points in the third period, the Wolves dropped 35 points in the quarter — their most impressive offensive segment of the series. When Towns is rolling, it opens up the floor for everyone else — starting with Anthony Edwards. But, in the fourth quarter, Towns regressed again, going 0 for 4 shooting from the field, and Minnesota scored just 20 points in the period en route to another crushing defeat. If Dallas doesn’t have to account for Towns on offense, the floor shrinks for Minnesota in short order. Towns has shot below 35 percent from the floor in nine of his 30 career playoff games, and the Wolves are 0-9 in those games. ADVERTISEMENT “I think KAT gotta just do a better job of maybe getting back to his old self, of finding himself around the basket more. Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "A coroner's inquest into the death of Haven Dubois is underway at the Royal Hotel in Regina. Dubois was 14 when he was found unresponsive in Pilot Butte Creek, in the east end of Regina, on May 20, 2015. A coroner's report prepared in 2016 found Haven's death to be an accidental drowning and listed marijuana use as a contributing factor. Regina police ruled out foul play in their investigation. Public inquest scheduled in death of 14-year-old who drowned in Regina creek in 2015 Since Haven's death his mother, Richelle Dubois, who began testifying today, has insisted there is more to the story. So far, her testimony has covered the morning leading up to her son's death. She spent more than a decade advocating for further investigation into his death, and took part in the Justice for Our Stolen Children camp outside the Saskatchewan Legislature in 2018. Richelle Dubois, mother of Haven Dubois, has spent years pushing for further investigation into what happened to her son in 2015. (Laura Sciarpelletti/CBC) In 2023, the family marched to Ottawa to call for a national inquiry into missing, murdered and neglected Indigenous boys, men and two-spirited people. On Monday morning, more than nine year's after Haven's death, the inquest, presided over by Coroner Brent Gough, got underway. Six people, four men and two women, were chosen to sit on the inquest jury, including three who are Indigenous. Family of Haven Dubois marching to Ottawa to call for national inquiry Over the next four days they will hear from 13 witnesses before determining who died, when and where that person died and the medical cause and manner of death. They could also provide recommendations so that similar deaths do not occur in the future.",

        "content": "It's about time that we got new smartwatches from Samsung. The company has been working on a new lineup that we now know includes the and Watch 7 Ultra models. As it stands, the company is expected to unveil these devices at its Unpacked event on July 10, where it's also going to unveil the new foldable phones. The Galaxy Watch lineup has been due for a design upgrade. The recent models have largely looked the same. Admittedly, there's only so much you can do, design-wise, on a device that as small as a smartwatch. Samsung has made efforts over the years, fine-tuning and making adjustments while retaining the circular design that has made its smartwatches so popular. Smartwatches came in all shorts of shapes back when the Galaxy Watch was trying to establish a footing in the market. Samsung made the conscious decision of choosing a circular shape, one that made it look like a conventional watch the most. Even though regular watches are also available in a wide variety of unique styles, it's the circular that remains the most popular. Evidently, the idea from the get-go has been to provide customers with a familiar look and feel while offering them functionality that one simply doesn't get on a conventional watch. Since the Galaxy Watch series went circular in its design language there haven't been very many significant changes, but that's now set to change. The first show an entirely new design. It's a mix of squarish and circular, certainly unique as far as smartwatches are concerned, but horologically-inclined would be quick to see the similarities between this design and that of some conventional watches, particularly those from Swiss watchmaker Panerai. Panerai's smartwatches, particularly the Luminor series, is instantly recongizable because of its squarish and circular design. It's one of those few watch lineups that have retained their iconic design over decades. Others that come to mind include the Rolex Submariner, the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, and the Patek Philippe Nautilus. The Luminor watches from Panerai are well known for their cushion-like cases with a circular dial and a distinct bridge that protects the crown. If you look at these watches close enough, it's easy to see where some inspiration has been drawn from for the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra. Sure enough, Samsung's smartwatches haven't had a “crown” like the Apple Watch, but the addition of a new button in the center is just as close to putting a digital crown on the smartwatch as Samsung has come. It's not a bad thing that the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra seems to be inspired by an iconic watch lineup, on the contrary, I think that it'll make watch lovers like myself gain more interest in smartwatches. For far too long, device makers have approached smartwatch design the same way as they have for smartphones and other products. Watches are supposed to be far more evocative. They can be heirlooms passed in the family for generations, incredible works of mechanical engineering, pieces of jewelry decked out with the finest gems, and they can also be signs of success. Smartwatches may be able to do a lot more than a normal watch, but they've remained soulless products, devoid of the capability to foster any emotion or connection in users. They'll just get rid of the one they bought last year to get the latest one that's come out this year. You don't see many people doing that with an Audemars or a Patek. That's not to say that the changes Samsung has made to the design of puts it in the same league as those giants, but at least now it doesn't look like yet another cookie-cutter smartwatch. Ever since smartwatches took off it felt like regardless of the manufacturer, they were there to confine regular watches to the dustbin of history. There was a sense of arrogance about them, that since they could help keep the user connected 24/7, regular watches will have no place in the future. On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra's inspiration appears to have been drawn from a place of respect. It doesn't seek to destroy an established order, rather, it pays homage to the centuries-old tradition of watchmaking that have given us some truly amazing designs. I've said it before, the key to getting more regular watch users to buy a smartwatch is to make them look a lot more like conventional watches. Samsung has clearly seen that this approach works, its circular models have remained a customer favorite, so it's now kicking things up a notch and adopting a design language that's highly regarded among the watch lover community. It's as if the new smartwatch from Samsung is striking a balance between being unapologetically tech-forward with , larger display, and improved battery life, while being respectful of the conventional watch industry. I imagine that a lot more regular watch owners will look at the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra and want to buy one, because it provides them with a chance to experience something new on something that doesn't look too foreign. I know I will, I've been literally craving this smartwatch ever since the leaked renders surfaced online. Will others feel the same way? Only time (pun intended) will tell.",

        "content": "As a female has clashed with yet another star, this time K-Pop singer Yoona, we're taking a look at all of the celebrities Marking her the third incident in the spotlight, an anonymous security guard at the once again clashed with a star on the red carpet. Throughout the annual film festival - which ran from May 14 to 25 in Cannes, - the unnamed guard has been caught in tension-filled moments with Yoona, Destiny's Child star , and actress Massiel Taveras. The first instance that sparked tension on the red carpet was when Destiny's Child star Kelly Rowland was seen getting into a heated confrontation with the security guard after feeling targeted while attending the ceremony. During the incident, Kelly was climbing the steps of the ceremony. Kelly shared a tense confrontation with the guard in which Kelly was seen turning and wagging her finger in her face. Later Kelly opened up about the tense interaction as she claimed that the security guard wasn't scolding people who \"didn't look like her.\" In an interview with the singer said: \"That woman knows what happened. I know what happened. I have a boundary and I stand by those boundaries,\" and added: \"There were other women that attended that carpet who did not quite look like me and they didn’t get scolded, or pushed off, or told to get off. I stood my ground and she felt like she had to stand hers. But I stood my ground.” After the encounter, a lip reader told Page Six that Kelly said: \"Don’t talk to me like that. Don’t talk to me like that. You’re not my mother. I told you not to talk to me like that.\" However, the star has not confirmed if that's what she said during their conversation. Dominican actress Massiel Taveras seemed to find herself in a very similar situation as Kelly on the red carpet as she was captured having a heated encounter with the same guard. In a viral clip on X, formerly Twitter, the star was seen walking down the red carpet in a white gown with a massive train featuring what seemed to be the face of Jesus on it that she was unfolding when she was scolded by the employee. As she went up the stars, Massiel was seen talking to the security guard as the guard held her arm up attempting to rush her up the stairs. And as she paused to attempt to situate her dress, Massiel was seen shoving the security guard's arm way from her. After this, Massiel turned to wave to her fans before the guard once again put her arm up and tried to move her from the carpet. Neither party has spoken out on the encounter since it took place. In the last and most recent incident, famous K-Pop singer Yoona was seen climbing the steps of the venue and turning to wave to fans just for the staffer to block her with her arm and usher her away. While Yonna didn't exchange any words with the guard, it was clear that she was frustrated and upset by the encounter from her facial expression and body language. Yoona has yet to speak out on the incident. Following all of the controversy, many fans are calling for the security guard to be fired from her position after so many tense encounters. In the wake of all the news, the security guard's fellow staffer spoke out and defended her actions in the incident involving Kelly. The unnamed employee told the : \"She was an usher working under a lot of pressure to keep people on the carpet moving, so as to stop crowds building up,\" and added: \"There was no pushing or shoving, or scolding. Security and safety are the priorities, along with keeping to strict timetables set according to contracts — even the celebrities have to stick to the rules.\"",

In March, Helen revealed she suffered a psychotic breakdown at the beginning of the year after splitting from her ex of 13 years, Scott Sinclair. And the former Coronation Street star, 33, took to Instagram on Sunday to share that she feels like a 'horrible mummy' being away from her kids - Charlie, six, and Matilda, eight - when they spend time with their father Scott. Helen shared an adorable video with her son, as she admitted 'not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls' due to splitting from Scott when her youngest was just one. 'Not seen my babies for 11 days as they were in Dubai with their daddy x,' Helen wrote. 'I feel such a horrible mummy for not seeing them and guilty but I think it's important for them to have a nice time with their daddy. Helen Flanagan shared a candid post on Instagram on Sunday about the 'mum guilt' she feels over her youngest child Charlie as she opened up about life as a single mother The former Coronation Street star, 33, took to Instagram on Sunday to share that she feels like a 'horrible mummy' being away from her kids - Charlie, six, and Matilda, eight - when they spend time with their father Scott 'I suppose mum guilt never goes no matter what you do x They went on holiday with their lovely nanna too which helps me as I get lots of pictures of them looking really happy x.' In the video shared by Helen, she looked angelic in a floaty white summer halterneck summer dress, as she curled her blonde locks and tied them up with a ribbon. Her and Charlie shared a sweet moment as they cuddled on a picnic blanket and made funny faces together. Of her own health following her breakdown earlier this year, Helen said in her post: ' Feeling in such a better place then I did this time last year and I think it's just time, it's a massive healer and I look back at myself this time last year and I can give myself kindness and compassion for maybe looking for love in the wrong places and numbing how I felt x. ' As mummys we just do our best at that time x. Maybe I've not always got it right but always had the right intentions x. I feel like I've changed so many times since Matilda was born and that we have grown together and our bond is really special x.' Helen opened up about going through her separation from Scott while Charlie was a baby, saying: ' Charlie was one when me and his dad split and I remember in the build up to us separating I was still breast feeding and I couldn't get my baby boy off the boob and it made me feel quite trapped and stuck as I couldn't do anything on my own independently as my baby needed to be stuck with me all the time and he would just cry for me and maybe because everything felt a lot emotionally when I finally got Charlie off the boob at 14months with help from a nanny. In March, Helen revealed she suffered a psychotic breakdown at the beginning of the year after splitting from her ex of 13 years, Scott Sinclair (Pictured in 2019) Helen shared an adorable video with her son, as she admitted 'not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls' due to splitting from Scott when her youngest was just one 'Not seen my babies for 11 days as they were in Dubai with their daddy x,' Helen wrote In the video shared by Helen, she looked angelic in a floaty white summer halterneck summer dress, as she curled her blonde locks and tied them up with a ribbon Of her own health following her breakdown earlier this year, Helen said in her post: ' Feeling in such a better place then I did this time last year and I think it's just time' 'I needed my space to get my head together and to feel like my own person and not just a mother but a woman too x. 'I do feel guilty for maybe not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls. I struggled to sit and just play with him.' She added: 'To be honest I struggled to be in the house too much as it all felt a bit sad. Their daddy moved away for football and originally he surprised me with our family home that me and the kids live in and I suppose at the beginning I just didn't want to take on the reality that it really was just me now and the three little ones. 'That was just a bit much for me. The beginning of the year was tricky and I felt so guilty for not being my best. 'I know I'll have such a beautiful relationship with Charlie and the girls. Feel in such a happier place this summer and I'm so grateful ✨.' The heartfelt post comes after she revealed the heartbreaking details of a psychotic breakdown she suffered earlier this year. Taking to Instagram in March, Helen revealed that across January and February she was fighting a secret battle with her mental health after her split from Scott Sinclair. Helen has admitted just how scary the breakdown was as she revealed she was seeing things and felt like she was in danger all the time after having a reaction to her ADHD medication (pictured her children Matilda, eight, Delilah, five, and Charlie, two) The couple called it quits on their relationship back in 2022 after spending 13 years together but are in a better place to co-parent now After suffering a bad reaction to her medication as she explained: 'It was really sad and very scary. I was seeing things and I felt like I was in danger all the time' And now she has admitted just how scary the breakdown was as she revealed she was seeing things and felt like she was in danger all the time after having a reaction to her ADHD medication. Opening up the The Mirror , she confessed she struggled to deal with the split: 'I don't see it as a break-up, I see it as a divorce. We were together 13 years. But instead of processing it all, I threw myself into work and shut off my emotions. 'I just went into survival mode. Then it all came to the surface earlier this year and I was mentally and physically breaking down.' She then started medicating for her ADHD and suffered a bad reaction to her medication as she explained: 'It was really sad and very scary. I was seeing things and I felt like I was in danger all the time.' Whilst in the grasps of her episode, Helen jetted to Bali with her kids Matilda, eight, Delilah, five, and Charlie, two, who she shares with ex Scott. Helen didn't have her children over Christmas as they were with their father so she decided to take them to the sunny destination for a special New Years. During the trip, she shared a slew of sweet snaps - with smiles hiding her hidden pain following the painful break-up from her ex and her new life as a single mum. While she did not comment on her battle at the time, she was the grasp of a psychotic breakdown due to unresolved trauma surrounding her split.

The 23-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., showed some rust in letting a 4-2 lead in the first set slip away before recovering. She elevated her game in a dominant second set and wrapped up the win in 94 minutes. Andreescu, who hadn't played since sustaining a back injury at the National Bank Open in Montreal last August, will face No. 23 seed Anna Kalinskaya of Russia in the second round on Thursday. The former world No. 4 and 2019 U.S. Open champion is looking to advance past the third round at Roland-Garros for the first time in her career. Andreescu's result was part of a successful day for Canadians at the clay-court Grand Slam with Felix Auger-Aliassime, Leylah Fernandez and Denis Shapovalov, all posting comfortable wins. Montreal's Auger-Aliassime was a 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 winner over Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka, while Fernandez, from Laval, Que., downed Jessika Ponchet of France 6-2, 6-0. Auger-Aliassime fired seven aces and won 84 per cent of his first serves in a match marred by two rain delays. Fernandez, meanwhile, opened with her first of five breaks in a match that took just 69 minutes to complete. Neither Auger-Aliassime nor Fernandez faced break point. Auger-Aliassime, seeded 21st in Paris, will next face German qualifier Henn Squire. The 31st-seeded Fernandez will next play China's Wang Xiyu. Later Monday, Shapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., beat Luca Van Assche of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, completing a clean sweep for Canada, as not one Canadian player dropped a set in four matches.

        "content": "After making his mark on numerous classic projects and memorable moments in the Ghanaian music scene, the talented and versatile artist Dayonthetrack embarks on a new journey with his mixtape/EP titled “Black & White: Before the Tape.” This release paves the way for his highly anticipated debut album. Dayonthetrack is set to release an exciting 5-song project on May 24, 2024, featuring impressive collaborations that promise to create a significant buzz in the rapidly growing industry. “Black & White: Before the Tape” boasts a diverse lineup blending hip-hop, trap soul, afropop, and afro fusion. The first track, “Life Lessons,” reflects on Dayonthetrack’s journey, addressing betrayal and his experiences in the industry. He poignantly describes the industry as a “burrow filled with poisonous snakes” and discusses spiritual maturity, enlightenment, and the pressures from younger family members who look up to him. He offers advice on navigating the treacherous nature of the music world. The second song, “Sticky Situation,” features one of Ghana’s top rappers, Kofi Mole. This track hints at Dayonthetrack’s experiences with his former label, with lyrics like “now we no be friends” suggesting it addresses rumours surrounding the GROUND UP CHALE label artists. Despite Dayonthetrack denying these speculations, the song clearly comes from a place of sorrow. The project also includes a remix of his breakout afropop hit “Ashawo,” featuring Nigerian afropop star YKB, who recently received major recognition from global superstar Wizkid. In conclusion, Dayonthetrack is evidently putting substantial effort into his projects and brand-building. From the vibrant Rap City Tema, we eagerly anticipate the emergence of yet another remarkable talent. Listen on all platforms here https://vyd.co/Blackwhitebeforethetape",

Harris was 30 years old when he went free. Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in April alleging police fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses into making false statements, Monday. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back together. “I don’t have any financial help. I’m still (treated like) a felon, so I can’t get a good job. It’s hard for me to get into school,” he said. “I’ve been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.” A message The Associated Press left on the city’s Law Department main line seeking comment Monday wasn’t immediately returned. The department provides attorneys for the city, its departments and its employees. Harris was an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested. The legally blind eyewitness picked Harris out of a police lineup and identified him in court. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and saw a person aiming a handgun. He also added that the shooter bumped into him. Harris’ trial attorney asked the witness if his diabetes affected his vision. He said yes but denied he had vision problems. But the man’s doctor deemed him legally blind nine years before the incident, court records show. A gas station attendant also testified that Harris wasn’t the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Chicago’s Cook County in 2023 alone. The Associated Press",

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — An American quarry company on Monday rejected the Mexican president’s as well as his offer to buy its property on the Caribbean coast. In July, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador offered to buy the American company’s for about $385 million amid a bitter, years-long dispute. Alabama-based Vulcan Materials said in a statement Monday that offer “substantially undervalues our assets.” In papers filed on the case in an international arbitration panel, Vulcan Materials valued the almost 6,000-acre (2,400 hectare) property, located just south of the resort town of Playa del Carmen, at $1.9 billion. The Mexican president has in the past threatened to expropriate the extensive property, claiming the pits it has dug to extract crushed limestone have damaged the fragile system of underground rivers and caves in the area. But Vulcan Materials rejected the charge. “Our operations have not adversely affected underground caves, cenotes or archaeological sites. In fact, we have mapped, protected and preserved these valuable resources,” the company said in a statement. Instead, the company alleged that some other quarries in the area have been operating unlawfully. “Unlike other quarrying sites that have been operating unlawfully to supply the Mayan Train, our operations were duly permitted,” the company said. The Mayan Train is a pet project of López Obrador to build a tourist train around the Yucatan peninsula. Activists, cave divers and archeologist say , which hold The president’s office had no immediate reaction to Vulcan’s allegations. López Obrador has said in the past that the most attractive part of the property was the company’s freight shipping dock — the only deep port on the coast’s mainland — which he plans to turn into a dock for cruise ships. He says he wants to turn the rest of the property into a natural reserve. “The Mexican government is using these political threats and false allegations to try to justify converting our property into a “naturally protected area,” which could — ironically — be used not to protect the environment but for commercial tourism purposes and naval operations, including cruise ship activity”, the company said. López Obrador said he also wants to use the flooded pits that the company dug out of hundreds of acres of the limestone soil as “swimming pools” or an “ecotourism” area that would be operated as a concession by a private operator. The huge pits are inhabited by crocodiles, which are a protected species in Mexico. The company’s dock at Punta Venado is the only one in the area that can handle cement, crushed stone and other shipments for the Maya Train. The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites. López Obrador touts the train as a way to bring some of Cancun’s tourism income to inland communities that haven’t shared in the wealth. But there are no credible feasibility studies showing tourists would want to use the train. The Associated Press",

The company’s dock at Punta Venado is the only one in the area that can handle cement, crushed stone and other shipments for the Maya Train. The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites. López Obrador touts the train as a way to bring some of Cancun’s tourism income to inland communities that haven’t shared in the wealth. But there are no credible feasibility studies showing tourists would want to use the train. The Associated Press",

MEXICO CITY (AP) — An American quarry company on Monday rejected the Mexican president’s campaign of criticisms and closures, as well as his offer to buy its property on the Caribbean coast. In July, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador offered to buy the American company’s Caribbean coast property for about $385 million amid a bitter, years-long dispute. Alabama-based Vulcan Materials said in a statement Monday that offer “substantially undervalues our assets.” In papers filed on the case in an international arbitration panel, Vulcan Materials valued the almost 6,000-acre (2,400 hectare) property, located just south of the resort town of Playa del Carmen, at $1.9 billion. The Mexican president has in the past threatened to expropriate the extensive property, claiming the pits it has dug to extract crushed limestone have damaged the fragile system of underground rivers and caves in the area. But Vulcan Materials rejected the charge. “Our operations have not adversely affected underground caves, cenotes or archaeological sites. In fact, we have mapped, protected and preserved these valuable resources,” the company said in a statement. Instead, the company alleged that some other quarries in the area have been operating unlawfully. “Unlike other quarrying sites that have been operating unlawfully to supply the Mayan Train, our operations were duly permitted,” the company said. The Mayan Train is a pet project of López Obrador to build a tourist train around the Yucatan peninsula. Activists, cave divers and archeologist say the project has damaged the caves, which hold some of the oldest human remains in North America. The president’s office had no immediate reaction to Vulcan’s allegations. López Obrador has said in the past that the most attractive part of the property was the company’s freight shipping dock — the only deep port on the coast’s mainland — which he plans to turn into a dock for cruise ships. He says he wants to turn the rest of the property into a natural reserve. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. “The Mexican government is using these political threats and false allegations to try to justify converting our property into a “naturally protected area,” which could — ironically — be used not to protect the environment but for commercial tourism purposes and naval operations, including cruise ship activity”, the company said. López Obrador said he also wants to use the flooded pits that the company dug out of hundreds of acres of the limestone soil as “swimming pools” or an “ecotourism” area that would be operated as a concession by a private operator. The huge pits are inhabited by crocodiles, which are a protected species in Mexico.

He noted that India has been taking lead in advocating for digital health innovations as key to the critical transformative process required to help achieve goals. While addressing Committee A of the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Monday, Apurva Chandra said, “At this critical juncture, when all countries are working towards our collective Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring health services for all so that no one gets left behind, India has been taking the lead in advocating for digital health innovations as key to the critical transformative process required to help us achieve our goals,” according to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare press release.

        "content": "Residents of central Mexico may have thought they were accompanying Dante through the I nferno in a freakishly wild weekend for weather. Extreme heat, destructively strong winds and a consequential hail storm — all accompanied by flooding — tormented central Mexico beginning on Friday. In a “be careful what you wish for” moment, residents of the city of Puebla, who may have been wishing for relief from the heat wave , were stunned by a wicked storm that pounded them with hail for 30 minutes on Friday afternoon. The squall covered streets in up to 50 cm of accumulated hail, nearly burying several cars in one neighborhood, toppling trees and producing flooding across the Historic Center and the northwestern part of the state capital. Winds of up to 50 km/hr collapsed the roof of an auto dealership and a department store, knocked trees onto a housing project, blew over billboards and caused a power outage. City and state civil protection agents were out in force to survey the damage and assist the public in digging out from the hail drifts. Police rescued a young girl who was being swept away by floodwaters, but no casualties were reported. ⛈️Intensa tormenta de granizo en #Puebla 🚨Con este video de @Manatimx , la tormenta de esta tarde en #Puebla corresponde a un #Downburst ✅Es una corriente que desciende desde la nube a gran velocidad, trayendo abundante granizo y viento que puede superar los 80 km/h pic.twitter.com/7OXlVXAdXz — 🌲⛈️Meteorología México🌧️🌳 (@InfoMeteoro) May 24, 2024 On Sunday, strong winds knocked over tarpaulins at campaign events in two municipalities of México state, causing dozens of injuries. Meanwhile in Mexico City, capitalinos sweltered in the extreme heat all weekend. Sunday was the third consecutive day in which a record was set. The mercury hit 33.8 degrees Celsius (93 ̊F), which is a new all-time record for May 26. A day earlier, the temperature topped out at 34.7C, surpassing the all-time record set on May 9. Friday’s high also climbed above 34C, setting a new record for May 24. National Meteorological Service (SMN) data confirms that record-setting temperatures are likely to continue through June, the newspaper Debate reported on Sunday. Mexico’s current heat wave — the third of an expected five heat waves this season — has seen temperatures above 45 C in parts of the country. The Monday morning forecast from SMN warned that 19 states will experience extremely hot temperatures this week. Intense storms and high winds remain in the forecast for northern Mexico, where gale-force winds destroyed a stage at a political rally on Wednesday, killing nine people and injuring dozens. The temperatures up north are expected to ease slightly in the coming days, according to the weather site Meteored, but tropical humidity will arrive in its place. The emerging weather system will bring heavy rains in parts of central and southern Mexico, and states in the west and northwest should be prepared for extremely high winds.

        "content": "GAZA: The Zionist entity faced a wave of international condemnation Monday over a strike that killed at least 45 people when it set off a fire that ripped through a tent city for displaced Palestinians set up by Kuwaiti charities. Kuwait’s ministry of foreign affairs condemned on Monday the Zionist occupation’s aggression against displaced people. In a statement, the foreign ministry asserted that Zionist occupation’s actions against Palestinians exposes its blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world. This calls for immediate and firm intervention by the international community to compel these forces into adhering to international legitimacy resolutions, including International Court of Justice resolution on immediately ceasing aggression against Rafah and protecting the Palestinian people. The Zionist entity said it was looking into the “grave and awful” impact on civilians after the latest mass casualty event in the Gaza war. The Zionist military said Sunday evening’s attack in the southern Rafah area had targeted and killed two senior Hamas operatives - but it also sparked a fire that Palestinians and many Arab countries condemned as a massacre. A US National Security Council spokesperson said the Zionist entity “must take every precaution possible to protect civilians”. The UN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland called on the Zionist entity to conduct a “thorough and transparent” investigation into the strike, as the Zionist military said it was launching a probe. UN human rights chief Volker Turk decried “horrific” images that “point to no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by (the Zionist entity) that have already led to so many civilian deaths”. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that “these operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians.” EU foreign ministers agreed to call a meeting with the Zionist entity to get it to explain its actions in its Rafah offensive despite a UN court order to halt it, said the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell, who called the strike “horrifying”. Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the government was investigating the “tragic accident” which he told parliament occurred “despite our best efforts” to protect civilians. Zionist government spokesman Avi Hyman earlier said: “It was definitely grave. Any loss of life, civilian live, is grave and is awful. We seek to go after Hamas and limit civilian casualties.” Relatives of captives held in Gaza, who have increased pressure on Netanyahu’s government demanding action to secure a captive release deal, heckled the premier from the public gallery as he was speaking and raised posters of their loved ones. The Zionist entity launched the attack on Rafah on Sunday evening, hours after Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets at the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. The Zionist army said its aircraft “struck a Hamas compound in Rafah” and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the militant group in the occupied West Bank. Gaza’s civil defense agency said the strike ignited a fire that tore through a displacement center in northwestern Rafah near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. “We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs ... We also saw cases of amputations, wounded children, women and the elderly,” said civil defense agency official Mohammad Al-Mughayyir. “The sky suddenly lit up,” said displaced Palestinian Muhannad, an eyewitness. One survivor, a woman who declined to be named, said: “We heard a loud sound and there was fire all around us. The children were screaming.” Footage from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of paramedics racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded. Mughayyir said the rescue efforts were hampered by war damage and the impacts of the Zionist entity’s siege. “There is a fuel shortage ... there are roads that have been destroyed” as well as “a shortage of water to extinguish fires”, he said. “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said the Zionist entity lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. The Zionist attack sparked strong regional protests from mediators Egypt and Qatar as well as from Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Egypt deplored the “targeting of defenseless civilians” and labelled it part of “a systematic policy aimed at widening the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip to make it uninhabitable”. Jordan accused the Zionist entity of “ongoing war crimes”, Saudi Arabia condemned “the continued massacres”, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed “to hold these barbarians and murderers accountable”. Qatar condemned a “dangerous violation of international law” and voiced “concern that the bombing will complicate ongoing mediation efforts” towards a truce. The African Union chair Moussa Faki Mahamat also condemned the attack on X saying: “(The Zionist entity) continues to violate international law with impunity and in contempt of an ICJ ruling two days ago ordering an end to its military action in Rafah.” The top world court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday ordered the Zionist entity to halt any offensive in Rafah and elsewhere that could bring about “the physical destruction” of the Palestinians. The Zionist offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly women and children. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA which has been central to aid operations in the besieged territory during the war, said on X that “with every day passing, providing assistance & protection becomes nearly impossible”. “The images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth,” he said, with “heavy movement restrictions”, ongoing Zionist strikes and Hamas rocket launches, and other “challenges ... that do not allow us to distribute aid”. On Tuesday, Spain, Ireland and Norway are due to formally recognize a Palestinian state — a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western powers. The Zionist entity opposes the move and on Monday announced punitive steps against Madrid, ordering its consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering services to Palestinians from June 1. - Agencies",

        "content": "Tourists warned of £9,000 fines as Spanish island bids to keep its \"paradise\" reputation Tourists planning to visit a \"paradise\" island in Spain are being warned they face fines of more than £9,000 if they flout an important rule. Formentera in the Balearics is famed for being \"one of the jewels of Spain\" with its wonderful beaches, pretty villages and breath-taking views. But with tourist saturation currently the buzz word in numerous other holiday locations, including neighbouring Majorca and Ibiza, the local council is taking no chances with Formentera's reputation. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Formentera council has issued a bulletin reminding visitors of the need to register their vehicles on Formentera.eco to be able to take them to the island between June 1st and September 30th of this year. \"Formentera wants to continue being the most paradisiacal destination in Spain, a place where rest is just that, rest, and where nothing reminds us of the saturation of large cities or where going from one point to another on the island becomes an odyssey,\" the council said in a statement. To achieve this objective, Formentera has a fundamental tool, which it has called Formentera.eco. This is the application of Law 7/2019 for the environmental and economic sustainability of the island, which regulates the entry and circulation of vehicles during the high season with the aim of protecting the environment and being able to offer, in this way, \" the paradise island\" that visitors deserve. Formentera.eco comes into force on June 1st and ends on September 30th. During these dates, visitors who want to enter Formentera with their car or motorcycle have to register it in advance and obtain authorisation to circulate on the island, since the number of vehicles that can enter from outside the island is limited. Furthermore, once you obtain authorisation on the website https://formentera.eco/es, to be able to enter the island with your vehicle you must pay a fee. The rate for tourism for the months of June and September will be six euros per day, with a minimum amount of 30 euros, while the rate for motorcycles will be three euros per day, with a minimum amount of 15 euros. As for the months of July and August, the amount for tourism will be nine euros per day, with a minimum amount of 45 euros, while for motorcycles the price will be 4.5 euros per day with a minimum amount of 22.50 euros. Formentera council is also stressing that access to the island by quads, caravans or campers is totally prohibited, since camping is not allowed on the island. Rental vehicles from outside the island cannot access Formentera either. Failure to comply with the specifications of Formentera.eco can lead to significant financial penalties, ranging from 1,000 euros to 10,000, in the most serious cases, according to the island's executive. Trending In order to correctly carry out this control to avoid saturation of the island's roads in the summer season and thus be able to provide a better experience to tourists who visit the island, Formentera has a system of video cameras for traffic control that automatically detect vehicles that have not been registered and automatically makes the penalty proposal. This camera system is complemented by the actions of the local police and regulated parking service controllers, who constantly monitor vehicle licence plates to prevent unauthorised circulation.

        "description": "A victory for the Labour Party would give the opportunity to rebuild relations between Belfast and London after a difficult period",
        "content": "The UK general election scheduled for July 4th is a welcome opportunity to hit the reset button between political parties in Northern Ireland and Westminster. Since the Brexit vote on June 23rd, 2016, relations between the Conservative government and the North’s main parties have been strained, for a variety of reasons. The Tories played a cynical game with Northern Ireland during Brexit negotiations. Boris Johnson, the former prime minister, gave a pledge to unionists that he would never accept a border between Britain and Northern Ireland, before he signed a deal in October 2019 to put customs and regulatory checks down the Irish Sea. Overall, Brexit has been a source of significant instability, which is underlined by the fact that the Stormont government was shuttered for a total of five years on two separate occasions since the 2016 vote. READ MORE Temu: What is it, how do I pronounce it, and why is it so cheap? Ken Early: Manchester United face a choice over Erik ten Hag, but not a difficult one Coleen Nolan: ‘I haven’t had two failed marriages, I’ve had two amazing marriages, because they gave me amazing children’ Una Mullally: Jennifer Zamparelli would have been worth fighting for. But if The 2 Johnnies ‘were never ours’, why hire them? The Conservative Party has carried its lack of consideration for Northern Ireland onto the campaign trail. It has said that its idea of introducing mandatory national service for 18-year olds will include Northern Ireland. Suggesting that people from a nationalist background sign up for the British army shows an astonishing lack of sensitivity. According to all credible polls, the Labour Party will win a thumping majority on July 4th. Hilary Benn, who is the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, has shown a willingness to engage with both communities, and the growing non-aligned middle ground. Labour would not reverse the Brexit vote, but it would take a much more constructive approach to relations with the EU. That would be a positive development for the outworking of the Windsor Framework, which gives Northern Ireland access to the UK internal market and the EU’s single market for goods. It is going to be a difficult election for the DUP amid the ongoing legal woes of Jeffrey Donaldson, the former party leade r, who is facing allegations of historical sex abuse. Underlining this, the news that Alliance party leader Naomi Long will contest the Belfast East constituency poses a significant challenge for Gavin Robinson, the interim leader of the DUP, to retain his seat. The splintered unionist vote means Sinn Féin appears poised to return the highest number of MPs in the July election. This would make Sinn Féin the biggest party at local council, in the Stormont Assembly and Westminster – a remarkable milestone. There are no indications that Sinn Féin will reverse its policy of abstentionism. Nevertheless, it would need to develop a good working relationship with Labour. The same applies to the DUP and the North’s other political parties. Political stasis in recent years has taken its toll on public services. The people of Northern Ireland deserve better. A Labour government presents the opportunity for a fresh start.",

Her mugshot for the May 20 DUI Shocking new video shows a police officer emptying bottle after bottle of Fireball whiskey out of Kathryn Dennis's Louis Vuitton dog bag after officers seized it following her arrest for causing a three-vehicle-collision last week. In a cache of new footage, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, the former Southern Charm belle can also be seen flunking her field sobriety test earlier that evening – wobbling shoeless in the headlights of the patrol car called to the scene. Dennis, 32, was arrested and charged with being drunk at the wheel and transporting alcohol in open containers when she smashed into the back of a car as it slowed to a stop at a red traffic signal about 9.15pm last Monday. That car in turn hit the car in front of it. Last week bodycam footage emerged of Dennis sobbing in the back of a police car as she was transported by officers of Goose Creek Police Department to Berkley County Detention Center in Monck's Corner, South Carolina. Now, DailyMail.com can reveal new details of that journey, of Dennis's erratic behavior and of the chaotic events that preceded it. The former Southern Charm belle can be seen flunking her field sobriety test - wobbling, shoeless, in the headlights of the patrol car called to the scene New video shows a police officer emptying bottles of Fireball whiskey out of Dennis's Louis Vuitton dog bag after her DUI arrest In the video, the officer takes the Fireball bottles out of the bag one by one, before coming across a single can of Coke. He eventually throws them all in the trash. According to the incident report obtained by DailyMail.com, the first officer to speak to Dennis observed her 'glossy eyes' and 'the odor of alcohol emanating from [her] person.' The officer also noted 'an unopened bottle of Fireball on the driver's side floorboard' and a 'pink tumbler cup in the center console which was empty'. The officer noted that Dennis refused a breathalyzer test but agreed to undergo a field sobriety test. Captured by the dashcam video of his patrol car the extent to which Dennis flunked the test is painfully evident. According to his report the first test the officer carried out was the 'Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test,' in which a person is asked to track an officer's finger while the cop looks for the tell-tale involuntary eye jerking which happens when someone under the influence of drugs or alcohol looks to the side. As well as smelling the alcohol on Dennis, the officer noted four out of six clues suggesting intoxication while conducting the test including a 'lack of smooth pursuit' on Dennis's part. The next test was a walk and turn for which she chose to remove her sandals. Here the officer noted she could not even keep her balance while standing in the starting position, used her arms and hands for balance as she walked and missed the heel to toe requirement of the walk on numerous occasions. She was also unable to balance on one leg without wind-milling her arms to keep her balance. Later, oblivious to her performance, Dennis can be heard telling herself: 'I passed that f***ing field sobriety test. This is some b******t. Like, I literally am not drunk.' Dennis was traveling with her golden doodle puppy 'Lil Gucci' whom she had placed in the back of the police patrol vehicle during these tests Videos show the reality star handcuffed after failing sobriety tests. She tells the cops: Y'all are ruining my life' Dennis was traveling with her golden doodle puppy 'Lil Gucci' whom she had placed in the back of the police patrol vehicle during these tests. When officers searched the pup's dog carrier they found, 'several mini bottles of Fireball, some of which were opened and empty.' Indeed, footage of the search of that bag as she was booked into Berkley County Detention Center some hours later shows an officer removing at least ten miniature bottles from the bag – some are empty, some are open and appear half empty, others are full and still bound together by the plastic wrap of the multipack in which they were bought. Read More EXCLUSIVE Southern Charm's Kathryn Dennis's car is seen speeding through a school zone before hitting officer and knocking stop sign out of her hand in hit-and-run incident - months before DUI arrest Patrol car footage of the drive from the scene to the detention center reviewed by DailyMail.com shows Dennis running the emotional gamut in attempts to derail the due process of her arrest. At times she pleads, at others she wails in fury at being separated from her 'child' by which she means her dog. At some points she threatens the officers with legal action, saying she will 'ruin' them, at others she attempts to chat more calmly and elicit sympathy. When she sobs her tears appear to be out of frustration and anger that none of her tactics have any impact on the cops. She accuses the officer of touching her inappropriately as he reaches across her to fasten her safety-belt across her lap while her hands are cuffed behind her back. She then accuses the officer of trying to 'gaslight' her 'like my ex.' Dennis's tumultuous relationship with disgraced former congressman Thomas Ravenel which resulted in two children and ended in 2018 when he was hit with sexual assault charges by three women , was the predominant plotline or her eight seasons with Bravo reality show, Southern Charm. The reality star was also booked for driving with an open container Dennis's tumultuous relationship with disgraced former congress man Thomas Ravenel ended in 2018. They share son St. Julien Rembert, eight, and daughter Kensington Calhoun, 10 At one point during her transportation to the detention center Dennis pleads for leniency from the officer arresting her saying, 'I'm going to lose custody of my children, please!' But Dennis lost custody of Kensington 'Kensie' Calhoun, 9, and St. Julien 'Saint' Rembert, 7, to their father following a protracted and bitter custody battle as she repeatedly failed the court-mandated drug testing on which her rights to her children depended. She now has supervised visitation with them every other Saturday and Sunday. At another point she says, 'I'm never going to get my kids back. Thanks guys. There's literally no reason for me to be here. So congratulations it's f***ing b******t.' Vacillating wildly, Dennis seems lucid at times, before lurching into a rage and threatening the officers, 'I will f***ing ruin you,' when they explain her dog will be taken into a pound until someone can come and collect him. Later, in a moment of apparent resignation and exhaustion she says, 'There's no way to go back now is there?' Dennis was booked into Berkely Detention Center Monday night where she was held before being released on bond. Her bond was set at $1,199.50 for the DUI and $257.70 for transporting an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle.

        "content": "The ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) has declared a resounding victory in the Capital, Provincial, City and District Council elections for the fourth mandate. Chhim Phalvorun, a spokesman for the CPP, said yesterday that the party won the majority of votes in the elections. “Our party agents are collecting the data, and we are waiting for the official results issued by the NEC, and then we can analyse it,” Phalvorun said. The official results of the Council Election will be announced on June 8. Five political parties— the CPP, the Khmer Will Party, the Nation Power Party, Funcinpec and the Khmer National United Party, contested the non-universal suffrage elections. Kong Monika, Secretary-General of the Khmer Will Party, said that the party lost some votes for two reasons: firstly, it was slow to garner support from some commune councillors of the Candlelight Party and secondly, local authorities arrested commune councillors who were voters. The KWP replaced Candlelight Party which was disqualified to run the elections. Monika added that the results of the Capital, Provincial, City, and District Council elections on Sunday were not different from the Senate Election earlier this year. “Based on the votes in each constituency, the Khmer Will Party can get between 40 and 50 seats for the Capital and Provincial Councils, and more than 300 seats for the City, and District councils,” he said. The CPP obtained 9,376 council seats (1,648 commune chiefs, 1,618 first deputy and 261 second deputy positions) during the June 5, 2022 commune elections. Candlelight Party has 2,198 councillors (four commune chiefs, 25 first deputy and 1,360 second deputy posts), Funcinpec has 19 commune councillors and Khmer National United Party has 13. NECs Chairman Prach Chan said that 11,598 sitting commune chiefs and councilors, or 99.79% of the 11,622 eligible voters, cast their ballots for 4,200 capital, provincial, city and district councillors on Sunday. “The elections were conducted smoothly with good security and order, and without any violence or intimidation,” Chan said. He said that the council elections were held in a free and fair manner based on the principle of liberal multi-party democracy. CPP won all the votes in Pursat, Kep, Pailin and Mondulkiri provinces. In general, nationwide most of the votes went to the CPP, followed by KWP, and KPP. Based on the preliminary results in Phnom Penh, the CPP received 813 votes, the KWP received 80 and the National Power Party got one. In Battambang province, the CPP received 711 votes, the KWP garnered 100 votes and the KPP got 11. In Siem Reap, the CPP received 541 votes, KPP (90), the KWP (35) and the Khmer United National Party obtained one vote. In Prey Veng province, the CPP received 737 votes, the KWP got 140, the KPP had six, while Funcinpec and the Khmer United National Party obtained one vote each. The Capital, provincial, city and district council elections are held once every five years. Only commune councillors are eligible to vote. The third Council Election was held on May 26, 2019. Seven political parties had contested the elections.",

        "content": "Listen to Story Young star Varvara Gracheva pulled out of the early upsets of the French Open 2024 as she eliminated Maria Sakkari in the first round of the competition on May 27, Monday to move to the second round. Buoyed by the support from the home crowd, Gracheva secured a comeback win over the Greek star with the scoreline reading 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 as the match ended in just over 2 hours and 10 minutes. Sakkari, who was looking to make amends for her poor showing in the Australian Open, had a shaky start as Gracheva was able to break her in the very first game. However, Sakkari was able to return the favour in the next one as she was slowy able to gain control over things and took a 4-2 lead by breaking the 23-year-old French star. The duo would then go on lose while serving, before Sakkari finally pulled away and secured the first set 6-3. Gracheva would find her groove in the second set and was finally able to break Sakkari to take the lead and extend it to 4-1. Sakkari, however, would mount a comeback of her own and levelled the score at 4-4 as the odds were in favour of the 6th seed at that point. However, the French star was able to get a grip of proceedings and won the next two games to make the game 1-1 and pushing it into the decider. The third set saw both women push each other in the early goings with the score level at 2-2. Gracheva was able to take the lead from the serve and then both women had an incredible back and forth in the next game. It seemed like the Greek star would be able to level things up before Gracheva used the encouragement from the crowd to gain the advantage and secure the break point. The next serve saw Gracheva on the verge of securing the win with the score at 5-2, before Sakkari dug deep to save a couple of match points and get the game. However, it wasn't able to start a revival for the 6th seed as Gracheva secured a memorable win to progress to the next round.",

        "content": "CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago man convicted of murder based in part on testimony from a legally blind eyewitness is suing the city and the police department. A judge convicted Darien Harris in 2014 in connection with a fatal shooting at a South Side gas station in 2011. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was freed in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he went free. Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in April alleging police fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses into making false statements, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back together. “I don’t have any financial help. I’m still (treated like) a felon, so I can’t get a good job. It’s hard for me to get into school,” he said. “I’ve been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.” A message The Associated Press left on the city's Law Department main line seeking comment Monday wasn't immediately returned. The department provides attorneys for the city, its departments and its employees. Harris was an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested. The legally blind eyewitness picked Harris out of a police lineup and identified him in court. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and saw a person aiming a handgun. He also added that the shooter bumped into him. Harris’ trial attorney asked the witness if his diabetes affected his vision. He said yes but denied he had vision problems. But the man’s doctor deemed him legally blind nine years before the incident, court records show. A gas station attendant also testified that Harris wasn't the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Chicago's Cook County in 2023 alone.",

        "content": "As the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) commences Continuous Voter Registration today (Monday), it’s notable that a substantial number of Permanent Voter Cards, totaling at least 635,011, are still awaiting collection by registered voters in Edo and Ondo states. INEC’s latest data reveals that Edo State has 373,030 uncollected PVCs, while Ondo State has 261,981 PVCs yet to be claimed. This update coincides with the commencement of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) process in both states. Edo State is gearing up for its governorship election slated for September 21, 2024, while Ondo State is preparing for its election on November 16, 2024. INEC has announced that the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will take place from Monday, May 27, to Wednesday, June 5. The registration will run from 9 am to 3 pm daily, including weekends, to ensure accessibility for voters before the elections. Additionally, uncollected PVCs will be available for collection during this period. INEC officials and corps members will facilitate the exercise across 397 walk-in registration centers, ward levels, and state headquarters to ensure accessibility and efficiency. During a recent stakeholders meeting, INEC Chairman Mahmood Yakubu emphasized provisions enabling registered voters to transfer their registration from other states to Edo and Ondo, as well as relocate their voting credentials within the two states. Yakubu explained that these measures were designed to streamline the process and encourage maximum participation in the forthcoming elections. This initiative aims to address time constraints and ensure a more inclusive registration process. In an interview on Sunday, the Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, expressed confidence in the smooth conduct of the CVR and encouraged registered voters to retrieve their PVCs. He said, “We encourage all eligible individuals to utilize this CVR window to exercise their right to vote. We are committed to ensuring a seamless process.”",

        "content": "The Nigerian Army, on Monday, confirmed the immediate reopening of the popular Abuja Banex Plaza following an understanding between the authorities, plaza management and traders’ association. The plaza had been shut for over a week following a mob attack on some personnel of the Nigerian army by unidentified hoodlums on May 18. This is contained in a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Maj.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on Monday in Abuja. Nwachucku said a high-level meeting was convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser including the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, Commissioner of Police FCT and the FCT Director of the Department of State Services. Others on the panel, according to him are the Leadership and Management of Banex Plaza, a Representative from the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the National Chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders Association. He said the primary objective of the meeting was to identify and apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the continued security of the Federal Capital Territory. “The following resolutions were agreed upon: Immediate reopening of Banex Plaza to the public and the leadership of Banex Plaza is instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect. “The owners of the shop who orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers are to be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. “Market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. “Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action. “The Nigerian army will also thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack,” he said. Nwachukwu reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel were not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order. He urged members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. According to him, there are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities. “It is imperative that these channels are utilized to maintain order and respect for those who serve and protect our nation. “The Nigerian army remains committed to ensuring safety and security of all citizens and will continue to work diligently to prevent such incidents in the future,” he added.

        "content": "A digital endoscope used in colonoscopy. (iStock / Getty Images) DEAR MAYO CLINIC : I just turned 45 and am dreading my first colonoscopy. Why do I need to be screened if I’m not having issues? Can you walk me through the process? ANSWER : Feeling anxious or afraid surrounding a procedure, particularly when you’ve never done it before, is completely normal. The purpose of screening is to act before someone develops symptoms. If we’re able to identify polyps , which are precancerous lesions in the lining of the colon, we would then have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer in the first place. So through screening, we can prevent cancer. At the time of diagnosing cancer, we’ve missed that opportunity. There are a number of ways we can screen for colorectal cancer . In the U.S., we most often use a colonoscopy . A colonoscopy is an invasive test, but it allows us an opportunity to not only see polyps, but also remove them at the same time. For people with no additional risk factors besides age, it is recommended to start screening at the age of 45. If other risk factors are present, though, it may be recommended to have a colonoscopy sooner than 45. The colon preparation prior to the colonoscopy is key. The goal of colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon by using a laxative liquid solution. Then, at the time of the colonoscopy, we’re able to see and detect even small precancerous lesions so they can be removed. It is very common to hear complaints from patients about the preparation, such as the consistency or taste of the solution, cramping, abdominal bloating or discomfort. That’s to be anticipated. Unfortunately, some patients also experience nausea. Try slowing down how fast you are drinking the solution. For those who tend to struggle with the taste or consistency, try drinking it through a straw. You can also bite into a small wedge of lime or lemon, or you can chew gum or ice between drinks. After you finish the last of the prep solution and check in for your appointment, you’ll often be greeted by the front desk team and then escorted back by a healthcare team member. They will review things like your medical history and medications and see how the colon prep treated you. There is a risk that you may have to come back and repeat the test at a later time if the colon prep was not adequate. Another critical thing they will do is establish your intravenous therapy or IV. The IV is the route in which they will give you the medication to help make the procedure a little bit more comfortable. Some people don’t do any sedation at all, but it is totally appropriate to opt for it. There are several different ways that sedation could be done for the procedure. A lot of that depends upon how the procedure is scheduled with your health care team. Then, you will end up going back to the procedure room where they will review the nature of the procedure before starting the colonoscopy. Afterward, there’s a bit of a recovery period, and then you’re able to head back home. Because of the sedation, we don’t want people driving, consuming alcohol or making any critical decisions for 24 hours. We still don’t have a perfect recipe for preventing polyps, but maintaining a healthy diet and exercise can protect you. It is important to be aware of any symptoms and then follow through with screening. Best of luck as you take this important first step. — Derek Ebner, M.D ., Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

In , Arturo was praised for his love story with Laura, which ended with the . In a post from May 24, a fan found a video of Arturo’s ex Aly claiming that he and Laura lied to get on the show. Aly revealed that Arturo started messaging Laura while they were still dating and said they met in person at a concert. However, he told Nev and Kamie that he and Laura never met before on Catfish. In another post from May 25, Aly shared further details about her side of the story following the response she received from her TikTok video. “I’m Arturo’s ex. he’s a manipulative and dangerous person who does not deserve your praise and empathy. Laura says racial slurs and allows Arturo to say inappropriate things about children,” she wrote at the bottom for users who wanted a summary of her lengthy post. “Both lied to get on this show despite having met in 2021. Please be careful who you support and do not give them attention.” Aly exposed Arturo’s negative behavior during their relationship and accused him of being abusive and stalking her, stating he continued the behavior after she began seeing someone new. According to her, Arturo went as far as sending screenshots of Aly’s tweets and Instagram stories because she blocked him. He allegedly also called her boyfriend’s workplace to report him for selling prohibited substances on set, which wasn’t true. Because the MTV series on the show, fans might not be surprised to find out that Arturo isn’t the sweet guy he portrayed himself to be, especially if her allegations are proven true. Although he’s still in a relationship with Laura as of now, fans are worried that he will reveal the same behavior he showed with his ex, Aly. Related:",

        "content": "The Kano State High Court has ordered the police to evict the dethroned Emir of Kano Aminu Ado Bayero, from his palace. The court also ordered Mr Ado-Bayero and his four colleagues in Bichi, Rano, Gaya and Karaye Emirates to stop parading themselves as emirs. The court issued the interim injunction on Monday, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice filed by the Kano State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, the Speaker, Kano State House of Assembly, and the Kano State House of Assembly. Earlier on Thursday, the Federal High Court had restrained the state government from implementing its new emirate council law that reinstated Emir Lamido Sanusi and dissolved the five emirates created by the preceding administration of former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje in 2019. The state high court judge, Amina Aliyu, gave the latest order after hearing an exparte application by counsel to the applicant, Ibrahim Wangida. “That an order of interim injunction is hereby granted restraining the 1st 2nd, 3rd 4th & 5th Defendants either by themselves, servants, privies, and or any other persons or officers serving under them or acting in connection with any other person from parading themselves as Emirs of Kano, Bichi, Gaya, Rano and Karaye pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. “That an order is hereby granted to the extent that the Commissioner of Police Kano State should immediately take the palace of the Emir of Kano situated being and lying at State Road Kano and evict the 1 Defendant/Respondent from the said palace pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice dated 24 May, 2024.

        "description": "After a year of enduring criticism about the Dallas Mavericks' star duo, Luka Doni and Kyrie Irving are proving everyone wrong.",
        "content": "When the traded for in February 2023, the move was met with many raised eyebrows from critics and fans alike. Irving had just unceremoniously exited from the amid their most successful season, concluding a confusing and disappointing era next to in New York. This had wrapped up a six-year stretch where Irving played in zero conference finals games, missed several playoff runs with injury, and had some of the . Needless to say, people wondered whether he would ever contribute to winning again or just float into retirement as one of basketball's most spectacular what-ifs. Perhaps more importantly, no one knew whether a pairing of two ball-dominant, isolation-scoring guards would be conducive to playoff success. There were concerns about each player's role, how they would defend, and whether could get the best out of Irving. Just a year later, the two stars are proving everyone wrong, and have Dallas one win away from the NBA Finals. Dončić, Irving Roles Have Not Been an Issue at All Putting two players who needed the ball to work their incredible scoring magic together seemed like a recipe for disaster, as one player was going to have to make huge sacrifices for the sake of the team. Viewers wondered how of the game and watching Dončić work in the clutch from an outsider's perspective after being such a great closer for his entire career. However, Irving has a lot of experience as the secondary scoring option to an all-time great player, having done it next to to great success, as well as Durant in Brooklyn. Kyrie is the perfect player to be a team's second scorer because of his off-ball excellence, which he showed specifically as a with James on three straight finals runs in as many years together. In fact, Irving's worst seasons came as a , when he had to lead a team and bear the full offensive burden as a number one option. Irving is one of the very best players in the league in spot-up situations, both as a shooter and a closeout attacker. Its unsurprising that he is elite at attacking closeouts, considering his incredible handle, quickness, and footwork that already serves him so well in more difficult isolation situations. Although fans don't always think of Irving as a deadeye shooter because of all the flashy scoring tools he uses, he is also one of the NBA's best marksmen, making him an even better off-ball player. Kyrie Irving: The Perfect Batman 2024 1.31 95.8 2023 1.19 84.5 2022 1.17 86.6 2021 1.29 94.6 2017 1.15 84.6 2016 0.96 55.6 2015 1.23 88.9 2024 Playoffs 1.17 78.9 *This chart lists every year Irving has played next to James, Durant, or Dončić The eight-time All-Star has been remarkably accurate from three-point land, shooting just under 40% (39.3%) for his career, which ranks 12th for active players in that time span. When given great looks, consistently playing with legends like James, Durant, and Dončić, he can torch a defense from long distance just like any other sharpshooter. Kyrie’s Presence Has Given Luka Badly-Needed In-Game Rest One of the best aspects of Irving's arrival in Dallas has been unlocking other parts of Dončić's game that he was too exhausted to focus on in the past. Over the first five seasons of his career, the Slovenian superstar made an extremely poor effort defensively because of the heavy burden he was carrying to lift his team on his own offensively. With Irving's presence on the floor alongside Dončić, he can delegate much of that burden to his co-star, which has allowed him to dedicate more energy to the defensive end of the floor. Shockingly, Dončić , and the rest of the Mavericks have followed suit. Irving himself is playing better on that end than ever before, and Dallas is now an elite defense with very few holes. Surprising Defense Player Playoff DFG% DFGA Dončić 43.0% 15.8 Irving 42.1% 10.6 Critics of this pairing cited the flaws in a \"my-turn-your-turn\" style of offense, but failed to foresee the team-wide benefits of the playing style. Not only have they helped each other save energy and get better looks, but their teammates have reaped the benefits of having a superstar shot creator on the floor at all times. Guys that were brought in to fix Dallas' defense, size, and toughness issues are thriving offensively with their high quality opportunities. PJ Washington, Derrick Jones Jr., Daniel Gafford, and Dereck Lively have all had meaningful offensive contributions and are playing beyond their normal abilities, in part because of Dončić and Irving and all the attention they receive. Duo Makes Dallas Unstoppable in Clutch Situations The most influential part of this duo's success has been their incredible performance in the clutch moments. They're simply unstoppable in slow-down half-court environments at the end of games because they have two guys who can get their own shot better than anybody, and opponents aren't able to focus too much attention on either player. Dallas' Clutch Excellence 2023-24 Regular/Postseason ORTG NBA Rank W-L Regular Season 127.1 1st 23-9 Postseason 124.3 5th 7-2 No matter who is on the other side, Dallas feels confident that Dončić and Irving will outplay them down the stretch. This has been the theme of their 3-0 series lead over the and their lockdown defense, with all three games coming right down to the wire. In each contest, Dallas out-executed Minnesota and got a better shot each time down the floor, making three close wins seem very comfortable. Presumed NBA Finals opponent Boston is a superior team to the Mavericks talent-wise, but in any close game, Dallas has the advantage, making it anyone's series. Dallas has played in nine tightly contested games during this postseason run, and has emerged victorious in seven. This is ultimately the difference between sitting at home already and being one win away from surviving the Western Conference gauntlet to play for the championship trophy.",

        "content": "BRITAIN'S Got Talent fans were left seriously distracted during the very first live semi-final show. Tonight Britain's Got Talent returned for the first live shows of the series as the first group of acts competed for a place in the final. Judges Amanda Holden , Simon Cowell , Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli were back, along with hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. As always the judges put on a glamourous display and Amanda, 53, looked incredible in an off the shoulder red leather dress with a daring thigh-high split. The presenter went braless for the look, and viewers were distracted when Amanda spoke to new dad Ant and co-host Dec, both 48, at the start of the show. Taking to social media, one wrote: \"Bit nippy, Amanda?\" Another said: \"Amanda could cut glass tonight.\" And a third joked: \"Does Amanda own a bra?\" It comes after Amanda admitted she thought she'd be fired when daughter Hollie, 12, stormed the panel with 64-year-old Simon's son Eric, 10, to send Japanese double dutch dancers Haribow through with the Golden Buzzer. Sharing the clip on Instagram, Amanda later wrote: \"I mean ... I thought I was going to get fired as it was so unexpected my #HRH & Eric x even @simoncowell was wobbled but they have the first ever audience GOLDEN BUZZER\" The moment came after Haribow received a standing ovation from the audience and roaring pleas for them to get a golden buzzer, despite all the judges already using theirs. Until this game-changing moment, Ant and Dec, plus each of the judges were allowed only one per series. Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight .",

Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight.",

        "content": "President William Ruto has ordered the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock to convene a meeting with stakeholders and address concerns raised on the sale and use of muguka. It follows the ban of the stimulant, a variety of Miraa, by Kilifi and Mombasa counties. The President on Monday met with the leadership of Embu county led by Governor Cecil Mbarire, her deputy, senator, woman representative and members of national and county assembly from the county. During the meeting, Agriculture CS Mithika Linturi informed the Prsident that muguka is a scheduled crop in accordance with the Crops Act, 2013 and the Miraa Regulations 2013. He said the two pieces of legislation were passed by the National Assembly and the Senate with the concurrence of the Council of Governors. “With muguka having been recognised by national legislation, any other laws or orders that contradicts national legislation is null and void,” Ruto said. “To address concerns of all parties and stakeholders, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock is directed to convene a consultative forum to address concerns raised and agree on the implementation of the Miraa/Muguka Regulations 2023,” the President said in a dispatch from State House said. He noted that having been passed by Parliament, the regulations obligate the government to allocate funds for the farming, licensing, promotion, regulation, transportation, aggregation, selling, marketing and export of the crops. To this end, Ruto said the government will pump Sh500 million in the 2024-25 Financial Year for value addition of the scheduled crops as part of the scaling up of their aggregation, grading, pricing, packaging and value addition. On pricing, he said the Council of Governors has already nominated three members to the Miraa/Muguka Pricing Committee to regulate the prices in accordance with the Crops Act, 2023. But despite the move, the President said the government remains steadfast in its commitment in the fight against drugs, illicit brews and other illegal substances.",

        "description": "The calima, or haze in English, is a sandstorm that engulfs the Canary Islands in a dense cloud of hot, dusty wind blown in from the Sahara. Experts say it's becoming more intense",
        "content": "UK holidaymakers planning to jet off to the Canary Islands have been warned that a severe weather event, known as the \"calima\", is becoming more intense. Tenerife and Lanzarote are popular destinations for Brits looking to spend time in the sun - but tourists are now being urged to brace for this potentially disruptive and intensifying phenomenon. The calima, or haze, is a sandstorm that descends on the islands in a thick cloud of hot, dusty wind, carried over from the Sahara. Weather experts say these sandstorms are getting worse and are also less predictable. If your sunny getaway is interrupted by a calima, it is likely to be far worse than what was experienced in the past. UK holiday hotspot Menorca resort chains off pretty streets to keep out tourists In February 2020, a severe thunderstorm sparked travel disruption ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) Data shows a startling 483 episodes of calima since 1980 across the islands an average of 24 stormy days per year. Such storms usually last around 1.8 days each. Fortunately, for those with their sights set on a summer stay in the Canaries, the worst of the storms often occur earlier in the year, around January and February. So, those heading to popular tourist spots such as Tenerife, Gran Canaria or Lanzarote this summer are not expected to see the year's fiercest sandstorms, but officials in the Canary Islands have released four pre-alert statuses for calima for the year. In February 2020, an intense calima shut down all eight airports on the archipelago, leading to significant travel chaos and unexpected changes to holiday schedules. The Canary president said at the time: \"We are under the influence of four phenomena with the alert for strong winds, the calima, coastal phenomena and forest fires. All the mechanisms required by the protocol have been activated. We have had fires in Gran Canaria in two municipalities and in six municipalities in Tenerife. Passengers wait outside Tenerife South Reina Sofia Airport after flights were cancelled due to a sandstorm on February 23, 2020 ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) \"We have a direct thread with the two Presidents of the Cabildos and 90 members of the UME (Emergency Military Unit) and 100 Civil Guard agents in Gran Canaria, and another 100 and more than 50 of the UME in Tenerife are working. In addition, there are more than 90 troops prepared in Seville to move to the islands iof the situation worsens.\" During calima, temperatures usually increase significantly. When the calima is intense, experts say you should stay indoors, keep doors and windows shut, hydrate with plenty of liquids and wear face coverings when heading out. This is because staying outside for a long period during the calima can affect your respiratory system, especially if you suffer from allergies. A new study published in the journal Heliyon found that while the frequency of calimas has decreased, their intensity has risen. The increasing intensity of calimas is linked to changing weather patterns and because of this, there are visibility issues and challenges for air travel in the Canary Islands.",

        "content": "Thank goodness NSW coach Michael Maguire picked Roosters centre Joseph Suaalii for the opening match of this year’s State of Origin series. If he’d heeded calls to overlook the 20-year-old for signing a $5 million deal with Rugby Australia from next season, it would have been another part of Origin that Queensland apparently do better than NSW. In 2010, Brisbane Broncos star Israel Folau signed with incoming AFL franchise GWS Giants. The AFL announced the deal on May 31, with a media conference involving Folau and the Giants’ inaugural coach, Kevin Sheedy, held the next day – six days after Folau had played in the first Origin played for Queensland. The argument for banning Suaalii from playing Origin goes that to let him play gives Rugby Australia free publicity. Folau’s decision to take the $6 million on offer to become the face of an ambitious new club in rugby league heartland in Sydney’s west, and then announce it in the middle of the game’s showpiece event, the jewel in the crown as it were, was a dagger through rugby league’s artery-clogged heart.

The sporting landscape has changed significantly since then, mostly for rugby union, which is no longer the same cashed-up powerhouse that pinched NRL stars Mat Rogers, Wendell Sailor and Lote Tuqiri in the early 2000s.

Israel Folau was selected by Queensland in 2010 despite announcing a $6 million switch to AFL in the middle of the series. Credit: Getty Images Will the sight of Suaalii playing for NSW really give rugby a leg-up? Hardly. He’s already told the Roosters he intends to return to the NRL once his three-year contract ends. Even ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys, who relishes any opportunity to kick AFL and rugby union whenever he can, is at ease about Suaalii playing. “The coach’s job is to pick the best team to win,” he said. “That’s all he should worry about.” Perhaps the more relevant question about Suaalii isn’t about whether he should play but which side of the field will he occupy. He’s been named in the centres alongside the Bulldogs’ Stephen Crichton, the best in the business. Both players are equally comfortable playing on the right or left. Crichton was exceptional in Penrith’s grand final win last year playing on the left. His clever little kicks into the in-goal were invaluable late in the game. But he’s been mostly playing on the right for the Bulldogs this season, and unlike some players who struggle when they leave the three-time defending premiers, his form hasn’t waned. Maguire would not be drawn on which side Crichton or Suaalii will play, but there’s a school of thought among his coaching staff that Suaalii is better suited to the right – even though he’s played most of this season for the Roosters on the left because Joey Manu has the right centre position stitched up. Israel Folau during his AFL days. Credit: Getty Because he’s right-handed and has a right-foot step, he is more comfortable on that side of the field. He’s also less likely to be targeted by inside defenders trying to drive a shoulder into the ball, forcing an error. That is the real fear I have with this NSW team, which features six debutants and a new captain heading into the opening match at Accor Stadium on June 5 – errors! Suaalii, who is only in his fourth season in the NRL, has produced some incredible touches in attack this year. But he can make the odd mistake, whether it’s a dropped ball or conceding a penalty. His defence, though, has improved significantly. If Maguire does play him on the right edge, he’ll be playing inside fellow rookie and right-winger Zac Lomax, who looms as Maguire’s greatest leap of faith with this side. Lomax has been in career-best form for the Dragons this season. He has made 2014 metres (fifth in the NRL) from 237 runs (third). But no player in the league has made more errors. Lomax has made 25 so far. When he threw an errant flick pass coming off his own line in the Anzac Day match against the Roosters, which led to their second try in their 60-18 drubbing, some people within Lomax’s own club reckoned it was enough to end his Origin aspirations. Now, he could end up on a precarious-looking right edge with fellow rookie Suaalii. Maguire had options: he could have played Suaalii on the right wing and picked either the Bulldogs’ Matt Burton, the Sharks’ Jesse Ramien or the forgotten man in the NSW conversation, Penrith’s Izack Tago. If the coach is concerned about it all, he wasn’t giving much away on Monday. “I met Joseph at the age of 13 and tried to recruit him a long time ago,” Maguire said. “I do know his passion and what rugby league means to him.

        "description": "Offenders older than their victim by 10 years and convicted of unlawful acts would be registered.",
        "content": "A bill that aims to make unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor a crime that requires sex offender registration is one step closer to becoming law after passing the Senate May 22 on a vote of 34-3. Legal distinctions between consensual and non-consensual sex with a minor in existing state law are the root of the issue the bill seeks to address. Senate Bill 1128, authored by Sen. Anthony Portantino, would require individuals older than their victim by 10 years and convicted of unlawful sex with a minor to be classified as what’s known as a tier one offender and have their name placed on the sex offender registry for 10 years. The author said the goal of his proposal will additionally fix a loophole in existing law where consensual sex with a minor, if convicted of such, requires sex offender registration, while non-consensual sex does not. “It is inexplicable that consensual sex with a minor can cause someone to be placed on the registry while unlawful sex does not... [and] this bill will change that,” Mr. Portantino told The Epoch Times. “If you are 10 years older and have illegal sex, you should be put on the registry.” The aim is to help protect children across the state from becoming a victim to sex trafficking and hold offenders accountable, he said. Human trafficking victims are predominantly young girls and women, about 99.4 percent of such cases, according to California Department of Justice data. Supporters of the bill pointed to statistics showing that sex trafficking accounts for 89 percent of all human trafficking cases in California, according to the Public Policy Institute of California—as a sign that more needs to be done to address the issue. “As a society, we must protect vulnerable youth and hold those who harm them accountable,” the California District Attorneys Association said in legislative analyses. “SB 1128 would ... strengthen our laws and hold accountable sex offenders who target minors.” Opponents said the measure is too broad and would cause some to be unfairly placed on the sex offender registry. “While current law recognizes that cases of unlawful sex with a minor vary widely in their circumstances and potential harm, and thus provides flexibility in charging, SB 1128 ignores those varying circumstances and applies the measure of sex offender registration to anyone convicted of this crime, regardless of circumstance, and regardless of whether the individual is convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor,” the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice said in legislative analyses. The criminal justice group alleges that those between the ages of 18 and 26 would be most harmed by the bill. California’s penal code defines all offenders 26 and under as “youth” because, officials say, their brains are still developing. “The majority of people affected by SB 1128 would be youth, as they are the people most likely to enter into sexual relationships with minors,” the group said. “Those most likely to be prosecuted ... are young adults, under 26, who are youthful offenders, which California law recognizes are subject to many of the same developmental issues as those under 18.” The group also contends the sex offender registration list—with about 88,000 individuals currently registered statewide and expected to increase if the bill is approved—is ineffective because it marginalizes and isolates them from jobs and housing opportunities. “Sex offender registration, even for serious sexual offenders, has a problematic history and has not been shown to benefit either the offender or the community,” the group said. “Adding sex offender registration would add no benefit, cause great harm to youth, and be enormously expensive.” Critics also point to comments made by the California Sex Offender Management Board as evidence that youth are vulnerable to exercising poor judgment and making decisions related to sexual activity that could cause them to face harsh punishment and consequences if the bill became law. They also highlighted recidivism rates of only about 3 percent for young sexual offenders. “Common methods of supervision and treatment used with adult sexual offenders are, for the most part, inappropriate and potentially harmful with youth,” the state’s sex offender board said on its website. “The Board strongly recommends that youth who have offended sexually should have services specialized for their needs.” California was the first state in the nation to require sex offender registration—beginning in 1947—to deter registrants from reoffending, provide law enforcement with relevant information and investigative tools, and protect the public. Offenders on the registry are required to register annually within five days of their birthday, with photos, location, and offense data available to public view. Having cleared the Senate with bipartisan support—with three Democrats voting against the measure, including Senators Nancy Skinner, Scott Wiener, and Susan Talamante Eggman—the bill will next be heard by respective committees in the Assembly in the coming weeks.",

In a statement on his official Instagram account, he said: “It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. “Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. “I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. “I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my nine years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. “Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion. “Thank you again for everything and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.” During his time in England, Martial has won the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa League, but has struggled for consistency and slipped out of the reckoning under current boss Erik ten Hag. In 2019 during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign, he signed a contract up until this summer with the option of a further 12 months.",

        "content": "The Royal Air Force has temporarily paused the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight after a pilot died in a Spitfire crash. Squadron Leader Mark Long was killed in the crash at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire at around 1:30pm on Saturday (May 25). The RAF said it has taken the decision to ground the aircraft while investigations take place, the BBC reports. A spokesperson said: \"Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight [BBMF].\" The BBMF had several events planned to mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day Landings and Operation Market Garden. These included displays at the English Riviera Airshow in Paignton on June 1 and June 2, and Plymouth Armed Forces Day on June 29.

He was a Typhoon pilot at RAF Coningsby and for the last four years he had been a pilot with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. The Prince and Princess of Wales were among those who earlier paid tribute to the pilot. They said they were \"incredibly sad\" to learn of the death, adding their thoughts were with the pilot's family, the BBMF and the wider RAF. Group Captain Robbie Lees, Commander Display Air Wing, said in an official statement following the incident: \"I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the RAF personnel and our emergency services colleagues who responded so swiftly yesterday. \"Our thoughts remain with Mark's family and friends to whom we offer our deepest sympathies. We ask that their privacy be respected at this tragic and shocking time.\"",

        "description": "Walton was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams.",
        "content": "By TIM REYNOLDS AP Basketball Writer Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "content": "are expected to be one of the clubs to vote in support of keeping VAR beyond the 2023/24 season, despite Wolves mounting pressure on the to get rid of the technology. The vote - fuelled by the Molineux outfits' belief that VAR is damaging the Premier League brand after they released a six-page document in a bid to court their support to scrap it - will take place on June 6, and will require 14 out of 20 votes to pass the motion. But while its use has been heavily criticised since its introduction in 2019, it appears a significant number of Premier League clubs will continue to support its place in the sport as it heads toward its fifth year, with West Ham - as reported exclusively to GIVEMESPORT by journalist Ben Jacobs. A shows that West Ham still would have finished ninth if VAR hadn't been in use last term, with the Hammers being denied just three points across the 38 games. Nevertheless, it hasn't stopped the club from being at the centre of controversy. Notably, during a 1-1 draw with Aston Villa in March, , including a stoppage time winner when it was ruled that Tomas Soucek had handled the ball before it crossed the line. The ruling broke an unwanted Premier League record, with the decision taking five minutes and 37 seconds. Moyes scrutinised the lack of accuracy and efficiency by those in Stockley Park's control room, and was equally keen to point out that it wasn't the first time his side had suffered from unfair judgments, with controversy also taking the headlines in their fixtures against Burnley and then Freiburg in the in the previous 10 days. Although it appears likely that West Ham will vote in support of VAR at next month's annual Premier League meeting, one could be forgiven for thinking otherwise after the club's vice-chairman, Karren Brady, offered a critical assessment of the technology's downfall. While also stating that the club had not yet made a decision at the time of her update, in a column released by , where she said: “You don’t need a PhD in human behaviour, or even more baffling, the handball laws, to realise VAR has not been a universal success. It was supposed to iron out the mistakes, make the game fairer for all and improve the overall experience for fans. To put it plainly, it has done none of that. “At West Ham, any decision on which way to vote has not yet been decided but in many ways VAR has been a disaster, especially for the lifeblood of the game, the supporters. Supporters pay good money to be entertained and sitting there waiting for interminable minutes for a decision from Stockley Park has been driving many bonkers.”",

        "content": "With VAR's future in the uncertain, are among the clubs expected to vote in favour of its continuation ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. Next month, on June 6, clubs will decide whether to scrap VAR at the Premier League's annual general meeting, with spearheading the movement for change. The West Midlands club signposted increased injuries, a negative impact on spontaneous goal celebrations, and continued errors as just a number of reasons why the technology should be abolished. But while a 70% vote is needed to pass any changes, , as journalist Ben Jacobs exclusively revealed to GIVEMESPORT this week. One look at the is enough to make Newcastle fans wince, as they would have finished sixth with qualification for the ahead of had VAR not been in use. According to an Independent Key Match Incidents Panel, Newcastle should have earned one extra point last season, with the decision not to award a penalty at Wolves in October when Fabian Schar was fouled by Hwang Hee-Chan while the opposition were 1-0 up, paired by Chelsea's projection to finish with two fewer points, proving the difference between the Magpies qualifying for European football next term and narrowly missing out. The table reveals that, although the two clubs would have finished on the same points tally, Newcastle's superior goal difference would have come into play. And because of 's FA Cup triumph, England were handed an extra European qualification spot, thus rewarding managerless Chelsea a lifeline ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. Despite this, there were times that Newcastle also benefitted from VAR. Another mistake outlined was the fact weren’t awarded a spot-kick during the Toon’s 3-2 win at the City Ground in February when Taiwo Awoniyi was brought down in the box by Martin Dubravka with the scores level at the time. On the penultimate matchday of the season, vented his anger to to Manchester United. The 23-year-old darted into the box, where he was caught on the Achilles by , who then bundled the ex-Everton forward to the ground. The challenge left a huge hole in the Englishman's sock, but to his shock, referee Rob Jones was not sent to the pitchside monitor by VAR. After the game, he said: \"I've watched the incident back, it's a clear penalty. I don't mind the referee getting it wrong on the pitch because it's a difficult decision, things happen really quickly. But I don't understand what the point of VAR is then, because it's there to correct mistakes.\" Interestingly, the decision came on the same day Wolves released their statement, and when he was asked about whether he would be in support of scrapping VAR, Gordon's answer was predictable: \"It's a big decision, I'm actually quite fond of it.\"",

Next month, on June 6, clubs will decide at the Premier League annual general meeting whether to abolish the system from the start of next season following a resolution submitted by . Contending that VAR is “eroding trust” and fuelling “completely nonsensical allegations of corruption\", the Molineux outfit released a statement saying: “After five seasons of VAR in the Premier League, it is time for a constructive and critical debate on its future. Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards.” Nonetheless, it is expected that a majority of Premier League clubs will remain in favour of keeping VAR beyond this season, with among those , as exclusively reported to GIVEMESPORT by journalist Ben Jacobs. A doesn’t look too different for Crystal Palace, who would have been projected to finish two points and one place lower than their actual standings. The main difference for Palace would have been the fact they would've finished below main rivals , who would have gained a significant five extra points had technology not been in use for the season. Certainly, this would have had an impact on Eagles' fans' view of their season's successes, with upstaging an important byproduct of all rivalries. However, besides that, the south London club weren't involved in too many VAR controversies throughout the course of the season. A notable moment of eye-rolling came during their home fixture against Liverpool in December that Wataru Endo was fouled by Will Hughes in the buildup to a potential Palace penalty. Nevertheless, there is a tangible optimism among Premier League clubs that efficiency will be one of they key improvements assessed ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. As reported by earlier this month, and believes that, with some changes, it can work better, while removing it could lead to more incorrect decisions. “I don’t get a vote, but I’m pro-VAR,” he said, before continuing: “I think we get more right decisions than wrong ones. I’m convinced that if we decide we don’t need it, after one year some will want it back because of many wrong decisions. “It’s good, maybe there are some wrong decisions, but now every club suffers from about five wrong decisions – if we don’t have it, every club will suffer from 15. Everyone will start criticising the referees, somebody else is always responsible when you lose. You are always responsible yourself when you get beaten – not the referee, VAR or the crowd.\"",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "description": "The most iconic motorcycles in automotive history make a mark not just on the design of future models and trends, but on the cultures in which they're sold.",
        "content": "Motorcycles have long been symbols of freedom, rebellion, and innovation. An iconic motorcycle is like a time capsule, preserving the essence of an era and transporting riders back in time. But for a motorcycle to achieve iconic status, there's a long road to take, and a combination of factors has to be considered. Some motorcycles break the mold and leave a lasting impact through innovative design, elevating industry standards. Others employ new engineering that changes how motorcycles are built and ridden. And let's not forget the ones with cultural impact that have us yearning for the good old days, reminding us of historical events and popular films. Our favorite motorcycle brands have storied histories and reputations that reflect their reliable performance and popularity. But these motorcycles have transcended to something even greater. Let's explore some of the most iconic motorcycles ever built. Join us as we take a ride through history and look at the bikes that have defined generations and continue to inspire new riders today. Honda's Super Cub motorcycle is legendary. One cannot talk about iconic motorcycles and not mention the best-selling, not just motorcycle, but motor vehicle in history, with over 100 million units sold since its introduction in 1958. One of the main selling points that made this the go-to motorcycle for almost anyone, especially in developing countries, was Honda's innovative approach to advertising the Super Cub in women's magazines and promoting it as a vehicle easy enough for anyone to ride, not just men. Demand was so high that Honda decided to build a dedicated factory in Suzuka, Japan. At the time, it was the largest motorcycle factory in the world, pumping out up to 50,000 SuperCubs a month, making it the most produced motorcycle in the world. Keeping operation of the vehicle simple was key, and this led to the development of the semi-automatic centrifugal clutch. This got rid of the need for a manual clutch lever so riders could just shift gears using their foot. Technical innovations saw the Super Cub fitted with a 50cc 4-stroke engine instead of the typical 2-stroke popular at the time, which offered better fuel efficiency and reliability. Since then, the Super Cub has stood the test of time over the decades, and while modern takes offer advancements to the motorcycle, it still retains its signature classic design. Triumph motorcycles are famous for setting many land speed records, and this one — named after the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah — is literally built for speed. The Bonneville was the go-to choice for many celebrities of the 1960s, like Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando, Clint Eastwood, James Dean, and Steve McQueen, and it was featured in many films associated with the counterculture of the time. These days, even Olivia Munn rides a Triumph Bonneville . The original model was the T120, with a 650cc twin-cylinder engine popular for its performance and sleek design. It was also an easily attainable motorcycle — any 18-year-old could walk right up, sign a hire-purchase credit agreement, and ride on out with a new Triumph. What makes the Triumph Bonneville uniquely iconic is its push toward targeting the younger demographic of potential motorcycle riders. After the war, there was an economic boom that saw many young folk with disposable income — and what better purchase than a Triumph? This motorcycle brings back nostalgia for many. Much like the thrill of a first kiss, one can look back fondly and remember the thrill of their first Triumph Bonneville. The Indian Chief is a timeless motorcycle that always turns heads. This iconic piece of history was produced from 1922 until 1953 when the company eventually encountered financial issues that resulted in a halt in production. Although it has had its own bumpy road, this remains a chief American motorcycle. The first models had several innovative features, like a gearbox bolted to the engine casing, a helical gear train versus a chain drive, a wet clutch, and dual camshafts. In 1940, a distinctive design was added — the full-skirted fender became a hallmark and instantly recognizable aspect of an Indian motorcycle. These early designs and features would evolve, and after the Second World War, the Indian Chief was the only pre-war model still was in production. Updates to the original motorcycle included telescopic forks in 1950 and an increased engine size up to 1,300cc. When thinking about iconic motorcycles, picture the famous \"Warbonnet\" logo on the tank and recall the Indian Chief. In 1999, there was a brief revival, but ultimately, the company faced bankruptcy. These classic motorcycles still remain in the hearts of Indian Chief enthusiasts. The R32 was BMW's first successful motorcycle, setting the foundation for the company's future. Produced from 1923 to 1926, it was unveiled at the Berlin Motor Show and later showcased at the Paris Motorcycle Show. It was unlike any other motorcycle manufactured at the time. The bike came equipped with a 494cc M2B33 flat-twin (boxer) air-cooled four-stroke engine with a three-speed manual transmission that put out 8.5 horsepower at 3,200 RPM and could hit a top speed of a whopping 59 mph. At the time, chain drives were the norm, but the R32 had a unique shaft drive system instead. You can't talk about the R32 without overlooking the interesting and novel feature of its recirculating wet-sump oiling system, which was superior and cleaner than the total-loss oiling systems other motorcycles had at the time. With its low center of gravity and short 54-inch wheelbase paired with 26-inch wheels, it was a safe touring motorcycle that could handle rougher terrain. The BMW R32 is still cool, even after 100 years . I think it's safe to say we've all seen the iconic movie scene in \"Terminator 2,\" where the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) rides the Harley-Davidson Fat Boy in pursuit of a young John Connor (Edward Furlong). The motorcycle symbolizes the film's raw, rugged, and powerful nature, just as much as the T-800. First launched in 1990 by Willie G. Davidson, the Harley-Davidson Fat Boy is one of the best models in the company's history . You may be wondering where the name \"Fat Boy\" came from, too. While there are rumors out there, Willie G. claims that due to the motorcycles massive, fat look, the name \"Fat Boy\" stuck. The iconic motorcycle has also seen its fair share of design and technical modifications over the years. Starting with a 1340cc engine in 1990 and then a 1,450cc twin-cam engine in 1999, the Fat Boy got even fatter in 2007, with its engine increasing to 1,584cc and the transmission upgraded to a six-speed. As of 2018, and following the \"Fat\" theme, new models have a 'Milwaukee Eight' 1746 or 1868cc engine with fatter wheels. The Harley-Davidson Fat Boy just keeps on getting bigger and bigger. It's even been immortalized as a Lego toy. When it comes to superbikes, the Ducati 916, which was produced from 1994 to 1998, is often referred to as the \"Michelangelo of Motorcycles.\" Designed by Massimo Tamburini, the Ducati 916 was a work of art — Motorcycle News Magazine called it \"the most beautiful bike of the last 50 years\" in 2014. It certainly made our list of head-turning motorcycles that defined the 90s. The motorcycle featured a 916cc liquid-cooled V-twin engine and put out around 114 horsepower at 9000 rpm, hitting max speeds of up to 161.6 mph. This was complimented with a tubular steel Trellis frame that had a single-sided swingarm and USD fork on the front end adding to its agility and precise handling. The Ducati 916's success on the track, and the fact even non-motorcycle enthusiasts fawned over the motorbike, helped inspire Japanese manufacturers to consider V-twin engines. The legacy of the 916 lives on, too — its successors, the Ducati 996 and 998, were also influenced by the 916's design. Today many collectors and enthusiasts wish to get their hands on arguably the most iconic and revered motorcycle to ever be produced by the Italian manufacturer. Although, some of the other rarest Ducati motorcycles ever built may give the 916 some competition. The Royal Enfield motorcycle company has a rich history. Its Classic 500 model is one of the most iconic, produced from 2008 to 2020. The design has character, a throwback to post-war British motorcycles. The Royal Enfield Classic 500, built in 2020, has a 499cc single-cylinder four-stroke engine, 27.2 horsepower at 5,250 rpm, and a 5-speed transmission. It has kept its old-school, timeless paint design, bobber-style seat, and peashooter exhaust — all reminiscent of simpler times. The bike is lightweight, weighing only around 412 pounds, which makes it easy to handle and operate. It's a tough motorcycle that can even traverse the rugged terrain of South America's famous Gaucho and Dakar trails. And because its horsepower isn't over the top, it's considered a \"gentlemen's\" bike. The Royal Enfield Classic 500 may seem to be stuck in the past, and that's the point. It's a motorcycle that's held onto its classic charm even though there have been over a hundred years of technological development. Every motorcycle enthusiast should know about the Suzuki Hayabusa. Capable of sometimes exceeding 186 mph and named after the fastest bird on the planet, the peregrine falcon, this motorcycle quickly became iconic. Introduced in 1999, its design aesthetics were sleek and curvy, and it honed in on aerodynamics to achieve both speed and stability, which catapulted it to being a favorite with motorcyclists and drag racers. The first generation of Hayabusa was produced from 1999 to 2007 and had a 1,298cc inline-four engine that pumped out 172.5 horsepower. The second generation, produced from 2008 to 2020, saw larger engines at 1,340cc and 195 horsepower. And the most recent third generation, produced in 2021, has maintained the iconic design. This motorcycle, particularly the 1999 and 2000 models, is highly sought after due to its unrestricted speed. The Hayabusa, also known as the GSX1300R, has been touted as inventing a new motorcycle category, \"Ultimate Sport.\" It has undoubtedly solidified its legacy as one of the fastest and most iconic motorcycles ever built. First introduced in 1969, the Honda CB750 is often credited as \"the world's first superbike\" and as the original Universal Japanese Motorcycle (UJM). At the time of development, the bike's design and engineering were unparalleled, challenging what a motorcycle could be and forcing competitors to catch up. The CB750 helped kickstart the golden age of motorcycle development. The CB750 had a 736cc, SOHC, air-cooled, inline four-cylinder engine that produced 67 horsepower at 8,000 rpm. It featured a five-speed transmission, electric starter, and front disc brakes. Adding to the trophy case, the Honda CB750 was named one of Discovery Channel's \"Greatest Motorbikes Ever\" and is in the AMA Hall of Fame Classic Bikes. The motorcycle ceased production in 2007, and today, it is highly sought out by collectors and enthusiasts, with restored models fetching a decent price. A CB750 from 1968 even sold for a massive $263,725, making it one of the most expensive Japanese motorcycles sold at auction. Also known as the \"Rolls-Royce of Motorcycles,\" the Brough Superior SS100 is a legend. Produced from 1924 to 1940, it was considered the fastest and most luxurious motorcycle built. It was the first bike to break the 100 mph world record. The SS100 is such a work of art that each one was hand-built to order with meticulous attention to detail. The rarity of the bike also adds to its iconic status, as only 383 units were built. Today, it's a highly sought after and prized possession. The bike's features were ahead of its time. It had adjustable footrests, rearview mirrors. You could even adjust the height and angle of the saddle. This was true symbol of luxury, ridden by famous people like T.E. Lawrence, aka Lawrence of Arabia. This motorcycle stands as a symbol of pre-war British engineering excellence.",

        "description": "adidas is resurrecting its legendary F50 range to celebrate the boot's 20th anniversary. Like the German sportswear brand's Predator range, the F50 has played an instrumental role in some of football's most cherished memories over the past two decades — from Lionel Messi’s “boot kiss” celebration against Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League final to Melanie Leupolz’s reign of dominance in FC Bayern Women's 2014/15 campaign. Fast Reborn, as the campaign has been named, reintroduces an earlier F50 Messi donned during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The latest iteration of the boot stays faithful to the original purple upper of the 'Chameleon' pack, but crafted with lucid lemon and white detailing in an aerodynamic silhouette that reflects the speed that modern players, such as Rafael Leão, Son Heung-min and Trinity Rodman use to inflict fear into their opponents. View this post on InstagramA post shared by adidas Football (@adidasfootball)“The F50 is a defining boot for so many across the last two decades, and with nine years on ice, the time is right to reintroduce its game-defining speed. With modern-day football so dominated by tactics, statistics, and often rigid tactical structures – sometimes out-and-out speed is the only way of breaking the game,\" said adidas' SVP of Product and Design, Sam Handy, in a statement. \"The design of ‘Fast Reborn’ acknowledges F50’s place in football culture, and the respect it commands, while giving a glimpse into the future potential of the franchise.

Like the German sportswear brand’s Predator range, the F50 has played an instrumental role in some of football’s most cherished memories over the past two decades — from Lionel Messi ’s “boot kiss” celebration against Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League final to Melanie Leupolz’s reign of dominance in FC Bayern Women’s 2014/15 campaign. Fast Reborn, as the campaign has been named, reintroduces an earlier F50 Messi donned during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The latest iteration of the boot stays faithful to the original purple upper of the ‘Chameleon’ pack, but crafted with lucid lemon and white detailing in an aerodynamic silhouette that reflects the speed that modern players, such as Rafael Leão, Son Heung-min and Trinity Rodman use to inflict fear into their opponents. A post shared by adidas Football (@adidasfootball) “The F50 is a defining boot for so many across the last two decades, and with nine years on ice, the time is right to reintroduce its game-defining speed. With modern-day football so dominated by tactics, statistics, and often rigid tactical structures – sometimes out-and-out speed is the only way of breaking the game,” said adidas’ SVP of Product and Design, Sam Handy, in a statement. “The design of ‘Fast Reborn’ acknowledges F50’s place in football culture, and the respect it commands, while giving a glimpse into the future potential of the franchise. We’re excited to share more in the coming months as we enter a new F50 era and show our fans what is under the hood,” Handy added. The Elite Laced ($293 USD) and Laceless ($282 USD) boots are available to purchase online and at select retailers.",

        "content": "Acadia Coombs, 11, holds one of her 30 chickens in their new home in North Harpswell. Acadia sells their output under the name Chipper Chickens Farm Fresh Eggs. Robin Casey photo Imagine you had 30 pet chickens. Could you tell them apart and call each by name? Acadia Coombs can. The pint-sized 11-year-old powerhouse sells organic eggs from her family’s backyard farm along Harpswell Neck Road. She’s been an excited egg entrepreneur since she was 6 years old, even though she doesn’t like to eat eggs. This spring, her father, Bob Coombs, owner of builder R.L. Coombs Inc., was constructing what passing motorists speculated was either a garage or a small house. Turns out it’s the Taj Mahal of chicken coops. Acadia’s pets now have a spacious 14-by-48-foot area enclosed by chicken wire with an attached modern “barn” that’s not like an old-fashioned red barn. This one, with its mono-slope roof, is adjacent to the entrance to Barnes Point Road, and Acadia can ride her bike from her home on nearby Walini Way to feed her fowl. Joining the chicken menagerie is Henry, a portly New Zealand rabbit who was raised with the chickens and snuggles with them at night. Three Rouen ducks are happy paddling in a pond with a fountain on the 1-acre roadside property. On Mother’s Day, the family added twin Nigerian dwarf goats, Ruby and Emerald. Acadia is named after Maine’s national park, of course, and like any diligent poultry farmer, she has compiled spreadsheets with information about her chickens, including breed, date of birth, name, and the color of its eggs (white, medium brown, dark brown or greenish-blue). On a recent spring day after the school bus had dropped her off by the chicken coop, Acadia easily rattled off the monikers of her 18 hens, one rooster and 11 chicks. The hens are Midnight, Chickadee, Chirper, Honey, Big Crown, Birdbrain, Buttercup, Hard Pecker, Pumpkin Pie-Peanut, Lilly, Lilac, Miracle, Spotted, Speckle, Wood Chip, Sweet-pea, Pom Pom and Flapper. The baby chicks are Ugg, Cocoa, Oatmeal, Raisin, Sheli, Turken, Willow, Rusty, Amanda, Emma and Poppy. Petey is the rooster, a “gentleman who’s a good guardian” of the hens, said Acadia’s mother, Lisa. Acadia, an only child who is entering the sixth grade at Harpswell Community School, crosses her arms, puts a finger studiously to her face, and recites the breeds of her chickens. There’s a buttercup, buff Orpingtons, naked neck or turkens, Jersey giants, Araucanas, Wyandottes, white leghorns and an ayam cemani. She can tell if they’re male or female by looking at the shape of their feathers as she gently spreads their wings. “Turkens are my favorite,” she said, cradling a tiny black turken she had fetched from its heated brooder box, its skinny bald neck looking like that of an ostrich. Another favorite pet is Wood Chip, an all-white rescue chicken that can’t walk, likely because of frostbite. Acadia babied the hen back to health. She plucks it from the coop and gently sets it down in the dirt. With its legs unable to bend, it sits on its hocks, flaps its wings to move, and glides to safety under Acadia’s legs. “She’s more of a human chicken,” Acadia said. Why chickens? “It’s kind of a funny story,” Acadia related, her eyes blue as the ocean and her long blonde pigtails swinging from side to side. She told her dad she wanted another animal. “He was like, ‘You can have another animal as long as you can get money out of it.’ I said, ‘A cow?’ Too big. ‘A horse?’ Nope. My dad suggested chickens so I could sell their eggs.” And so began Chipper Chickens Farm Fresh Eggs, selling for $6 a dozen. At first she sold them to friends and neighbors. Now, with the new barn, she can sell them to passersby. Her dad scrambled to finish building the chicken coop in May after the family returned from Costa Rica, where Acadia went to school for three months. Her mom, Lisa, grew up in a city but is no stranger to pitching in to help Acadia. “I’m definitely the backup. (Acadia) gives me jobs and I do them,” Lisa said. Lisa and Bob met when Lisa was his brother’s boxing coach in Portland. Tall and slim, Lisa is a five-time national boxing champion in the welterweight category and was captain of the U.S. women’s boxing team. Because of her efforts, women’s boxing became an Olympic sport in 2012. Acadia said she prefers basketball to boxing. As far as what she wants to do when she grows up, Acadia said, “It’s complicated. When I’m an adult, I want to live in a small house with one or two kids and a 60-acre farm.” That’s after she becomes a veterinarian. In the meantime, Acadia, a preteen who one minute seems like a little girl and the next like a seasoned and wise egg farmer, said she has started writing a book for first-time egg farmers. This summer she’ll also find time to play volleyball and swim. And her mini zoo will keep expanding. Her next pet? A barn cat. Connie Sage Conner is a former editor of The Virginian-Pilot.

        "content": "RICCI RIVERO – University of the Philippines (UP) Fighting Maroons star player Ricci Rivero uploaded photos from 26th birthday party. Ricci Paolo Uy Rivero is a Filipino professional basketball player and actor, known for his dynamic playing style and significant contributions to Philippine basketball. Born on May 25, 1998, in Ilagan, Isabela, Philippines, Ricci grew up in a family with a strong basketball background. He is the younger brother of Prince Rivero, also a notable basketball player. Ricci Rivero attended La Salle Green Hills for his high school education, where he honed his basketball skills and emerged as one of the top high school players in the country.

        "content": "A Chicago man convicted of murder based in part on testimony from a legally blind eyewitness is suing the city and the police department. A judge convicted Darien Harris in 2014 in connection with a fatal shooting at a South Side gas station in 2011. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was freed in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he went free. Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in April alleging police fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses into making false statements, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back together. “I don’t have any financial help. I’m still (treated like) a felon, so I can’t get a good job. It’s hard for me to get into school,” he said. “I’ve been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.” A message The Associated Press left on the city’s Law Department main line seeking comment Monday wasn’t immediately returned. The department provides attorneys for the city, its departments and its employees. Harris was an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested. The legally blind eyewitness picked Harris out of a police lineup and identified him in court. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and saw a person aiming a handgun. He also added that the shooter bumped into him. Harris’ trial attorney asked the witness if his diabetes affected his vision. He said yes but denied he had vision problems. But the man’s doctor deemed him legally blind nine years before the incident, court records show. A gas station attendant also testified that Harris wasn’t the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Chicago’s Cook County in 2023 alone.",

        "description": "Qld Labor has dished out a pre-election sugar hit by way of cheap fares, but a political expert and a former premier say it's still the end of the line.",
        "content": "A surprise move by the Labor state government of Queensland to offer 50-cent tickets for public transport will only win over urban commuters already committed to the Greens. That’s according to a political expert, who says the incumbent government is only delaying a likely election loss in October. Griffith University Associate Professor Paul Williams provided his insight to The Epoch Times after it was announced that from Aug. 5, all Translink public transport tickets would cost just 50 cents as part of a six-month trial. Translink is government-run and is the largest provider of train, bus, and ferry services in Brisbane. But Assoc. Prof. Williams said the problem with policy “sugar hits” was that they seldom worked in an election, and voters often had short memories. “The problem is also that only a minimal number of people use public transport,” he said. The people who were most likely to use it and swing their votes to Labor, he said, were Greens-partial city-slickers who—might—angle their vote the way of Premier Steven Miles. Mr. Miles started above water, and the electorate “gave him a chance,” he said. But Labor’s primary vote is almost certainly likely to sit around the 20 percent mark in Queensland, largely due to voter dissatisfaction in four key areas: cost of living, law and order (especially youth crime), housing, and health. “Nothing will stop [Opposition Leader David] Crisafulli becoming premier in October,” Mr. Williams said. Labor is likely to lose 20 to 25 seats to the LNP (Liberal National Party) and some to the Greens, and there’s nothing they can do about it, according to the academic. “It won’t be a wipe-out, but it'll be a comfortable victory,” he said. “Labor’s careering to certain defeat. “This [50 cent fares] was announced quite quickly and these sorts of sugar hits don’t last.” Voters would most likely like to have seen changes to interest rates, mortgage payments, and grocery bills, he says. “It’s a blatant vote-buying exercise,” he told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s an act of desperation by the premier.” Mr. Newman said it would also lead to a difficult decision for an incoming LNP government who would need to decide whether it could afford to maintain the initiative or not, likely to cost millions. But Mr. Newman, who served as premier from 2012-15, said the move could also be a good way to determine whether public transport ridership increases. “It’s going to be a very interesting experiment to see what happens to public transport patronage in Queensland,” he said, noting it could ease pressure on the roads. “For all intents and purposes, it’s making public transport almost free. I don’t believe it’s sustainable, suddenly, it’s a massive increased cost.” “I expect this will save Queenslanders thousands of dollars over six months, and encourage more people to catch our fast, frequent and 50 cent public transport,” he said in a statement. “Encouraging more Queenslanders to jump on a bus or train to get to work or school will help bust congestion. “Queenslanders are doing it tough, but they can trust that my government is here to help, and we’re doing what matters to Queensland.” The LNP opposition provided a statement to The Epoch Times, saying the party believed Labor had driven costs up and was desperately trying to hold on to voters. “The LNP supports more cost-of-living relief, Queenslanders are doing it tough under a Labor government that’s driven-up living costs,” a spokesperson said. “The LNP is committed to long-term underlying cost of living relief, but after nine years of Labor driving-up costs, Queenslanders see Labor will now do and say anything to cling to power, including announcing measures which expire just weeks after the election.” But Minister for Transport and Main Roads Bart Mellish assured the public the move was one that would help provide hip pocket relief. “The Miles Government is providing critical cost of living relief to Queenslanders,” he said in a statement. “This initiative will importantly mean money in the pockets of families across Queensland.” Queenslanders will head to the polls on October 24.",

So, that's immutable.\" But the judge said sexual assault complainants, with the presumption of innocence afforded to an accused person, hear the court's message as: \"We are entitled to think you might be lying until you prove that you're not.\" \"That's not quite how the system works but that's the messaging,\" she said. \"Part of what we can do without throwing fair trials out the window, I think we can do better in terms of reducing delay.\" The list Chief Justice McCallum is working on a practice direction to announce the list dedicated to progressing sexual assault cases to trial faster. In theory, a sexual violence case committed to the Supreme Court would almost immediately land in the new list and be managed by a judge rather than a registrar. Chief Justice Lucy McCallum. Picture by Karleen Minney The list is intended to help deal earlier with pre-trial issues and things like recording complainant evidence, or work out if legal problems can be dealt with later by a trial judge to help speed up a months-long process. The Chief Justice also said she wanted prosecutors to present an indictment with charges, and for an accused person to be arraigned, at the beginning of proceedings. \"This is going to be across the board for all matters. At the moment the accused aren't arraigned until just before their trial,\" she said. \"I want them to be arraigned earlier, so that they have that focus with their lawyers to think about do they want to plead guilty or not guilty. \"They always can choose not to but I think it's important to maintain the focus on the fact that you're facing these charges, and you need to work out what you're going to do with them.\" The Chief Justice is set to formally announce the list soon. Picture by Karleen Minney Cross-examination \"I fully accept that an accused person is entitled to have a barrister cross-examine the complainant and test their evidence,\" Chief Justice McCallum said. \"That's what a trial is. It's a trial of the evidence.\" But the judge said courts had a statutory duty to disallow cross-examination questions that were \"misleading, confusing, offensive, annoying, harassing, humiliating, or repetitive\". \"So why aren't we doing that? Because we're all scared of not giving an accused a fair trial,\" she said.

I think judges need to own that responsibility a bit more.\" Accused given 'significant leeway' Erin Priestly, head of practice at the Sexual Violence Legal Service, agreed there was an imbalance and legal protections in place for cross-examinations were not invoked as they should be. \"We have observed judges to give significant leeway to the accused party to undertake cross-examination rather than to step in to ensure these protections are enforced,\" she said. The ACT Supreme Court. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong Ms Priestly said she continually observed rape myths invoked during proceedings. \"Perhaps most common is the myth that people will act in a particular way in the days, weeks, months and even years after being subjected to sexual violence,\" she said. \"This is particularly the case when the violence has occurred in the context of intimate partner relationships. A very common immediate response to being subjected to sexual violence is to do nothing.\" The lawyer said rape myths reflect social ideas about what is and isn't sexual violence in the broader community. \"This means it's also critical juries have access to appropriate expert evidence about trauma responses and sexual violence, where appropriate, to combat these pervasive myths,\" she said. The ACT Women's Legal Centre pilot program established last year aims to support complainants through the criminal justice system and \"rebalance the scales\". Ms Priestly said the service supported the introduction of a specialised sexual assault court list, and its goals of reducing delays and achieving earlier resolutions. \"A specialised list is just one step in building faith in the criminal justice system. It alone will not achieve this, however, and it is just one change amongst many that are needed,\" the lawyer said. \"Such a list will only be successful where everyone involved - the judicial officers, the prosecutors, and defence solicitors - have adequate training on trauma responses to sexual violence and consider the design of processes to ameliorate these.\" Support is available for those who may be distressed.

        "content": "Taking a child to the emergency department is a stressful time for any parent. Subscribe now for unlimited access . $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading Continue with Email Continue with Google Continue with Apple See subscription options But a visit can become much more uncomfortable for them both if their child has neurodivergence and feels too overwhelmed to undergo any kind of tests or treatment. Neurodivergence includes autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or dyslexia. Dr Alison Lally, a pediatric specialist at Canberra Hospital, said turning any room into a less chaotic environment for young patients could make all the difference in their care. She has introduced a range of sensory tools like virtual reality goggles equipped with games, magic shows and puzzles along with noise-cancelling muffs, a tablet and a light projector. This could make drawing blood or checking vitals less of a challenge. Dr Alison Lally, right, introduces Annabell Fenton and her neurodivergent son Max, 12, to a virtual reality headset at Canberra Hospital. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong Mum Annabell Fenton said her son Max was \"a frequent flyer\" in the emergency department. She explained the 12-year-old, like most kids with autism, had an ever-changing sensory profile. \"You might be able to cope with pressure on Tuesday, but the next day, because you've had a bad night's sleep or your clothes are too tight, you might not be able to cope with noise,\" she said. 'Life-changing' tools can help avoid trauma Ms Fenton said sensory tools available in hospitals was life-changing for neurodivergent children. She said the extra support could save the children \"a lot of trauma\" in the long run. \"[The system] is not built for an autistic person, it's built for a neurotypical person,\" she said. \"It means our kids will start their journey with the health sector knowing that it's okay to need and expect these things, to say, 'I need sensory support', or 'I'm going to struggle in this setting'.\" Dr Lally, who also has a son with autism, said neurodivergent needs can be hard to grasp for those who don't live with them everyday. Emergency physician James Falconer is part of Canberra Hospital's ED staff. Picture: Karleen Minney \"Having ADHD or being autistic doesn't mean they're bad child or you've been a bad parent. It means we are just making them live in a world that suits us and doesn't suit them. It's similar to going to a foreign country, you don't speak any language,\" Dr Lally said. She said she was advocating for health professionals to \"break the bias\" and educate themselves about how to care for these patients which includes communication style or something as simple as dimming the lights. Parents can request these tools at Canberra Hospital by telling staff what neurodivergence their child has in a form titled CHS Neurodiversity Care Plan. Dr Lally looked forward to the opening of the new critical services building at Canberra Hospital, which has a dedicated sensory room for those who need it.

Subscribe now for unlimited access . $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading Continue with Email Continue with Google Continue with Apple See subscription options In its 2024-25 pre-budget submission, Professionals Australia found that the public sector risked being caught in the \"slow lane of a two-speed industry\". Reported pay rises were 2 per cent in the Australian Public Service compared with 5 to 7 percent in other tech roles, the union reported. Medium base rates of pay of between $71,000 to $152,000 were being offered in the APS compared with between $110,000 to $187,000, plus stock options worth about $100k, \"which is now typical in new tech companies\". One of the sticking points to tech recruitment in the APS was identified as the 11.2 per cent salary cap increase over three years, as set by the Australian Public Service Commission. The union also urged swift action and investment to address science, technology, engineering and mathematics skill shortages in public sector agencies by removing average staffing level caps in public service agencies. \"Unfortunately STEM skill shortages threaten to derail the delivery of major infrastructure projects, the transition to green energy and digital transformation,\" the report said. Professionals Australia's government director Kathleen Studdert said that for the APS to build its STEM capability it needed to become competitive in a market for technical and engineering talent. Professionals Australia's Kathleen Studdert says the APS needs to build its tech capability. Picture by Keegan Carroll \"There is a benefit to doing meaningful, impactful work in the public sector that can and will attract talented and ambitious people,\" she said. \"Setting up a technical and engineering remuneration framework is a crucial first step to this. \"In some cases the total remuneration gap is six figures between public and private sector employers. It doesn't necessarily need to be dollar for dollar, but it needs to be in the same ballpark.\" PA members work in both the private and public sectors and its ranks include engineers, scientists, pharmacists, IT professionals, translators and interpreters. In spruiking the May budget, Public Service Minister Katy Gallagher said the public sector had grown by 10,000 people in the past year. And that public sector growth will continue in the next financial year . Social Services will grow by 3472 roles in the next financial year - largely spread across Services Australia and the National Disability Insurance Agency - while Treasury's growth is predominantly linked to a 1771 increase to staffing in the Tax Office. The PA submission identified two key safety agencies, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Australian Transport Safety Bureau, as experiencing significant technical staff shortages and budgetary constraints, \"undermining their capacity to maintain the integrity of Australia's transport safety regulatory regime\". For instance, more than eight months on from the horrific Gundaroo plane crash in which a pilot and three children were killed , the ATSB is yet to issue its final report and potentially explain why an emergency parachute in the Cirrus aircraft failed to deploy. \"Unfortunately, the ATSB's workforce has seen significant turnover over the last seven years, and rising demand in each of the sectors the bureau manages (rail, aviation and marine) coupled with budget shortfalls has meant the capacity of the bureau to undertake investigations has been reduced,\" it said. The PA submission also found women were still seriously underrepresented in tech fields, especially engineering and IT. \"In addition, workplace outcomes for women in STEM remained unequal. The STEM Equity Monitor revealed that in 2022 the gender pay gap in all STEM industries was 17 per cent,\" it reported.

Rachel Stephen-Smith encouraged First Nations Canberrans to consider standing for election to the body. \"I think the referendum on recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through a Voice to Parliament has raised the profile of our own elected body,\" Ms Stephen-Smith said. \"And I hope that will encourage more people to have their say to ensure that we're electing a strong Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, and also to participate in the review so that we can continue to strengthen that voice to the ACT government and Assembly.\" Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith. Picture by Karleen Minney Ms Stephen-Smith said the failed referendum for a national Voice to Parliament had raised the profile of the Elected Body. \"I think one of the many reasons that Canberra's were the only jurisdiction to vote yes in the referendum last year was because we had the experience of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice to government, and we know that it's made a positive impact,\" she said. Nominations to run for the 2024 Elected Body election opened last week and will close at noon on Monday, June 3. Voting opens on July 6 and closes at 6pm on Saturday, July 13. Elections for the seven-member body are held every three years. Eighteen people nominated for the 2021 election, and 267 eligible people cast formal ballots in the election. Census data collected in 2021 by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed there were more than 6000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Canberra who would have been eligible to vote. A report into the conduct of the election, released by Elections ACT in 2021, said: \"At the time of polling at the [Alexander Maconochie Centre] on Wednesday 7 July 2021, approximately 101 detainees identified as being an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander. Of the 101 potential electors, a total of 19 people cast a vote.\" The Auditor-General last year found the part-time Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body in the ACT, which attracts low voter turnout, risked being an ineffective support for Indigenous self-determination in the ACT. An independent review is considering the future of the Elected Body, with the government earlier this year committing to working with the ACT's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community on improvements. The ACT committed $1.19 million over three years to increase members' paid time and set up an independent secretariat. \"The more people who are going to come out and vote, the more people are going to have conversations about the elected body - and then that will encourage more people to get involved,\" Ms Stephen-Smith said.

        "description": "Yes, her dad’s Ethan Hawke and her mum’s Uma Thurman. But Maya Hawke is creating thoughtful work on her own terms – including her new album, Chaos Angel.",
        "content": "On a highway somewhere between Atlanta and South Carolina, Maya Hawke is enjoying a brief respite from armageddon. She’s been given a few days off from shooting the final season of Stranger Things , the Netflix hit where she plays the loveable, neurotic video shop clerk Robin Buckley, and the 25-year-old has decided to break up the grind of the lengthy shoot – “We started in January, and we’ll probably be done in January. It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” she deadpans – with an impromptu road trip. By the time she phones through for our scheduled interview, she’s already singing the classics. “We’ve been listening to a podcast on the history of the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte,” she says with a dry laugh, when I ask her for the road trip’s playlist. It’s not Sabrina Carpenter and it’s not the Beatles’ Black Album , the famous mixtape her dad Ethan Hawke once curated for her and later repurposed for his role in Richard Linklater’s Boyhood , but it feels delightfully on brand for the most cerebral of Gen-Z’s rising screen stars. “I remember it all pretty well from grade school,” Hawke adds. “I can sing along if I try really hard, shouting out Bastille Day, really vibing with it.” Beyond the screen, Hawke – the daughter of Ethan and Uma Thurman, who, besides Stranger Things , earned acclaim for her recent performances in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City and Bradley Cooper’s Maestro – is gearing up for the release of Chaos Angel , her third album of thoughtful indie-pop following Blush (2020) and Moss (2022), albums which, while sonically sparse, showcased her sensitive, expressive songwriting. If Moss was her musical unveiling, particularly via its breakout single Therese , inspired by modern artist Balthus’ Therese Dreaming , Chaos Angel , elevates her work further, both with its sonic ambition and an increasing boldness in her songwriting. Take the lead single Missing Out , for example, where Hawke sings about naive kids envying her “television salary” and her own conflicted feelings about “being born with my foot in the door”, as though she’s grappling with the privilege of how she grew up while also wondering if she lost something along the way. “I don’t see Missing Out as any more revealing than any of my other songs, but it’s possible it’s revealing aspects of my thinking that are more salacious to people in, like, a kind of headliney way,” Hawke concedes, perhaps a weary glare to the nepo narrative that’s become every Hollywood scion’s burden. The song was inspired by Hawke’s misgivings about having skipped college at 18 in order to live on her own and pursue acting opportunities instead. The decision left her feeling so alienated among her own generation that years later, she tagged onto her brother Levon’s experience at Brown University, where she dropped in on random lectures on the history of Hinduism, Eastern religion, and the history of China for three months. “Yes, there was a poetic irony to it,” Hawke says, when I suggest most uni kids are trying to get out of class, not get into ones they aren’t even enrolled in. “But it was so fun and so enlightening. I got to sneak into classes and listen to professors talk, and I’m grateful to my brother for allowing me to do that and to talk about it publicly, because both things are slightly embarrassing for him.” By the time summer break came around, Hawke had found perspective. “I was like, you know what? I like my life. I don’t have any regrets. But I wrote a song about it, so not a total waste of time.” It’s a strange thing to admit to an interview subject that you might have inadvertently stalked them years ago, when they were merely a child clutching their famous father’s hand during a leisurely stroll around their home neighbourhood, but here we are. It was over a decade ago, I tell Hawke, and my girlfriend and I were tourists in New York, on our way to explore Chelsea’s recently opened High Line, when we stumbled across Ethan Hawke in the streets with kids in tow. Obviously, we did what any Before Sunrise enthusiast would do and surreptitiously walked in the same direction for a string of blocks to see what exciting movie star business he was getting up to. About 10 minutes later, we gave up out of both shame and boredom. What was surprising, however, was the space and respect his fellow New Yorkers afforded Hawke. He might have attracted the odd head turn, but no one bothered him – just a dude taking a walk with his family. You sense that even with two Hollywood superstars for parents, Maya’s childhood was decidedly sheltered from typical movie star eccentricities. “One thing that’s wonderful about my parents is that they never had an overblown sense of their own importance,” says Hawke. “They felt like artists, in that their relationship to their work was not as celebrities or famous people, but as people whose job it was to make art. And so they acted like anyone would with that; they just saw it as their job. That’s what I was brought up around, an understanding that a life in the arts is a job and it’s a craft. It’s a beautiful privilege to have that job, but it’s also a job like everyone else’s and it’s not more or less important than anyone else’s.” Growing up in such an environment, a life in the arts was always likely. “My whole life was drowned in the arts,” says Hawke. “I did every school play, I was always writing songs, I was always doing watercolours, I was always writing poems. Being in New York City, we’d go to the Met, the theatre, see plays on Broadway, things off-Broadway. It just felt like a necessary part of life – you eat, you sleep, you try to move your body, you try to go to school, and you try to consume a little art and make a little art, too.” In an interview with Variety , Ethan once mentioned he knew the exact moment Maya would follow in her parents’ footsteps, after he brought her along to a technical read through of a Shakespeare play he was in, and was shocked to find she wasn’t bored at all. But when does Maya pinpoint her professional awakening? “It was doing Euripides’ Bacchae in my junior year, directed by Laura Barnett, at my high school Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn,” she says. “I dove into it completely. I didn’t study for my SAT, I didn’t focus on anything else, I just let myself be an actor and it was the best feeling I’d ever had. It felt like I was home, I loved the community, I loved the friendships I made. That experience, and how positive it was, became kind of like the golden compass, alethiometer, of my life. I was like, OK, I’m gonna chase that feeling.” Music was a similarly organic pursuit, fuelled by childhood guitar, piano and singing lessons, and the realisation that songwriting was a prime form of communication that persuaded the people around her to listen more. “I’m still this kind of person who practises for my conversations. Like, if we were roommates and we were gonna have a big talk about the fact that you don’t do the dishes enough, I would practise that conversation in my head a lot, and I would find that putting melodies to my rehearsed conversations and making them rhyme was a better way to remember them.” Negative preconceptions about actors who make music are prevalent, and Hawke hasn’t been immune. She credits her producer and co-writer Christian Lee Hutson (to whom she’s also been romantically linked ) for being “a huge influence in shirking some of the imposter syndrome, though I still have a lot”. “I still have imposter syndrome but it’s gotten a lot better,” says Hawke. “On my first record I really felt like I had to keep the songs completely bare, like only use acoustic instruments and not double my vocal or have any harmonies because I didn’t want anyone to think that I had, you know, ‘bought a record’ – like, hired a producer to make me sound good. If they didn’t like me, I wanted to make sure they knew that they didn’t like me and not that they didn’t like the choices somebody else had made. “But I think each record has gotten less constrained by my fear and more playful and more present, and I think it’s just from education. The more you learn, the less afraid you are. Knowledge is power.” Her confidence is present on Chaos Angel, a warm album that’s more sonically layered than Hawke’s others, with its use of samples, horns, electronics and distortion, inspired by artists she was listening to at the time including Liz Phair, Mazzy Star, Buffy Sainte-Marie, James Blake, and our own Julia Jacklin. “About my first few records, people kept writing that they were sparse,” she says. “And I definitely had a goal to have no one say that this was sparse.” The song Dark , which she’s said “emerged from a major anxiety episode following a soul-shattering break-up”, highlights Hawke’s way with a good line (“I’m your guitar, mute me gently with the palm of your hand”). You can imagine the Notes app on her phone is loaded. “It’s very chaotic,” Hawke admits. “I like to play this game called ‘Notes Roulette’, where you and another person pick a date and you scroll through your phone to find the note you made on that day and you have to read it out loud. Fun game, I highly recommend it,” she adds. “Nothing’s more revealing than a grocery list.” In a recent interview, Hawke said that Chaos Angel , the album’s titular track, came out of the mindset she was in while making Wildcat , a film she did with her father Ethan where she played author Flannery O’Connor. It seems like being in such a space of imagination and creative empathy offers a fertile overlap for songwriting. “I think they work very well together, and I highly recommend that all actors write music,” she says, noting that acting’s a form of “reaching out” to better understand the world, while songwriting is an act of “digging deep” to figure out what you feel and think. Each practice lies in a desire to “express, pursue truth and tell stories”, says Hawke, but she admits, as her music career flourishes, that it’s becoming difficult to juggle both. Is there some sort of plan to how she navigates her career or is she just feeling her way through? “I still audition a bunch and I’ve taken most every good job that’s come my way. I think that a lot of people see the roles that actors choose as, like, intensely reflective on them, and that’s partially true. But also, most actors I know, even really successful ones, are kind of going with the flow and, like, whatever good writing comes their way they want to do, basically,” says Hawke. “I mean, you’d be hard-pressed to find a kind of person that’s more gung ho, ‘put me in, coach!’ than an actor – they’re a pretty excitable group of volunteers.” Having veterans in her corner (yes, Mum and Dad), only helps to a degree. “I think people really overestimate the amount of strategy that goes into an actor’s career, you know?” Hawke jokes. “I mean, it’s a lot of auditioning, taking the jobs that come your way, and hoping that more do. “The advice I get from my parents is always more minutiae-based – ‘I don’t want to do this job but it’s a good job, would I be stupid not to do it?’ or ‘What should I do if I’m having an uncomfortable experience with my scene partner?’ In terms of what projects to do and how to spend your career, that’s mostly 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent instinct.” Her next role will see her playing Anxiety in Pixar’s Inside Out 2 , a casting stroke that feels inspired considering her public persona – that rare star who appears introverted, slightly uncomfortable with the spotlight. “Wow, is that my persona?” Hawke says. “I don’t feel like that’s who I am as a person. I mean, of course I have anxiety, but I don’t think I have any more anxiety than the average person. In fact, I might be lucky enough to have a little bit less.” OK, but has she ever seen herself on a talk show? There’s a kind of charming, nervous energy there that is a large part of what makes her feel relatable to audiences, despite her atypical upbringing. Is it painful for her to get up on stage, or to see herself on screen? “I mean, I’m not gonna be like, ‘No, I’m totally comfortable on stage!’ I’m totally nervous and excited, and I feel like I want to express myself and I want to be understood, and I’m afraid that I won’t be or that I won’t be good enough. But it doesn’t feel painful, it’s joyful,” says Hawke. “There’s a great David Bowie quote about that: ‘You want to be just deep enough in the water so that your toes don’t touch the bottom’. That’s how I feel. I’m happiest when I’m just deep enough out there into the realm of what scares me that my toes don’t touch the bottom, and I can explore that and just, you know, kick my feet a little.” Maya Hawke’s Chaos Angel is out on May 31.

The theme for 2024 is \"Now More Than Ever\", to facilitate conversation about shared histories and cultures like Uncle Billy T from Yukembruk Dreaming Dance Academy. \"Our dance group is not just about local dance, it's about the community,\" he said. \"Also recognising who we are as First Nations people, learning the songs and the dances. A lot of people just watch, they don't know what the song is about or the dance is about.\" The Yukembruk dance group followed Uncle Billy's smoking ceremony to welcome the community onto Country. \"It's good to see the whole community here as well,\" he said. Stevie Greenaway is a member of the Yukembruk dance group, alongside her children. Leilani Greenaway, 14, Uncle Billy T, Stevie Greenaway and Janara Duffin, 13, from the Yukembruk (black crow) dreaming dance academy on Monday. Picture by Keegan Carroll She said that people who come to these events get a better understanding of what Indigenous communities are about. \"It means the Aboriginal people and our culture being accepted by the wider community, which obviously, it already should be.\" \"The Yukembruk dance group allows my children to practice their cultural skills when we're not living on country, which to me as an Aboriginal woman is just amazing.\" \"Unless we do that, we're never going to be acknowledged, our culture won't reach where it should reach.\" In the children's marquee, activities that displayed Indigenous culture included Aboriginal symbol tracing, Yulunga language development games and the Wiradjuri dance dice. Ms Greenaway said her kids might have friends who don't understand Indigenous culture, so raising them to tell their friends who they are, and where they come from, in the story behind our First Nations people was important. \"I hope to raise strong, black, proud children who will always stand up for their rights, their country and their culture. That's what I want as a mum.\" Families gathered around the main stage where entertainment like Wallabindi and Djaarmby Band shared stories and song. AJ and Debbie Wiltshire were among those in attendance reflecting on what Reconciliation Day means to them. \"I think it's important to spread the message of reconciliation and everyone needs to be a part of it,\" they said. \"The more we can be around and talk about Aboriginal issues and bring them to the public, I think, the more the better.\" Local Canberra residents, like Martin Lumb, who, despite not often going to events like these, showed up to be part of the conversation. \"It's important that despite the referendum, we need to keep having some presence,\" he said. Fleur Taylor-Lumb said: \"It's a reminder of how far Australia hasn't come.\" Share Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Email Copy More from Canberra Hate speech laws 'too late' as anti-Semitism continues to spread in ACT 41m ago Reconciliation needed 'now more than ever' in Canberra 41m ago No comment s More polling places in effort to boost votes for First Nations voice 41m ago Public sector STEM roles under threat with wages 'in the slow lane' 41m ago No comment s More from Canberra Hate speech laws 'too late' as anti-Semitism continues to spread in ACT 41m ago Reconciliation needed 'now more than ever' in Canberra 41m ago No comment s More polling places in effort to boost votes for First Nations voice 41m ago Public sector STEM roles under threat with wages 'in the slow lane' 41m ago No comment s Huge opportunities for regions as 'late to abate' sectors play catch-up 41m ago No comment s Tools to dim the 'chaos' for kids in Canberra's emergency department 41m ago No comment s More from Canberra Hate speech laws 'too late' as anti-Semitism continues to spread in ACT 41m ago Reconciliation needed 'now more than ever' in Canberra 41m ago No comment s More polling places in effort to boost votes for First Nations voice 41m ago Public sector STEM roles under threat with wages 'in the slow lane' 41m ago No comment s Huge opportunities for regions as 'late to abate' sectors play catch-up 41m ago No comment s Tools to dim the 'chaos' for kids in Canberra's emergency department 41m ago No comment s",

        "description": "From student to director, Lisa Pavane’s storied 46-year journey with the Australian Ballet School is drawing to a close.",
        "content": "Lisa Pavane arrived at the Australian Ballet School as a starry-eyed teenager. Forty-six years later, she’s leaving after nine years as its director. The school celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2024, but has only been overseen by four directors across that period. Each person who led the school clearly left their mark; during Pavane’s tenure, the old stereotype of the draconian ballet taskmaster who demands everything of their students has been replaced by an approach she describes as “holistic”. Lisa Pavane is retiring after nine years helming the Australian Ballet School. Credit: Hilary Walker “We’re so fortunate in the way that we’re looking at our young people and their health and wellbeing. That’s a real lens now,” she says. “It’s a very vigorous vocation, so having that education around how you look after your body and how you learn about it and how you fuel it, prepare it, condition it, is leaps and bounds from when I went to the school.” When Pavane was a student, there was an implicit understanding that dancers were to be seen and not heard. Now the atmosphere is one of collaboration. “We’re trying to break down that hierarchy, that power between teacher and student and really levelling it out. Inviting young people to step into the space, to be their own learners and understand their learning. We’re inviting a lot more conversation.” Greg Horsman and Lisa Pavane perform in Giselle, 1990. Credit: The Australian Ballet Dancer and choreographer Kevin Jackson says that Pavane’s interest in giving students more chances to explore their own artistic voice and contribute to classes has lifted the local ballet scene on the whole. “Lisa’s been a visionary in her response to investing in homegrown talent. She’s given the students of today the opportunity to experience the creative part of the profession, and allowed a space for choreographers to explore their art.” Pavane says that a nurturing learning environment leads to far better outcomes than a whip-cracking, disciplinarian approach. Lisa Pavane is proud of the way the school has become more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. Credit: Lynette Wills “We know through positive education and psychology that when they’re happy, they’re thriving, they’re flourishing, they’re feeling comfortable in the space, then their brain is open and they’re much more open to learning. That’s our philosophy, embedded in what we do every day now.” Pavane is also proud of the way the school has become less of a closed shop and more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. “I’ve worked to try and open up the school so that we have more accessibility and more connection with the community. “We have an incredible love and passion for teaching and dancing and nurturing the future generation of dancers. We can all learn from each other. We’re really trying to inspire that and not feel that we’re better than anyone else.” In the nine years she has been the school’s director, Pavane hasn’t been the sort who leads from afar. “Lisa is very involved,” says Jackson. “She’s always there for assessments and will come into rehearsals for the productions we do, as a mentor not only to the choreographer but also to the students.” Pavane has been an influential mentor in Jackson’s own career, from his time training as a teacher at the school to his development as a choreographer. But along with the success stories come those who don’t find a career in dance is on the cards. “We talk about the holistic person and the skills that they learn, whether it be from one year, three years, five years of this amazing discipline, that they can take into all walks of life. When we hear back from young people that have left the school for whatever reason they speak so highly of the skills you learn from being in this artistic field,” says Pavane. After graduating from the school, Pavane rose to become a principal artist at the Australian Ballet before enjoying a long international career. En Pointe , the final Australian Ballet School performance under her stewardship, will be performed at Hamer Hall on May 28 and at The Round, Nunawading on August 21. She’s looking forward to a little break, but she’s not putting her feet up for good. “This school gave me my life, it gave me my career, and I’ve loved every minute that I’ve spent in it ... I’m certainly not going to be putting on my slippers and sitting on the couch with my knitting needles just yet.” En Pointe is on at Hamer Hall on May 28 and The Round on August 21.

        "content": "The NBA conference finals are lacking drama, as both series appear headed for a sweep and a finals clash between the Celtics and Mavericks. Indiana goes into Game 4 on Monday night attempting to save their season as a 7.5-point home underdog. Oddsmakers at DraftKings , among others, are clearly expecting a sweep. Ahead of Game 1 , we noted that the Celtics do not turn the ball over nor do they get their shots blocked. Wise bettors have smashed that trend into oblivion. Those prop projections have all plummeted thanks to a 100 percent win rate on Myles Turner’s blocks, steals, and blocks + steals prop in each of the first three games. Bettors who have followed the trend are more than 10 units of profit on three games, but oddsmakers, as always, are adjusting. Turner’s prop projection is down to 1.5 steals + blocks ahead of Game 4, and there likely will be no Tyrese Haliburton going forward . (8 p.m. ET, ESPN) Many have joked about Andrew Nembhard’s sudden emergence as he’s thrown up shots and connected on many, especially during a 32-point outburst in Game 3 . He kept the Pacers on top for most of that game before the Celtics furiously rallied to win. If Nembhard can’t keep up that hot shooting, the Pacers are live to get smoked Monday at home. And that’s where we could see some mop-up duty from guys like Peyton Pritchard, Sam Hauser and Xavier Tillman Sr. Based on the oddsmaker’s opinion of this game, it should seem likely that the Celtics are able to sit their starters for large portions of Monday’s contest. Hauser played 22 minutes in the Game 2 blowout (1-for-5 from 3-point range). Target Hauser in Game 4; he’s taking a ton of shots and his poor shooting has been nothing short of shocking, considering the Pacers own the worst defense in the NBA playoffs. Hauser is 1-for-11 in this series, taking multiple 3-pointers in each game he has played. His projection is 3.5 points, according to FanDuel and BetMGM, but given the expected game script and freedom he’s being given to fire away whenever he has the ball, he’s a good bet. Hauser’s overs are all worth targeting. Here’s my plan of attack for Game 4. PICKS: Hauser over 3.5 points scored (-113, BetMGM ) | 2+ 3-pointers made (+175, FanDuel ) | 10+ points scored (+500, Bet365 )",

        "content": "Anti-Semitic attacks are continuing in the territory, as a Jewish community leader dismissed the Albanese government's consultation on new laws to ban hate speech as \"too little, too late\". Subscribe now for unlimited access . $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading Continue with Email Continue with Google Continue with Apple See subscription options The Canberra Times has been sent a photo of graffiti in Civic calling on Jews to leave, as evidence anti-Semitic hate speech continues in the ACT. The graffiti, scrawled onto a wall in East Row earlier this month, comes after nearby Anita Gelato was targeted with anti-Israel stickers in November . Australian Jewish Association president Robert Gregory, who took the photo while visiting Canberra on May 12, said it was no consolation the federal Attorney-General was progressing hate speech laws, when anti-Semitism had been allowed to spread for the past seven months. \"The Albanese government should have taken action immediately following the protest outside the Opera House on 9 October when it was clear anti-Semitism was spreading,\" Mr Gregory said. \"They have allowed the situation to deteriorate.\" Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus is consulting on a standalone hate speech bill while still seeking to include religious vilification prohibitions in the government's controversial Religious Discrimination Bill . Mr Dreyfus said the Albanese government \"is committed to promoting and supporting respect, acceptance and understanding across the Australian community\". \"We are committed to protecting the community from those who promote extremism, hatred or seek to incite violence,\" he said in a statement. Federal Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus is consulting on hate speech laws. Picture by Karleen Minney Mr Gregory said it was \"not necessarily clear that there needs to be new laws\" and that there needed to be \"enforcement of the existing laws\". He acknowledged disagreement over the precise words chanted at the pro-Palestine Opera House protest, but said \"either way, the conduct was unacceptable.\" The ACT already has a ban on religious vilification as part of its Discrimination Act. It is unclear how frequently it is being enforced. Federal Opposition frontbencher Dan Tehan said the Coalition would \"work with the government in a bipartisan way\" on laws to address religious vilification amid the \"growing anti-Semitism, which is occurring at the moment\". \"The government has been too late to this issue, far too late to this issue, and we need to take strong action,\" he said. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles on Monday condemned \"confronting\" levels of anti-Semitism in Australia after a Jewish school in Melbourne was vandalised with threatening graffiti. \"We need to be, as a country, mature enough to be able to have a debate about what's going on overseas, to allow people to have their completely legitimate right to express their views about what's happening overseas - but to do that in a way which does not challenge our own social cohesion,\" Mr Marles said. Mr Marles visited Mount Scopus College after the school's fence was found sprayed with the words \"Jew die\", words he said \"have no place in our society\". Speaking alongside Labor MP Josh Burns, a former student of the school, he said the number of incidents of extreme hate speech he had observed in recent months were higher \"than any that I've seen during my lifetime\". Mr Burns said it was \"just devastating to see the graffiti outside a place that was such a big part of my life\". \"We need ... to stand strong and to stand firm against anti-Semitism in all of its forms,\" he said. A spokesperson for ACT Policing said it had \"received a report of a Civic business having propaganda stickers relating to protests placed on them\" in November. \"ACT Policing continues to monitor this type of behaviour and will prosecute as required those who are responsible for acts of public nuisance, vandalism or criminal damage,\" the statement said. \"We support a tolerant and inclusive society and encourage anyone who is the victim of racial vilification to report this crime to police.\" Share Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Email Copy Dana Daniel Senior Political Reporter Dana Daniel is Senior Political Reporter for The Canberra Times.

        "description": "City councillor notes naloxone kits were installed in City of Richmond facilities 'swiftly.'",
        "content": "Dear Editor, Re: \" How do Richmond schools respond to drug overdoses and poisonings ?\" May 22, 2024 It appears that Richmond schools have not taken any proactive measures to address drug overdoses and poisonings at this point. The Board of Education and their administration seem to be stuck in a state of political and bureaucratic gridlock. After a heated debate among trustees in December 2023, a motion was passed to conduct a feasibility study on the naloxone issue. The latest update indicates that the study is expected to be completed by the end of the school year. In contrast, Richmond City Council swiftly passed a motion in November 2023 to install naloxone kits in all civic facilities, including the Richmond Olympic Oval. Within just 30 days the process started, and now over 40 locations in the city are equipped with naloxone, alongside automated external defibrillators. There is a growing consensus among public health experts and policymakers that having naloxone available in high schools can be life-saving in the event of an opioid overdose. Given the infiltration of “street fentanyl” into the illicit drug market and the prevalence of drug experimentation among young people in high schools, it is imperative to have naloxone readily accessible to respond effectively to emergencies. Naloxone, also known as the “Lazarus Drug,” has been proven to rapidly reverse opioid overdoses by blocking the effects of opioids like fentanyl. Its effectiveness lies in its ability to work only when opioids are present in the system. It’s crucial for decision-makers to consult with local health authorities, school administrators and other stakeholders to establish protocols for the proper use of naloxone in high schools. In my years of researching drug policy, I have not encountered any experts who oppose the expansion of naloxone availability. While I cannot predict when, or if, the Board of Education will take action, I emphasize the moral imperative of prioritizing the preservation of lives. I urge the trustees to unite and fulfill their duty as guardians of our youth to prevent unnecessary tragedies.

        "description": "I'd buy these two shares over a Powerball ticket any day.The post Forget lottery tickets, I'd buy these ASX shares instead appeared first on The Motley Fool Australia.",
        "content": "You might have heard someone talk about the recent Powerball jackpot at your most recent barbeque or water cooler gathering. Nothing gets as a-gossiping more it seems than a monstrous, life-changing jackpot up for grabs. Certainly not ASX shares. Last week's $150 million Powerball jackpot remains unclaimed at the time of writing, although we do know that the winning ticket was purchased in South Australia. Whilst this gargantuan amount of cash has understandably got everyone talking (and dreaming), it's probably worth discussing the pitiful odds of this windfall coming to you. According to , mathematician Adam Spencer has estimated that the odds of winning last week's $150 million jackpot was a staggering 134 million to one. Here's how that looks written out: 134,000,000,000 : 1 Spencer expanded by walking us through the maths: First of all, you have to get seven correct out of 35... That is a one in 6.8 million chance. If you get through that hoop, you then have a one in 20 chance of getting the final ball. The total odds are one in 134 million. Not much of a gambler myself, I like the idea of getting a decent return on one's cash using ASX shares instead. Buying an ASX share almost certainly isn't going to make you a millionaire 134 times over in one day. However, the probability of you building life-changing wealth using the share market is a lot more appealing than buying a lottery ticket. So if you missed out on last week's jackpot, here are two ASX shares I think you'd be better off buying than another long-shot lotto ticket. Two ASX shares I'd buy over a lottery ticket First up is the ( ). This isn't really an individual ASX share, but represents an investment in a whole bunch. How many? Well, VAS tracks the (ASX: XKO), which means it holds the largest 300 shares on the Australian share market within it. That's everything from ( ) and ( ) to ( ) and ( ). Think of this index fund as buying a small share of all the lottery tickets on the ASX. You won't get rich overnight. But over time, you'll enjoy the average return of the entire stock market. This average return has historically been rewarding. Since this index fund's inception in 2009, it has averaged a return of 8.97% per annum (as of 30 April). Whilst past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, I think an index fund like VAS is about as good as it gets if you're looking for a sturdy long-term investment. If you can't win the Powerball, buy it Next, we have ( ). Yep, none other than the very ASX share that runs the Powerball. Lottery Corp has exclusive licenses to run lotteries and Keno in most Australian states and territories. Whilst only one person tends to benefit from a Powerball win, every single Lottery Corp shareholder benefits when a Powerball ticket is sold. As such, I think you'd be better off betting on the ASX share that runs the Powerball than trying to beat those one in 134 million odds. Lottery comparisons aside, I like Lottery Corp as an ASX share investment. We all tend to want to try our luck with a lotto ticket or at Keno in all kinds of economic weather. That makes Lottery Corp a reliable and defensive investment in my view. Additionally, this company pays a decent, , which means that there's a good chance (a lot better than the lotto) you'll get paid every six months just for owning this company's shares.",

        "description": "Out-of-date thinking on heavy industries needs to change.",
        "content": "The regions are key to Australia's enormous emissions reduction potential. They also stand to gain from its equally enormous clean energy and industry opportunities. Login or signup to continue reading Australia and its regions have incredible advantages: abundant renewable resources, a strong industrial history, a skilled workforce and established trading partners, ready and waiting for our green products. Despite these advantages, the country's heavy industries have been defined by many as \"hard to abate\" - in other words, it is considered difficult to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. But that thinking is out of date: it is rather that they are \"late to abate\". Climateworks co-convened the four-year Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative which found it is possible to eliminate over 90 per cent of emissions in Australia's major heavy industry supply chains of iron and steel, aluminium, liquified natural gas, chemicals and mining of other metals such as copper and lithium. The other good news is Australia's heavy industries and associated emissions are clustered in a handful of places across the country. Five industrial regions - Illawarra, Hunter, Kwinana, Gladstone and the Pilbara - account for one-eighth of Australia's total emissions. That's equivalent to the emissions of every car and light commercial vehicle across the country. That is why taking a place-based \"Net Zero Industrial Precinct\" approach makes so much sense for Australia, alongside other national and state policies. The idea is relatively simple - focus on where the emissions and industries are and supercharge them with plenty of renewable energy, green hydrogen and shared infrastructure and take advantage of their existing skilled workforce. A place-based approach also allows for the costs, risks and benefits to be shared, and actions to be coordinated. Net Zero Industrial Precincts are a major revitalisation opportunity for our industrial heartlands to ensure they - and the communities they support - remain competitive in a decarbonised world. It wasn't that long ago that solar panels were considered a novel, emerging technology. I can remember in 2010 when Climateworks Centre showcased different low carbon solutions for Australia and solar ranked behind energy efficiency, transport and carbon farming. Today, close to 3 million Australian homes have rooftop solar, supplying over 10 per cent of the country's power. We have the highest amount of solar PV per person in the world and a renewable energy target of 82 per cent by 2030 for the national electricity grid. Earlier this month the federal budget showcased Future Made in Australia, a framework focused on developing wind and solar in addition to clean industries like green hydrogen and critical minerals. Australia is starting to focus on decarbonising not just the grid we have today but the economy we want tomorrow - one with prosperous clean industries that generations of Australians can work in and benefit from. Australia's national net zero legislation is now two years old, and older for all the state and territory governments and many companies and financial institutions. New national laws will require large companies' financial reports to include their emissions; those of their suppliers and customers; their forward targets to reduce emissions and their transition plan to get them there. Having agreed to net zero targets, now every country, sector and company needs a plan to achieve it. That's where the Australian government's sector decarbonisation plans come into play. The government is developing national net zero sector plans for the major parts of our economy that matter for emissions reduction: Electricity and energy, Industry, Resources, Transport, Built environment and Agriculture and land. There are a few key things that need to be taken into account when developing and implementing these plans. To solve for what the science demands, they should align ambition with the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming limit in the Paris Agreement. There are also many interdependencies between sectors. Most obvious is the energy and electricity sector, which must move quickly to build the renewable energy needed to power the decarbonisation of other sectors, including the built environment, industry and transport. Management textbooks say when you set your strategy you make a plan and provide targets and resources to those responsible for implementing it. We are now in the era where net zero strategy, targets and plans are being tackled by nations, sectors and companies. It won't be long until we can reflect on a time when industrial decarbonisation felt out of reach, and point to Australia's world-leading Net Zero Industrial Precincts and sectors with green supply chains producing and exporting green energy, green metals and critical minerals around the world.",

        "content": "The developers of the West of Orkney Windfarm have donated £50,000 to support a new apprenticeship programme in Caithness and north Sutherland. The money will go to FutureSkills, a grant scheme designed to tackle skills shortages and boost investment in new opportunities for businesses and young people in the far north. The initiative is being led by the Caithness Business Fund and will offer eligible businesses an opportunity to access grant support of up to £24,500, over a maximum period of three years, towards employment and associated training costs of an apprentice. It was established in March this year with initial funding from NRS Dounreay and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The announcement was made as members of the West of Orkney Windfarm team visited Caithness for meetings with Scrabster Harbour Trust, Caithness Chamber of Commerce, Wick John O’Groats Airport and JGC Engineering and Technical Services. The wind farm will consist of . The turbines will have a maximum blade tip height of 360m and the proposals include cable landfalls on the Caithness coast. Stuart McAuley, project director for West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “The West of Orkney Windfarm has an ambition to deliver a world-leading energy project which will create long-term social and economic benefits for businesses and communities in the north of Scotland. “This will include employment opportunities through the construction phase and for many years of operation, and we would like as many of these jobs as possible to go to local firms. It is terrific to see local businesses already embracing this exciting new world. “This donation is an investment in this future and will help upskill young workers so they can participate in Scotland’s offshore wind energy industry – which will become a major force in the years ahead.” West of Orkney Windfarm has backed a number of other initiatives in Caithness, Sutherland and Orkney. Details of FutureSkills can be found on the Trudy Morris, executive director of the Caithness Business Fund and chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, managing agent of the fund, said: “Caithness Chamber has been engaged with the West of Orkney Windfarm for a number of years now and we are delighted they are able to support this excellent apprenticeship scheme. “It’s open to businesses that can demonstrate a strong commitment to hosting a modern apprenticeship and targets SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] with the aim of facilitating new apprenticeship opportunities to stimulate business growth and overcome potential financial barriers. “I would encourage local firms to apply.”",

        "description": "From student to director, Lisa Pavane’s storied 46-year journey with the Australian Ballet School is drawing to a close.",
        "content": "Lisa Pavane arrived at the Australian Ballet School as a starry-eyed teenager. Forty-six years later, she’s leaving after nine years as its director. The school celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2024, but has only been overseen by four directors across that period. Each person who led the school clearly left their mark; during Pavane’s tenure, the old stereotype of the draconian ballet taskmaster who demands everything of their students has been replaced by an approach she describes as “holistic”. Lisa Pavane is retiring after nine years helming the Australian Ballet School. Credit: Hilary Walker “We’re so fortunate in the way that we’re looking at our young people and their health and wellbeing. That’s a real lens now,” she says. “It’s a very vigorous vocation, so having that education around how you look after your body and how you learn about it and how you fuel it, prepare it, condition it, is leaps and bounds from when I went to the school.” When Pavane was a student, there was an implicit understanding that dancers were to be seen and not heard. Now the atmosphere is one of collaboration. “We’re trying to break down that hierarchy, that power between teacher and student and really levelling it out. Inviting young people to step into the space, to be their own learners and understand their learning. We’re inviting a lot more conversation.” Greg Horsman and Lisa Pavane perform in Giselle, 1990. Credit: The Australian Ballet Dancer and choreographer Kevin Jackson says that Pavane’s interest in giving students more chances to explore their own artistic voice and contribute to classes has lifted the local ballet scene on the whole. “Lisa’s been a visionary in her response to investing in homegrown talent. She’s given the students of today the opportunity to experience the creative part of the profession, and allowed a space for choreographers to explore their art.” Pavane says that a nurturing learning environment leads to far better outcomes than a whip-cracking, disciplinarian approach. Lisa Pavane is proud of the way the school has become more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. Credit: Lynette Wills “We know through positive education and psychology that when they’re happy, they’re thriving, they’re flourishing, they’re feeling comfortable in the space, then their brain is open and they’re much more open to learning. That’s our philosophy, embedded in what we do every day now.” Pavane is also proud of the way the school has become less of a closed shop and more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. “I’ve worked to try and open up the school so that we have more accessibility and more connection with the community. “We have an incredible love and passion for teaching and dancing and nurturing the future generation of dancers. We can all learn from each other. We’re really trying to inspire that and not feel that we’re better than anyone else.” In the nine years she has been the school’s director, Pavane hasn’t been the sort who leads from afar. “Lisa is very involved,” says Jackson. “She’s always there for assessments and will come into rehearsals for the productions we do, as a mentor not only to the choreographer but also to the students.” Loading Pavane has been an influential mentor in Jackson’s own career, from his time training as a teacher at the school to his development as a choreographer. But along with the success stories come those who don’t find a career in dance is on the cards. “We talk about the holistic person and the skills that they learn, whether it be from one year, three years, five years of this amazing discipline, that they can take into all walks of life. When we hear back from young people that have left the school for whatever reason they speak so highly of the skills you learn from being in this artistic field,” says Pavane. After graduating from the school, Pavane rose to become a principal artist at the Australian Ballet before enjoying a long international career. En Pointe , the final Australian Ballet School performance under her stewardship, will be performed at Hamer Hall on May 28 and at The Round, Nunawading on August 21. Loading She’s looking forward to a little break, but she’s not putting her feet up for good. “This school gave me my life, it gave me my career, and I’ve loved every minute that I’ve spent in it ... I’m certainly not going to be putting on my slippers and sitting on the couch with my knitting needles just yet.” En Pointe is on at Hamer Hall on May 28 and The Round on August 21.

        "description": "Leeds United’s latest play-off final heartache will hurt more than ever before. That’s six play-off encounters they have been involved in spanning close to three...The post Neil Warnock states what he noticed about Daniel Farke when Dan James hit the crossbar for Leeds appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "That’s six play-off encounters they have been involved in spanning close to three decades and they have all ended in defeat. Some would say that’s typical because they have a serious mental blockage when it comes to these games, as they proved during their on Sunday. When hit the crossbar, it sent a shudder down the spine of both sets of supporters because the game was coming to an end and it was a moment that could have changed everything. The Yorkshire outfit, after falling behind to an early Adam Armstrong goal, just couldn’t play their natural game and Russell Martin was tactically outdoing , again! Southampton were the only team during the regular season to do the double over Leeds – and that showed at the home of football. Neil Warnock made it clear that ‘the best team won tactically’ even if he thinks highly about the man in the Elland Road dugout. , Warnock shared that he instantly looked down at the Leeds manager and noticed that ‘he knew’ that was it and the game was gone, as he told (26/05/24 at 5:55 pm). Very little time was left and if the Whites had any luck, then that effort would have hit the back of the net, but in the end, it’s another season in the Championship for Leeds. Leeds United lose play-off final to Southampton “When James hit the crossbar, I looked down at Daniel (Farke) and I think he knew,” said Warnock. “When that hit the crossbar, I think he knew that it wasn’t going to be. He shouldn’t batter himself because he has done a brilliant job. He is a lovely man and I think he is a good manager. “But I thought the best team won tactically. Look at that here, that’s a volley, no chance for the goalkeeper and any other way, it goes in. That’s in, it’s then a different game and they are on top. That’s football and you need a bit of luck, a referee decision or the smallest of things.” Big pressure on Daniel Farke You can’t see the manager leaving, whether that’s moving on himself or getting booted out. But this defeat does put huge pressure on him heading into the forthcoming campaign because nothing but promotion is expected. Two of the relegated sides – Leicester City and Southampton – did their jobs, so Leeds can’t have any excuses, in that regard. The issue for the club is that if you offered them a play-off finish next season, then fans wouldn’t probably accept it because they know what’s coming. But now it’s about dealing with the present, , they better hope that he is the only one.",

        "content": "Do you ever feel like the world is against you? or signup to continue reading Like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong? Like Murphy (and his law) has moved in and is squatting in your basement? Sometimes, it can feel like the world is against you when one thing after another comes at you like rolling punches on a speed bag ... and you're the speed bag. That's certainly how I've been feeling lately. Battered, bruised, barely able to catch my breath, and still having to show up for everything, plastering a smile on my face and making the best of it. Honestly, it's exhausting. Why do we do this? Why do force ourselves to pretend everything is OK, that we're coping just fine, that we don't need help? Is it shame? Embarrassment? The belief that acknowledging the challenges we are facing makes them real? Maybe it's a little of all of those things. Well, - once again sharing my own rawness and failures for the world to see - because I think it's really important that we remind ourselves that everyone needs help sometimes. And that's OK. Last week, my husband was rushed to hospital and spent the week in intensive care. We nearly lost him and it was stressful beyond measure. In between trying to get to and from the hospital, managing my and our son's respiratory infections, working, a uni assignment that was due, we had a house inspection we weren't able to reschedule. Then, this morning, I receive a phone call from my husband to tell me that we've received a \"no cause\" termination notice, so on top of everything else, we now have to try and find another place to live in a rental market that thinks it's OK to of all places. I mean seriously. Get a grip. At this point, what started out as a snowball rolling down the hill, has gathered so much stress and anxiety, panic and fear along the way as it rolls, it's become something of an avalanche. I'm finding myself desperately running in front of it as it careens down the hillside, trying not to be smothered by the immeasurable amount of stress-snow nipping at my heels as I find myself running more and more out of control, picking up pace I can't handle. Like I said, it's exhausting. I know I'm not the only person in this situation. in December 2022 and discovered that 64 per cent of people rated their stress level as 5/10 or higher, with 40 per cent of all Australians worryingly rating their stress level as 7/10 or higher. I really don't think we can lay claim to being the laid-back she'll-be-right-mate nation of the world anymore, and we need to seriously look at how this is impacting people across Australia. Stress is a natural part of our lives as it's a normal human reaction that everyone experiences from time to time. According to Dr Timothy Legg, It is a biological response to a perceived threat manifested through the physical and mental experience of the hormone release that produces the \"fight-or-flight\" response. However, stress becomes a problem when you start to feel overwhelmed by it or it lasts for a long time. So how can we manage it? How can I prevent the snowball turning into an avalanche and squishing me flat on the downhill spiral that appears to be becoming my life? Well, that's a very good question. Looking at the cause of our stress is an important factor in being able to manage our stress levels as this holds the key to finding ways to prevent stress occurring in the first place. However, stress prevention isn't always possible. The American Institute of Stress said (in not so many words) that essentially it comes down to the Serenity Prayer: it's about recognising there's no point stressing about things you can't do anything about, working out what you can do about the things you can change, and taking the time to work out what goes on what list. Now, I just need to find the magic solution to fear and panic and I'll be golden. I'm thinking something with four bedrooms and two bathrooms might have something to do with it.

        "description": "Out-of-date thinking on heavy industries needs to change.",
        "content": "The regions are key to Australia's enormous emissions reduction potential. They also stand to gain from its equally enormous clean energy and industry opportunities. or signup to continue reading Australia and its regions have incredible advantages: abundant renewable resources, a strong industrial history, a skilled workforce and established trading partners, ready and waiting for our green products. Despite these advantages, the country's heavy industries have been defined by many as \"hard to abate\" - in other words, it is considered difficult to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. But that thinking is out of date: it is rather that they are \"late to abate\". Climateworks co-convened the four-year Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative which found it is possible to eliminate over 90 per cent of emissions in Australia's major heavy industry supply chains of iron and steel, aluminium, liquified natural gas, chemicals and mining of other metals such as copper and lithium. The other good news is Australia's heavy industries and associated emissions are clustered in a handful of places across the country. Five industrial regions - Illawarra, Hunter, Kwinana, Gladstone and the Pilbara - account for one-eighth of Australia's total emissions. That's equivalent to the emissions of every car and light commercial vehicle across the country. That is why taking a place-based \"Net Zero Industrial Precinct\" approach makes so much sense for Australia, alongside other national and state policies. The idea is relatively simple - focus on where the emissions and industries are and supercharge them with plenty of renewable energy, green hydrogen and shared infrastructure and take advantage of their existing skilled workforce. A place-based approach also allows for the costs, risks and benefits to be shared, and actions to be coordinated. Net Zero Industrial Precincts are a major revitalisation opportunity for our industrial heartlands to ensure they - and the communities they support - remain competitive in a decarbonised world. It wasn't that long ago that solar panels were considered a novel, emerging technology. I can remember in 2010 when Climateworks Centre showcased different low carbon solutions for Australia and solar ranked behind energy efficiency, transport and carbon farming. Today, close to 3 million Australian homes have rooftop solar, supplying over 10 per cent of the country's power. We have the highest amount of solar PV per person in the world and a renewable energy target of 82 per cent by 2030 for the national electricity grid. Earlier this month the federal budget showcased Future Made in Australia, a framework focused on developing wind and solar in addition to clean industries like green hydrogen and critical minerals. Australia is starting to focus on decarbonising not just the grid we have today but the economy we want tomorrow - one with prosperous clean industries that generations of Australians can work in and benefit from. Australia's national net zero legislation is now two years old, and older for all the state and territory governments and many companies and financial institutions. New national laws will require large companies' financial reports to include their emissions; those of their suppliers and customers; their forward targets to reduce emissions and their transition plan to get them there. Having agreed to net zero targets, now every country, sector and company needs a plan to achieve it. That's where the Australian government's sector decarbonisation plans come into play. The government is developing national net zero sector plans for the major parts of our economy that matter for emissions reduction: Electricity and energy, Industry, Resources, Transport, Built environment and Agriculture and land. There are a few key things that need to be taken into account when developing and implementing these plans. To solve for what the science demands, they should align ambition with the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming limit in the Paris Agreement. There are also many interdependencies between sectors. Most obvious is the energy and electricity sector, which must move quickly to build the renewable energy needed to power the decarbonisation of other sectors, including the built environment, industry and transport. Management textbooks say when you set your strategy you make a plan and provide targets and resources to those responsible for implementing it. We are now in the era where net zero strategy, targets and plans are being tackled by nations, sectors and companies. It won't be long until we can reflect on a time when industrial decarbonisation felt out of reach, and point to Australia's world-leading Net Zero Industrial Precincts and sectors with green supply chains producing and exporting green energy, green metals and critical minerals around the world.

        "description": "Yes, her dad’s Ethan Hawke and her mum’s Uma Thurman. But Maya Hawke is creating thoughtful work on her own terms – including her new album, Chaos Angel.",
        "content": "On a highway somewhere between Atlanta and South Carolina, Maya Hawke is enjoying a brief respite from armageddon. She’s been given a few days off from shooting the final season of , the Netflix hit where she plays the loveable, neurotic video shop clerk Robin Buckley, and the 25-year-old has decided to break up the grind of the lengthy shoot – “We started in January, and we’ll probably be done in January. It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” she deadpans – with an impromptu road trip. By the time she phones through for our scheduled interview, she’s already singing the classics. “We’ve been listening to a podcast on the history of the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte,” she says with a dry laugh, when I ask her for the road trip’s playlist. It’s not and it’s not the Beatles’ , the famous mixtape her dad Ethan Hawke once curated for her and later repurposed for his role in Richard Linklater’s , but it feels delightfully on brand for the most cerebral of Gen-Z’s rising screen stars. “I remember it all pretty well from grade school,” Hawke adds. “I can sing along if I try really hard, shouting out Bastille Day, really vibing with it.” Beyond the screen, Hawke – the daughter of Ethan and Uma Thurman, who, besides , earned acclaim for her recent performances in Wes Anderson’s and Bradley Cooper’s – is gearing up for the release of , her third album of thoughtful indie-pop following (2020) and (2022), albums which, while sonically sparse, showcased her sensitive, expressive songwriting. If was her musical unveiling, particularly via its breakout single , inspired by modern artist Balthus’ , , elevates her work further, both with its sonic ambition and an increasing boldness in her songwriting. Take the lead single , for example, where Hawke sings about naive kids envying her “television salary” and her own conflicted feelings about “being born with my foot in the door”, as though she’s grappling with the privilege of how she grew up while also wondering if she lost something along the way. “I don’t see as any more revealing than any of my other songs, but it’s possible it’s revealing aspects of my thinking that are more salacious to people in, like, a kind of headliney way,” Hawke concedes, perhaps a weary glare to the nepo narrative that’s become every Hollywood scion’s burden. The song was inspired by Hawke’s misgivings about having skipped college at 18 in order to live on her own and pursue acting opportunities instead. The decision left her feeling so alienated among her own generation that years later, she tagged onto her brother Levon’s experience at Brown University, where she dropped in on random lectures on the history of Hinduism, Eastern religion, and the history of China for three months. “Yes, there was a poetic irony to it,” Hawke says, when I suggest most uni kids are trying to get out of class, not get into ones they aren’t even enrolled in. “But it was so fun and so enlightening. I got to sneak into classes and listen to professors talk, and I’m grateful to my brother for allowing me to do that and to talk about it publicly, because both things are slightly embarrassing for him.” By the time summer break came around, Hawke had found perspective. “I was like, you know what? I like my life. I don’t have any regrets. But I wrote a song about it, so not a total waste of time.” It’s a strange thing to admit to an interview subject that you might have inadvertently stalked them years ago, when they were merely a child clutching their famous father’s hand during a leisurely stroll around their home neighbourhood, but here we are. It was over a decade ago, I tell Hawke, and my girlfriend and I were tourists in New York, on our way to explore Chelsea’s recently opened High Line, when we stumbled across Ethan Hawke in the streets with kids in tow. Obviously, we did what any enthusiast would do and surreptitiously walked in the same direction for a string of blocks to see what exciting movie star business he was getting up to. About 10 minutes later, we gave up out of both shame and boredom. What was surprising, however, was the space and respect his fellow New Yorkers afforded Hawke. He might have attracted the odd head turn, but no one bothered him – just a dude taking a walk with his family. You sense that even with two Hollywood superstars for parents, Maya’s childhood was decidedly sheltered from typical movie star eccentricities. “One thing that’s wonderful about my parents is that they never had an overblown sense of their own importance,” says Hawke. “They felt like artists, in that their relationship to their work was not as celebrities or famous people, but as people whose job it was to make art. And so they acted like anyone would with that; they just saw it as their job. That’s what I was brought up around, an understanding that a life in the arts is a job and it’s a craft. It’s a beautiful privilege to have that job, but it’s also a job like everyone else’s and it’s not more or less important than anyone else’s.” Growing up in such an environment, a life in the arts was always likely. “My whole life was drowned in the arts,” says Hawke. “I did every school play, I was always writing songs, I was always doing watercolours, I was always writing poems. Being in New York City, we’d go to the Met, the theatre, see plays on Broadway, things off-Broadway. It just felt like a necessary part of life – you eat, you sleep, you try to move your body, you try to go to school, and you try to consume a little art and make a little art, too.” In an interview with , Ethan once mentioned he knew the exact moment Maya would follow in her parents’ footsteps, after he brought her along to a technical read through of a Shakespeare play he was in, and was shocked to find she wasn’t bored at all. But when does Maya pinpoint her professional awakening? “It was doing Euripides’ in my junior year, directed by Laura Barnett, at my high school Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn,” she says. “I dove into it completely. I didn’t study for my SAT, I didn’t focus on anything else, I just let myself be an actor and it was the best feeling I’d ever had. It felt like I was home, I loved the community, I loved the friendships I made. That experience, and how positive it was, became kind of like the golden compass, alethiometer, of my life. I was like, OK, I’m gonna chase that feeling.” Music was a similarly organic pursuit, fuelled by childhood guitar, piano and singing lessons, and the realisation that songwriting was a prime form of communication that persuaded the people around her to listen more. “I’m still this kind of person who practises for my conversations. Like, if we were roommates and we were gonna have a big talk about the fact that you don’t do the dishes enough, I would practise that conversation in my head a lot, and I would find that putting melodies to my rehearsed conversations and making them rhyme was a better way to remember them.” Negative preconceptions about actors who make music are prevalent, and Hawke hasn’t been immune. She credits her producer and co-writer Christian Lee Hutson (to whom she’s also ) for being “a huge influence in shirking some of the imposter syndrome, though I still have a lot”. “I still have imposter syndrome but it’s gotten a lot better,” says Hawke. “On my first record I really felt like I had to keep the songs completely bare, like only use acoustic instruments and not double my vocal or have any harmonies because I didn’t want anyone to think that I had, you know, ‘bought a record’ – like, hired a producer to make me sound good. If they didn’t like me, I wanted to make sure they knew that they didn’t like and not that they didn’t like the choices somebody else had made. “But I think each record has gotten less constrained by my fear and more playful and more present, and I think it’s just from education. The more you learn, the less afraid you are. Knowledge is power.” Her confidence is present on a warm album that’s more sonically layered than Hawke’s others, with its use of samples, horns, electronics and distortion, inspired by artists she was listening to at the time including Liz Phair, Mazzy Star, Buffy Sainte-Marie, James Blake, and our own Julia Jacklin. “About my first few records, people kept writing that they were sparse,” she says. “And I definitely had a goal to have no one say that this was sparse.” The song , which she’s said “emerged from a major anxiety episode following a soul-shattering break-up”, highlights Hawke’s way with a good line (“I’m your guitar, mute me gently with the palm of your hand”). You can imagine the Notes app on her phone is loaded. “It’s very chaotic,” Hawke admits. “I like to play this game called ‘Notes Roulette’, where you and another person pick a date and you scroll through your phone to find the note you made on that day and you have to read it out loud. Fun game, I highly recommend it,” she adds. “Nothing’s more revealing than a grocery list.” In a recent interview, Hawke said that , the album’s titular track, came out of the mindset she was in while making , a film she did with her father Ethan where she played author Flannery O’Connor. It seems like being in such a space of imagination and creative empathy offers a fertile overlap for songwriting. “I think they work very well together, and I highly recommend that all actors write music,” she says, noting that acting’s a form of “reaching out” to better understand the world, while songwriting is an act of “digging deep” to figure out what you feel and think. Each practice lies in a desire to “express, pursue truth and tell stories”, says Hawke, but she admits, as her music career flourishes, that it’s becoming difficult to juggle both. Is there some sort of plan to how she navigates her career or is she just feeling her way through? “I still audition a bunch and I’ve taken most every good job that’s come my way. I think that a lot of people see the roles that actors choose as, like, intensely reflective on them, and that’s partially true. But also, most actors I know, even really successful ones, are kind of going with the flow and, like, whatever good writing comes their way they want to do, basically,” says Hawke. “I mean, you’d be hard-pressed to find a kind of person that’s more gung ho, ‘put me in, coach!’ than an actor – they’re a pretty excitable group of volunteers.” Having veterans in her corner (yes, Mum and Dad), only helps to a degree. “I think people really overestimate the amount of strategy that goes into an actor’s career, you know?” Hawke jokes. “I mean, it’s a lot of auditioning, taking the jobs that come your way, and hoping that more do. “The advice I get from my parents is always more minutiae-based – ‘I don’t want to do this job but it’s a good job, would I be stupid not to do it?’ or ‘What should I do if I’m having an uncomfortable experience with my scene partner?’ In terms of what projects to do and how to spend your career, that’s mostly 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent instinct.” Her next role will see her playing Anxiety in Pixar’s , a casting stroke that feels inspired considering her public persona – that rare star who appears introverted, slightly uncomfortable with the spotlight. “Wow, is that my persona?” Hawke says. “I don’t feel like that’s who I am as a person. I mean, of course I have anxiety, but I don’t think I have any more anxiety than the average person. In fact, I might be lucky enough to have a little bit less.” OK, but has she ever seen herself on a talk show? There’s a kind of charming, nervous energy there that is a large part of what makes her feel relatable to audiences, despite her atypical upbringing. Is it painful for her to get up on stage, or to see herself on screen? “I mean, I’m not gonna be like, ‘No, I’m totally comfortable on stage!’ I’m totally nervous and excited, and I feel like I want to express myself and I want to be understood, and I’m afraid that I won’t be or that I won’t be good enough. But it doesn’t feel painful, it’s joyful,” says Hawke. “There’s a great David Bowie quote about that: ‘You want to be just deep enough in the water so that your toes don’t touch the bottom’. That’s how I feel. I’m happiest when I’m just deep enough out there into the realm of what scares me that my toes don’t touch the bottom, and I can explore that and just, you know, kick my feet a little.”",

        "content": "The new owners of a former Allentown church were at the closing while a historic marker on the property was removed, and they want it back. The marker was erected in 1932 on the grounds of the ivy-covered Church of the Ascension, located at 16 Linwood Ave., at North Street, by the Buffalo chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, also known as DAR. On May 10, Peter Johnson, DAR's handyman, removed the patinaed marker and the wooden post it was attached to. That happened as the 1872 Gothic Revival-style church's new owner, John Daly, was in a downtown office closing on the Medina sandstone property purchased with his sister Melissa Littlefield for $450,000. A June 21, 2016 photo shows a historic marker on Church of the Ascension property in Allentown that was there for 92 years until its removal May 10 by the Buffalo branch of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The new owner, who closed on the property the next day, wants it returned. Daly learned this because Johnson posted photographs of the removal on the Buffalo Rehab and Reuse Facebook page, writing, \"I've been tasked to remove it by 3 p.m. today,\" a half-hour after the scheduled start of the closing. The posts drew Daly's ire, leading him to file a police report charging DAR with whisking away something that wasn't theirs to take. \"I'm very disturbed that someone on social media bragged about how they stole it, and that they had a certain window of time to steal it,\" said Daly, a managing partner at the engineering and architectural firm Trautman Associates. \"It is bothersome that that person has not been apprehended and the property recovered. It was a downright, sneaky theft.\" Betsy Boundy, who initiated the marker's removal as a board member of the Katherine Pratt Horton Buffalo chapter of DAR, said it belongs to the organization and that the Episcopalian Diocese, which was selling the church, gave permission to take it. The nonprofit, which owns the historic Henry Birge House, also known as the DAR House, a Georgian Revival row house at 477 Delaware Ave., wants to relocate the marker to tiny Tony Sisti Park across from the church. \"Our Daughters of the American Revolution commissioned the marker. That's our marker and we are taking repossession of it,\" Boundy said of the group that claims descendants from supporters of the American Revolution in the late 18th century. But Jennifer Hurley, an attorney representing Daly's lender, said a search of the property's title report found no deed restriction or sale exclusion on file with the property showing DAR owned the marker, giving the group no legal right to it. \"There was nothing in the contract excluding the monument from the sale, and nothing in the title report indicating that there was an exception wherein the Daughters of the American Revolution could retrieve the marker if the church sold to another buyer,\" Hurley said. The sign in the middle of the controversy reads \"GUIDE BOARD ROAD\" on the first line, followed by, \"Directing Pioneers Coming from The East to Black Rock Ferry. Erected by Buffalo Chapter National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, 1932.\" \"If you look at the marker, it says 'erected by DAR' and not 'property of DAR,'\" Daly said. \"It never belonged to them. There is not a shred of evidence that it is DAR property.\" Gwen Howard, chair of the Buffalo Preservation Board, said neither DAR nor anyone else can remove a historic marker without going through proper channels. \"The marker is part of a historic site, and the site cannot be modified without the approval of the Preservation Board,\" Howard said. Daly expects to seek state and federal historic tax credits when the church is redeveloped, and the marker helps make the case for the property's historic value. While a mixed-use development in the former church is a possibility, \"we are in the planning stages, with nothing ruled in or out. We are intending on doing a historic preservation, and the history of the corner is very important to us.\" The former Church of the Ascension, at 16 Linwood Ave., was recently purchased by John Daly and Melissa Littlefield. A historic marker on the property was removed, and they want it returned. If Daly values the historic importance of the sign and wants to keep it on his property, why did DAR feel a need to remove it? Boundy said the DAR learned about the building's sale by accident, when they called the diocese about cleaning the marker. Boundy sought the marker's removal out of concern that the church, which closed in 2015, would be converted into residential housing and the grass where the marker was would become a parking lot. \"There is no parking on North,\" she said. \"If you are building housing units on that complex, then where are people going to park?\" Boundy never spoke with Daly about his intentions before removing the marker. \"The diocese would not tell us who the buyer was,\" she said. Louise Kreiner, DAR's house chair who asked Johnson to remove the marker at Boundy's behest, heard the marker wasn't wanted. \"I think it was going to be tossed by the new owners,\" she said. Johnson said on the Facebook thread that \"the lawn that that marker was on is going to become a parking lot and the church is going to turn into apartments.\" A responder thanked Johnson for \"preserving the marker that the new owner doesn't care about.\" Johnson didn't return phone messages left by The News. In a separate matter, he has been accused by Hurley of fraudulent billing practices in a lawsuit in State Supreme Court. Johnson's counterclaim on defamation was dismissed, with a second claim regarding a bonus still pending, according to court documents. Boundy contacted Fillmore Council Member Mitch Nowakowski, whose district includes Allentown, to see if she could get his help to move the marker to the nearby park. Nowakowski told The News that Boundy told him \"the new developers basically told them to get rid of it.\" All of this has Daly furious. \"They never reached out to me, and I'm very reachable,\" he said. \"It's also very disturbing when you hear accusations about what we plan to do. There won't be parking where that sign is. There is no way you can even put parking there.\" Although Daly never gave the diocese permission for DAR to remove the marker, it turns out his attorney did – but under false pretenses, she said. \"I have not heard anything about the sign,\" Kristina Ramos, Daly's attorney, emailed Donna Hartnett, the diocese's attorney, on May 9, after a second inquiry, on the day before the closing. \"You can have owner remove it.\" Ramos said Hartnett told her the sign was owned by DAR and she had no reason to question it. That was before, she said, she learned the sign was part of the property purchased by Daly. \"The church's attorney misrepresented who owned the sign, most likely as a result of assertions of third parties,\" Ramos said. \"But in the end, the sign belongs to Mr. Daly.\" Ramos said she plans to reach out to Hartnett. \"In the end, we would like the sign placed back because it's going to be maintained as part of the historic value of the building,\" she said. John Ramos, Kristina's husband and partner in the firm Ramos & Ramos, thinks the situation can be resolved in a way that puts DAR's fears to rest. \"Hopefully, this turns out to be a comedy of misunderstandings, and gets worked out amicably in the end,\" he said. Diocese spokeswoman Rebecca Wilson said the diocese went by what DAR presented to the attorney. \"I think everyone with the diocese was acting with the best of intentions,\" Wilson said. Nowakowski said he's ready and willing to help facilitate a resolution, but the whole episode has left a sour taste with Daly, who is inclined to let law enforcement handle it. \"I have heard so many lies from such a simple story, and I believe (my attorney) was deceived,\" Daly said. \"This could have been handled in a very cordial, friendly manner. It's very sad.\" Mark Sommer covers culture, preservation, the waterfront, transportation, nonprofits and more. He's a former arts editor at The News. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

        "content": "Do you ever feel like the world is against you? Login or signup to continue reading Like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong? Like Murphy (and his law) has moved in and is squatting in your basement? Sometimes, it can feel like the world is against you when one thing after another comes at you like rolling punches on a speed bag ... and you're the speed bag. That's certainly how I've been feeling lately. Battered, bruised, barely able to catch my breath, and still having to show up for everything, plastering a smile on my face and making the best of it. Honestly, it's exhausting. Why do we do this? Why do force ourselves to pretend everything is OK, that we're coping just fine, that we don't need help? Is it shame? Embarrassment? The belief that acknowledging the challenges we are facing makes them real? Maybe it's a little of all of those things. Well, I'm writing this column - once again sharing my own rawness and failures for the world to see - because I think it's really important that we remind ourselves that everyone needs help sometimes. And that's OK. Last week, my husband was rushed to hospital and spent the week in intensive care. We nearly lost him and it was stressful beyond measure. In between trying to get to and from the hospital, managing my and our son's respiratory infections, working, a uni assignment that was due, we had a house inspection we weren't able to reschedule. Then, this morning, I receive a phone call from my husband to tell me that we've received a \"no cause\" termination notice, so on top of everything else, we now have to try and find another place to live in a rental market that thinks it's OK to charge $630/week for a townhouse without ducted air conditioning in Wodonga of all places. I mean seriously. Get a grip. At this point, what started out as a snowball rolling down the hill, has gathered so much stress and anxiety, panic and fear along the way as it rolls, it's become something of an avalanche. I'm finding myself desperately running in front of it as it careens down the hillside, trying not to be smothered by the immeasurable amount of stress-snow nipping at my heels as I find myself running more and more out of control, picking up pace I can't handle. Like I said, it's exhausting. I know I'm not the only person in this situation. Australian Community Survey (ACS) by NCLS Research asked Australians about their stress levels in December 2022 and discovered that 64 per cent of people rated their stress level as 5/10 or higher, with 40 per cent of all Australians worryingly rating their stress level as 7/10 or higher. I really don't think we can lay claim to being the laid-back she'll-be-right-mate nation of the world anymore, and we need to seriously look at how this is impacting people across Australia. Stress is a natural part of our lives as it's a normal human reaction that everyone experiences from time to time. According to Dr Timothy Legg, It is a biological response to a perceived threat manifested through the physical and mental experience of the hormone release that produces the \"fight-or-flight\" response. However, stress becomes a problem when you start to feel overwhelmed by it or it lasts for a long time. So how can we manage it? How can I prevent the snowball turning into an avalanche and squishing me flat on the downhill spiral that appears to be becoming my life? Well, that's a very good question. READ MORE: Looking at the cause of our stress is an important factor in being able to manage our stress levels as this holds the key to finding ways to prevent stress occurring in the first place. However, stress prevention isn't always possible. The American Institute of Stress said (in not so many words) that essentially it comes down to the Serenity Prayer: it's about recognising there's no point stressing about things you can't do anything about, working out what you can do about the things you can change, and taking the time to work out what goes on what list. Now, I just need to find the magic solution to fear and panic and I'll be golden. I'm thinking something with four bedrooms and two bathrooms might have something to do with it.

And, when Body Sculpture arrived at its new home at the National Gallery of Australia, which had acquired it for a cool $6.6 million, unpacking the work wasn't quite the main event it usually is when new works arrive. While most major art galleries tend to be quiet places, there's often a buzz behind the scenes that most people will never see. From carpenters to robotic and IT specialists, there are people doing jobs you don't automatically associate with what you're seeing in the official gallery spaces. National Gallery of Australia operations and maintenance technician Neve Foxcroft, and chief information officer Jade Carson with Jordan Wolfson's Body Sculpture. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong And a growing number of them are women, especially when it comes to robotics and animatronics. For Body Sculpture , an entirely separate team was required to bring it to life once it arrived. The team was led by Sally Brand, senior project manager for complex artistic commissions - a realm of art that's developing at a rapid pace as the parameters around artistic definitions shift and morph. Body Sculpture features two robots - a factory-style mechanical arm, and a metal box with humanoid arms and hands, held captive by a chain. It's a disconcerting work that comes with a content warning and appears to lose control - a kind of statement on the darkness within the human condition. Paradoxically, putting it together involved plenty of planning, control and human intervention - of the tech-savvy variety. American artist Jordan Wolfson with his robotic work Body Sculpture, unveiled at the National Gallery of Australia in December 2023. Picture by Karleen Minney Brand, who has a background in both science and art history, says the art world is appealing to more than just artists and curators. \"Artists and scientists are particularly curious people in the world,\" she said. \"You have to be curious to work in the arts, and you have to be curious to work in STEM. \"But I do love that idea of STEAM, which is the STEM with art ... because you just have to be creative. It's all complex problem-solving.\" She had previously worked with Patricia Piccinini after the gallery acquired her renowned Skywhale hot air balloon, and commissioned a companion piece, Skywhalepapa . Like Wolfson, Piccinini requires large, multi-skilled teams to realise her vision. \"We took a lot of the learnings of when it's an artwork as well a lot of other things into this work on the robot, because it is a work of art,\" Brand said. \"People are running to meet with the technology and regulation that sits around robotics, but also wanting to encourage a lot of creativity in that place as well. It's really fascinating.\" The gallery's chief information officer Jade Carson, who works with the gallery's behind-the-scenes technology infrastructure, said the field for women who want to work in tech was ever-widening. \"People often underestimate the diversity of roles available in technology,\" she said. \"Wolfson's work and the women at the NGA who have helped bring it to life, shows how technology roles have evolved. \"We want people to see that you can align your passion and creativity with your work and that digital works of art are increasing.\" She's leading a Women in ICT panel discussion at the gallery on May 30 celebrating the intersection of art and technology, centring around Wolfson's Body Sculpture , and the various skills that are required to bring a work like this to life. \"If you're a woman in tech, or a girl coming through school, and you want to get into tech, or you want to do art, you can do both,\" she says.

        "description": "Annette King, Yukon's child and youth advocate, is calling for better legal representation for young people involved in court matters. She's also wants her office to be able to review any child deaths that happen in the territory.",
        "content": "Annette King admits that even after nine years as Yukon's child and youth advocate, she still finds many people don't quite understand what she does. \"I think everywhere we go and every time we meet with a different group, or even an individual client or family that comes to our office, we have to explain our role,\" she said. \"And I do think over the last several years, people are getting a broader understanding of what we do, as there's more experiences with our office, more reports that we've released publicly.\" The advocate office was created by territorial legislation passed in 2009. Written into the Child and Youth Advocate Act was a requirement for the all-party Members' Services Board to establish a process to review the act, within five years. Fifteen years later, that review is underway. King spoke to CBC's Yukon Morning host Elyn Jones about the review, and some of the recommendations she's making to update the legislation. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Who have you heard from so far, in this review? We've been talking about this review in my whole term, which is now nine years. So we provide a little bit of input on what we've heard to date, each year in our annual report. And so at the beginning, what we've really focused on was our experiences to date, so what we were hearing from the people accessing our services and the service providers that we'd be working with. And we'd be like, \"OK, so if the act was amended, we'd want to really look at this or look at this.\" And then we worked really closely with youth advisors. So we contracted youth advisory groups. We've had a few different iterations of youth leading the way to review our legislation. They created a youth-friendly version of the legislation so that it made a little bit more sense. We connected really closely with the territorial youth collective as the territorial youth strategy was being developed. Then also we've stayed connected to service providers and First Nation governments throughout the years. Over the last year, I've been really targeting those conversations because I want to make sure that the First Nations governance, as it is intended to be, you know, in parallel to the Yukon government, that that is definitely represented in our legislation. And those conversations have been really deep and meaningful. One of the things that you're asking for is a mechanism to review deaths of children. Why is that so important? When this act came into place in 2009, it was a small little act. And I think that's partly why the review in five years was built into it, it was like, \"let's just start here, let's really get things so that young people have a voice in government services, and then we'll look at building it from there.\" Every other child advocate in the country — and there are 12 — have a child death review mandate. And so it's one of those questions that we've been asking over all of the years to anybody that we talked to about the legislation: how do you see that working? And we've had some great conversations with the coroner and with the death review investigators across the country. We've really looked at what could be a model for the Yukon. And so that's kind of what we're trying to develop. You're also calling for legal representation for children and youth, and better information-sharing. Tell us more about that. So when a child needs legal representation, it's usually three different ways. A youth over 12 that's been charged with a crime would need a lawyer for the criminal investigation. That is already in place really well, through legal aid — every young person who's been accused of a crime has access to legal representation there. In family law, there's two areas that we want to make sure young people of all ages have legal representation to make sure their views and rights are upheld in court. And that is, if there's a court matter regarding the Child and Family Services Act — so their placement, or if their custody is being changed as a result of being in that system — we want to make sure young people are represented in that system. Our office can represent young people in the decision-making and in the case planning. But when it goes to court, we don't have a role. And we want to make sure that that happens. And the other one is, we get so many calls regarding child custody matters and high-conflict custody matters where a parent will say, \"my child needs a view in this process. How do I make sure that happens?\" Our office isn't... we don't have child lawyers that go to court. We actually have a clause in our legislation now that says we can't interfere and impede with the court process. So we're trying to create that access for young people to have legal representation in those big matters where the adults have the, you know, the applicant, the respondent, the court decisions — but the child's voice matters in these things that impact their lives. When will you be presenting your recommendations? That's really up to the Legislative Assembly. I report to an all-party committee, so all three parties are represented on that. They've asked me to provide a submission to them of what we're recommending. I provide recommendations to them every year, but this one will be more fulsome. And we're hoping that we do some more targeted interviews over the summer and get that to them as soon as possible. Yukon ombudsman says territory's Safer Schools Action Plan doesn't go far enough 'Time for some action': Review to look at systemic racism in Yukon education I think we're at a point now where we've had so many conversations — and since I'm talking publicly, I want to thank everybody who's contributed. We've had even a sort of outline of what we're looking at on our website for the last several months. We just want to make sure we're getting it right, or that we're not missing other things. So we're continuing these conversations. Over the last year, I've been doing most of them myself. Like, I just wanna hear it myself 'cause I've been so in this act — like I'm in it, right? And I know what's going on. I've heard all the different stories and I'm putting them all together. And it's been a fascinating process. And I really hope that we'll be able to just advocate even more effectively for children in the Yukon. Can people still have their say? Absolutely. Yeah, this is not even close to done. On our website, we've got it right on the home page . And also on our website there's an e-mail address that people can just click. We have Facebook, Instagram. Or they can just call our office and set up a time to chat. I'm not huge into the surveys because like you said, what is this act? And unless you're in it, you don't really understand what the questions are. So what we've done is we've identified six areas of conversation, so six themes, and we've put like, one-pages on what our experiences are in that, and there's some key questions. So if somebody's really into writing a survey-type of answer to that, we are thrilled to have that. We've already had a few. I find those are good guides to creating the conversation. So, look at the themes and then call me and let's sit down and talk about it, if you have lots to say about it.",

        "description": "Budget for unforeseen events such as flooding has been increased to boost response.",
        "content": "Nairobi County government has shelved a few programs to enhance the implementation of key programs in the latest supplementary budget. The county executive reduced or completely scrapped funding for some projects in the 2023/2024 financial year Supplementary Budget to enable implementation of priority projects. Some of the projects the county government has prioritised include the school feeding program, bursary and scholarships, construction of stadiums and construction of markets among others. The Governor Johnson Sakaja-led adminstration has also rationalised the budget in line with its own source revenue collection trends ensuring that only projects that can be funded are retained in conformity with fiscal responsibility principles. Sakaja has said his administration is well prepared to tackle unforeseen events such as flooding by increasing its emergency response budget. \"In the remaining period of the FY, the County will accelerate the enforcement efforts to ensure all outstanding charges are paid and more revenues flow in to fund the above projects,\" Sakaja said. \"The County Treasury has made steady progress in the revenue mobilization efforts in the current financial year and the revenue mobilization strategies are showing positive results, the County is poised to record the highest own source revenues collected since the onset of devolution.\" By May 23, 2024, the County revenue performance was at Sh11.2 billion, one of the best performances since the inception of devolution. Among the vote heads affected by the county executive's move to scrap the budget is the county public service board whose original development budget was Sh 10,000,000. The amount was reduced to zero. Nairobi Revenue Authority's development budget of Sh100 million has also been scrapped completely. \"These allocations have been carried forward to the next financial year with the purchase of revenue mobilization vehicles under the Authority allocated Sh100 million,\" Sakaja said. The county executive reduced the Public Service Management budget to Sh10 million from the Sh30, million allocated. As a result, the Sakaja adminstration has provided an additional Sh30 million to the department in the budget for the coming financial year. The budget for the county assembly has been cut by Sh915 million to Sh300,000. The initial budget was Sh1.215 billion. The county government now says it has cut the budget for the County Assembly as a result of an agreement with the Sakaja administration to provide land for the construction of the administration block. The cost of acquisition of land and other attendant costs were hence knocked off the budget. County executive however increased the budget for Environment, Water, Energy & Natural Resources by Sh311,420,000 to Sh 732,460,000. The increase is to tackle the flooding by investing in more garbage collection, clearing of drainages, provision of more water tanks as well as improvement of the dumpsite. Ward development funds (WDP) were reduced to Sh 1.3 billion from Sh1.955 billion. This represents a drop of Sh655 million. With the total completion certificates raised for WDP at the time of considering the supplementary estimates standing at Sh600 million, the county deemed the Sh1.3 billion for the Ward Development Programme sufficient to take care of the completed works by the end of the financial year. This is by also considering that an additional Sh600 million is expected by the end of the financial year. With a focus now on key projects, the Sakaja administration now aims to ensure the key projects are implemented for the benefit of City residents.",

        "content": "Hackers are taking advantage of the Windows launch of Arc browser to trick victims into downloading malware . Arc is a relatively new internet browser , first launched for macOS in the summer of 2023 - and initial feedback from both media and the users was positive enough to prompt the release of a Windows version too. However, at the same time, unidentified hackers were creating websites with typosquatted domains, seemingly identical to the browser’s actual website. They were also creating ads on Google which, due to certain problems the network has, displayed the legitimate website, but redirected people to the typosquatted one. This meant customers who wanted to install Arc on their Windows device, and had used Google to search for it, would find an ad in the very top of Google’s search results page. The ad seemingly pointed to the site’s actual website, but led the victims to a malicious site which offered an infected version of the browser’s installer, hosted on MEGA, for download. Anyone who downloaded this installer would get the browser, but also malware which, according to initial reports, seems to be an infostealer, although confirmation on the malware’s nature is still pending. Hackers are always taking advantage of major events and product launches to try and trick people into giving away sensitive data, or downloading malware. Events such as the FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, Chat-GPT launch, Windows 11 launch, and others, have all been abused in the past to deliver bad code to people. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The best way to protect against these attacks is to always type the website address into the browser, instead of “just googling” it. If you don’t know the site, be mindful of the search engine results, and always double-check the characters in the address bar before downloading anything. Via BleepingComputer",

        "description": "Pinole resident Jeanne Gibson, 98, helped make history during World War II as a \"Rosie the Riveter.\" On the 80th anniversary of D-Day, she'll be one of about 70 heroes of that conflict honored in France.",
        "content": "PINOLE — Feeling she wasn’t giving enough to the war effort after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Jeanne Gibson — at the time only 18 years old — traded her nursing school life in Minnesota for a welding job in the shipyards of Seattle. Now 98, Pinole resident Gibson will be one of about 70 American World War II heroes honored in France on the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy, eventually leading to the liberation of France and the end of the war. “During World War II, everyone was on the same page. We were working to get it over with so we could get our boys back home,” Gibson said in an interview. “Everybody was just doing what they could. It was great and we were all working together. It was a good time as well as being a bad time because of the war.” The millions of women like Gibson who worked in American shipyards and factories during World War II — many of them stepping into the industrial workforce for the first time while the men who had formerly worked such jobs were deployed overseas — became known as “Rosie the Riveters,” after the song of the same name. The 1942 hit, popularized by several artists, could have been about Gibson herself: “All the day long, whether rain or shine / She’s a part of the assembly line / She’s making history, working for victory / Rosie, the riveter.” Whether or not there was a “real” Rosie on which the song was based is much-debated, but the most iconic image of Rosie the Riveter became the wartime poster by Pittsburgh artist J. Howard Miller of a woman with the sleeve of her industrial blue uniform rolled up, flexing her bicep as she proclaims, “We can do it!” Beginning May 31, Gibson and other honorees will be flown out to the headquarters of American Airlines in Fort Worth, Texas, where they’ll receive a send-off parade before boarding a charter flight to Paris. The trip will culminate in a ceremony on June 6 at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, where more than 9,000 American WWII soldiers are buried. The trip is made possible through a partnership between American Airlines and the nonprofit Old Glory Honor Flight. Gibson, one of only two Rosie the Riveters participating in the event, and a recent recipient of a Congressional Medal of Honor, said she’s excited for the adventure. It’s far from the first in her lifetime though; besides her World War II welding work, she’s also earned a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, as well as a pilot license, and traveled abroad over the decades since. Before moving to Seattle, Washington, to weld warships, Gibson was studying to become a nurse in Minneapolis, having heard the position was in demand during the war. She remembers listening to the radio when news broke about the attack on Pearl Harbor and wanting to be of service. But after two quarters studying nursing, she said she realized the role wasn’t for her. She and a school friend, Esther Harri, landed roles as welders at the Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle, working the cold evening shift in their safety helmets, leather overalls, jeans and long underwear purchased with their first checks. Gibson later took on another role making manifests and hatch lists for the Army Transportation Corps’ Embarkation Center in Juneau. Whether welding or filling out ledgers, Gibson said she loved and took great pride in the work. “Without World War II and what happened, I would be an entirely different person,” Gibson said. “It gave me courage to go ahead and I can do it. And it gave me some backbone.” After the war, Gibson moved to San Francisco and then Berkeley. She went on to earn a bachelor’s in psychology, and a master’s and Ph.D. in educational psychology from UC Berkeley, where she also taught multiple sections of educational psychology 101. While writing her dissertation, she also taught science to local schoolchildren and would end up dedicating 30 years of her life to teaching kindergarten through sixth grade. She and Harri earned their pilot licenses and joined a local chapter of the Ninety-Nines, a group for women pilots started by famed flyer Amelia Earhart and 98 others. They traveled the world, socialized with an assortment of friends, and picked up hobbies like weaving and baking. After attending a trip to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in December of 2023, Gibson was inspired to begin telling her story to hundreds of visitors nearly every Friday at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park in Richmond, which honors the contributions of women during World War II. The work is what’s keeping her going, Gibson said, noting she especially enjoys encouraging young girls to fight for what they deserve, including fair pay. “I say don’t limit yourself to what you think you can do,” Gibson said. “You can do it and don’t let them pay you less.”",

        "content": "Headlines are sizzling with Bronny James’ potential pair-up with his dad. LeBron James ’ unyielding longevity is about to realize another feat unheard of in the NBA. While NBA enthusiasts wonder where the two will end up teaming up with each other, Rich Paul recently spilled some beans about it opening a can of worms. Fans have already deciphered the message speculating LBJ’s exit from the Lakers, however, Skip Bayless believes otherwise. On ‘UNDISPUTED’ , Bayless made it clear that despite the comments by the “ masterful ” businessman, Bron isn’t leaving the Purple and Gold for a swansong with the Cleveland Cavaliers. For him, the writing is on the wall since James has “ two beautiful places ” in LA and is reaping humungous rewards in the boisterous marketplace. As a cherry on top, Bayless posited that since his son has also been living in LA for a long time, the best move is to stay put with one of the most recognizable franchises in the world. Additionally, as per the vet, Anthony Davis will also accompany them. “ In the end, LeBron will be a Laker, Bronny will be a Laker, and AD will do whatever LeBron says ,” Bayless claimed. The FS1 analyst is steadfast that the father-son duo will share the hardwood for the Lakers. At the same time, there has been a lot of buzz about LBJ leaving the Lakers to pair up with his 19-year-old son. Rich Paul’s comments have now added to the intrigue. Where will LeBron James head to next? During Game 2 between the Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves, Rich Paul, a guest on TNT’s ‘AltCast’ talked about LBJ’s future, “ Look, LeBron’s a free agent. I gotta focus on his business and who should be paying about his business” . This “ free agent ” labeling raised eyebrows since James is eligible for a $51.4 million extension by June 29, and wouldn’t be a free agent until he decides to opt out. Chris Haynes, who was a part of the coverage, capitalized on this slip-up and urged Paul to lay out the details but he was naturally hesitant to do so. Furthermore, LBJ was spotted on the sidelines of the Cavaliers’ home during Game 4 between the Cavs and the Celtics in the ECSF. This sighting set off a firestorm about James returning to the franchise that drafted him and finishing his career with them. To complicate matters further, there has been a ton of chatter about King James possibly leaving for the Dallas Mavericks . There are murmurs about the Mavs drafting Bronny James if he falls into their lap as the last pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. Thus, some expect the 4x Finals MVP to join his son, alongside Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. While each offseason brings a plethora of rumors about James, the 2024 offseason has the highest intrigue because of Bronny James’ inclusion in the NBA.",

        "content": "The Brazilian has been at Spurs since moving from Barcelona during the 2021 summer transfer window but has never really impressed at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 25-year-old lost his place in the Premier League club’s starting 11 this season to Pedro Porro and Ange Postecoglou is happy to move Emerson on during the upcoming transfer window having only played the full-back 22 times during the current campaign. According to , Spurs are willing to part ways with Emerson should a bid between €15m-€20m arrive, with AC Milan being one club with the right-back on their transfer list. This is a position the Serie A outfit need to address ahead of the 2024/25 campaign and they also have an interest in Lille’s Tiago Santos. AC Milan have Tottenham’s Emerson Royal on their transfer list Writing in his , Moretto has said that Emerson is on Milan’s list but they will have to wait for Paulo Fonseca’s approval before making a move. The transfer journalist stated: “Milan have to sign a right-back, they have a shortlist with various names on it. On that list is Emerson Royale, who can leave Tottenham Hotspur for €15-20m this summer, and Tiago Santos of Lille is also on that list. “He can leave the Ligue 1 side for a little less than Emerson. Clearly, the fact that Paulo Fonseca will be the Milan manager could have an impact on the decision. As things stand, we have to see if Milan make a definitive call to go for one of the two, but those two are on the shortlist.”",

        "content": "A Calgary man facing a murder charge after human remains were discovered by firefighters west of the city was in court Monday as lawyers dealt with a conflict issue. Christopher Stack, 39, faces a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Kyle Schuiling, 33. Court records suggest police aren't sure when Schuiling was killed. The offence dates listed on court documents show Stack is accused of murdering Schuiling between April 1 and April 3, 2024. Lawyer in conflict Schuiling's body was found by members of the Tsuut'ina Nation Fire Department as they were extinguishing a grass fire in Rocky View County near Range Road 40 and Township Road 241 early in the morning of April 3. Police charged Stack a month after Schuiling's remains were discovered. Stack was also in court Monday on other, unrelated charges, including possession of stolen property, driving offences and breaching court-ordered conditions. Justice Jim Ogle heard that Andrea Urquhart, Stack's lawyer on his previous charges, cannot act for him on the murder charge because she knew the victim and is in a conflict. Instead, defence lawyer Tonii Roulston will take the case. Stack will be back in court in two weeks.",

        "description": "Unlicensed miners are being arrested for allegedly stealing the country’s lithium, a critical mineral used in batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones and power systems.",
        "content": "Miners work at an illegal tin mining site in Jos, Nigeria on April 3, 2024. Nigeria is seeking to regulate mining of critical minerals, curb illegal activity and better benefit from its mineral resources. Sunday Alamba/Associated Press ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigeria’s government is cracking down on illegal mining, making dozens of arrests of unlicensed miners since April for allegedly stealing the country’s lithium, a critical mineral used in batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones and power systems. The recent arrests come as Nigeria seeks to regulate its mining operations of critical minerals, curb illegal activity and better benefit from its mineral resources. The clean energy transition, a shift away from coal, oil and gas and toward renewable energy and batteries has spiked global demand for lithium, tin and other minerals. Illegal mines are rife in the country’s fledging industry as corruption among regulatory officials is common and the mineral deposits are located in remote areas with minimal government presence. Officials say profits from illicit mining practices has helped arm militia groups in the north of the county. In the most recent arrests in mid-May, a joint team of soldiers and police conducted a raid on a remote market in Kishi, in the country’s southwestern Oyo State. Locals said the market, once known for selling farm produce, has become a center for illicit trade in lithium mined in hard-to-reach areas. The three-day operation resulted in the arrest of 32 individuals, including two Chinese nationals, local workers and mineral traders, according to the state government and locals. Loads of lithium were also seized. Jimoh Bioku, a Kishi community leader, said there had been “clandestine searches” for the mineral at remote sites tucked away in the bush in the past years by Chinese nationals before “they engaged people to dig for them and turned the market into a transit point.” The community was “particularly worried about the insecurity that usually follows illegal mining and that was why we reported to the state government,” he said. China is the dominant player in the global EV supply chain, including in Nigeria where China-owned companies employ mostly vulnerable people leaving Nigeria’s far north – ravaged by conflicts and rapid desertification – to work in mining operations throughout the country. China’s nationals and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining. There have been at least three cases of illegal mining arrests involving Chinese nationals in two months. President Bola Tinubu has repeatedly blamed illegal mining for the worsening conflicts in the country’s north and asked the international community for help to stop the problem, which provides armed groups with the proceeds needed to sustain and arm themselves. The Chinese embassy in Abuja did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on the arrests and claims of illegal operations. But in a statement last year following a report by The Times of London alleging Chinese miners were bribing militants for access, the embassy said it “always encouraged and urged the Chinese companies and nationals in Nigeria to abide by the laws and regulations of Nigeria.” Nigeria is emerging as a new source of lithium in Africa as the world’s largest producers, like Australia and Chile, are unable to fulfill the growing demand worldwide. But illegal activities thrive in Nigeria’s extractive sector, denying the government due revenues, said Emeka Okoro, whose Lagos-based SBM Intelligence firm has researched illicit mining and terrorism financing in northern Nigeria. And the combination of conflict and climate change effects, such as once fertile land rapidly turning into useless arid sand in northern Nigeria, has produced a cheap workforce for mining sites. The arrests of “both Chinese nationals and young Hausa boys from conflict-affected regions underscore a troubling pattern,” Okoro told the AP. “The socioeconomic strain stemming from conflict and the repercussions of climate change has given rise to a vulnerable demographic desperate for survival.” To fight resource theft that causes losses of $9 billion to the government annually, according to the country’s extractive industry transparency watchdog, the West African nation has set up a 2,200-strong “corps of mining marshals” earlier in the year. While existing law enforcement agencies are still combating the problem, the new corps is geared at curbing “the nefarious activities of illegal miners,” said Segun Tomori, spokesperson for the solid minerals ministry. Before the Kishi raid, the mining corps arrested two trucks laden with lithium on the outskirts of the capital Abuja in April. Later that month, the corps raided a location in Karu, Nasarawa State, near Abuja, leading to the arrest of four Chinese nationals and the seizure of tons of lithium. Tomori said the cases are now in court. On April 22, a federal court in Ilorin, in the north-central region, convicted two Chinese nationals for illegal mining and sentenced them to a one-year jail term, although with an option of a fine. Nigeria has long neglected the solid minerals sector, which allows some communities like the northern-central town of Jos — which is tin-abundant — to depend on subsistence mining for their livelihood. For those communities where livelihood is tied to mining, Tomori said the government is encouraging artisanal miners there to form cooperatives and operate legally. Success.

        "description": "Enhance your hi-fi experience with a solid phono preamp. Whether you're an aspiring hobbyist or vetted vinyl collector, our list has options for everyone.",
        "content": "Whether you’re a hi-fi hobbyist or a , one of the best investments you can make for your is a phono preamp. Also known as a phono stage, these mostly compact external preamplifiers take the low signal output created by turntable cartridges and boost it so it's loud enough for the , , or powered speakers to amplify. Some models can even let you fine-tune the sound and output to match a specific cartridge you might be using. While many modern turntables and devices include their own built-in phono preamps, getting your own can give you more control over your sound and even improve it byadding balance, stability, smoothness, clarity and even better sound staging. Certain preamps also include additional features, like the ability to switch between more common moving magnet (MM) phono cartridges and higher-end moving coil (MC) cartridges, should you be getting into more audiophile-level territory. There are hundreds of phono preamps to choose from, so we’ve put together this list of the best models on the market. Our roundup includes options for LP first-timers, audiophiles, and those looking to score a phono preamp for a great price. Rega is well-known for its best-in-class turntables and amplifiers. The Rega Fono MM Mk5 is designed as a phono preamp for the more common MM (moving magnet) cartridges only — you typically only see MC (moving coil) cartridges in higher-end turntables. There is an MC-only version though, the , should you venture into MC territory. The Rega Fono MM Mk5 is affordable, simple to set up and use, and provides detailed and noise-free playback, with just enough punch and energy to reproduce any type of music just as the artist intended. Without getting too bogged down in the minutia of the tech, a phono stage has the job of amplifying the weak signal from the cartridge, yes, but it also must process the equalization standards applied to all vinyl records by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to produce a tonally even audio signal. What makes the Fono MM Mk5 unique is that it splits the RIAA equalization into two stages — the regular signal path and the RIAA equalization circuits. This separation allows the Mk5 to provide cleaner and distortion-free playback. With a signal gain of around 41 decibels, the Mk5 is comparable to most other phono stages in this price range. Physically, the Fono Mk5 is pretty no-frills and is about the size of a paperback novel. The aluminum case fits in with the look of Rega’s other products. Also, the preamp’s aesthetics will look great amid modern hi-fi setups. While it’s pricier than some of the other products on our list, the Rega Fono MM Mk5 is an excellent choice for beginner LP owners and audiophiles alike. Phono preamps don’t get much more basic than the Rolls VP29, but sometimes simple is all you need. Measuring 3.25 inches wide, 2 inches tall, and 1.5 inches from front to back, the Rolls VP29 is just large enough to house RCA ins and outs, a 3.5mm output, a grounding post, and a power connection. The internal circuitry is designed to deliver fine-tuned playback that matches the RIAA equalization curve, and the VP29 delivers 42 decibels of gain. Keep in mind that this preamp is meant for signal conversion only. If you’re looking for a phono stage with adjustable gain and EQ settings, you’ll want to look elsewhere. In fact, not even the volume of the headphone output can be adjusted. Still, for under $70, the Rolls VP29 Phono Preamp is a plug-and-play winner that gets the job done. The Cambridge Audio Alva Duo is a diverse phono preamp that's good for both older vinyl and new (more on this below). Under the hood, a cutting-edge switch mode power supply reduces hum, and a surface-mounted circuit board further reduces noise for clean and ultra-quiet playback. They’re also connected in a way that prioritizes short signal paths, resulting in fast and precise timing. And consistent with the quality of sound that Cambridge is known for with its , the Duo offers rich, smooth sound with a wide soundstage. The Alva Duo’s subsonic filter and balance control mean that the preamp all but eliminates the low-frequency rumbles that come from scratches and scuffs on a record, as well as those that can come from an unbalanced cartridge. We’re also glad to see a 1/4-inch (6.35mm) headphone jack for private listening. While some users claim the headphone amp isn’t powerful enough, it’s still a thoughtful addition. The Alva Duo only consumes half a watt of power in standby and automatically powers down after 20 minutes of not being used, which saves energy. Pro-Ject Audio makes some of the best turntables around, so it stands to reason that it knows its way around a phono stage, too. The main idea behind the Pro-Ject Phono Box DC (or any phono stage, really) is to deliver a balanced, low-noise signal that is packed with as much precision and depth as possible. Pro-Ject achieves this by implementing high-quality circuitry that cuts down on distortion and other audible issues. It's compatible with both MM and MC cartridge types, and switching between either setup is handled with the simple push of a button. The Phono Box pushes up to 40 decibels for MM cartridges and 60 decibels for MC systems. For less than $150, you’re getting a phono preamp with gold-plated inputs and outputs and dual-mono circuitry for optimized performance. It’s a minimalist piece of equipment that will have no problem fitting in with your other AV gear. While it doesn’t have as many settings as other preamps, the Pro-Ject Phono Box DC is an ideal middle-ground between entry-level phono stages and preamps that cost thousands of dollars. The Musical Fidelity MX-VYNL is a premium phono preamp that sounds refined and detailed, excels at vocals, is deliciously full-sounding, and is even a bit forward (and smooth) in the low end. For its $850 price tag, it should do all that and more for those with premium turntables to pair it with -- and it does. Engineered for well-balanced and detail-focused performance, the MX-VYNL is compatible with MM and MC cartridges. It’s also one of the only phono stages to include both a standard RCA input and a balanced single XLR 5-pin input. Not only does this allow for connecting two turntables simultaneously, but the balanced input allows for much less noise. The MX-VYNL also features RCA outputs, as well as balanced XLR outputs, which are much quieter, but can deliver more precise and fuller sound than the RCA, should you have a compatible amplifier to connect to. The MX-VYNL goes ever further with fine-tuning features, with its dial for switching between MC and MM, and the ability to adjust cartridge impedance to perfectly match any given cartridge. Unlike other phono stages with these controls, you’ll actually be able to adjust settings during playback too. The MX-VYNL is also one of the best preamps for RIAA correction, letting you choose between it and the newer IEC equalization curve. It's definitely more advanced than most of the other phono stages on our list, but if you're heading in the direction of audiophile sound, then a phono preamp like this might be a good place to start. The Fosi Audio Box X2 leans on vintage engineering and delivers big results with its two vacuum tubes that are front and center. Thanks to low-noise integrated circuitry and top-shelf components, the X2 is designed to remove as much low-frequency noise as possible during LP playback, so you’ll always have crystal clear sound. You’ll be able to choose from 39-, 42-, and 45-decibel gain settings, so you’ll never have to worry about having enough power to match your MM cartridge -- but in case you have one that needs a little boost, it's there. We’re also glad to see an onboard tube preamp with a 3.5mm AUX input. Conveniently, the X2’s vacuum tubes can be swapped for other tube models. An excellent feature for hi-fi fans, this means you’ll be able to experiment with different makes and models to get the sound you like for your amplifier and speakers. Developed by legendary master circuit designer John Curl, the man behind the equally legendary Vendetta Research phono preamp, the Parasound JC3+ Phono Preamp is a sturdy, feature-rich component that audiophiles praise for its wide soundstage, realistic imaging, refined detail retrieval, and excellent neutrality. Featuring Vampire 24K gold-plated RCA inputs and unbalanced outputs, as well as balanced Neutrik XLR outputs, all of the JC3+ connections are designed for minimal noise and hum. This same principle carries over to the 24K gold-plated copper traces on the phono module boards. Even the power supplies and AC wires use low-carbon mild steel partitions to deliver the clearest signal possible. The JC3+ also includes an integrated Mono switch for enhancing the quality of older mono LPs, on top of an AC polarity reverse switch for dialing down the hum that many systems generate. Impedance adjustment dials and variable MC, fixed MC, and MM selection options allow for precise pairing with a wide range of moving coil and moving magnet cartridges. The Parasound JC3+ is more of a boutique component than many others, and its price reflects that. But audiophile users will appreciate the noise-free playback, customization options, and, of course, Curl's stamp on the product.",

READ: DFA protests China’s fishing ban encroaching West Philippine Sea Beijing’s fishing moratorium in the South China Sea encroaches most of the West Philippine Sea in outright disregard of Manila’s sovereign rights inside its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where it is allowed to explore and manage all the resources as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It already started on May 1, 2024 and is expected to last until September 16, 2024. READ: Chinese ships block convoy’s mother boat from reaching Scarborough “Our pangulongs go sailing [in the West Philippine Sea] everyday [despite the ban],” Cuaresma, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview in Filipino, referring to an indigenous mother boat. Cuaresma, who has sailed in the West Philippine Sea for over four decades, also noted that he, along with hundreds of fishermen, already joined the civilian convoy led by five “pangulongs”—which attempted to reach Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal—also this month when Beijing’s moratorium is already in place. The fishing activities of small bancas and pangulongs during the mission went unimpeded, as witnessed by INQUIRER.net. However, the convoy was blocked to come near the vicinity of Panatag Shoal by 10 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) branded as an “overkill” response. The actions of CCG are in line with Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, even if such a claim has been effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013. Despite CCG’s latest demonstration of authority, a geopolitical analyst noted that Filipino fishermen were able to fish in the West Philippine Sea even in previous years. “Nevertheless, there are still risks of escalation,” Don McLain Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University’s Department of International Studies, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. Gill also said “we have to wait and see” as to how the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. intends to address the lengthy ban. “This uncertainty and concern for miscalculation will likely raise pressures for the Marcos Jr. administration,” Gill noted. “It is likely for Manila to remain cautious and utilize its open channels with Beijing, while simultaneously emphasizing how the illicit and unilateral actions of China continue to derail bilateral ties,” he further said. In an expected move, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), through a diplomatic note, on Monday protested the fishing ban, calling it “illegal” under the “final and binding” 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA would always lodge a protest whenever China announces this yearly moratorium. For Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, the DFA should have completely disregarded China’s unilateral policy. “My personal opinion, we should just ignore it,” Ong said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “By protesting, we acknowledge its existence and inadvertently recognize it even in protest.” But for security expert Chester Cabalza, all other channels, like filing of a diplomatic protest, should be explored to defy Beijing’s policy and assert Manila’s rights in the West Philippine Sea. “This [fishing ban] should be defied,” Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “We should encourage more of our Filipino fishers to continue their fishing rights in our maritime entitlements.” Cabalza further said: “If we submit ourselves to their domestic law, it means that we surrender to their will.” Which, Cuaresma said, the fisherfolk have no plans of doing, as PCG continues to allow the fishermen to sail in the West Philippine Sea. “As long as our government allows us, we will continue to fish and we will not allow our neighboring countries to bully us and interfere with our livelihood,” Cuaresma said.

        "content": "A Special Prevention of Money Laundering Act(PMLA) court on Monday sent Purushottam Chavan, husband of an Indian Police Services (IPS) officer, into judicial custody until June 7. Purshottam was arrested last week by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) Mumbai in the Rs 263 crore Income Tax Refund (ITR) fraud case. ED officials did not seek extension of Chavan's custody from the court on Monday, hence the court sent him to judicial custody, Chavan's lawyer Shekhar Jagtap said. The central agency has requested the court that the accused shall not be released on bail as the investigation is underway. Another accused and businessman Rajesh Brijlal Batreja was also sent into judicial custody along with Chavan. The ED mentioned in its remand copy that during the custodial interrogation, Purushottam Chavan, the husband of an IPS officer, was not cooperating on being confronted with various records and documents seized during the two raids at the IPS officer's official residence. The accused chose not to disclose the true facts about the seized property documents worth Rs 150 crore. According to sources, it is suspected that these could be benami assets created in the names of other individuals. Additionally, when Purushottam was confronted with the other accused Rajesh Batreja, he did not provide details of how much funds he had actually received, nor the mode and manner of receiving the funds and their further utilization. According to the ED investigation, a third Dubai-based partner was identified. During the confrontation of Chavan with Rajesh Brijlal Batreja, it was established that the accused Chavan received proceeds of crime (POC) from Rajesh Batreja, which were earlier siphoned off to Dubai and then brought back to India through hawala channels with the help of Purushottam's Dubai-based partner. In the 263 crore fraud case ED arrested the main accused Tanaji Mandal Adhikari last year during the investigation revealed that he generated Rs. 263.95 crore in proceeds of crime (POC) from the Income Tax Department between November 15, 2019, and November 4, 2020. Rajesh Batreja played a key role in diverting Rs 55.50 crore of this amount, converting it into cash, and helping Adhikari conceal the funds by transferring them to Dubai. During Batreja’s custodial interrogation, his transactions with Purushottam Chavan were uncovered. Further investigation revealed that Batreja transferred a significant amount of the POC to IPS official's hubby Chavan in cash. The central agency has twice raided the IPS' official residence in Colaba, seizing several incriminating property documents suspected to include benami properties. The ED seized property documents worth approximately Rs. 150 crore, registered in the names of multiple individuals. These documents also included Transferable Development Rights (TDR) for land parcels in Mumbai and Pune.",

        "content": "ABUJA – The founder and Chief Executive Officer, CEO, of Afriprize, a gaming platform, Olumide M. Ogunwo, has shared an inspirational journey on how he grew from Okitipupa in Ondo state to becoming a tech enthusiast and a major player in the gaming industry. A statement personally signed by him revealed that his life story begins in an old garage, in Okitipupa, but his roots trace back to Ode-Aye, adding that even as a student, he was captivated by technology, managing a cybercafe and diving into the digital world early on. He revealed that after high school, Ogunwo wanted to explore new places and ended up in Awka, Anambra where he began learning about cybersecurity and game development. He said: “The internet opened doors to global communities, I made friends and discovered ways to earn online. At just 17, I started trading digital currencies and creating content for websites like Waptrick and Sefan, showing my entrepreneurial spirit.” Traditional education, however, took a back seat as Ogunwo found a treasure trove of opportunities on Craigslist, where he started connecting landlords with tenants, earning commissions for his verification services. “Though I spent my early earnings carefreely, this venture sparked my journey into entrepreneurship”, he said. Ogunwo also traveled to Senegal with his best friend to explore bounty hunting and vulnerability identification for companies, but unfortunately, tragedy struck during a beach celebration that claimed his friend’s life. Afterward, he returned to Nigeria but remained resilient and continued to shine as he navigated through various living situations, adapting to the unpredictable nature of life. “Each setback became a stepping stone, leading me to Akure and a promising project that aligned with my skills and interests. Realizing my financial naivety, I didn’t shy away from the challenge. Instead, I embarked on a quest for knowledge in financial management, showcasing a willingness to learn and grow”, he said. As the idea that would redefine his path emerged, Olumide’s resilience stood as the foundation for innovation, and each twist and turn in his journey unfolded not as obstacles but as opportunities for growth. “Every challenge was a chance to improve and adapt,” Olumide explains.",

ALSO READ: Hajj 2024: Gov Yusuf inaugurates first flight of Kano pilgrims According to a statement signed by the spokesman of the party, Hassan Sahabi Sanyinawal, and made available to newsmen on Monday, the party said not fewer than five states have made provisions to support their pilgrims. The statement said, “the party wishes the intending pligrims for the 2024 exercise a safe trip and successful Hajj. “As the first batch of the Sokoto state intending pilgrims will start departing to Saudi Arabia tomorrow, the PDP hereby urges our pilgrims to be good ambassadors of our great state in the holy land and use the opportunity to pray for peace and tranquility and progress in Sokoto State and Nigeria as a whole. “We also wish to remind the governmeng of Sokoto State that it is not too late to emulate other states in Nigeria and provide reliefs on the Hajj for our 2024 pilgrims. “The party notes with concern and sincere amazement, that while governments of states like Rivers have since provided subsidies for their intending Muslim faithfuls to enable them pay the Hajj fare, that of Sokoto State, which the center of the Islamic faith in the country, has remain unconcerned and mute on the issue. “It has come to our notice that so far, the Federal Government and six states in the country have given aide to pilgrims to offset the high fare for this year’s pilgrimage. These are Kebbi, Rivers, Jigawa, Bauchi, Yobe and Kano.” The statement further said, “Sokoto State PDP, wishes to remind the APC regime in our state that all previous administrations, in spite of the lean resources available to them, had provided subsidies to pilgrims towards a successful Hajj, which is one of the pillars of Islam. “We therefore see no reason that the current administration that is enjoying an unprecedented availability of funds, should fail to sustain the noble gesture.”",

        "content": "The rhythmic drums, hundreds taking to the streets and colourful characters – it can only mean Combe Martin has spent the bank holiday weekend Hunting the Earl of Rone. The unique custom sees villagers don their costumes to seek out the elusive ‘earl’ with processions on each day accompanied by characters including the Hobby Horse, Fool and a troop of Grenadiers. It began on Friday evening, then on Saturday local children have their own junior procession, followed by a mazy Sunday afternoon affair and finally culminating in the grand finale on Monday evening, when hundreds join the hunt. The Earl is finally located, captured and led down the long village street to the sea seated backwards on a donkey. He is ‘shot’ several times before being revived and finally at sunset is cast into the sea. The popular annual event is joined by many in the village and is a great spectacle for visitors, as well as an opportunity for more than a little revelry and merriment! Participants in this year’s event also remembered Phyllis Ackland, who passed away very recently aged 96 – Phyllis was a long-term and enthusiastic supporter of the Earl of Rone and took part for many years.

        "content": "A resident of a shelter for medically vulnerable people experiencing homelessness is accused of killing a roommate Sunday, less than six months after the facility opened . The 62-year-old woman killed, named in a probable cause affidavit as Stephanie Lynne Hackett Carrasco, was staying at the Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility in Sandy. One of Carrasco’s two roommates woke up from a nap to find her draped in bed sheets, laying under her bed face down in a pool of blood with blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Sandy police arrested another roommate — a 60-year-old woman — on suspicion of murder and tampering with evidence. The Salt Lake Tribune generally does not name defendants unless they have been formally charged with a crime. According to the probable cause affidavit explaining the woman’s arrest, Carrasco was seen on security footage entering the room for the last time, and cameras captured the roommate accused of killing her leaving the room 40 minutes later. The affidavit says the roommate had “her arms full of what appears to be clothing and other personal items.” When the other roommate awoke and saw Carrasco unconscious, she reportedly called emergency medical services. Paramedics declared Carrasco dead when they arrived at the scene. Police noticed spots of blood on a red fanny pack the accused roommate was carrying when she returned to the room. The probable cause affidavit states police had not yet searched the room, but that detectives hoped to look for an object that could have been used to cause the injuries to Carrasco’s head. The roommate who allegedly struck and killed Carrasco declined to make a statement to police without a lawyer. It is unclear if she has retained an attorney. She is currently being held at Salt Lake County jail and has been denied bail. (Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) A room at the Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility in Sandy on Friday, Dec. 8, 2023. A resident there is accused of killing her roommate Sunday. The Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility is located on 9000 South near Interstate 15 in Sandy, in a former EconoLodge motel. The facility is funded by both taxpayers and philanthropy. Michelle Flynn, the director of The Road Home — and organization that helps operate the facility — said in a statement Monday afternoon, “The events ... are tragic, our hearts are with those involved.” “The MVP program provides a safe and supportive environment where residents can rehabilitate from illness by accessing the necessary health care and care management services to find stability to move toward permanent housing and other long-term care solutions,” Flynn continued. “We are unwavering in our commitment to safety, ensuring a welcoming and secure environment for all those who seek refuge with us. We are working closely with law enforcement and other crisis services to support residents and staff. We will continue to work with our community partners to support ongoing needs as they arise.” The Salt Lake Tribune reported in December that the facility was designed to serve 165 people in need of specialized care, and that residents would either have their own rooms or share a room with one other person, depending on their condition. At the time of Sunday’s killing, three women were sharing a room.",

        "content": "VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis used a highly derogatory term towards the LGBT community as he reiterated in a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops that gay people should not be allowed to become priests, Italian media reported on Monday. La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, Italy's largest circulation dailies, both quoted the pope as saying seminaries, or priesthood colleges, are already too full of \"frociaggine\", a vulgar Italian term roughly translating as \"faggottness\". The Vatican did not respond to a request for comment. La Repubblica attributed its story to several unspecified sources, while Corriere said it was backed up by a few, unnamed bishops, who suggested the pope, as an Argentine, might have not realised that the Italian term he used was offensive. Political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20, when the Italian Bishops Conference opened a four-day assembly with a non-public meeting with the pontiff. Francis, who is 87, has so far been credited with leading the Roman Catholic Church into taking a more welcoming approach towards the LGBT community. In 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously said, \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\", while last year he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering substantial conservative backlash. Nevertheless, he delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject any suspected homosexuals. In a 2005 document, released under Francis's late predecessor Benedict XVI, the Vatican said the Church could admit into the priesthood those who had clearly overcome homosexual tendencies for at least three years. The document said practicing homosexuals and those with \"deep-seated\" gay tendencies and those who \"support the so-called gay culture\" should be barred. REUTERS",

Ugwuka, a final year student of EBSU in the Department of English Language and Literature, allegedly committed suicide in her hostel apartment on Wednesday, May 23, 2024. Addressing journalists on Monday at the institution’s conference room, the Vice Chancellor, Professor Chigozie Ogbu, dismissed claims by the deceased that the accused lecturer was behind her failure. Ogbu’s briefing read in part: “When a student is confident that a lecturer has deliberately marked them down, and they are sure that they passed the exam, what the student does is to complain to the HOD or Dean and request re-marking, which will be sent to the Vice Chancellor’s office. “It is usually sent to another university to re-mark and let us know. Some of them, on very rare occasions, have returned positive, and whatever the student gets here is usually what they get from the other university after re-marking, and that is the process. “If at the last exam, the late student felt that she was marked down by the lecturer, she would have complained to the Dean and asked for re-marking, and the paper would have been sent to another place for re-marking. ‘But from what is seen, it’s not that the student deserves to pass, and she didn’t pass. And from the record, you will find out that this is not the only course that she didn’t pass.” Professor Ogbu further stated that, according to the certified true copy of Ugwuka Favour Chinonye’s results, with the registration number EBSU/2018/89726 for the Department of English Language and Literature, who registered in the year 2018/2019, and that is her 1st year. In her 1st year, she offered 9 courses out of which she failed 3 courses and had a CGP of 1.78. In the 2nd semester of her 1st year, she took 8 courses, out of which she failed 2 and had a CGP of 1.75, thereby having a sessional CGP of 1.76. Professor Ogbu continued, “In 2019/2020, which is her 2nd year, she registered a total of 10 courses. Out of the courses, she was absent in 2 courses: Intermediate English Composition (ENG 215) and Philosophy and Logic (GST 102). She was absent in the 2 courses out of the 8 she wrote, she failed 2. She had a GP of 1.41 in that 1st semester. In her 2nd semester, she registered 10 courses. Out of the 10 courses, she failed 4 and had a CGP of 1.82. Total CGP in her 2nd year is 1.62.” The Vice Chancellor went on to detail Ugwuka’s academic performance in subsequent years, concluding that she had outstanding courses, including ENG 416, which she failed twice.

        "description": "Prominent proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis aired concerns about the \"excessive size\" of Musk's pay deal.",
        "content": "Tesla shareholders should reject CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, according to proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which singled out the \"excessive size\" of the deal and its potentially negative impact on smaller shareholders. The recommendation from the influential proxy advisory company comes as Tesla is asking its shareholders to vote again on his 2018 pay package after a Delaware judge earlier this year nullified the payout , which was the biggest compensation plan in corporate America. Tesla shareholders are set to vote on the pay package on June 13. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Glass Lewis' recommendation to vote against the pay deal. Proxy advisory firms are relied on by institutional investors to provide research and advice on how to vote during annual and special meetings on public companies' proxy proposals, which can range from executive compensation to corporate governance issues. In Tesla's case, Glass Lewis wrote in a 71-page report, shared with CBS MoneyWatch, that Tesla shareholders risk stock dilution if Musk is granted the massive stock grant, meaning that their shares could be worth less as a result. The proxy advisory firm also noted that Musk is well compensated through his current 12.9% ownership of Tesla, a stake that is valued at about $74 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk doesn't receive a salary from Tesla, but Glass Lewis noted that his shares in the company mean that his interests are already aligned with that of the business. Deadly Tesla crash and burn in Weston 00:27 The value of Musk's current Tesla stake \"challenges the very basis that the 2018 grant as structured and sized was even necessary,\" Glass Lewis wrote. Dilution occurs when a company issues additional stock, which in turn shrinks the proportional ownership stake of pre-existing shares. Under the 2018 pay deal for Musk, Tesla would issue about 304 million new shares, creating a dilution effect of about 9%, the firm said. \"[T]hese concerns are exacerbated by the concentration of ownership in Mr. Musk,\" the report said, noting that Musk would increase his ownership stake to 22.4% if the 2018 pay package were to be approved next month. \"Mr. Musk would be the Company's largest shareholder by a healthy margin.\" It added, \"Given the impact on the holdings of other shareholders, the continued concentration of ownership around Mr. Musk warrants particular attention.\" More from CBS News Fired up about barbecue costs this Memorial Day?

        "content": "A new state law expands legal protections for hundreds of miles of Minnesota waterways whose status had been uncertain. In the final days of the session, lawmakers passed language clarifying that a waterway that meets the legal definition is a public water, even if it’s not on a decades-old state inventory. The change was included in an omnibus environment and natural resources budget bill, which Gov. Tim Walz signed into law last week. “This is a backstop to say water courses that meet the definition in state law are water courses that belong to all of us as Minnesotans, and are due these protections that we’ve outlined for public waters,” said Carly Griffith, water program director for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. The bill’s passage followed a lengthy legal dispute over Limbo Creek, the last free-flowing stream in heavily-farmed Renville County. The county board did not require an environmental review of proposed improvements to the upper reaches of the creek, because it wasn’t listed on the public waters inventory. Environmental groups and the Department of Natural Resources argued the stream met the legal definition of a public water, warranting greater protection. A lower court agreed, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld that decision in 2022. In Minnesota, “where water is really central to our identity,” the state has taken an expansive view of what counts as a public water, Griffith said. That definition includes natural and altered waterways with a total drainage area greater than 2 square miles. “So that means it can include streams and creeks that aren’t the Mighty Mississippi River, but that are important to the local communities that rely on them,” Griffith said. She estimates the new law will affect at least 640 miles of waterways across the state. Griffith said there are errors in the state’s public waters inventory, which was created in the 1980s when the technology used to identify drainage areas was less advanced. The new law includes $8 million over the next eight years for the DNR to update the inventory. Some farm groups are concerned the new law could expand legal protections to more waterways and create uncertainty for farmers. Public waters have more regulations, including restrictions on draining and filling, and requirements to maintain vegetative buffers. Pierce Bennett, public policy director for the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, called it “a pretty dramatic expansion” of what could be labeled public waters, leaving farmers “in a little bit of limbo.” “Our view is that this would allow for a lot of waters that aren’t currently under that inventory to just simply be put in,” Bennett said. “And that is concerning.” He said farmers shared their concerns about the bill with legislators throughout the session, and plan to work with state regulators to understand its impacts. “We need to have a greater understanding of what this might mean for the future,” Bennett said.",

The new law includes $8 million over the next eight years for the DNR to update the inventory. Some farm groups are concerned the new law could expand legal protections to more waterways and create uncertainty for farmers. Public waters have more regulations, including restrictions on draining and filling, and requirements to maintain vegetative buffers. Pierce Bennett, public policy director for the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, called it “a pretty dramatic expansion” of what could be labeled public waters, leaving farmers “in a little bit of limbo.” “Our view is that this would allow for a lot of waters that aren’t currently under that inventory to just simply be put in,” Bennett said. “And that is concerning.” ADVERTISEMENT He said farmers shared their concerns about the bill with legislators throughout the session, and plan to work with state regulators to understand its impacts. “We need to have a greater understanding of what this might mean for the future,” Bennett said. ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.
