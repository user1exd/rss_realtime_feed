The 35-year-old Hot Man actor got candid about his work stating how he “ruined” a take as he watched a rough cut for the first time. In his appearance on the Therapuss with Jake Shane podcast, Powell revealed he \"puked in the bushes\" after seeing his performance as the famous astronaut, John Glenn, in Hidden Figures , a 2016 historical drama. \"I remember watching Hidden Figures for the first time on the Fox lot ... and this was before all the effects were done, the music was in, the sound design ... and I literally left the movie and I puked in the bushes,\" Powell said on the podcast. Appreciating his movie stars, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, he continued, \"I was like, 'All these women put in these great performances,' and it's like, the legacy of these women. I was like, 'I literally ruined this movie.'\" Glen Powell how the rough cut took a toll, saying, \"It does get in your own head. People forget that when you're watching the rough cut of a movie, it's probably like watching the footage of yourself that you're having to edit, right? So you sit there and you're like, 'I hate myself.'\"",

        "content": "CUSTOMERS are reacting to self-checkout being removed in busy locations, leaving many to wait in long lines for exorbitant times. Target , which recently put in place a strict 10 items or less policy for self-checkout , has recently decided to pull the plug on that experience in one of its most populated locations in the country . Target in Emeryville, California - which serves a majority of the East Bay area , announced early this week that they were removing access to self-checkout altogether, citing a massive increase over the past few years in shoplifting . This is the only nearby Target, for many shoppers in the Oakland area, with the nearest locations being in Albany, Alameda, and Berkeley. Some shoppers, as expected, were not happy with the change and are worried that this will further impact their experience in the store. \"Target be like: we want the checkout experience to be 4 times longer,\" commented one user under the news on X, formerly Twitter. \"Still only gonna have 2 registers open at peak times,\" wrote another. \"We all know damn well there’s still gonna only be one single register open anyway,\" someone else complained . Although there are no official numbers available for this specific Target, the chain did report an overall increase of theft by 120% in the first half of 2023, compared to the same time a year prior. One customer commented that \"the honor system doesn’t work in Emeryville.\" But another user responded that he believes \"the honor system doesn't work in America, period.\" Another suggested that corporations like Target \"have lost their honor.\" \"Why should we be expected to maintain ours?,\" he asks in the post. One person joked that maybe if people keep stealing, it would actually create more available jobs in retail. But others disagreed. \"Nah,\" one replied , \"they’ll still have 2 people running registers while 30 people wait in line.\" Over the last two years, Target cut over 35,000 jobs , or almost 8% of its total national workforce, according to company records. This cut has resulted in a major downsizing in the number of available cashiers in any location Since this change, customers have been complaining all over social media about being forced to wait in long lines with even longer wait times, frustrating those who may only have a few items in the absence of self-checkout. The chain also announced this month that prices of over 5,000 everyday items would be lowered in the store. This decision has led many customers to speculate on social media that Target has been actively price gouging. \"Alternative headline: Target confesses to blatantly price gouging millions of consumers, no penalties expected,\" one viral post said . \"Target was price gouging you to hell while claiming inflation pressure and lost a s**t ton of customers,\" another post read. \"So they’ll return prices to normal and pretend they’re giving you a deal.\" Target has not responded to the U.S. Sun's request for comment.",

        "content": "The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, has urged members of the National Assembly not pass the Bill mandating the country to revert to the old National Anthem through legislative fiat. LEADERSHIP reports both chambers of the National Assembly had last week expeditiously pass a Bill for an Act to revert to the old Nigeria’s National Anthem – ‘Nigeria, We Hail Thee..’ But, Fagbemi warned that such an important Bill on the national anthem should not be done by legislative fiat. Speaking at the public hearing on the Bill organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters in Abuja on Monday, AGF Fagbemi warned that the issue of National Anthem should not be treated with legislative fiat without giving Nigerians a say. He said as commendable as the move by both chambers of the National Assembly may be, on enacting law on the National Anthem or replacing the current one with the old one, Nigerians must be carried along for their required “buy-in”. The AGF said: “In some cases, the national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration. “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions. “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone. “Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.” In his submission at the public hearing, the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, recommended that the scope should be expanded to include a robust issue on national identity rather than limiting it to mere change of national anthem. The Minister, who was represented by the Director-General of National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem being advocated by the lawmakers, do not make a complete meaning. “The issue of the national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not value national identity, of which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning it and imbibing it,” he said. Also cautioning the National Assembly on the expeditious passage of the Bill into law, renowned lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever National Anthem is proposed and buy into it. According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an Act for general acceptability. He, however, supported the move to replace the current “Arise O Compatriots” anthem with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee” version, which the country started with at independence in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current National Anthem adopted in 1978, does not have the required gravitas and is not inspirational to fire the passion and zeal for nationhood among Nigerians. Nigeria, according to him, will not be the first country in the world to replace its National Anthem with the old one as over 20 countries like Russia, Austria, Chile, France, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq etc, have done so at different times in the past. Other stakeholders in their submissions spoke in preference for the old National Anthem against the current one.",

He promised that when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of God would raise a standard against him. “Posting this testimony to encourage anyone out there who is going through a challenge. It might seem bigger than you, but greater is He that is in you than anything you will face in this world. “Grateful for my wife, family, friends, and Pastors for their love, prayers, and support.

        "content": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has signed a new five-year contract with the club after taking them into next season’s Champions League. The 52-year-old Spaniard has turned Villa around since arriving from Villarreal in October 2022 with the club sitting 17th in the Premier League. Emery led them to seventh place in his first season in charge and fourth in this campaign. “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club,” said Emery, whose existing deal still had another three years to run. “There’s a great chemistry in Aston Villa. And the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. “We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams,” he said. Emery also took Villa, the 1982 European Cup champions, to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League this season in their first European campaign for 13 years. The club’s Chairman Nassef Sawiris said, “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core, and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Aston Villa undoubtedly want to bolster their squad this summer after the superb achievement of reaching the Champions League – but the news that manager Unai Emery has agreed a new five-year contract means they have already captured the most vital signature of all. Emery extended his current deal until 2027 in April but this was always with the intention of a longer-term extension once the season finished. Villa have wasted no time in tying up their inspirational manager for the future. The Spaniard has overseen a stunning rejuvenation of Villa since succeeding the sacked Steven Gerrard in October 2022. Emery’s new contract is a sign of ambition from Villa’s owners but also an indication of the faith he has in them, in partnership with his long-time associate, Villa’s president of football operations Monchi. The fact that Emery has taken them into the Champions League was beyond fans’ most optimistic expectations this season. Emery has put Villa ahead of schedule but there will be no complaints as they mix with the Champions League big names for the first time. They will feel confident of making an impact under a manager with such pedigree in the European environment, one who already has four second-tier Europa League titles to his name. He has already assumed hero status at Villa Park and it will be a source of joy to everyone at the club that Emery has now signed up until 2029.",

        "content": "The management of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo town in Oyo State on Monday, declared a three-day mourning period with fasting and prayers over the death a student, Akor Alex who was killed by his colleagues on Friday. Alex, a 22-year-old 200-level Mechanical Engineering student was killed in the hostel by his colleagues for allegedly stealing a phone. The Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Professor Timothy Adebayo disclosed this while addressing journalists at the Council Chamber of the school in company of other principal officers of the faith-based university. “I sympathise with the family. We don’t pray for such to happen. We are sad over the development. The university has declared a three-way mourning starting from Wednesday to Friday, with fasting and prayer every night against a recurrence such as a sad incident. In those days, it is lecture-free to mourn the departed student,” Prof Adebayo said. The Vice-Chancellor also disclosed that he wept for two days over the incident. He said, ”As the vice chancellor, I wept throughout Sunday and Monday. Even while conveying the message to the staff, I wept. I didn’t know I would be able to address this press conference. Adebayo also disclosed that 16 persons were already in police custody over the incident. “Twelve students are in the police net over Ajayi Crowther varsity’s student killing. Eighteen (18) were initially apprehended but the Police screened them to 12, including a porter who was taken to Iyaganku Police Station, Ibadan,” he said. The deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Muyiwa Popoola, also confirmed the VC’s statement, saying: “We wept bitterly.” He also reiterated the university’s stance against cultism and bullying, saying: “We have learnt our lessons in a hard way. We have zero tolerance for bullying, and cultism. There is no cultism. We have worked in different schools, cultists need bushes to operate. “There is no sign of cultism and bullying here. There are no bushes here. Cultists need bushes to operate. We always ask our students not to stay alone and in obscure places. We rusticate anyone involved in bullying.” The VC further added that security had been beefed up to guide against a recurrence of the incident. He said, “We have a monitoring team that moves around. We have a security team. The Management moves round to check that things are in order to ensure that students comply with the mechanism put in place. “We will increase the number of security operatives and porters. We will keep on beefing up security in our hostels. We will work on every other aspect of observed inadequacies,” Prof. Adebayo said. He further assured that the Ajayi Crowther University is safe, saying, “We raise students with Godly characters. We are telling the parents now that their children are in safe hands here.”",

        "content": "In a significant move to enhance law enforcement in KwaZulu-Natal and Mthatha in the Eastern Cape , additional Public Order Policing (POP) units are being deployed to bolster existing crime combatting efforts. This initiative was highlighted during a send-off parade in Harrismith, where the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service (SAPS), General Fannie Masemola, addressed over 700 POP officers. Maintaining a safe and secure environment for the upcoming elections General Masemola emphasised the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment for the upcoming elections. He tasked the officers with preventing and combating criminal activities while ensuring that South Africans can exercise their right to vote in peace. “We are sending you off to maintain law and order. No disruptions and acts of criminality should take place under your watch. We are sending you out there to protect the constitutional right of South Africans and the integrity of the election process,” said General Masemola. Aim of the police deployment in these regions The deployment aims to enhance the capacity of the current law enforcement presence in these regions. This comes in response to recent tensions in Mthatha , where roadblocks have been a significant issue. General Masemola confirmed that police forces have been fully mobilised to address these challenges, and five individuals have been arrested for attempting to block roads leading to Mthatha Airport. Lieutenant General Tebello Mosikili, Co-chair of the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS), also participated in the send-off parade. She urged the officers to perform their duties within the legal framework, underscoring the importance of lawful conduct during these operations. Earlier reports indicated a tense situation in Mthatha, which caused several roads to be closed. At around 9:00, five suspects were arrested following an altercation where shots were fired at POP and Mthatha Vispol members. Two suspects were injured, and two firearms were confiscated. Authorities have opened cases of attempted murder and illegal possession of firearms for further investigation. According to Jacaranda FM , by Monday afternoon, Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said that he had asked President Cyril Ramaphosa to send the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to Mthatha to help maintain order and restore calm. Additionally, Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nomthetheleli Mene issued a stern warning against the circulation of videos and messages inciting unrest. “Such actions are not only irresponsible but also illegal. We will take strict action against anyone found to be engaging in activities that threaten the safety and security of the public and the integrity of the election process,” she stated.",

        "content": "In the run-up to the final adoption of Georgia’s “foreign agents” law, the United States prepared to on members of the Georgian Dream party responsible for promoting it and obstructing the country’s Euro-Atlantic integration. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department that it was introducing a new visa restriction policy against a wide range of Georgian officials and their family members, as well as those who participated in the use of violence against protesters on the streets of Tbilisi. The visa restrictions are only the first stage of sanctions pressure on sub-sanctioned persons, which is typically followed by freezing of assets in U.S. jurisdictions and restrictions on financial transactions. Each of these measures requires additional explanation, if only because some representatives of the Georgian Dream claim that and even ask to be in the “honorary register of patriots,” apparently believing that they will cause only minor harm to them and their families. In order to understand the effect of sanctions, it would be useful for the members of Georgian Dream to refer to the long experience of Russian individuals on the sanctions lists. This measure applies to property and property rights, including cash, securities, interests in companies and other property located in the U.S. jurisdiction. This means that a house, apartment, car, or business asset located in the U.S., as well as a current account, deposit, or bank card opened in a U.S. bank, may be subject to the freeze. For example, shortly after the U.K. froze the assets of Russian oligarch and billionaire Mikhail Fridman, he that he did not know how to pay for even small expenses, such as cleaning his house abroad. Another sanctioned Russian billionaire, Pyotr Aven, he did not understand how to survive because “everything we have built over 30 years is now completely destroyed.” The American jurisdiction has a much broader scope than the British one, so a person caught under the asset freeze can say goodbye to his financial assets and property located in Western countries, as well as forget about the possibility of building and developing any business there. This ban not only prevents the sanctioned person from entering the United States, but also results in the suspension of visas issued to family members, for example to study at a U.S. university. For example, if a visa ban is imposed on Irakli Garibashvili, the chairman of Georgian Dream, it is likely that he will not be able to visit his son who is studying at the University of Pennsylvania. Since this measure will also apply to his family members, it is likely that Garibashvili’s son will also be forced to suspend his studies there. It should be noted separately that if visas are banned for such Georgian Dream deputies as Aluda Gudushauri, Beka Odisharia or Irakli Chikovani, their US-born and US-citizen children will be directly affected by the very harsh US sanctions legislation, which provides for criminal liability for violations of the sanctions regime. The deputies themselves and their families will no longer be able to visit the United States, even for tourism. In the context of visa restrictions, it will be useful for Georgian Dream members to familiarize themselves with the experience of another Russian oligarch and billionaire, Oleg Deripaska. Although he was subject to US sanctions in 2018, he nevertheless to circumvent them in order to organize the birth of his two children on US territory, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. But the machinations were exposed, and Deripaska and his associates, including the arrested , were charged with conspiracy to evade sanctions, which carries up to 20 years in prison. It is noteworthy that in 2022, for violating or circumventing sanctions imposed on Russia. It is also worth recalling that last year the USA imposed on four high-ranking and their families, which became the first case of application of the sanctions mechanism in the history of Georgian-American relations. The measure was so painful for the ruling party that some members of Georgian Dream the U.S. decision and even categorically demanded that it be lifted. At the same time, the parliamentary majority, despite its confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Georgian judiciary, prevented the establishment of a temporary investigative commission to investigate corruption in the judiciary. This measure denies a sanctioned person access to a significant part of the international financial system. For example, he/she cannot use bank cards that use the U.S. payment systems Visa or Mastercard are blocked, and his/her ability to conduct banking and financial transactions in U.S. dollars is suspended. In addition, because Georgia does not have its own payment system, such as Russia’s MIR or China’s UnionPay, the sanctioned person will not be able to use Visa or Mastercard bank cards, even those issued by Georgian banks, and will face restrictions on accessing bank assets and conducting transactions in Georgia itself. The painfulness of this measure for the Georgian authorities can be judged by the scandalous story of the imposition of in September 2023 against the “Georgian-Russian oligarch”, citizen of Georgia and General of the country . Shortly after the sanctions were imposed against him, the National Bank of Georgia denied Partskhaladze access to accounts and banking operations in the country. The next day, however, the bank’s acting president, Natia Turnava, single-handedly her decision under the alleged pressure from the then-leader of Georgian Dream. Top managers who disagreed with the decision resigned from the bank, and major Georgian commercial banks refused to obey the decision and continued to comply with the sanctions regime. Partskhaladze, in turn, with the assistance of the Georgian Ministry of Justice, expedited the transfer of his Georgian assets (12 properties, including land, residential and commercial premises, and the family church) , after which the Ministry revoked his Georgian citizenship to reduce sanctions risks for Georgia. It is difficult to assess the financial cost of sanctions, as each case is different. One year after the sanctions were imposed, Deripaska his losses at $7.5 billion, while Fridman recently $15.8 billion for the freezing of his assets in Luxembourg. *** Being under US sanctions has another very important consequence: huge majority of Western countries, including EU countries, Canada, the UK, South Korea, Japan and a number of others, are traditionally US allies. So we can expect them to share data on the activities of sanctioned individuals in their countries with their U.S. counterparts, and possibly seek to add those individuals to their own sanctions lists. Cases of lifting sanctions are isolated, such as the case of banker Oleg Tinkov, who his Russian citizenship, and are possible only when sanctioned individuals clearly distance themselves from the ruling party and go through complicated court procedures. Nevertheless, Georgian Dream seems to have decided that it had calculated all these risks well, and faced with the dilemma of refusing to adopt the law on “foreign agents” and being placed on the U.S. sanctions lists, it chose the latter, hoping to retain its power at the cost of into authoritarianism and Russia’s orbit. However, judging by the of the leaders of Georgian Dream to the position of Georgia’s strategic partners – the EU and the U.S., their comments on the Venice Commission’s remarks and against the European Commissioner Varhely, and other similar actions, the ruling party is calculating its moves by no more than one step ahead.

        "content": "Delhi’s Tis Hazari Court on Monday dismissed the bail plea of Delhi Chief Minister’s aide Bibhav Kumar in connection with the alleged assault of Aam Aadmi Party MP Swati Maliwal. The court said that the investigation is at an initial stage and that the chances of influencing witnesses and tampering with evidence cannot be ruled out. Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sushil Anuj Tyagi said, “The investigation is still at the nascent stage and the apprehension of influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence cannot be ruled out. Keeping in view the allegations made against the applicant, at this stage, no ground for bail is made out.” “The allegations raised by the victim have to be taken on their face value and cannot be swiped away. The mere delay in registering the FIR would not have much impact on the case as the injuries are apparent in the MLC after four days. There seems to be no pre-meditation on the part of the victim as if it would have been so, then the FIR would have been registered on the same day,” ASJ Tyagi said in the order passed on May 27. The court while dismissing the bail plea noted that the victim is a sitting Member of Parliament from the Aam Aadmi Party and as per her allegations, she has been brutally beaten up at the CM’s house by the applicant. The applicant was present at the CM’s house even after his employment was terminated, the court further observed. The investigating agency has also reported that the applicant has formatted his mobile phone and has not provided the password for opening his mobile phone. The CCTV footage collected from the CM’s camp office is also stated to be blank, the court noted in the order. The judge said that it has come on record that the complainant was medically examined on May 16, 2024, at AIIMS Hospital. Her statement under section 164 CrPC was recorded by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. Her version as mentioned in the complaint finds corroboration from the MLC and her statement recorded under section 164 CrPC. The court stated that the applicant (Bibhav Kumar) was joined in the investigation, but as per the investigation officer, he did not cooperate in the investigation and was arrested to prevent him from tampering with crucial evidence. During the arguments, the counsel for the complainant argued that the victim is the sitting MP of the Aam Aadmi Party and earlier also, she has gone to meet the CM and she cannot be termed as a trespasser, rather it was the applicant/accused who was present in the CM office without any authority. It was further contended that no one reported the matter to the police from the CM office and it was the complainant who made the complaint to the police from the spot itself. It was also argued that the magnitude of the injuries was such that they were present even after four days when the medical examination was done. He contended that the complainant has an association with the CM since past nine years and she was brutally assaulted. She went to the police station but due to trauma, she did not lodge a complaint. It was further contended that the applicant made a complaint on May 17, 2024, at 3.34 pm through e-mail when the complainant had already reported the matter to the police. It was also contended that the complainant is receiving threats of death and rape through vulgar messages on social media. It was contended that the applicant is not simply a PA of CM but he is a very influential person with whom the complainant is apprehending danger. It is therefore prayed that bail cannot be granted to the applicant",

        "content": "T he Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and its allies, a group that produces 40% of the world’s crude, wants to keep oil prices high and stable. Lately they have certainly been stable, even if not that high. Despite the recent death of Iran’s president and the escalating war in Gaza, prices of Brent crude, the global benchmark, have stayed within $2 of $82 a barrel since the start of May. Part of the reason why OPEC is failing to keep prices high is because its members are failing to keep to their output targets. In March the group’s leaders and Russia extended production cuts, vowing a reduction of 2.2m barrels a day (b/d), or 2% of global supply, until the end of June, on top of 3.7m b/d of previously agreed cuts for 2024. Yet the cartel is now overproducing so much that its daily output in 2024 is little changed from the last quarter of 2023. This will create tensions when members get together to decide their strategy at OPEC ’s ministerial meeting on June 2nd. The mystery matters for global economic growth Politicians must act now to avert the worst Farewell to a financial mystery",

        "content": "The management of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo town in Oyo State on Monday, declared a three-day mourning period with fasting and prayers over the death a student, Akor Alex who was killed by his colleagues on Friday. Alex, a 22-year-old 200-level Mechanical Engineering student was killed in the hostel by his colleagues for allegedly stealing a phone. The Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Professor Timothy Adebayo disclosed this while addressing journalists at the Council Chamber of the school in company of other principal officers of the faith-based university. “I sympathise with the family. We don’t pray for such to happen. We are sad over the development. The university has declared a three-way mourning starting from Wednesday to Friday, with fasting and prayer every night against a recurrence such as a sad incident. In those days, it is lecture-free to mourn the departed student,” Prof Adebayo said. The Vice-Chancellor also disclosed that he wept for two days over the incident. He said, ”As the vice chancellor, I wept throughout Sunday and Monday. Even while conveying the message to the staff, I wept. I didn’t know I would be able to address this press conference. Adebayo also disclosed that 16 persons were already in police custody over the incident. “Twelve students are in the police net over Ajayi Crowther varsity’s student killing. Eighteen (18) were initially apprehended but the Police screened them to 12, including a porter who was taken to Iyaganku Police Station, Ibadan,” he said. The deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Muyiwa Popoola, also confirmed the VC’s statement, saying: “We wept bitterly.” He also reiterated the university’s stance against cultism and bullying, saying: “We have learnt our lessons in a hard way. We have zero tolerance for bullying, and cultism. There is no cultism. We have worked in different schools, cultists need bushes to operate. “There is no sign of cultism and bullying here. There are no bushes here. Cultists need bushes to operate. We always ask our students not to stay alone and in obscure places. We rusticate anyone involved in bullying.” The VC further added that security had been beefed up to guide against a recurrence of the incident. He said, “We have a monitoring team that moves around. We have a security team. The Management moves round to check that things are in order to ensure that students comply with the mechanism put in place. “We will increase the number of security operatives and porters. We will keep on beefing up security in our hostels. We will work on every other aspect of observed inadequacies,” Prof. Adebayo said. He further assured that the Ajayi Crowther University is safe, saying, “We raise students with Godly characters. We are telling the parents now that their children are in safe hands here.”",

        "content": "(CNS): A Caymanian woman who worked for a floor covering company has admitted stealing $42,000 from her former employer, Randolph Stanford, using over a dozen forged cheques between November 2021 and March 2022. Samantha Angella McLaughlin has pleaded guilty to 16 charges of theft and forgery and has been bailed until an expected sentencing hearing in July. McLaughlin appeared in Grand Court on Friday and admitted a long list of charges. The crown had accepted a dispute over one cheque she allegedly forged, which reduced the original amount of the theft from $49,000 to $42,000. The court ordered a social inquiry report, and McLaughlin was bailed to appear for her sentencing hearing on 26 July.",

        "description": "At UCLA, Walton was a three-time National Player of the Year. In the NBA, he won the MVP in the 1977-78 season, and was a two-time champion.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. This story will be updated.",

(AP Photo/Michael Owen Baker) JUSTICEPHOTO.COM Bill Walton at ROTH Conference Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice.

With his future at the club beyond June 2025 now uncertain, have reported that the Citizens have earmarked Girona boss Michel as the man to replace their current manager. It has been suggested that the Sky Blues' hierarchy admire the LALIGA coach's tactical prowess, as well as his ability to nurture young talent. It is believed they feel those characteristics are key to helping the club maintain what Guardiola has already put in place. Michel took over at Girona in 2021, and guided them to promotion from the Spanish second tier in his first season. The following campaign, the side finished 10th in LALIGA with 49 points. Most recently, in the 2023/24 season, he led them to a third-place finish with 81 points, four behind Barcelona and 14 behind eventual league winners Real Madrid. While the 48-year-old has reportedly caught the eye of those at the Etihad, there are other candidates who have been shortlisted as potential Guardiola replacements, with the list believed to also include former Brighton & Hove Albion boss Roberto De Zerbi, Germany's Julian Nagelsmann, and Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso.",

        "content": "The RAF has grounded a fleet of Spitfire planes after the death of a pilot over the weekend, raising the prospect of the legendary aircraft being absent from the 80th anniversary of the D-day landings next month. Sqn Ldr Mark Long – a Typhoon pilot based at RAF Coningsby – was killed in a crash while flying a Spitfire belonging to the Battle of Britain Memorial Fleet as part of a memorial event. He had been a pilot with the BBMF for the last four years and had been due to take over the event next year. “Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight,” an RAF spokesperson said. The air force announcement raises questions about the legendary single-seat fighter aircraft’s participation in the D-day celebrations. They were due to take part in a national commemorative event in Portsmouth on 5 June to mark 80 years since Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy in northern France, turning the tide of the second world war away from Nazi Germany. It is not known when the RAF’s investigation will be complete or when a decision will be made on whether the vintage planes will fly again. King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales will join world leaders – including Joe Biden, the US president, Emmanual Macron, the French president, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor – in Normandy for the memorial celebrations. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The BBMF is a collection of wartime fighter and bomber aircraft that take part in air shows and memorial displays. A few dozen airworthy Spitfires remain, including six based at RAF Coningsby. Paying tribute to Long, Gp Capt Robbie Lees, commander of the Display Air Wing, said on Sunday: “It is with great sorrow that I must confirm the death of Sqn Ldr Mark Long. “Mark was a Typhoon pilot here at RAF Coningsby and for the last four years he has been a pilot with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. A great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator, he will be sorely missed by all who knew him.” “An investigation into the cause of this tragic event has now begun.” The Prince and Princess of Wales led tributes to Long, writing on social media: “Our thoughts ... are with the pilot’s loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread by Laurence Tognetti, Universe Today How can sunlight reflecting off SpaceX's Starlink satellites interfere with ground-based operations? This is what a study recently posted to the arXiv preprint server hopes to address as a pair of researchers investigate how Starlink satellites appear brighter—which the researchers also refer to as flaring—to observers on Earth when the sun is at certain angles, along with discussing past incidents of how this brightness has influenced aerial operations on Earth. This study holds the potential to help spacecraft manufacturers design and develop specific methods to prevent increased brightness levels, which would help alleviate confusion for observers on Earth regarding the source of the brightness and the objects in question. Here, Universe Today discusses this research with Anthony Mallama of the IAU—Center for the Protection of Dark and Quiet Skies from Satellite Constellation Interference regarding the motivation behind the study, significant results, potential follow-up studies, importance of studying Starlink satellite brightness, and implications for managing satellite constellations in the future. So, what was the motivation behind this study? \"I study the brightness of Starlink satellites under all circumstances,\" Mallama tells Universe Today. \"That includes their operational phase at 550 km [342 mi] altitude, when they are rising from the initial orbit around 300 km [186 mi] to operation height, ordinary flares which occur frequently but have small amplitudes and these extreme flares.\" For the study, the researchers conducted a geometrical analysis of the brightness of Starlink satellites based on the sun's location and angle in the sky. This comes despite SpaceX taking steps to mitigate reflectivity off Starlink satellites, which only decreases reflectivity when the satellites are directly overhead. The study also discussed how reflectivity from Starlink satellites has affected aerial operations, specifically with commercial airline pilots. What were the most significant results from this study? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"This study demonstrated that Starlinks can be exceedingly bright under certain conditions. In one instance they were reported as Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) by pilots on two commercial aircraft.\" Regarding potential follow-up studies, Mallama tells Universe Today, \"I am characterizing the brightness of other satellite constellations including Amazon's Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile's BlueWalker/BlueBirds and Planet's Pelicans.\" The study mentions how the UAP incidents occurred in 2022 and was recently discussed in Buettner et al (2024) with the pilots' reporting brightness magnitudes (also called stellar magnitude or apparent magnitude) of -4 to -5. For context, a stellar magnitude of -5 is equivalent to the planet Venus at its brightest, which is known for being observed before sunrise or after sunset periodically throughout the year. The apparent magnitude scale ranges from -30 to 30 with higher numbers corresponding to decreasing brightness. Buettner et al (2024) was recently presented at the 4th IAA Conference on Space Situational Awareness ( ICSSA ). That paper discussed how the incident occurred on August 10, 2022, and was observed by five pilots aboard two separate commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean, which resulted in two photographs obtained by the pilot's cell phones. After analyzing a series of simulations and additional data, the researchers determined these UAPs were Starlink satellites launched earlier that day, which were designated as Starlink Group 4-26. Given this incident, what is the importance of studying Starlink brightness/flaring? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"The importance of studying Starlink brightness is that the satellites interfere with astronomical research if they are brighter than magnitude 7. Furthermore, casual sky watchers, such as amateur astronomers and naturalists, are distracted by those brighter than magnitude 6 because they are visible to the unaided eye.\" This study comes as SpaceX's Starlink constellation continues to grow on a regular basis, with the number of current Starlink satellites in orbit having reached more than 5,600 with almost 6,000 having been launched by SpaceX as of this writing. As noted by both the study and Mallama, sunlight reflectivity off Starlink satellites causes issues with both aerial operations on Earth and astronomical observing, with Mallama also conducting research on satellite constellation brightness for Amazon, AST SpaceMobile, and Planet Labs. Therefore, with the number of satellites in orbit rapidly increasing due to constellations, what implications could this study have on managing satellite constellations in the future? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"One approach to reducing satellite brightness is to reflect sunlight into space rather than allowing it to scatter diffusively toward observers on the ground. That works very well most of the time. However, there are certain sun-satellite-observer geometries where it fails and observers see a mirror-like reflection of the sun.\" Mallam published a 2023 article with Sky & Telescope discussing how SpaceX's second-generation of Starlink satellites are fainter than their predecessors. Mallama credits his co-author, Richard Cole, as playing a \"crucial role\" in this study, noting how Cole \"predicted the extreme flares based on his numerical model of Starlink satellite brightness.\" How will sunlight reflectivity off Starlink satellites influence ground operations in the coming years and decades, and what steps can be taken to mitigate this activity? Only time will tell. More information: Anthony Mallama et al, Extreme Flaring of Starlink Satellites, arXiv (2024).

        "content": "MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as ''vital'' in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has ''its own large reserves of uranium.'' Putin, in turn, vowed to ''do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan's (nuclear energy) market.'' If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia's influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China, where he expressed appreciation for China's proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin's ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",

After marking an emphatic victory over the Pat Cummins-led SRH, KKR became the second-most successful franchise in the history of the IPL by clinching their third-ever title. During an interaction with the KKR media team, Russell was asked the viral question back from his Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) side, Duronto Dhaka's triumph in the 2023 season -\" Final match your perform what happening?\". The video became an instant hit amongst cricket fans around the world in no time. In a video uploaded by KKR's social media handles, the side's media personnel went around the team's stars like Sunil Narine and Russel about their experience of winning the IPL 2024 title. At the end of the video, the two were asked the viral question, which left them comically surprised. In the video from BPL 2023, Russell was left troubled about understanding the question from the interviewer, and that ultimately went on to become a widely used meme all over social media.

However, this was a first IPL final for the 36-year-old, after having missed out on the IPL 2014 final for his side due to an injury. In their IPL 2024 campaign, Russell has often played a pivotal role with both the bat and the ball for KKR and helping them clinch the title. A post shared by Kolkata Knight Riders (@kkriders) A post shared by IPL (@iplt20) Batting usually at number 6 or 7 for KKR, Russell showcased his trademark explosiveness with the bat and scored 222 runs in his 15 appearances throughout IPL 2024. With the ball, Russell had a brilliant season which saw him pick 19 wickets across the season.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

The extension will consist of three new classrooms to provide a special class for children with special needs, two special education rooms for one-to-one teaching or group working and three general classrooms. Welcoming the announcement from the Department of Education, Donegal minister, Charlie McConalogue said: “This is great news for the Twin Towns, and for the staff, students and parents of Finn Valley College. “I’d like to acknowledge the efforts of Minister Norma Foley in relation to getting the extension to construction stage and thank Cllr Patrick McGowan for his ongoing work with this project.” Minister McConalogue also welcomed confirmation from the Department of Education that it has granted approval for the reconfiguration of an existing classroom to be used as a science lab and prep area at Crana College in Buncrana to go to tender. “Cllr Rena Donaghy and local election candidate, Fionán Bradley have been to the fore in helping advance this application. “They are also giving strong support towards the delivery of the three-school campus at Crana College,” the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine added.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. ''Bill Walton,'' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, ''was truly one of a kind.'' Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. ''One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,'' Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: ''Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. ''It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. ''As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.'' Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. ''In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,'' Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. ''Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.'' The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a ''Deadhead.'' And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the ''Conference of Champions'' and loved it all the way to the end. ''It doesn't get any better than this,'' he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. ''What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,'' Silver said. ''He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.'' Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "FURTHER CUTS TO interest rates and energy prices are on the cards, according to Finance Minister Michael McGrath. Speaking to reporters at the National Economic Dialogue in Dublin Castle today, the minister said Ireland’s inflation rate is one of the lowest in the Euro area, running at around 2%. “We are likely to be at a turning point in the interest rate cycle. We expect further energy price reductions to be passed through the wholesale level to the retail level. We will see an improvement in living standards for many people. “The vast majority of households in Ireland will see gains in real terms across 2024. So that’s very positive,” he said. His comments come as the chief economist of the European Central Bank Philip Lane has indicated that the ECB should be in a position to begin cutting interest rates from next week. McGrath said there is still a need to be careful in the decisions government makes over the next year, due to the “deep uncertainty” surrounding geopolitical tensions. Speaking about the budget this year, the minister said there will be measures to support households with the cost of living. He said there will be a social welfare package and income tax cuts. He said there should be a move away from one-off cost-of-living measures, given the fall in inflation, and a move towards permanent measures and permanent changes to taxation frameworks. While there has been speculation of the budget being brought forward, perhaps in time for an autumn election, McGrath said today that the budget will be at normal time in October. The minister said in the coming weeks he will bring a memorandum to the government to confirm the date of the budget, stating: “There are no plans to change the budget date from normal periods.”",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 In recent years, the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) market has emerged as a pivotal segment of the global travel and tourism industry. Two major events propelling this growth in China and the Middle East are the Riyadh Travel Fair (RTF) and ITB China. These events have become essential platforms for fostering business connections, showcasing destinations, and promoting the expansion of the MICE sector. Riyadh Travel Fair: Gateway to Middle East’s MICE Market The Riyadh Travel Fair, held annually in Saudi Arabia’s capital, has grown into one of the most significant travel and tourism events in the Middle East. The fair attracts thousands of visitors and exhibitors from across the globe, providing a comprehensive platform for the travel trade industry. For the MICE market, Riyadh Travel Fair offers unparalleled opportunities for networking, business development, and knowledge exchange. RTF’s significance lies in its ability to bring together stakeholders from various segments of the travel industry, including airlines, hospitality groups, travel agencies, and tourism boards. The fair’s focus on the MICE sector is evident through its dedicated pavilions and sessions that address the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in event management and corporate travel. One of the key aspects of Riyadh Travel Fair is its emphasis on showcasing Saudi Arabia as a prime MICE destination. The Saudi Arabian Kingdom’s Vision 2030 initiative aims to diversify its economy by boosting tourism, and RTF plays a crucial role in this endeavor. By highlighting state-of-the-art convention centers, luxury hotels, and unique cultural experiences, Riyadh Travel Fair positions Saudi Arabia as a competitive choice for international conferences and exhibitions. ITB China: A Catalyst for China’s MICE Industry ITB China, held annually in Shanghai, is a leading travel trade fair dedicated to the Chinese travel market. It serves as a vital hub for international and domestic exhibitors to connect with Chinese buyers and establish fruitful partnerships. The event’s focus on the MICE sector is particularly noteworthy, as it provides a platform for stakeholders to explore new business opportunities and trends. China’s MICE market has experienced significant growth, driven by the country’s robust economic development and increasing demand for business travel. ITB China capitalizes on this trend by offering a comprehensive program that includes business matchmaking, educational forums, and networking events. These elements are designed to facilitate connections between Chinese and international MICE professionals, fostering collaboration and innovation. One of the standout features of ITB China is its Hosted Buyer Program, which brings high-caliber buyers from around the world to meet with exhibitors. This program ensures that participants have access to decision-makers and influencers in the MICE industry, enhancing the potential for successful business outcomes. Additionally, ITB China’s focus on technology and innovation provides attendees with insights into the latest tools and solutions for optimizing event management and enhancing attendee experiences. Synergizing Growth and Innovation Both the Riyadh Travel Fair and ITB China are instrumental in driving the growth of the MICE market in their respective regions. By providing platforms for networking, knowledge exchange, and business development, these events contribute to the expansion and diversification of the travel trade industry. In the Middle East, RTF supports Saudi Arabia’s vision of becoming a leading MICE destination, attracting international events and boosting tourism. Meanwhile, ITB China plays a crucial role in connecting Chinese MICE professionals with global partners, fostering innovation and growth in the sector. As the MICE market continues to evolve, the collaborative efforts and insights gained from events like RTF and ITB China will be essential in shaping the future of business travel and tourism in the Middle East and China.",

        "content": "The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) in partnership with the Kwara State government, on Monday, flagged off the introduction of free Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine against cervical cancer among school children in the state. At the rollout of the HPV vaccine in Ilorin, the state capital, the executive director and chief executive officer of the NPHCDA, Dr. Muyi Aina, said that cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally and the second most common cancer affecting women in Nigeria. A total of 787 school children were vaccinated at the event. Aina, who was represented by Sheu Hassan, said that the HPV vaccine is a very important vaccine, adding that, “it prevents the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and causes more than 95 per cent of cases of cervical cancer.” He said that all eligible girls between the ages of 9-14 years across 193 wards in the 16 local government areas of Kwara State will be vaccinated against cervical cancer during the five-day programme. “I believe that together, we will achieve the goal of this exercise. At least 80% eligible girls aged 9 to 14 years will be reached during the five days intensification, after which the HPV vaccines will be accessed by our girls through routine immunization services in our PHC facilities. “Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally and the second most common cancer affecting women in Nigeria. It is estimated that 604,000 cases with 342,000 deaths occurred globally in 2020, and an estimated 12,075 cases and 7,968 deaths were recorded in Nigeria,” he stated. The NPHCDA boss, who said that the HPV vaccine was free, safe, and effective, urged stakeholders to mobilise family members, friends, and communities to ensure that all eligible girls get vaccinated. “Let me thank and appreciate the Kwara State Government for its support in strengthening PHC in the state. I want to specially thank Her Excellency Professor Olufolake AbdulRazaq for her role in the fight against cervical cancer. “HPV vaccines with corresponding devices and operational funds have been provided to the states to support this exercise. I must thank his Excellency, the governor of Kwara state, for his regular release of counterparts’ funds to support PHC activities, including the HPV introduction. “Your support, that of the Governors Wives forum, wives of LGA chairmen, traditional/religious leaders, Civil Society Organizations, Women groups, media, and other relevant stakeholders remain paramount to the success of the HPVV introduction and other PHC activities. “The NPHCDA remains committed to collaborating with the sub-national levels to strengthen routine immunization and other PHC services for better health for all,” Aina added. In her remarks, the wife of the Kwara State governor, Ambassador Olufolake AbdulRazaq, assured of the efficacy of the vaccine, while she charged stakeholders to dispel negative rumours and misconception against the HPV vaccines. “Today’s event set the tone for an ambitious, inclusive strategy to accelerate eliminating cervical cancer as a public health concern. Elimination is within the reach of all hence we in Kwara are committed to towing this path to ensure that we seize the opportunities that are within our reach now, so that our girls will live free of this disease. “In complementing the efforts that culminated in incorporating the HPV vaccine into the National routine immunization schedule and today’s roll out however, I urge key stakeholders in respective communities to continue to amplify awareness and sensitization on benefits of presenting eligible children for the vaccine. “This no doubt will entail engagements with our communities, traditional and religious institutions to educate, inform, and dispel any misconceptions surrounding the HPV vaccine,” the Kwara State First Lady added.",

Kansas Highway Patrol reports the crash occurred at 1:50 p.m., a quarter of a mile east of 182nd Street and Homer Road. A 2002 Ford F250 driven by Ryan Knight Pickens, 22, of Garden City, was traveling east on Homer Road. Once past 182nd St., the driver lost control of the pickup due to speed. It entered the ditch and rolled. Pickens was taken to Russell Regional Hospital with a suspected minor injury. Passenger Tabatha Lynn Yakubovich, 38, also of Garden City, mentioned pain but was not transported by ambulance. Both were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash.

        "content": "The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State in the 2023 election, Chief Timipre Sylva has expressed dissatisfaction with Monday’s Bayelsa Governorship Election Tribunal judgment and expressed his readiness to appeal the ruling. A statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Affairs, Julius Bokoru, said the Minister of State for Petroleum under former President Muhammadu Buhari immediately held a meeting with elders and stakeholders of the party after the judgement. Rising from the meeting, the former Governor of Bayelsa directed his legal team to immediately seek justice at the Court of Appeal. Prior to the judgement, Sylva had accused the tribunal of bias following alleged several infractions observed by his lawyers during the hearing of the case. He subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal demanding the dissolution of the panel and reconstitution of a new one. Sylva said, “We are not satisfied with the decision of the tribunal. But this is just a court of first instance and after meeting with the elders and critical stakeholders of our great party, the APC, we directed our legal team to seek justice for Bayelsa at the Supreme Court.” The governorship candidate assured the people of Bayelsa that the Court of Appeal would surely correct the travesty perpetrated by the tribunal. He declared that the liberation of Bayelsa was close and that “justice was inevitable for the traumatised people of the state,” appealing to them to remain positive, law-abiding and steadfast.",

        "content": "A NORTH Korean rocket carrying its second spy satellite reportedly exploded midair today in a dramatic setback for Kim Jong-un. Footage showed a red, orange and yellow fireball in the night sky soon after the launch that was strongly condemned by the pariah state's neighbours. North Korea's official state news agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket from its main space centre tonight. But it added that the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. Japanese TV broadcast apparent footage of a missile exploding showing a huge fiery ball lighting up the sky. Earlier today, residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa were urged to take shelter inside buildings or underground premises as part of a missile alert. The public alerts were withdrawn after it became clear the rocket would not fly over the islands. North Korea had informed its neighbour of an imminent launch of a satellite rocket during a launch window from Monday through June 3. There was a warning of caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon. North Korea had been strongly urged to abandon the launch, which had been predicted by South Korea. South Korea's military later said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite at 10:44pm local time. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said. The UN bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. However, North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Last November, Kim sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to deal with what he calls US-led military threats. AFTER launching its first successful spy satellite in November, Kim Jong-un declared it a \"new era of space power The November launch drew new sanctions from the US and its allies over fears the satellites are a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. Western powers have slammed North Korea's satellite tests as a violation of the UN's Security Council resolutions, which prohibit the development of North Korea's missile programmes. The UN's ruling - passed with Russia's support - also bans any scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea in nuclear science and technology and aerospace. However, Kim has been hellbent on flaunting the rules and pursuing his space programme in a bid to counter what he calls Western military threats. How could the spy satellites be used? In February, US space experts said North Korea's first spy satellite, dubbed the Malligyong-1, was \"alive\" although its capabilities remain unknown. The satellites will likely be unable to provide the North with detailed intelligence but could be useful for spying on things such as troop movements, analysts say. However, North Korea is believed to be developing a larger rocket to launch a more capable satellite. Is Russia helping? After the success of the November launch - after two failed attempts - South Korea said Kim may have overcome technical hurdles with the help of Russia. Russia in September publicly pledged to help Pyongyang build satellites. Many experts expressed doubts, however, that Moscow could have provided game-changing assistance in such a short time. Afterwards, Kim revealed would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two embarrassing failed liftoffs . In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor US and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. Monday's launch came hours after the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It's highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative military action when China - its major ally and economic pipeline - is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region.",

        "content": "In preparation for the next phase of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, former Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has named his Benin Republic team to face Super Eagles, PRIMANEWS Sports Extra reports. Nigeria face South Africa on June 7 at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo before heading to Abidjan’s Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny three days later for a date with Rohr’s Benin Republic. The Eagles and the Squirrels are in Group C of the World Cup qualifiers and are set to face each other next month. Since taking over the Benin job in February 2023, Rohr has played 10 games, winning just one, drawing four, and losing five. He will however hope to turn the fortune of the team around when he faces his former team and to do that the Franco-German has named his 25-man squad. In the squad are 19 professionals playing at various clubs in Europe and six home-based players drawn from the local league. Nigeria have drawn their first two matches in the series against Zimbabwe and Lesotho, positioning them in third place, trailing behind the leaders Rwanda with four points and South Africa with three points. Acknowledging the qualities of the Eagles squad, Rohr said, “They are only two points behind the group leaders (Rwanda), and that is an advantage they can overturn in the next round. We cannot rule out a team with the quality of the Nigerian team. Every team in the group knows it.” The Eagles last qualified for the global football tournament in Russia in 2018 after they missed out on Qatar 2022 following a play-off defeat to eternal rivals Ghana. The squirrels are expected to leave Cotonou for Abidjan on Monday and train on the same pitch where they will face the Super Eagles. During his time in charge of the Eagles, which spanned five years, Rohr led the team through a total of 64 matches. He guided the Eagles to 35 victories, suffered 13 losses, and endured 16 drawn games. One of the highlight of his time in charge of the Eagles was a third-place finish at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA 's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "description": "Health authorities are working to gather information on the spread of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, in U.S. dairy cows—the first confirmation of the virus in cattle.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Carol Clark, Emory University Health authorities are working to gather information on the spread of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, in U.S. dairy cows—the first confirmation of the virus in cattle. \"We have moved into new territory,\" says Thomas Gillespie, professor and chair of Emory University's Department of Environmental Sciences. The dairy cow infections are simply the latest twist in a global pattern: since 2022, bird flu has been infecting a wide variety of mammals. \"You can find this trend around the world, almost anywhere you look,\" Gillespie says. \"This virus has an extremely broad range of hosts that it is able to infect.\" Gillespie is a disease ecologist, studying how pathogens jump across species in the environment. He is a leader in the \"One Health\" approach—considering the deep connections between the health of people, domesticated animals, wildlife and ecosystems—to build pandemic control and prevention. The avian influenza cases in cows have been mild. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed two human cases connected to the outbreak—one in Texas and one in Michigan. Both cases were mild and involved people who worked on a dairy farm. The pasteurization process kills the H5N1 virus, and the CDC describes the current risk to the general public as \"low.\" The H5N1 virus is known as avian influenza, or bird flu, because birds are its natural reservoir. Wild, migrating birds can spread H5N1 globally. The current version has been circulating since 2020 and has infected a greater diversity of bird species than past lineages. The virus has been reported in birds in the United States since 2022. Poultry producers have culled millions of their animals to try to control the spread of the virus. It has long been known that mammals can become infected with H5N1 when they eat infected birds or are exposed to environments contaminated with the virus. What is unprecedented is the current scale and variety of mammals that have been infected. \"Most of these are likely dead-end cases, where a predator eats an infected bird and gets sick but doesn't spread the virus,\" Gillespie says. He adds, however, that recent die-offs of thousands of elephant seals, sea lions and fur seals in South America caused by bird flu raises concerns about the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission. \"Not enough surveillance is done in wildlife to know for sure how the virus is spreading,\" he says. H5N1 has also been reported in foxes, otters, lynx, polecats and badgers in Europe and in raccoon dogs and foxes in Japan. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recorded detections of H5N1 in 200 mammals in the United States since 2022, including a bottlenose dolphin , foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, coyotes, skunks, harbor and gray seals, opossums, squirrels, minks, otters and black and brown bears. Last December, a polar bear on Alaska's North Slope became the first of its species known to die of avian influenza. In 2023, the virus was also been detected for the first time in the Antarctic region—in birds, elephant seals and fur seals—raising fears for the health of the fragile ecosystem. \"Some of the species that are at risk for bird flu are already battling the stressors of climate change and loss of habitat,\" Gillespie says. And each time H5N1 infects a new animal host, it gives the virus a chance to mix with other flu strains and rearrange its genetic material. Accumulating such mutations can change the virus in ways that make it more easily transmissible and more deadly—including to humans. Pigs' immune systems share similarities with humans, making swine especially efficient mixing bowls for viruses that can affect humans. Gillespie cites deforestation and industrialized animal production as major drivers for the risk of pandemics as well as climate change. Forests in tropical regions are rapidly degrading due to cattle ranching and the clearing of land for agricultural crops such as soybeans—which are mainly used as feed for chickens and pigs on industrial farms. \"The resulting cheap meat that we buy does not reflect the true costs to the ecosystems that sustain us,\" Gillespie says. \"If we want to live sustainably, we need to cut down on the amount of animal products that we consume. That will be a win-win for human health and for planetary health.\" Provided by Emory University",

That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "content": "Travelers move through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport ahead of Memorial Day on Friday in Atlanta. Mike Stewart/Associated Press ATLANTA — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the Transportation Security Agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airline crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer. AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday – 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost.

        "content": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered hundreds of new worlds, with TESS planet candidates now outnumbering the total number of confirmed planets from Kepler. Owing to differences in survey design, TESS continues to provide planets that are better suited for subsequent follow-up studies, including mass measurement through radial velocity (RV) observations, compared to Kepler targets. In this work, we present the TESS-Keck Survey’s (TKS) Mass Catalog: a uniform analysis of all TKS RV survey data which has resulted in mass constraints for 126 planets and candidate signals. This includes 58 mass measurements that have reached ≥5σ precision. We confirm or validate 32 new planets from the TESS mission either by significant mass measurement (15) or statistical validation (17), and we find no evidence of likely false positives among our entire sample. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished TKS survey data, including 9,204 RV measurements and associated activity indicators over our three year survey. We took the opportunity to assess the performance of our survey, and found that we achieved many of our goals including measuring the mass of 38 small (<4R⊕) planets, nearly achieving the TESS mission’s basic science requirement. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the Automated Planet Finder (APF) as survey support and observed meaningful constraints on system parameters due to its more uniform phase coverage. Finally, we compared our measured masses to those predicted by commonly used mass-radius relations and investigated evidence of systematic bias. Alex S. Polanski, Jack Lubin, Corey beard, Jospeh M.

        "content": "Ellie Leach has named her 'dream' contestant for Strictly Come Dancing, nearly six months on from her own win on the show and after a wealth of rumours on who will be on the line-up this year. Not long after her exit from ITV soap Coronation Street, Ellie took to the Strictly dancefloor for the first time in September and her partnership with pro dancer Vito Coppola quickly made the couple a force to be reckoned with, as the scores just got better and better in the run up to the BBC final. And, while things didn't quite go plan for them in the finale, with a lift going wrong right at the end of their Show Dance, Ellie and Vito ended up as champions, topping the public vote when it mattered most. A month after their victory in the ballroom, Ellie and Vito joined many of their co-stars on the Strictly live tour and, now Ellie is taking on a very different role on stages across the country, as she joins the cast of Cluedo 2 , as Miss Scarlet. And, as the production arrives in Newcastle for a run at the Theatre Royal , Ellie has backed one of the most rumoured stars this time round to follow in her footsteps and do Strictly.

Speaking to ChronicleLive, she said: \"Hannah Waddingham would be amazing. And I'd just say to anyone who does end up doing Strictly this year to enjoy every second of being on the show and the whole experience. It completely changed my life!\"",

        "content": "As cyclone ‘Remal’ over Coastal Bangladesh and adjoining Coastal West Bengal moved nearly northwards, with a speed of 15 kmph during past 06 hours, Kolkata Police said that many areas of the city have been hard-hit by the severe cyclonic storm. Taking to X, Kolkata police shared, “Many areas of the city have been hard-hit by Cyclone Remal. Our Disaster Management Group personnel and personnel of different police stations have been making efforts all night to remove numerous trees uprooted in the storm to keep traffic moving.” Trees were uprooted in many parts of Kolkata. The city witnessed downpour with severe waterlogging following the landfall on Sunday over the adjacent coasts of West Bengal and Bangladesh between Sagar Island and Khepupara, near the southwest of Mongla in the neighbouring country. Heavy rain and gusty winds lashed several parts of West Bengal on Monday. The severe cyclonic storm ‘Remal’ has weakened since making landfall last night and is expected to downgrade into a deep depression by this evening, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) announced on Monday. The NDRF made the announcement based on the latest update from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). “The current information that we have from the IMD is that the severe cyclonic storm has now transformed into a cyclonic storm. The wind speed, which was earlier about 110 to 120 km/hr during landfall, now has come down to 60 to 70 km/hr,” NDRF Deputy Inspector General Mohsen Shahedi told ANI when asked about the status of ‘Remal’ after its landfall. Pointing out the downfall in the intensity of the cyclone, Shahedi said “This is a big relief and it is expected that by evening today, this will further change into a deep depression.” Questioned about the loss of lives and damage to properties due to the cyclone, the NDRF officer said: “From the information that we have, one death has taken place in Kolkata due to wall collapse. Restoration work is in progress. NDRF teams are deployed, 14 teams are deployed in major affected areas in the state and six SDRF teams are also deployed to assist... Apart from 14 teams in West Bengal, we have one team in Tripura just as a precautionary measure.” (ANI)",

        "content": "First, it was Toys “R” Us. Then, Bed Bath & Beyond. Now, perhaps the most personally painful demise of a legendary franchise that helped to shape my psyche (and my penchant for complimentary appetizers), our local Red Lobster, along with over 90 other locations nationwide, recently bit the dust, or the biscuit – as it were. I guess we all saw it coming in the carnage of crippled restaurant chains that COVID-19 left in its wake. Red Lobster was never quite the same haven of succulent, mass-produced seafood after the pandemic. In particular, they inexplicably excised their scrumptious seafood gumbo from the menu – one of the main reasons I loved the place, and the only reason my eldest and most expensive daughter ever wanted to go. Granted, the carpet was dingy, the nautical decor was corny, and the lobster tanks invoked a sort of morbid fascination that made us all wish they’d take those rubber bands off the lobsters’ claws and let them have a battle royale to entertain us while we waited seemingly forever for our table. But still we went, if for no other reason than those indescribably delicious Cheddar Bay Biscuits, the presentation of which by our server invoked a kind of joy comparable only to the delivery of one’s firstborn child. Well, maybe not that much joy . . . but almost. Speaking of joy, in the late summer after my senior year of high school, when I had finally learned to apply the perfect combination of Right Guard deodorant and Calvin Klein Obsession for Men cologne, I took my future wife to Red Lobster one Sunday after church for our first real date. For an eighteen-year-old aspiring stud-muffin on a city-pool-lifeguard salary, Red Lobster was a big deal, and I thought she’d be especially impressed by the big brass lobster claw door handles. I know I was. It was there, gazing at each other across elegant entrees of fries and popcorn shrimp, that we found true love among the crustaceans. After we had children, we began a tradition of visiting Red Lobster after the evening Christmas Eve service at church since it was usually one of the very few restaurants open and we weren’t in the mood for pancakes – even international ones. I always requested kid’s menus for our daughters – even when they were teenagers – so that we could guess at the silly trivia games, play tic-tac-toe, and take turns embarrassing my wife by inserting crayons in various facial orifices – usually right when the server showed up. Besides, the food at Red Lobster just tasted good. I know there are seafood snobs out there who scoffed at what were undoubtedly pre-cooked, frozen menu items that required little more than a boiling bag, a deep fryer or an industrial microwave, but in East Texas, it was the next best thing to a mess of fried crappie if you asked me, and I’ll miss it. So, thanks for the memories, the Key lime pie with raspberry drizzle and those unlimited biscuits of gold, Red Lobster. You’ll always hold a special place in my heart – and my digestive system.

        "description": "Walton, who starred at UCLA and was a star in basketball broadcast died of cancer.",
        "content": "Bill Walton celebrates after the Celtics won the Eastern Conference finals in May 1986. Walton, who starred for UCLA and later played for NBA champions in Portland and Boston before becoming a broadcasting star, died at 71. Steve Pyle/Associated Press Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career – disrupted by chronic foot injuries – lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,’ ” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA Coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Success.

The world of budget-friendly continues to grow as more companies try to appeal to those who don't feel like spending $1,000+ on a nice Netflix machine. Samsung is once again trying to make something happen in the upper mid-range sector with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE series, which consists of the and the . I've been reviewing the latter, which starts at $549, and... it's pretty good! I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's the greatest tablet since sliced bread. While it marks the return of Samsung's Galaxy Tab FE line after a hiatus in 2022, the company's mid-range tablets haven't changed all that much, save for a few tweaks here and there to bring them up to 2024 standards. The S9 FE+ is a prime example of that, but despite it being a boring update, it's still a great option if you're after a big screen with long battery life. The screen is really what makes the Galaxy Tab S9 FE+. Samsung includes a 12.4-inch 16:10 IPS LCD that, to my eye, looks about as close as you can get to OLED without actually making the leap to OLED. Content looks pin-sharp thanks to the 2560 x 1600 resolution, while colors are vibrant and contrast is surprisingly adequate. I've enjoyed doing just about everything on this tablet, from watching movies to reading articles. It all looks superb, which is to be expected from a tablet from Samsung. Is it as beautiful as a straight-up OLED panel? No, not really. It doesn't help that there's a gray tint whenever something super dark shows up on the screen (such as nighttime in a movie), but for this price, it's forgivable. The screen sits on the front of an aluminum chassis that Samsung offers in four different colors: Silver, Gray, Lavender, and Mint (the one I got -- and yeah, it's definitely the best one). There's no shortage of similarities between it and the other members of the Galaxy Tab series, with its flat sides, circular speaker grilles, and antenna stripes. This also makes it look a lot like Apple's , which you cannot unsee the moment you set them next to each other. While the Tab S9 FE is not the most comfortable tablet to hold for long periods of time (no tablet with flat edges is), it's at least thin and light enough that you don't grow tired. After a while, it just tends to dig into your hand, which isn't great. But then again, that's with most modern tablets these days. At least the bezels are thick enough so you have somewhere to put your thumbs. Under the hood, Samsung packs in its Exynos 1380 processor, a mid-range chipset that isn't positioned to take on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2s and Apple M1s of the world. Instead, it's a fine processor for the Galaxy Tab S9 FE+, with performance that's generally reliable during my testing. Apps and games respond in a timely manner, with only a few slowdowns whenever I switch between apps rapidly. There's 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage in my unit, which is perfectly fine for most consumers. If you want more, there's a that's $100 extra, which will give you a bit more headroom that can come in handy if you're a serious tablet multitasker. The device comes with Samsung's One UI 5.1 on top of Android 13, and it's a fine operating system. The Tab S9 FE+ dons the usual One UI aesthetic and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to features and settings, including an array of multitasking features like split-screen, multi-window, and even DeX, which gives you a desktop-like interface for getting work done. That feature is best paired with a keyboard and mouse, which Samsung is happy to sell you in the form of the $229 Book Cover Keyboard. I didn't get it to review, but I bet it's nice when you're in DeX mode. Of course, this is Android on a tablet, so you'll have to deal with all the weird ways apps open and scale on the display. I'll admit, the app support situation isn't as bad as it was , thanks to Google pressuring more developers to optimize their apps for larger devices. Still, it's not perfect, and common apps like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Slack will either not stretch to fill the display or stretch too widely and leave you with a bunch of white space. This isn't Samsung's fault, by the way -- it's a larger problem with Android, which I feel obligated to mention whenever I review an Android tablet. Oh, there's one more software-esque feature I have to mention: drawing. The Tab S9 FE+ comes with an S Pen that magnetically attaches to the back to recharge. You can write notes, sign documents, create drawings, sketch, and more with solid accuracy and responsiveness. Samsung has been doing the S Pen thing for a while now, and it's perfected its technique. Battery life has been really good on the Tab S9 FE+, which is nice to see. There's a 10,090mAh battery inside that can last two to three days on a full charge with my light use. If you take it on a plane with you, you can easily watch two movies, play some games, and read an ebook before it dies. Standby is also surprisingly great; I left this tablet unattended all night at 100%, and it only dropped to 96 percent by the next morning. It's reminiscent of the kind of endurance you can get from an . ZDNET's buying advice If you're considering picking up the , I would recommend considering exactly what you need from your next tablet. If you're after a big screen and long battery life, this is the one for you. But if you'd be okay with something a little smaller or serves as a second device when you aren't using it, the is always a great option. It comes with a smaller 10.2-inch screen and a Tensor G2 processor, and it bundles a speaker dock in the box that turns it into a smart display. Plus, it's around $200 cheaper. But if you have your heart set on a big tablet for watching movies and multitasking on the go and want to keep your spending in check, the Tab S9 FE+ is a solid choice. There's nothing really special that stands out about the device, but as a general everyday tablet (that happens to be larger than average and comes with a stylus in the box), it's quite good.

        "content": "close Video Hunter Biden's gun charges are more dangerous than his tax charges, says Former acting AG Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker provides his expectations ahead of New York v. Trump's closing arguments and the political impact of Hunter Biden's upcoming gun trial. President Biden paid a visit to his daughter-in-law's home Sunday night, days before the ninth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden, who was her husband. The president's brief visit to Hallie Biden's home also comes before she is expected to testify as a witness in Hunter Biden's gun crime trial next month. The first son is charged with making false statements on a federal form when purchasing a firearm in 2018. A source with knowledge of the Oct. 23, 2018, police report told Fox News that it indicated that Hallie, who was in a relationship with Hunter at the time, threw a gun owned by Hunter Biden in a dumpster behind a market near a school. She is likely to be required to testify in the upcoming trial.

(Michael Reynolds/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images) A reporter for NBC News faced heavy criticism for pointing out her connection to the trial on social media. Biden allies argued there was nothing inappropriate about the visit. The court in Hunter Biden's case met for its final hearing before jury selection begins on June 3. Fox News has previously reported that prosecutors planned to use portions of his book and laptop, including photos, to convince a jury that the first son is guilty of making false statements on a federal form when he purchased a revolver in 2018, while actively using narcotics. Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Judge Maryellen Noreika said Special Counsel David Weiss must show Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs, but not necessarily using drugs the day he purchased the gun.

        "content": "VICTORIA EDEME speaks to business consultant and Chief Strategy Officer for Shoprite Nigeria, Bunmi Adeleye, on her career journey and experiences. C ould you tell us about your educational and career background? I refer to myself as a strategist, mentor, and speaker. I have worked for over two decades and my background is in computer science and information systems. I have worked across companies in Africa and other global companies like Heineken in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and the United Kingdom. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from the University of Benin, Nigeria, and a Master of Science degree from the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom. I’m a certified Change Management practitioner and a fellow of the International Association for Strategy Professionals. I’ve attended various leadership and functional training globally. What was your childhood like? I lost my father at a very tender age. I remember growing up with my mum, who became the head of home due to the loss of my father. I have two siblings – a brother and a sister – and my mum did everything to ensure we had the best education through primary, secondary, and university. I remember very well that my mother used to have a distribution business. She used to work with the Leventis stores in Benin. I grew up in Benin. When we lost my father, we were in Kwara State. My father was in the military and we had to travel a lot. I was born in Uromi in Edo State. After we lost my father, my mother had to relocate to Benin. My father was from Kwara State. What was one experience you had growing up that influenced what you have become today? I remember my mum working in a retail company then, Leventis, and today, I’m also working in a retail company. It’s so funny that there’s a lot of coincidence. What I remember growing up was travelling as my father was in the military. He was transferred a lot. So we had to live in different states. We lived in Jalingo, Kaba, and Uromi. We travelled a lot. I also remember my mum used to cook pepper soup. I can never forget that experience because she asked me to sit down by her in the kitchen where she prepared it, which birthed my love for cooking. I like experimenting with food. When I’m not working, people will refer to me as ‘Chef Bum Bum’ because I do a lot of cooking and try out cuisines from different parts of the world. What influence did your parents have in your life journey? Seeing my mum single-handedly bringing up three kids all by herself, working, and giving us the best has taught me how to remain resilient, be strong as a woman, and accept circumstances that might befall me. I remember how my mum had to do multiple jobs to ensure she put food on our table. I grew up in Benin as a young, pretty, and dark-skinned woman. People often approached my mum to sponsor me to Italy. It is common in Edo State to see young women that go to Italy for different reasons. Sponsors may tell you that you’d get a job, keep homes, or carry children for people. My mum disagreed because she doesn’t have many children and I’m her first child. She was tempted because a lot of young girls had left the country for Europe and all parts of the world. A lot of suitors also came around to marry me but my mother didn’t agree because she wanted me to go to school. It’s part of what I am today, knowing that life will always throw its curveballs at you but you must have the ability to come back on your feet and deal with it. What was your dream while growing up? As a child, I saw myself as the family woman, living in my full femininity, with a well-kept home and family, and not doing a nine-to-five job. When I was in secondary school, I used to love food and nutrition, clothing and textiles, and other creative subjects but my mother wouldn’t have it. She wanted me to become a medical doctor or even a lawyer, and that was how I left my food and nutrition to go on with pure science in senior secondary school. I never had any dream of being a doctor or a computer scientist. I even have the knitted clothes, table covers, chair covers, and recipes I had while growing up. Why did you decide to study Computer Science at the university? Getting into school, I knew I couldn’t have read medicine or pharmacy, so the next thing available was computer science. It wasn’t because we saw the future or we saw the prospects that technology would have, it’s just that computer science was just the next logical thing on the jump. Where did you work after graduation? After I graduated in the late 90s, I served in Enugu State. My first assignment was with Nigerian Telecommunications and I worked in the Management Information Systems Department as a programmer. After my youth service, I came to Lagos and got a job. My first assignment was with Ecobank as a programmer and software developer. As a programmer, I used to code in Fortran, Cobol, and C++, to develop in-house software for consumer banking. That was my first major job. How did you move from the banking to the retail industry? I began my career as a software developer at the then Allstates Trust Bank (which was acquired by Ecobank). After working at the bank, I went to do my Master’s in Information Systems in the United Kingdom. I then got a job as a data-based administrator at SchlumbergerSema in the United Kingdom. That company is now called Atos Consulting; it’s a Belgian company. After working at SchlumbergerSema, I got a job with the Heineken Company in the UK. I was employed as an expatriate from the UK through the Heineken Young African Talent Programme; a programme that the company used to headhunt Africans in the diaspora to develop them to be leaders. Heineken was then in over 70 countries. I came to Nigeria after my induction in Amsterdam and my first assignment was as a project manager in Human Resources to implement the Campus Management Initiative. A programme with the goal to attract the best graduating students from Nigerian universities. I then worked as a Risk Analyst in the Audit Department before taking up the role of a Business Controller where I was a pioneer business controller. I went back to Europe as a senior programme manager in major technology projects that span six countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Rwanda, Burundi, DRC, Nigeria, and two other countries. After that project, I came back to run a major Enterprise Resource Planning software. I moved from doing business process improvement as a technology project manager to being a change lead for a major ERP implementation in the region. I came to Nigeria to become the change lead for SAP implementation in Nigerian business. After successfully implementing the ERP, working together with Accenture, the group IT, and the Nigerian employees, I moved from there to finance as a regional finance manager, still in Heineken. My career was across different departments. It was when I was working as a Sales Business Controller, I had another expatriation job.I had to leave Nigeria again to go overseas for another assignment. So this time around, I went to Ethiopia to be part of the post acquisition of two major breweries; Bedele and Harar. I went there to lead the business process development and management department responsible for the ERP Implementation and ensuring a seamless transformation of both breweries to The Heineken Company global standards. After my assignment in Ethiopia, I left the Heineken company to set up my consulting firm and to focus on other things. How long did you spend in Heineken? I spent over 11 years at Heineken. I joined them in 2002 and left in 2014. What year did you establish your consulting firm? I established Atunda Consulting in 2017. When I left Ethiopia, I returned to Nigeria to try other things. That was when I started a non-governmental foundation called the Novel Opportunities for Women foundation. I didn’t have that balance that I wanted. I took time off work for almost three years and didn’t do anything. So for two years, I focused on myself and my mental health and took a consulting job with Execution Edge. That was when I became an independent consultant; helping small to medium businesses to improve their operational efficiency to save costs by using the experiences I’ve had working with Heineken. So I combined the consulting work I did with my non-profit experiences. Could you share your experience as a business consultant? As an independent consultant, I had the opportunity to work on major technology implementation projects with companies like UAC Foods Limited, and Dangote International Limited, while helping companies like ADECCO Projects Engineering West Africa and some small and medium businesses in insurance, telecommunications and food processing develop and implement strategies to achieve their goals. This was until the acquisition of Shoprite by Nigerian institutional investors in 2021. I joined the post acquisition team as the change lead for Shoprite transformation programme. I was appointed as a consultant to help with the change management process, called post-integration. After the implementation, I took up a permanent position in 2022. They wanted me to be their Chief Strategy Officer not on a consulting basis but full-time. In your years of expertise, have you ever been looked down on because you are a woman? Yes. I often tell people that if I weren’t a woman, I would have been more successful as a consultant in Nigeria. When I worked at Heineken’s global office in Europe through the youth programme, I and two other females who were employed weren’t exposed to gender inequality but when I came to the Nigerian office, we realised that it was male-dominated. When we came in, the Nigerian Breweries had only three female managers out of over 3,500 employees. Most females there were often secretaries, typists, or cleaners. It was so bad that there were no female toilets in the brewery because a majority of those at the site were men. The three of us came in and we experienced serious resistance. When we travel with our male counterparts to locations, those receiving us will carry only the bags of the males and leave us. However, the senior male managers knew better because they were more exposed. I remember they used to call me ‘Oga Madam’. It was male-dominated and they only started embracing women after some time. When the Heineken Group acquired a majority share in Nigeria, they made a deliberate effort to bridge the gender gap, encourage women, and give them breathing space. So there was a lot of inclusion and diversity. When we came, we were the second generation of female managers, and today, the story is different. As a consultant, I must say that I had some challenges and I wonder why most women don’t talk about these things. As a woman, I would submit the same proposal as that of a man but the man will most likely get the contact because it is easier for men to network with men than for a woman to do the same. The decision-makers during such contracts are men and they may ask you to have a drink with them or meet at the club. Men can do that but the woman would have to go home to her family. At the end of the day, because you are not doing what they are doing, you are not able to get the contract. I lost a lot of opportunities as a consultant because I was not flexible like my male counterparts. Most men do not even want to hear your pitch because you are a woman unless you came highly recommended or you have connections. However, where I work now, it’s balanced. Generally, we also have more women than men in the retail sector. However, the owners of modern retail companies in Nigeria, like the one I work in, are mostly owned by men.",

        "content": "The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) in partnership with the Kwara State government, on Monday, flagged off the introduction of free Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine against cervical cancer among school children in the state. At the rollout of the HPV vaccine in Ilorin, the state capital, the executive director and chief executive officer of the NPHCDA, Dr. Muyi Aina, said that cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally and the second most common cancer affecting women in Nigeria. A total of 787 school children were vaccinated at the event. Aina, who was represented by Sheu Hassan, said that the HPV vaccine is a very important vaccine, adding that, “it prevents the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and causes more than 95 per cent of cases of cervical cancer.” He said that all eligible girls between the ages of 9-14 years across 193 wards in the 16 local government areas of Kwara State will be vaccinated against cervical cancer during the five-day programme. “I believe that together, we will achieve the goal of this exercise. At least 80% eligible girls aged 9 to 14 years will be reached during the five days intensification, after which the HPV vaccines will be accessed by our girls through routine immunization services in our PHC facilities. “Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally and the second most common cancer affecting women in Nigeria. It is estimated that 604,000 cases with 342,000 deaths occurred globally in 2020, and an estimated 12,075 cases and 7,968 deaths were recorded in Nigeria,” he stated. The NPHCDA boss, who said that the HPV vaccine was free, safe, and effective, urged stakeholders to mobilise family members, friends, and communities to ensure that all eligible girls get vaccinated. “Let me thank and appreciate the Kwara State Government for its support in strengthening PHC in the state. I want to specially thank Her Excellency Professor Olufolake AbdulRazaq for her role in the fight against cervical cancer. “HPV vaccines with corresponding devices and operational funds have been provided to the states to support this exercise. I must thank his Excellency, the governor of Kwara state, for his regular release of counterparts’ funds to support PHC activities, including the HPV introduction. “Your support, that of the Governors Wives forum, wives of LGA chairmen, traditional/religious leaders, Civil Society Organizations, Women groups, media, and other relevant stakeholders remain paramount to the success of the HPVV introduction and other PHC activities. “The NPHCDA remains committed to collaborating with the sub-national levels to strengthen routine immunization and other PHC services for better health for all,” Aina added. In her remarks, the wife of the Kwara State governor, Ambassador Olufolake AbdulRazaq, assured of the efficacy of the vaccine, while she charged stakeholders to dispel negative rumours and misconception against the HPV vaccines. “Today’s event set the tone for an ambitious, inclusive strategy to accelerate eliminating cervical cancer as a public health concern. Elimination is within the reach of all hence we in Kwara are committed to towing this path to ensure that we seize the opportunities that are within our reach now, so that our girls will live free of this disease. “In complementing the efforts that culminated in incorporating the HPV vaccine into the National routine immunization schedule and today’s roll out however, I urge key stakeholders in respective communities to continue to amplify awareness and sensitization on benefits of presenting eligible children for the vaccine. “This no doubt will entail engagements with our communities, traditional and religious institutions to educate, inform, and dispel any misconceptions surrounding the HPV vaccine,” the Kwara State First Lady added.",

        "description": "The ‘King of Clay’ said it was difficult to talk about his future after defeat to Alexander Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal said he did not know if he had played his last match at the French Open but revealed appearing at the Olympic Games at Roland Garros this summer is “motivation” to continue his career after defeat to Alexander Zverev. The 14-time French Open champion, who turns 38 next week, said there is a “big percentage” his defeat to fourth seed Alexander Zverev was his last match at the tournament he has dominated for almost 20 years . Nadal was handed a brutal first-round match with Zverev one of the contenders for the title after winning in Rome last week, and the 27-year-old became just the third player, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, to beat Nadal in his 116 matches at the French Open , In an emotional on-court interview after the defeat, Nadal said he was given hope by his performance, but said it was “difficult” to talk about his future. Nadal spoke in front of a packed Court Philippe-Chatrier, the scene of Nadal’s 14 French Open titles, and addressed a crowd that included wife Xisca, baby son Rafael Jr and fellow tennis stars Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. Here’s Nadal’s post-match speech in full \"It is difficult for me to talk, I don’t know if it’s the last time I’ll be here in front of all of you. Honestly, I am not 100 per cent sure. “If it is the last time, then you, the crowd, have been amazing. Today the feelings I have are difficult to describe in words. For me, it is so special to feel the love in the place I love the most. \"I have to congratulate Sasha for this great match and last week, victory in Rome. I really wish you all the best in this tournament. 2022 [when Zverev broke his ankle in his semi-final defeat to Nadal at the French Open] was a tough moment for you and you deserve more, so all the best. \"For me, as I said before, I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through these processes with the dream to be back here in Roland Garros. It is true that the first round wasn’t the ideal one. I needed something else! I was competitive, I had chances but it was difficult against a great player as Sasha. \"It’s difficult for me to say about the future. There is a big percentage I won’t be back at Roland Garros but I can’t say 100 per cent. I am enjoying myself, I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. “Maybe, in two months, I say it’s enough, I can’t give anything else. But that is something I don’t feel yet. I have goals. I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. That’s going to be another chance and I really hope to be well prepared. \"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court throughout my career, it’s just unbelievable. When I was a kid I couldn’t imagine being here at almost 38 with all of the success. Winning so many times, I couldn’t dream about it. “It has been a very beautiful process. All the memories are very special. All the people who are in Roland Garros behind the scenes helping me since I came here, and the support of my people. I can’t thank them all enough. “Last thing, all the people, the feelings you made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” Rafael Nadal set to miss Wimbledon: ‘I don’t think it’s a good idea’ Rafael Nadal is set to miss Wimbledon next month and may never play at the All England Club again as retirement looms, writes Kieran Jackson. The 37-year-old has won two Wimbledon titles amongst his collection of 22 Grand Slams. Nadal insists he will compete at Roland Garros again as he targets the Paris Olympics in two months’ time and, as a result, put his presence on the grass at Wimbledon into serious doubt. Asked whether he thinks he will play on grass and at Wimbledon, he said: “[It] looks difficult, honestly. “For me now, it looks difficult to make the transition to grass when we have the Olympics again on clay. “I cannot confirm anything, I need to analyse so many facts. I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happen to my body, to make a transition to a completely different surface, then come back to clay. “Today I don’t think that’s a good idea, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.”",

        "description": "According to the Washington Post, Alito's wife, Martha-Ann, shouted, \"It’s an international signal of distress\" after being probed by the reporter on the flag.",
        "content": "The Washington Post revealed on Saturday that the outlet initially passed on the Samuel Alito flag story in 2021 after its former Supreme Court reporter had a confrontation over it with the justice’s wife. “The Post decided not to report on the episode at the time because the flag-raising appeared to be the work of Martha-Ann Alito, rather than the justice, and connected to a dispute with her neighbors,” the Washington Post report said, citing a spokesperson for the paper. “It was not clear then that the argument was rooted in politics.” Former Washington Post Supreme Court reporter Robert Barnes went to the Alitos’ home in 2021 after receiving a tip on the flag. According to the outlet, Alito’s wife, Martha-Ann, shouted, “It’s an international signal of distress” after being probed by the reporter on the flag. An upside-down American flag, a symbol used by the former president’s supporters who falsely claim President Biden did not win the 2020 election, was seen flying at Alito’s home in the weeks following the Jan. 6 riot, The New York Times first reported last week. Alito previously told Fox News that his wife was the one who hung the flag in response to insults from a neighbor. Cameron Barr, the former senior managing editor, took responsibility for not running the story at the time, according to Semafor. “I agreed with [Supreme Court reporter] Bob Barnes and others that we should not do a single-slice story about the flag, because it seemed like the story was about Martha-Ann Alito and not her husband,” Barr told the outlet. Semafor referred to the decision as “cautious and deferential, and very pre-Dobbs,” suggesting it meant more now after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade. “Now, it’s hard to imagine,” the outlet wrote. Subscribe to our daily Business Report newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Members of the media and prominent Democratic lawmakers are calling on Alito to recuse himself from all cases before the court that are related to Donald Trump. Conservatives have said the story is much ado about nothing and part of a wider effort to delegitimize the Supreme Court. “In retrospect, I should have pushed harder for that story,” Barr told Semafor. Alito’s wife reportedly told the Washington Post reporter to ask their neighbors what they did and told the reporter to get off their property. Another symbol carried by Trump supporters, an “Appeal to Heaven” flag , was seen flying at a beach home owned by Alito in New Jersey, the New York Times reported days after their initial report. The flag, also known as the Pine Tree flag, dates back to the Revolutionary War.",

        "description": "While the U-turn portion of the structure is almost ready, the arm that lands on the CSIR Road, perpendicular to the IT Corridor, will take at least three months to complete",
        "content": "A portion of the U-shaped flyover on Rajiv Gandhi Salai near the Tidel Park junction, is nearing completion. Currently, painting work, fixing of lamp posts and electrical work are being carried out. Sources in the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company (TNRDC), which is executing the project, said that the U-turn portion of the flyover is almost ready. “We had been waiting for the rain to stop to lay the bituminous tar layer for about a length of 250 metres. This is for the approach ramps on either side,” said a source. The arm, which lands on CSIR Road, perpendicular to the IT Corridor, will take at least three months to complete. This is because of several issues pertaining to service utilities running beneath the road. “There is a power substation nearby and over 40 large-sized cables of 110 KVA and 230 KVA run from there to the IT companies in the area. We had a similar problem while constructing both the approach ramps for this flyover. When we cut open the road, we found bunches and bunches of cables that had to be slowly moved aside to facilitate construction. There were atleast three major cable cuts during that time and repairs had to be carried out,” explained an engineer associated with the project. TNRDC is also planning to dismantle and reconstruct the stormwater drains in the area to carry larger volumes of water. This is the second U-turn flyover on the road. The earlier one is in use near the Indira Nagar MRTS Station and it allows those coming from Tidel Park junction and wanting to reach ECR, Indira Nagar, Adyar and other places to reach the Indira Nagar bridge. This reduces the waiting time at the Tidel Park junction. Suresh Subramaniam, a resident of Thoraipakkam, said that the U-turn flyover was of great help. “Facilities should also be created for pedestrians near the two flyovers. The traffic police should take steps to ensure smooth traffic flow at SRP Tools junction where Metrorail work has begun and only four lanes are available for vehicular movement,” he suggested.

        "description": "Bill Walton won a championship with the Celtics in 1986.",
        "content": "Former Celtics center Bill Walton died Monday at age 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer. The NBA great was surrounded by his family at the time of his death according to a statement released by the NBA. Walton was a legendary force in the basketball world on the collegiate and NBA level, winning multiple titles on both level. He won a pair of NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973 while leading UCLA on a 88-game winning streak over multiple seasons. The Portland Trail Blazers selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft and he went on to win a title with the Blazers and a Finals MVP in 1977 before foot injuries derailed a large chunk of his career with the Clippers. He saw a career resurgence in Boston after the team acquired him in the summer of 1985. Walton’s long NBA career wrapped up when he played for the Celtics, winning the 1986 title as he was a bench player at that point in his career. But he was instrumental that season, winning the 1986 Sixth Man of the Year award as he played in a career-high 80 games (two starts) as a backup for Robert Parish. That was despite major injury questions coming into the season after getting traded from the Clippers. He wasn’t able to play during the 1987-88 season due to the injuries, and while he attempted a comeback in February 1990, he retired from the league as a player shortly afterwards. Walton spoke fondly of his time with the Celtics, giving him one last opportunity at the end of his career to make an impact. He dealt with injuries during his time in Boston, but he was able to be a key contributor to a championship team. Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also selected to the NBA’s 50th and 75th anniversary teams. Walton also thrived as a color commentator and studio analyst for NBA and college basketball after his retirement, leaving a lasting impact on the game as a beloved personality. NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued the following statement after his passing. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. “As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.”",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Both the CPM and the state government have found themselves entangled in the controversy over the new liquor policy. The party is of the view that relaxations in the liquor policy are necessary for the development of the tourism sector in the state and to attract more investment in industrial and IT parks. However, the controversy erupted even before the government took a decision on the liquor policy. In this situation, how can the government announce relaxations in the liquor policy? If the government announces relaxations, it will be interpreted as the confirmation of taking bribes from the bar owners. The party and the government are finding it hard to make a decision on the matter. Neither the CPM nor the LDF has held a discussion on the bar owners' bar owners' demands to do away with the dry day system and extend the operating hours of bars. The controversy broke out when a voice message sent by a leader of the bar owners' association asking each bar owner to pay Rs 2.50 lakhs in exchange for the relaxations from the government came out. The voice message was sent by Animon, a state leader of the Federation of Kerala Bar Association. It is alleged that there is a massive bribery deal behind this. The opposition is planning to launch widespread protests against the government even though CPM state secretary MV Govindan and Excise Minister MB Rajesh are claiming that the government has not even started a preliminary discussion on the liquor policy. Opposition targeting Chief Minister The opposition, which demanded the resignation of Excise Minister MB Rajesh, turned against Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas after the details of the meeting called by the Tourism Director came out. It is asking if the Tourism Director would call a meeting without the knowledge of the Tourism Minister. By portraying Minister Riyas as the main mastermind in the bar bribery controversy, the opposition is targeting Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The opposition is also trying to take advantage of the resentment that a section of the CPM has towards Riyas.",

        "content": "( KTLA ) – NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has died at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday. The accomplished basketball center died of cancer, according to ESPN NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski , who cited the league as his source. In a statement, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called Walton “truly one of a kind,” citing his impact both on the court and in the broadcast booth, “where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.” “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton started at UCLA under legendary coach John Wooden. The pair won national championships in 1972 and 1973, and Walton was thrice the national college player of the year. Walton was named Most Valuable Player multiple times throughout his decade-long professional basketball career, which began with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1974 and ended with the Boston Celtics in 1988. After retiring as a player, the UCLA alumni pivoted to sports commentary for college basketball with ESPN, NBC Sports and CBS Sports. He earned an Emmy Award for his analysis in 1991. Aside from his time on the court, Walton was known for his love of jam bands, particularly the Grateful Dead, and was often spotted in a tie-dyed shirt while broadcasting basketball games. Despite what the NBA called “a prolonged battle with cancer,” Walton was spotted at this year’s NBA All-Star Game with a smile on his face.

        "content": "OAKLAND — Firefighters stood watch on Monday over the smoldering remains of a long-time lumber yard in Oakland that was scorched by a four-alarm fire this weekend, as an investigation into the blaze begins. The fire consumed Economy Lumber at 750 High Street in Oakland. The Oakland Fire Department said the blaze was first reported around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday. By 11 p.m., the same night, firefighters had contained the fire, Oakland fire spokesperson Michael Hunt said. “Crews are still on scene at Economy Lumber,” Hunt said Monday. “We’ll probably be on scene most of the day.” The wrecked complex is the site of one of four lumber yards that Economy Lumber operates in the Bay Area. Oakland fire investigators were attempting to determine the cause of the fire. The Oakland Fire Department also began working with the property owner and a heavy equipment operator to pull apart the building so crews could reach any remaining hot spots, Hunt said. About 75 firefighters responded to the site of the fire Sunday. No injuries were reported as a result of the blaze. Economy Lumber has been in business since 1935. The company was born as a small lumber business and eventually expanded to four Bay Area locations. It wasn’t immediately known when 750 High Street lumber yard began operating.",

        "content": "Ever since her retirement in September 2022, Serena Williams has spent more time with her family. Ahead of the release of her 8-part series, Williams took some time out and went for a family vacation in France. Her husband Alexis Ohanian and daughters Olympia Ohanian and Adira Ohanian were having a great time too. But what the most attention online was Olympia’s braids. Alexis Ohanian shares a great father-daughter bond with Olympia, as evident through their countless Instagram posts together. He bakes ‘artsy’ pancakes for her in the shape of cartoon characters and also spends quality time with her. Being the doting father, Alexis shared a picture of Olympia from Paris, where she is looking at a small pond. The picture was beautiful, with flowers and greenery all around. But viewers noticed the new hairstyle on Olympia – her braids. It was long and luscious and braided all over. It was a refreshing change since the spotlight was off her mother Serena Williams, for once. Both Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian have been raising their kids with the utmost freedom. Be it her right to exercise freedom while playing, talking, or even styling herself, Olympia’s parents have always encouraged her. Allowing her to experiment with her looks is just a small step for Olympia to follow in her mother’s footsteps. Here’s how some of the comments were under the Instagram post: But this is not the first time Olympia Ohanian has gone viral for her looks. Olympia adorably tried on Serena Williams’ Met Gala 2021 look for its 2023 edition to twin with her mother for the event, making it a first of sorts. When Olympia Ohanian tried to pull off Serena Williams’ iconic Met Gala look At the 2021 Met Gala, Serena Williams wore a pink cape that was fuzzy. The cape displayed various shades of pink, with the edges being black. It was an iconic look for the tennis legend, who was wearing a silver bodice dress. A year or two later, Serena Williams posted an Instagram video, with the same dress one more time. Only this time, it was her daughter Olympia trying it on. Olympia was wearing that same fuzzy pink cape and walking inside their closet. The video was clubbed to the song ‘Made You Look’ by Meghan Trainor. At age 6, Olympia might just be the biggest star kid in the world right now. With unbelievably famous parents who encourage her at every step, Olympia is blessed to have them by her side. She was also made the owner of two sports clubs – Los Angeles Golf Club and soccer team Angel City. The future seems bright for the young star kid.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, a two-time NBA champion and two-time league All-Star before becoming one of the league's most prominent voices on TV, died at age 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced Monday. Walton won an NBA title in 1977 as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. He capped off his career with a title with the Boston Celtics in 1986. He was a league All-Star back-to-back years in 1977 and 1978. Before entering the NBA, he won consecutive titles in 1972 and 1973 with the UCLA Bruins. He later had his number retired by UCLA. Walton was also a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, which controversially lost to the Soviet Union, costing the U.S. a chance at the gold medal. Following his playing career, he joined CBS, and later NBC and ABC/ESPN, to broadcast college and NBA games. He was also enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement reacting to Walton's passing. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams,\" Silver said. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. \"As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.\"",

        "content": "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, on Sunday, announced that it would work with Schlumberger Global to develop frontier oil basins in Nigeria. Schlumberger, globally known as SLB Global, is a major player in the oil and gas industry, while Nigeria’s frontier basins are regions with potential for oil and gas reserves that have not been extensively explored yet. The Chief Executive, NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, hosted a delegation from the global oil firm led by its President, Olivier Le Peuch, where both parties discussed developing Nigeria’s frontier basins, according to a statement issued in Abuja by the upstream regulatory commission. “Areas of mutual interest discussed include the development of Nigeria’s frontier basins and the integration of innovative technologies to enhance exploration and production efficiencies,” NUPRC stated, The frontier basins hold promise for increasing Nigeria’s hydrocarbon production and they include the Anambra, Benue Trough (Lower, Middle, Upper), Chad (South-Eastern sector), Dahomey, Bida (Mid-Niger), Sokoto, and Deep/Ultra-deep offshore. The significance of the basins is that they are new sources of oil and gas revenue for Nigeria, with the potential for natural gas reserves for domestic use and export. NUPRC is responsible for overseeing frontier basin exploration through regulations, and the basins are seen as a way to ensure Nigeria’s long-term energy security and economic growth. The statement stated that the meeting between NUPRC and Schlumberger underscored the commission’s commitment to fostering strategic partnerships that would enhance Nigeria’s oil production and operational efficiency. It said the purpose of the visit was to explore specific areas of collaboration and partnership between both organisations. During the meeting, Komolafe said the NUPRC adopts a participatory and collaborative approach to facilitate ease of doing business in the oil sector. He highlighted several of the commission’s feats since its inception in 2021 under the Petroleum Industry Act, adding that key achievements include the establishment of 17 regulations aimed at improving industry standards and operational efficiency. “Additionally, the re-engineering of the Nigeria National Data Repository has been a significant milestone, promoting the monetisation of oil blocks and aligning regulations with global energy transition initiatives and carbon footprint reduction goals,” the commission stated. It said Komolafe also mentioned the ongoing licensing rounds as a testament to the commission’s proactive approach in regulating the sector. “One notable achievement expounded upon was the NUPRC’s commitment to eliminating gas flaring and commercialising flared gas under the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme. “This initiative has designated 49 flare sites for commercialisation, demonstrating the commission’s dedication to environmental sustainability and resource optimisation,” the agency stated. On his part, Le Peuch expressed satisfaction with the commission’s regulatory framework and indicated SLB Global’s readiness to collaborate. He reiterated the importance of such partnerships in unlocking Nigeria’s onshore and offshore oil potential, particularly through leveraging advanced technology. “At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that a contact team would be established to further investigate and identify more opportunities for collaboration. The team will focus on expanding the scope of mutual interests and ensuring that both organisations can effectively work together to achieve their shared objectives,” NUPRC stated.",

        "description": "Boxing legend left nauseous and dizzy after an ulcer flare-up during a journey from Miami to Los Angeles",
        "content": "Sport | Boxing Mike Tyson has reportedly suffered a medical scare during a cross-country flight in the USA, less than two months before he is scheduled to face Jake Paul in his high-profile boxing comeback. American outlet In Touch Weekly first reported on Monday that the former undisputed heavyweight world champion had a medical emergency on a delayed flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday night, with eyewitnesses reporting an announcement asking for a doctor before paramedics boarded the plane following its landing at LAX. In a statement subsequently delivered to the New York Post , Tyson’s representatives insisted that the 57-year-old was now doing well after an ulcer issue caused him to become nauseous and dizzy towards the end of the flight. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” the statement read. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him. “However, it’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay. This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” Tyson is in the midst of preparing for his sensational and controversial return to the sport where he remains one of the most iconic figures, 19 years since the last of his 58 professional fights when he retired on his stool against Ireland’s Kevin McBride in Washington DC. It was announced back in early March that ‘Iron Mike’ would be coming out of retirement to take on YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul in a blockbuster contest to be held at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas - home of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys - on July 20, screened live on Netflix. It will be Tyson’s first involvement in the ring since he fought an eight-round exhibition draw against fellow legendary ex-boxing champion Roy Jones Jr in LA in 2020, with Paul knocking out basketball player Nate Robinson in only his second professional bout on the undercard at Staples Center. It was initially unclear if the fight, which pits Tyson against a man 31 years his junior, would be another exhibition or a professional contest, until confirmation arrived last month that it had been officially sanctioned as a pro bout by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The fight will consist of eight rounds lasting two minutes each, with heavier 14-ounce gloves and no headgear to be worn. Taylor vs Catterall 2 LIVE!

        "description": "The Oakwood site \"is a profound testament to the enduring spirit and historical significance of New York City’s African American community,” said Concilmember Kamillah Hanks.",
        "content": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — A nearly 100-year-old Oakwood cemetery originally built for African Americans took another step toward landmark status this week after the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission held a hearing Tuesday. Frederick Douglass Memorial Park, at the corner of Amboy Road and Montreal Avenue , looks poised for landmark status as multiple people testified in support during the hearing, including Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (D-North Shore), who chairs the Council’s Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, and Disposition. “Frederick Douglass Memorial Park...is more than a cemetery. It is a profound testament to the enduring spirit and historical significance of New York City’s African American community,” Hanks said. “Landmark status will provide the necessary support and resources to maintain and enhance the park allowing it to continue serving as a place of reflection, remembrance and celebration of African American Heritage.” Hanks’ local colleagues, Council Minority Leader Joseph Borelli (R-South Shore) and Councilman David Carr (R-Mid-Island), have also offered their support to the cemetery’s landmark push. During a recent tour of the grounds, Frederick Douglass Memorial Park Board President Brandon Stradford and members Debbie-Ann Paige and Lisa Wallace said the landmark designation would help them better maintain the cemetery. While rich in historic significance, the memorial park still functions as a modern, 14.88-acre cemetery, accommodating burials a few times each week for people of all races and denominations. It has also been used for the Richmond County Public Administrator’s Burial Program, which provides dignified burials to descendants who have no families to handle them. At Tuesday’s hearing, Stradford told the Landmarks Preservation Commission about the importance of the cemetery to the African American community and to its current stewards, in particular. Most members of the board have family members interred there. “The place is really special to us. It’s not just something of interest, something that we said ‘this has fallen down, oh let’s grab a hold of that,’” he said. “It’s part of my legacy, our legacy.” STEEPED IN HISTORY Rodney Dade, a Harlem funeral director, founded the cemetery in 1933 after seeing the bigotry Black people faced in the five boroughs when burying their loved ones. Cemeteries around the city often segregated Black dead people to undesirable areas on their grounds, and forced their families through various indignities, Mary Ann-Hurley, who presented Frederick Douglass Memorial Park’s landmark case to Landmarks Preservation Commission in March, said at the time. Founders named the park for Frederick Douglass, the 19th century abolitionist and statesman born into slavery, and began burying people in 1935. Douglass is buried in Rochester. As one of the few cemeteries entirely open to Black people, Frederick Douglass Memorial Park accepted a host of prominent figures, including blues singer Mamie Smith, Negro League baseball players Elias “Country Brown” Bryant and King Solomon “Sol” White, Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew, Founder of Commandment Keepers Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Harlem and Joanna Berry Shields, a Founder of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first Black sorority. RECOVERING FROM NEGLECT During that recent tour, signs of care, like flowers and other mementos, could be seen at individual graves around the park, but decades of neglect preceding the current board have left the site in need of work. In 2008, the Advance/SILive.com reported that Frederick Douglass Memorial Park was in danger of becoming an abandoned cemetery after years of mismanagement. The state Division of Cemeteries, which regulates nonsectarian cemeteries like Frederick Douglass Memorial Park, first raised alarm bells about management there in 1999. In 2005, the state courts removed a former director of the cemetery, issued a $667,593 judgment against her, and put the cemetery into a receivership. That receivership wasn’t without controversy after the third individual to take on the role tore down historic gates at the park entrance, leading to a lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. Today, the stewards of Frederick Douglass Memorial Park want to move on from the past few decades, and hope securing a landmark status can help them do so. COMMISSION HEARS ‘MOVING TESTIMONY’ Landmarks Preservation Commission Vice Chair Frederick Bland, serves on the board of another city cemetery with landmark status, and said it’s been vital in helping them maintain their grounds. For Landmark Preservation Commissioner Angie Master, the only Staten Islander serving on the Commission, Fredrick Douglass Memorial Park would be the first local site to receive the status since her term began last year . “I’m just so happy with the community support and how the cemetery folks have come out here and express themselves so articulately, and it’s such a deserving individual landmark,” she said. While the Commission has yet to schedule a final vote for whether Frederick Douglass Memorial Park will receive its landmark status, it seems to be trending in the right direction. Commission Chair Sarah Carroll noted as she closed the portion of the meeting related to the Memorial Park that Master’s comments may have been out of place — typically, commissioners wait until their votes to offer their explicit support — but that they were understood given the cause. “We’re not technically commenting today but I think the testimony was so moving it sort of warranted those feelings and thoughts,” she said.",

Sir Keir was first elected to the Commons in 2015 on a Labour manifesto pledge to trim fees to such levels, with universities’ income made up through increased state support. But it would not be lost on him that even though his party had won the argument, Labour lost that election. Tax and spending promises lie at the heart of modern election campaigns in Britain. The experience of being put on the back foot over economic issues has led Labour to an almost crippling cautiousness. Sir Keir has sought to close down opportunities for the Tories to label his plans as “tax bombshells”. There are differences between Labour and the Tories. But they are small. Labour’s proposed tax rises – VAT on private school fees, ending the non-dom regime, and a crackdown on tax avoidance – don’t affect the majority of voters, but they do suggest a targeting of unfair advantage. Labour’s proposals raise about £10bn, a sum dwarfed by the size of the public sector and its problems. Rishi Sunak’s government missed its recruitment target for teachers by more than 13,000 teachers last year. Labour promises to hire just half that number for £350m. The party has also pledged to spend £1.1bn to pay health staff extra for out-of-hours working to deliver the promised 40,000 weekly operations, scans or appointments. That is welcome, but there are 7m GP appointments every week in England alone. Spending is restrained in part because Labour is targeting a balanced current budget. Even if the economy turns out as forecast, this leaves a Labour government having to either deliver spending cuts to non-ringfenced departments or raise taxes. This fiscal rule could be weaponised by Labour to tap into public frustrations about inequality . But Sir Keir is trying to distance himself from the politics of redistribution. Instead, voters are left with austerity economics, as they are with Labour’s retention of the Conservative fiscal rule that debt as a share of GDP has to be falling by the fifth year of a Treasury forecast. Most investment spending won’t pay for itself in such a short period, limiting Labour’s ambitions. Sir Keir should think bigger, because the fixes that the country needs exceed what he has offered so far. Reducing the wasteful consumption of the wealthy to make resources available for socially useful spending must be the aim of Labour’s tax policy. Bolder policies can capture voters’ imaginations, if they are clearly communicated and chime with the public’s priorities. The risk is that they become hostages to fortune. However, Mr Sunak will find it hard to appeal to voters’ sense of prudence when their experience of Conservative government has been rising costs, falling living standards and failing public services.",

        "description": "Photographer Tim Morris got the chance to visit the school he used to attend back in the 1970s",
        "content": "For a lot of us, school days are remembered with affection. From forming lifelong friendships to keeping up with the latest fashion trends, school was the most exciting part of our young lives even if it didn't always seem that way at the time. When we walk through their doors for the last time, for most of us, it's an opportunity we'll never have again. But not for photographer Tim Morris, who got to visit his former school, Dyffryn Lower Comprehensive School in Port Talbot, almost half a century later. Dyffryn Comprehensive School, which was officially opened in 1966, was situated on two sites. Year 7 and Year 8 pupils were taught at the Lower School, which was located on Talcennau Road in the town, while Year 9, 10 and 11 pupils attended the Upper School on Bertha Road in Margam.

In 2019, the former Upper School buildings were demolished, and in the same year, the Lower School building was deemed as \"surplus\" to the operational requirements of the Education, Leisure and Lifelong Learning Directorate. Now, the former school on Talcennau Road is facing a new chapter in its life. In May of last year, Neath Port Talbot Council's planning committee approved plans for new homes. It is set to see the construction of 43 affordable properties built on the site by developers Linc Cymru, along with an internal road network, landscaping, and additional car parking. You can read more about the proposed plans here. Ahead of the work taking place, developers got in contact with Tim Morris, to invite him to take photographers of the old site before the major changes get underway. The photographer took pictures of the derelict site in the space of four supervised visits with the developers. Here are some of the best photos of the school. He also shared his experience of taking photographs of his former school. Tim Morris explained that the first time he went to Dyffryn Lower Comprehensive School as a pupil was in 1974 at the age of 11 - almost 50 years ago Tim has been an avid photographer all his life and mostly enjoys taking photographs of buildings \"I hadn't done schools until now,\" he said. \"I've done farm houses, industrial places, military places. They were all legal - I don't break into these places. Going into my old school and having a look around was great.\" Tim said he attended the nearby Central Junior School before going to Dyffryn Lower. He said: \"Dyffryn was a much bigger school, they had more children than we had in the junior school. Coming from the Central School, I was one of the biggest, largest boys and then I went to Dyffryn - even though there were only two years there, I became one of the youngest.\" \"As an 11-year-old, you don’t really appreciate the architecture of the school or the buildings while you're in it,\" Tim said. \"I could walk to the school because my parents’ house in Port Talbot was about a five-minute walk away. I could walk to it then and I could see it.\" \"I was aware that the school had closed, but didn’t know when it had closed. I go to Port Talbot to visit my parents, but I don’t really socialise in Port Talbot anymore - up until recently I didn’t keep up with what was going on in the town.\" Tim explained that he became a member of various art walk groups on social media, one of which is located in Port Talbot. From there, a representative of Linc Cymru got in contact with the group asking if a photographer wanted to take photos of the closed school before work would begin on the site, which Tim volunteered to do. \"The reason I got involved in this is because there is a heritage project aiming to record the school, and also when it’s demolished, to try and have some sort of memorial for the school built into the new housing development.\" Tim first visited the old school in September of last year and went back to take more photographs three more times Tim said: \"I went in twice in September of last year, the next time I wandered from the outside, and then the last time I went in was January of this year.\" When asked what it was like, Tim said that it was \"quite bizarre\" He added: \"The outside buildings haven’t really changed, but the inside - it has changed completely from when I was there, I was trying to remember what it was like.\" \"The old woodworking room is no longer there, that had been repurposed.\" \"The lower part of the school was for the lower year, and it’s strange to think, we were all taught in that building for the whole of our first year.\" \"The only building that had remained the same was the gym - that hadn’t changed since the 70s, it had the same wooden floors and the beams.\" Tim revealed that his favourite subjects while at Dyffryn Lower Comprehensive School were the scientific subjects “I was quite glad that I could go back in a few times. I went in for the first time, and there were things I hadn’t photographed or I thought I hadn’t photographed well. So to go back in a few times afterwards, I could explore the same buildings but from a different angle.\" Dyffryn Comprehensive School, which was officially opened in 1966, was situated on two sites, and Year 7 and Year 8 pupils were taught at the Lower School Some of the work that former pupils did while at Dyffryn Lower \"Going in, I had no idea what it was like, so there was no plan. I remember the layout being there as a boy, but in terms of what the state was like, I just wanted to see what it was like.\" According to Tim, some rooms, including the gym, had remained in tact, while others had been affected by the weather and other elements He said: “The gym photos are the ones that stand out for me, the room seemed fairly intact. But to go to the other extreme, the very first form room that I was in has been badly damaged by rain and various things.\" \"You’ve got the contrast where the building is intact and then the room that has been destroyed.” \"The gym was the highlight for me because it was just like it was back in the 70s, it hadn’t changed whatsoever.\" Even a pair of PE daps had been left in the school \"The changing rooms were the same, very simple, very basic.” The school kitchen had also been frozen in time 'Is it good to live forever?' Even former pupils' work had been left on the school floor Some more work Ystafell yr Athrawon Tim said he \"enjoyed\" the experience of taking photographs of his former school Tim said: \"I’ve shared it on a Facebook group that has been specifically set up for former pupils of Dyffryn School, I joined that and shared the photos. People loved the pictures, but I think people’s memories of the school were good and bad.\" \"Some people had good times, some people had bad times with the place.\" For Tim, he had nothing but fond memories of his former school. He explained that he went on to work within the IT industry and retired as a computer programmer last year, which meant that he had \"more time\" to focus on his photography “I’m surprised with how small the school seems now compared to when I was there.\" Tim said he was \"proud\" of the work that he produced while visiting his former school",

        "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu admits 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills 45",
        "content": "Listen to Story Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "content": "S ector by sector, private equity is making deep inroads into UK public services. More than a decade ago, the collapse of Southern Cross , the private-equity-owned care home operator, revealed the havoc that can be wreaked when essential public services are run by heavily indebted businesses with complex financial structures. Typically, such owners maximise profits by using low-tax jurisdictions, loans, and sale-and-leaseback arrangements that split holding companies from property assets. Present trends show that this cautionary tale is being ignored. A forthcoming report from the Common Wealth thinktank uses the example of the companies that lease trains to railway operators, to demonstrate that private equity companies are pressing their advantage from financial engineering. Britain’s transport network has joined health and social care, children’s homes and some areas of education in offering rich pickings to private-equity investors . The advantages to businesses are obvious. Because these are essential services, whose continued operation is guaranteed in law and by the public’s need for them, the risks are low. On the railways, contracts guaranteeing revenue have turned rolling stock companies into hugely profitable entities at a time when the rest of the industry was forced to make cuts. In health, social care and special needs education, a long-term lack of public investment has limited the options available to commissioners, including NHS bodies and councils. Privately owned businesses are filling the gaps. In 2021, a review by the Competition and Markets Authority noted the high profit margins of children’s home operators and judged the market they are part of to be “dysfunctional”. Yet Tory ministers rejected most of the recommendations of the independent reviewer they had appointed to look at the children’s social care system. Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner, is among critics of how businesses based in low-tax jurisdictions are enabled to take money out of statutory services “at an alarming rate”. Yet far from cracking down on opaque accounting, capping profits or making efforts to re-shore taxes, Conservative governments have let a similar pattern emerge in early-years education and childcare. A Guardian investigation last year found investment funds had doubled their stake in childcare in four years, and further expansion is all but guaranteed given the government’s pledge to fund more places, without enabling the public sector to provide them. Awareness of the harm caused by tax havens is wider than it used to be, but international efforts to tackle it have stalled, and UK overseas and crown dependencies have rejected transparency. Meanwhile, the mobile, intangible nature of digital businesses has made it far easier for multinational corporations to avoid taxation. This is a global problem as well as a national one. But the siphoning of profits from heavily subsidised public services – the subsidy is worth around £28bn a year in the case of rolling stock – must be curbed. As the Common Wealth authors point out, austerity and tax havens are a destructive combination. Offshore boots should never be filled at taxpayers’ expense.",

        "content": "Dozens of people were injured on Sunday when strong wind caused large tarpaulins to collapse at two campaign events in México state. The México state government said in a statement that 58 people sustained minor injuries at an event for a mayoral candidate in Xonacatlán, while around 20 people became trapped when a tarp collapsed at an event for a mayoral candidate in Ixtlahuaca, according to reports. Three people were reportedly injured in the latter incident. In Xonacatlán, located about 60 kilometers west of downtown Mexico City, 55 people were treated on-site for minor injuries while one person sought medical care at a hospital “by their own means,” the México state government said. Two other people were taken to hospital by ambulance, one of whom was suffering a nervous breakdown, the government said. In Ixtlahuaca, located around 100 kilometers northwest of Mexico City, three people suffered “bumps” when the tarp and the structure supporting it collapsed, according to the Excélsior newspaper. Paramedics and other emergency personnel assisted and treated the injured in both Xonacatlán and Ixtlahuaca. The accidents occurred at “close of campaign” events for Morena party mayoral candidates in the respective municipalities. They happened five days after strong wind caused a stage to collapse at a Citizens Movement campaign event in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, Nuevo León. Nine people were killed at that event and more than 100 others were injured. Morena’s mayoral candidate in Xonacatlán, Alfredo González, said that “strong gusts of winds” brought the tarp down at his event. The party’s mayoral candidate in Ixtlahuaca, Guadalupe Díaz said in a video message that heavy rain and strong wind caused the tarp to collapse at her event. “Fortunately, ... there aren’t lives to mourn,” she said. Díaz and González are among hundreds of candidates vying to become mayors in the 125 municipalities of México state, Mexico’s most populous state. Mexicans will elect some 20,000 municipal, state and federal representatives — including a new president — in the country’s largest ever elections this Sunday.

Follow Us Shares of Evergrande Automobile today closed up 86% on the first days of trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since shares were suspended on May 17. Yesterday Evergrande Automobile applied to resume trading after news broke that a mystery saviour intends to buy a 29% stake in the company. - Advertisement - The company has been embattled for a long time partly due to problems of the parent Evergrande Group which is a property company and has been suffering due to the property market collapse in China. The company bet big on a number of new energy vehicle projects which culminated in in the creation of the Hengchi brand by Evergrande Auto. One of the biggest stands at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show was from Hengchi and they showed now no fewer than 9 new cars, all allegedly production ready. Despite already having huge financial problems one model, the Hengchi 5 , did enter production in 2022. Interestingly Evergrande tried to sell the whole project to Xiaomi back in 2021. Since production began there have been a number of halts , the most recent since around the beginning of this year. Also on January 8 Evergrande NEV executive director Liu Yongzhuo was arrested due to illegal actions by the company. - Advertisement - The new deal concerns the block of Evergrande Auto shares controlled by China Evergrande Group (in liquidation), Evergrande Health Industry Group, and Acelin Global Limited. Between them they hold 6.348 billion shares which is about 58.5% of the total issued Evergrande Auto shares. Under the agreement the as yet unknown third party will acquire 3,145,000,000 shares, amounting to 29% of Evergrande Auto immediately. The remaining 29.5% of shares owned by the three parties amounting to 3,203,000,000 will be subject to an exercisable option for a period of time after the sale and purchase agreement. It’s understood that under the agreement the purchaser will extend Evergrande Auto a line of credit to support ongoing operations and facilitate development of the group’s EV business. It is not known whether this extends to a resumption of production. The Evergrande plant in Tianjin since production began in September 2022 is understood to have only produced 1,700 Hengchi 5 models up until the end of last year. - Advertisement - Furthermore the financial report stated that as of 31 December 2023 the asses of Evergrande Auto amounted to 34.851 billion yuan (4.81 billion USD) while liabilities were 72.543 billion yuan (10.01 billion USD). On May 22 this year Evergrande announced that it was required to pay back 1.9 billion yuan (262 million USD) in subsidies due to breaches in agreement. Editor’s note: As previously written on the pages of Car News China the fact that Evergrande ever managed in the first place to produce and sell any Hengchi cars was quite an achievement. Whether this latest deal will be enough to save the company remains to be seen and it comes just weeks after another mysterious deal to rescue an ailing Chinese EV producer. However, that deal to rescue HiPhi would seem to have far more potential as the company has a proven track record and three production cars. While Hengchi might have displayed 9 cars back in 2021 it is questionable how close many of them are to production and with time they have become an increasingly less competitive proposition.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who led the Trail Blazers to their only NBA title, is dead at age 71. The center, who won two NBA titles during his injury-plagued career, died of cancer, the NBA announced Monday morning. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” The 6-foot-11 Walton led the Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, earning the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award after averaging 18.5 points, 19 rebounds, 5.2 assist and 3.7 blocks while shooting 54.5% in a six-game series against the Philadelphia 76ers. Walton’s all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA, where he led the Bruins to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, and he was selected as the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four in each year. He was a three-time Player of the Year during his four seasons under legendary coach John Wooden. Three years later the dominant Walton led the Blazers on a stunning run to the NBA title. They defeated the Chicago Bulls and Denver Nuggets in the first two rounds. Then the Blazers shocked the Los Angeles Lakers with a four-game sweep in the Western Conference finals before a stunning 4-2 series win over Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. The Blazers rallied after losing the first two games of the series. The Blazers seemingly were on their way to back-to-back championships the following year, starting the season with a 50-10 record. However, Walton suffered a foot injury that shelved for the remainder of the season and the Blazers closed out the season with an 8-14 record. Walton returned for the playoffs, but played in just two games and the Blazers were eliminated in six games by the Seattle SuperSonics in the conference semifinals. Despite playing in just 58 games, Walton was named the league’s Most Valuable Player in 1978. Walton sat out the entire 1978-79 season after demanding a trade and he eventually signed with the San Diego Clippers in 1979. The Clippers traded Walton to the Boston Celtics in 1985. Walton, coming off the bench, helped the Celtics win a title in 1986 and was named NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year. Walton was named one of the NBA’s 75 greatest players and was inducted into the Naismith Pro Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993.",

        "content": "The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mr Nyesom Wike, has said there is hope for Nigerians, considering the achievements of President Bola Tinubu in just one year in office. Wike stated this in Abuja on Monday, after he inspected the Southern Parkway Road and Abuja Rail Mass Transit, in preparation for commercial inauguration on May 29. According to Wike, Tinubu has done very well in FCT and the country in just one year, particularly in physical infrastructure and human capital development. “Mr President’s “Renewed Hope” agenda is no longer a story; it’s a reality. It is a promise made and a promise fulfilled. “I think Mr. President has done very very well in terms of reassuring Nigerians that he is committed to deliver the dividend of democracy. “From what we have seen on the ground, there is really hope for Nigerians. “So, we are very happy.” He added that in FCT, Tinubu has rekindled the hope of civil servants by instituting their career progression “and I am sure the civil servants are happy”. The minister noted that although there were some areas that needed to be looked into, one year was not enough for Tinubu to deliver 100 per cent expectations of Nigerians. On the inauguration of the projects, Wike said: “We are good to go; just putting finishing touches. “We have been to the Southern Parkway, and we are 100 per cent ready. Here in the Metro Line, we are also ready. “We are happy that all our efforts have come to fruition. “The residents are very happy and by the end of the day, the train services will be available for Nigerians. “So, for us at FCTA, we are very very happy,” the minister said.

        "content": "An Israeli airstrike that caused a huge blaze at a tented area for displaced people in Rafah has killed 45 people, medics have said, with images of charred and dismembered children prompting an outcry from global leaders and putting ceasefire talks in jeopardy. Bombing overnight that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said targeted senior Hamas militants in a precision strike appears to have ignited fires that spread quickly through tents and makeshift accommodation, overwhelming a nearby field hospital operated by the International Committee of the Red Cross and overstretched local hospitals. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the north-western neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, told the Associated Press. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The health ministry in the Hamas-controlled area said about half of the dead were women, children and older adults. Barefooted children wandered around the smoking wreckage on Monday as searches for the dead continued and mourning families prepared to bury their loved ones. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in parliament that “something unfortunately went tragically wrong” with the airstrike. “We are investigating the incident and will reach conclusions, because this is our policy,” he said. The US, Israel’s staunchest ally and weapons supplier, described the images from the aftermath as devastating. The strike, one of the deadliest single incidents in the eight-month war to date, came two days after the international court of justice in The Hague, which arbitrates between states, ordered Israel to stop its operation in Rafah immediately . More than 85% of the Palestinian territory’s population had sought shelter in the area having fled fighting elsewhere, and a million people have been forced to move again since Israel’s ground operation began on 6 May. Israeli ground troops have so far probed Rafah’s southern and eastern outskirts, rather than its overcrowded centre. Aid deliveries have slowed to a trickle, with the Rafah and nearby Kerem Shalom crossings effectively blocked. International censure of Israel’s war against Hamas has grown steadily in tandem with the death toll and humanitarian crisis in the strip, but Israeli officials have vowed that a ground operation in Rafah, where it believes Hamas’s leadership and four battalions of fighters are camped out with Israeli hostages, is necessary for “total victory”. Friday’s order from the ICJ is binding, but not enforceable. Several countries called on Israel to obey the judges’s 13-2 majority decision in the wake of the Rafah strike. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages, said the Rafah casualties would complicate the protracted negotiations. The Israeli daily Haaretz reported later on Monday that Hamas had decided to pull out of the latest proposed talks over what its senior leadership described as a massacre. Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Relations between Egypt and Israel, cool at the best of times, have reached a nadir since the Rafah operation began. The situation deteriorated further on Monday after the Israeli military confirmed there had been an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers in the Rafah crossing area in which at least one member of Egypt’s security forces was killed. Both countries’ militaries are reviewing the incident. France, a European ally of Israel, said it was outraged by the Rafah strike. “These operations must stop,” the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, posted on X. “There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire.” The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, posted: “Horrified by news coming out of Rafah on Israeli strikes killing dozens of displaced persons, including small children. I condemn this in the strongest terms.” Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, said that bombings such as Sunday night’s would have long-standing repercussions for Israel. Speaking to Sky TG24, he said: “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision.” The head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said: “The state of Israel continues to violate international law with impunity and in contempt of an international court of justice ruling ... ordering an end to its military action in Rafah.” After criticism of the Rafah strike, the IDF said it had not anticipated civilian casualties, and had bombed an area outside the latest “evacuation zone” to where Palestinians have been ordered to move, although that claim appeared to contradict a previous “safe zone” map from 22 May. The bombing had killed Hamas’s chief of staff for the West Bank and another senior official responsible for deadly attacks on Israelis, the IDF said. Several rightwing Israeli journalists celebrated the attack in appearances on Israeli television and social media site X, likening it to this week’s Jewish bonfire festival, Lag B’Omer. Commentator Naveh Dromi retweeted another user’s post which also showed a fire in Rafah, adding her own: “Happy Holidays.” About 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 taken hostage in Hamas’s 7 October attack that triggered the latest conflict. According to the local health ministry, more than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory operation, which has left desperate civilians without healthcare, food or water and reduced most of the coastal territory to ruins. After a week in which Israel’s global standing had plummetted , Sunday’s attack attracted more attention than usual in the Hebrew-language media, which has often avoided daily reporting on the scenes of death and destruction in Gaza. Hostilities also flared on Israel’s northern border on Monday. Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah said it had launched a salvo of rockets at Israeli territory in response to a deadly Israeli strike outside a hospital in southern Lebanon earlier in the day. Israel has been locked in a battle of attrition with the Iranian-backed militia since 8 October, when Hezbollah began firing missiles at the Jewish state to aid Hamas.

        "content": "Listen to Story England white-ball skipper Jos Buttler is set to miss the third T20I against Pakistan with his wife Lousie expecting the birth of their third child. England will take on Pakistan in the third game of the four-match series on Tuesday, May 28 at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. In Buttler’s absence, vice captain Moeen Ali will be seen leading the side as England look to seal the series in the upcoming encounter. Buttler guided his team to a 23-run win in the second T20I with a magnificent innings of 84 (51). The wicket keeper batter smashed eight fours and three sixes helping England score 183/7 batting first in their 20 overs. Following England’s win, the 33-year-old travelled back to his home in London and missed the training session on Monday afternoon ahead of the third T20I. His marvellous stroke play will be missed in the second game as decides to be along with his family on the joyous occasion for the couple. “Jos Buttler is set to miss our third IT20 match vs Pakistan as his wife Louise is expecting the birth of their third child Wishing Jos, Louise and the family all the best,” wrote England Cricket on their X account.

However, he’s expected to travel with the team to the Caribbean on May 31 for the T20 World Cup 2024. In his absence, Will Jacks or Ben Duckett is likely to open the innings alongside Phil Salt in the third T20I. Notably, Buttler left the Indian Premier League 2024 earlier this month along with other national teammates Salt, Jonny Bairstow and Sam Curran to prepare for the ongoing series which serves as the preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024. With England leading the series 1-0 after the first game got washed out, the hosts will look to close it out with a win in the third T20I as well and go into the World Cup on a winning note. The Three Lions are the defending champions of the upcoming event having won the tournament back in 2022 after beating Pakistan in the final. They’ve been placed in Group B alongside Australia, Namibia, Oman and Scotland against whom they will start their campaign on June 4 at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 in what could be his last match at Roland Garros.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 in what could be his last match at Roland Garros. It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has lost a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The 14-time champion, known as the 'King of Clay', was roared on by family, friends and rivals at the scene of his greatest triumphs. Having returned to the tournament he skipped in 2023 and refused to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) 14 titles 112 victories 4 defeats 19 career Roland Garros appearances 96.5% wins 14 finals, 0 defeats 7 sets lost in final, 42 won Three 30+ win streaks 31 (2005-09), 33 (2017-21), 39 (2010-15) Nadal was persuaded afterwards by tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to say a few words to the crowd. \"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent - but if it is I enjoyed it,\" he said. \"The feelings that I have are difficult to describe, it's so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. How Nadal went down to defeat against Zverev... Murray remains proud of French Open legacy despite defeat French Open contenders and who will win at Roland Garros? Everything you need to know ahead of Roland Garros \"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries and I went through a process with the dream of being back at Roland Garros. \"The first round was not the dream one but I was competitive and had my chances. It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun. \"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics. \"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here. I really hope to see you again - but I don't know.\" Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal, the 22-time Grand Slam champion who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, has previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon) A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's No 1 and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Also in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Manchester City midfielder Rodri, no stranger to titles himself, was another famous face in the crowd. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier. Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two break points before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tie-break.

His celebrations were low key as Nadal sent a forehand wide on match point, before Chatrier rose, possibly for one last time, to salute their hero. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, came into the French Open unseeded for the first time and saw his career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament fall to 112-4. His three other losses came against Soderling in 2010 and twice against Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. \"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. Today is not my moment. It's Rafa's moment.\" Italian world No 2 Jannik Sinner looked fully recovered from his injury problems as he saw off American Christopher Eubanks 6-3 6-3 6-4. Sinner, the Australian Open champion, withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed Rome with a hip injury, but was back on form at Roland Garros as Eubanks exited at the first hurdle for the second successive year. \"The hip is good, I'm glad that my team and myself, we were working very hard to be on court as soon as possible,\" Sinner said. \"For sure, the general shape is not at 100 per cent yet, so we try to build every day.\" The Italian broke twice in the opening set to lead 4-1 before Eubanks broke back but Sinner saw out the set with another break, and needed just one break in each of the next two sets to take his place in the second round. A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) \"Honestly, I'm just happy to be back on court, I was injured, so I'm very happy to be back here,\" Sinner said. \"It's a very special tournament for me, it was the first time in a quarter-final of a grand slam, so I have some great memories.\" Djokovic, who returned to the top of the rankings in September, now needs to at least reach the final to have any chance of staying there. The 37-year-old Serb, who said he has \"low expectations and high hopes\" of defending his title in Paris, faces French wild card Pierre-Hugues Herbert in his first-round match on Tuesday.

        "content": "(BCN) — Sonoma County authorities arrested a motorist for alleged reckless driving after a lengthy pursuit over the weekend. In a statement on Sunday, Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office said that around 9 p.m. Saturday, one of its deputies attempted to stop a grey BMW in the area of Santa Rosa Avenue near Todd Road after the vehicle was seen allegedly moving recklessly. However, the driver sped away and after a chase began, the deputy had to end his pursuit as he lost sight of the vehicle near Santa Rosa and Yolanda Avenues, the sheriff’s office said. Minutes later, the sheriff’s office helicopter saw a vehicle darting through the area of state Highway 101 and the Highway 12 interchange. According to the air patrol, the brakes of the vehicle appeared extremely hot through the helicopter’s thermal imaging camera. A deputy tried to stop the vehicle as it traveled on Wilson Street in Santa Rosa, the chase was again terminated for the safety of the public as the vehicle fled toward downtown. A Santa Rosa police officer, who was unaware that the vehicle was involved in a pursuit, attempted to stop it as it turned onto First Street. But it turned onto South A Street and lost control.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Los Angeles Dodgers’ series opener at the New York Mets on Monday was postponed because of a forecast of steady rain. The game was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader on Tuesday starting at 4:10 p.m. Right-hander Tylor Megill (0-2), who had been slated to start Monday for the Mets, will start the opener against Tylor Glasnow (6-3), who had been scheduled to start Tuesday for Los Angeles. Dodgers right-hander Gavin Stone (4-2) was pushed back to the second game, and the Mets will start Jose Quintana (1-4). The NL West-leading Dodgers (33-22) have lost five straight games, their longest skid since six in a row in April 2019. New York (22-30) has lost 10 of its past 13 games. The Mets ended a five-game losing streak Sunday by rallying for three runs in the ninth inning to beat San Francisco 4-3. ___ AP MLB:",

Unfortunately, Delhi government officers did not cooperate with us... In fact, in 2021, we sought information from the Delhi government about the NICU in Delhi. So we got information about 4 NICUs in Shahadra...” said Priyank Kanoongo. He further pointed out, “We even urged the Delhi government to conduct a fire safety audit and submit the report but we received no such report. Prima facie we observed, there was no fire exit in the hospital, nor was there any sprinkler system or fire extinguishers. They had no NOC for refilling oxygen cylinders in the hospital...” Kanoongo stated that NDMA guidelines were violated. He held local authorities, district administration, the health department, the state government, and the fire department responsible for the incident. Lashing out at the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal led Delhi government he said, “This is a failure of the state government... We will prepare a report on the entire incident and hand it over to the Home Ministry...” Earlier in the day, Delhi’s Karkardooma Court remanded two accused, including the owner of New Born Child Hospital case to three days of police custody in connection with the deaths of seven new-borns in the fire incident. Accused were produced before the court after their fresh arrest. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vidhi Anand Gupta remanded Dr Naveen Khichi and Dr Akash to three days of police custody till May 30.

        "content": "US Gulf Coast a natural fit for clean hydrogen industry. The Gulf Coast currently produces 3.5 million tons (Mt) of hydrogen per year, a third of all hydrogen produced in the United States. A major oil and gas region, the Gulf Coast has the largest hydrogen network in the country spanning over a thousand miles and boasts three of the world’s six salt storage caverns. The region around Houston, Texas has the country’s largest market with 36 GW of wind power and 15 GW of solar and strong growth predicted in the coming years. It also has a highly skilled energy workforce, and approximately 2.4 billion tons of CO2 storage capacity. The region is home to major ports that already export energy products, including the Port of Corpus Christi and the Port of Houston, as well as some of the top refineries in the country. Partner at consultancy group McKinsey, said: Ati focuses on strategy, oil & gas, and energy transition at the consultancy firm. “There are lots of reasons we remain very confident that, if there is to be a hydrogen industry at scale, it will happen out of Houston.” Clean hydrogen demand in Texas could reach 21 Mt a year, according to McKinsey in its study ‘Unlocking clean hydrogen in the US Gulf Coast: The here and now’. Around 30%-60% of clean hydrogen projects planned in the region would be located in poor and disadvantaged communities, McKinsey says. The industry could create around 180,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs, and generate around $100 billion in additional GDP by 2050, it says. The Gulf Coast HyVelocity Hub is one of the seven regional hydrogen planned across the country as part of the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program (H2Hubs) and is expected to be one of the largest. The project will receive up to $1.2 billion from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Once federal authorities decide the of clean hydrogen – expected later this year – the Inflation Reduction Act will also provide billions of dollars in tax benefits for hydrogen production (45V), carbon sequestration (45Q), and renewable energy generation (Section 45). HyVelocity has seven project sponsors (AES, Air Liquide, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Mitsubishi Power, Orsted and Sempra Infrastructure) working on nine projects focused on four demand areas: ammonia, petrochemical and refining, ground transportation, and power and utilities. , Executive Director of the HyVelocity Hub, said: The hub is in the planning stage. Following permitting and construction, the hub is expected to start operations by the mid-to-late 2030s. Consistent with the DOE phases for award, the hub team will engage with communities to ensure the hub serves them best. “We want to know what their concerns are, what they’re interested in learning more about, where their job interests lie, what are their challenges, and how we can make sure that we bring jobs and economic opportunity to bear through these projects,” Dalton says. However, until the clean hydrogen definitions are finalized later this year, Dalton is concerned the continuing uncertainty will make it difficult to start building community trust. The hub directors in February penned a joint letter to the Secretary of Treasury commenting on the narrow guidance of the initial 45V proposal which, they said, “may have far-reaching negative consequences for the entire domestic clean hydrogen industry.” One group which says it is not relying on government help and is ready to focus on hydrogen production is Offshore Wind Power Systems of Texas (OWPST), an offshore wind and water desalination company operating out of Dallas. , CEO and President of OWPST, said: The company, which Hines says has the financing and insurance deals already agreed upon but will take funding from the inflation act if it’s offered, can have hydrogen production of some 1,000 tons a day within 60 months of an order. Around 24 to 30 months of that timeframe is just to order the necessary electrolyzers, he says. “It’s taken us about 20 years to get to this point, and it’s been blood, sweat, and tears all the way. Because of that, we’re competitive without the subsidies and we’re bringing our product to the market right now,” says Hines. One challenge for the group is political wrangling, he says. President Joe Biden has bet heavily on environmentally-friendly projects, such as the emerging clean hydrogen industry, through large funding bills such as the inflation act and the IIJA, however deep political divides over climate change mean many projects could be overturned if he is ousted by Donald Trump in November’s election. These can already be felt at a local level. Offshore projects wind projects along the Gulf Coast are currently being held up by the Texas Land Commissioner, which is resisting efforts to auction projects, claiming in a letter to the Biden administration that The White House is “force-feeding Americans failed ‘green’ policies”. the latest news shaping the hydrogen market at US Gulf Coast a natural fit for clean hydrogen industry.

        "content": "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of rampant unemployment in the country and exuded confidence that PM Modi will not become Prime Minister again this year. “There are 2 problems in front of the INDIA bloc. One is rich-poor disparity and the other is unemployment. ‘Congress party inn dono samasya ko ek jhatke se thik karne jaa rahi hai’... A list will be prepared of the poor people in the country. From every poor family, a woman’s name will be selected,” Rahul Gandhi addressing a rally in Bhojpur. He further said that the name of a woman from each family will be selected and on July 5, crores of women will get Rs 8,500 in their bank accounts. “The INDIA bloc will form a government on June 4... On 5th July, Rs 8,500 will be credited to the bank accounts of crores of poor women in the country...This will continue from July to August to September, October, November, December and so on ‘thaka-thak, thaka-thak andar’... And when this takes place if the media will raise any questions, we will say that we will double this amount,” he added. He further hit out at Adani and claimed that the people are getting electricity bills in the thousands because Adani purchases coal from foreign. “The electricity bills you get in thousands are because Adani buys coal from foreign, and till the time that coal arrives here, Adani increases its price, and the government buys that coal at higher prices to help him. Who gives the money? You,” said Rahul Gandhi. The Congress leader in the rally also called up the Aginveer named Vikas Kumar and asked whether he liked the scheme, the Aginveer responded saying “no”. “Narendra Modi’s Agniveer scheme is an insult to the country’s army and the patriotism of the youth,” he said. The Congress leader said that the INDIA bloc is voted to power, it would scrap the Agnipath scheme. “He (PM Modi) says that there will be two kinds of soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country. One, a normal jawan or officer whose family will get a pension, status, and all other facilities. The other, a poor family’s son who is named Agniveer; this Agniveer will neither get the status of ‘shaheed’ nor will he get any pension or any other facility. The INDIA bloc, if voted to power, will throw the Agnipath scheme into the dustbin,” he said. Rahul Gandhi also said that if the INDIA bloc forms the government after June 4, it would open all closed industries and fill up three million job vacancies. “Jiase hi Tejashwi ji ne Bihar mai job diya uncle ji (Nitish Kumar) bhaag gai. Like that INDIA bloc will provide 30 lakh jobs to the youth after it comes to power. PM Modi will not become the Prime Minister again this year after the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. This is my guarantee from this state. As he did not provide jobs to youth, brought Agniveers, he is quite on Caste Census,” he asserted. Under the INDIA alliance agreement in Bihar, the RJD is vying for 26 seats, Congress for nine, and the Left parties for the remaining five out of the state’s 40 Lok Sabha constituencies. While, in the NDA, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will contest on 17 seats, Janata Dal-United (JDU) on 16 seats, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) (Ram Vilas) on 5 seats, Hindustani Awam Morcha and Rashtriya Lok Morcha on one seat each in 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Elections in Bihar are contested in all seven phases. With 40 Lok Sabha constituencies, the fourth highest among all States and Union Territories, Bihar holds a crucial position in shaping Indian politics. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA, consisting of BJP, JDU ( (Janata Dal-United), and LJP (Lok Janshakti Party), secured victory by taking the lead on 39 out of 40 seats. Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan, led by RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal), INC (Indian National Congress), and RLSP (Rashtriya Lok Samta Party), only managed to secure one seat",

        "content": "Jaraka: Ahead of Phase IV twin polls in Odisha, violence erupted at Dharmasala in Jajpur district on Monday afternoon, after a former Sarpanch drove his SUV into an election rally of the BJD, injuring four activists. According to reports, on Monday, BJD Dharmasala MLA candidate Pranab Kumar Balabantaray was campaigning in a bike procession on National Highway No. 53 in the Pakhara Panchayat. In the meanwhile, the former Sarpanch of Pakhara Panchayat, Dilip Behera, who was driving a Mahindra Scorpio, ran into the rally. As a result, four BJD activists were left injured on the spot. However, Behera managed to flee from the scene. In order to vent their anger, scores of people entered the market complex of Behera on Osara Chhak and resorted to vandalism. The mob ransacked Dilip’s office in the market complex and also broke the window glasses of four Hyvas, belonging to the ex-sarpanch. After Dharmasala Police, Jajpur Road SDPO, Jajpur SP Vinit Agarwal reached the spot with a platoon of police force, the mob dispersed soon after. “Strict action will be taken against whoever is found guilty in this incident...

        "content": "Boxing legend Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare en route to Los Angeles, from Miami, prompting medical emergencies according to his representatives. It was reported that he became dizzy, prompting flight attendants to ask passengers if a doctor was on board to assist. Paramedics met the plane upon landing in Los Angeles and treated Tyson after a two-hour delay caused by Miami heat. His representative however said after the incident that the 57-year-old was now in good condition. “Thankfully, Mr. Tyson is doing great,”. The incident comes after initial reports surfaced on Monday morning alleging Tyson “had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded.” Passengers on the flight claimed cabin crew requested a doctor 30 minutes before landing and the message appeared on passenger screens. An eyewitness described the scene: “He was in first class, but we were an exit row. They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, ‘He’s a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he’s OK.’ I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words ‘Mike Tyson’ and she nodded her head yes.” READ ALSO: Boxing legend Mike Tyson to face Jake Paul in exhibition fight The plane landed at LAX and experienced another delay of 25 minutes while paramedics treated Tyson. Tyson admitted to using marijuana daily and has reportedly stopped using the drug in preparation for the fight with Paul. He has also revealed he has temporarily given up sex as part of his training regimen. “He only stopped as a means of following all of the rules,” Tyson’s publicist recently told USA Today Sports. “But he is still a strong advocate for the medicinal benefits of cannabis for his well-being and others like him.” The fight between Tyson and Paul is set for AT&T Stadium in Dallas on July 20. The legendary boxer will be 58 on that night. “I don’t see too many people critical about it. Look at this,” Tyson said at a press conference earlier this month. “Who? Name me somebody. You? Who?” The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation has sanctioned the fight as a professional bout. Although it will be contested over eight two-minute rounds instead of the standard ten or twelve three-minute. The fight will also use heavier gloves (14 ounces instead of 10) to reduce the power of punches. Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2005. His most recent fight was an exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr. in California in November 2020. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

Marjorie Taylor Greene celebrated her 50th birthday Monday by posting bikini pics of herself — and was immediately burned on the internet. The firebrand Georgia Republican shared a photo of herself on X standing poolside, wearing a pale blue two-piece swimsuit and a straw cowboy hat. \"Today I turned 50!\" she wrote. \"Many people go into their 50th birthday thinking it’s a bad thing, but I truly feel it’s wonderful and I’m so excited and grateful God let me live 50 years and do so many things. From being the first person to graduate college in my family, to carrying 3 babies in my womb and the absolute miracle of 3 childbirths, to raising my children and teaching them about God’s creation and man’s dangers, to running successful businesses and carrying the weight of the responsibility, being a member of congress, running, cycling, swimming, competing, training, reading, always learning, creating, building, skiing, surfing, hiking, making mistakes, learning lessons, and most importantly God’s grace that I don’t deserve but am thankful for beyond words, my 50 years have been an incredible journey that I’m thrilled to be on. \"And God willing, I’ll passionately continue each step following Him wherever the road leads.\" Many of the responses were not exactly happy birthday wishes.

In a fundraising email sent late Sunday, the GOP’s expected nominee re-shared a misquoted section of FBI policy that has been blasted as false by several experts — including Attorney General Merrick Garland who called Trump using it as \"dangerous.\" \"This is an Alert from Donald Trump ,\" the fundraiser read. “DEADLY FORCE? Biden authorized it. They brought guns to the raid on Mar-a-Lago!” “I’m sick and tired of the Radical Left destroying this country and trying to destroy me. Here’s the bottom line: I WILL NEVER SURRENDER. AND NEITHER WILL YOU!” The message then asked for a donation of up to $500. The latest fundraising effort was reported by The Guardian . Trump’s claim is based on an FBI policy that, “When necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.” ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy The statement is standard procedure when FBI agents execute searches. Trump was not at Mar-a–Lago when the agents went there. “No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,” the FBI said in a statement. On Friday, Smith asked for an order limiting what Trump can say about the raid , claiming that claims of what some Trump supporters have called an “assassination” attempt are dangerous.

It's also made of \"METAL.\" Downside: You may be a fool if you believe that metal is really gold.

Source: Donald Trump campaign Platinum card The \"TRUMP 2024 BALLOT DEFENDER PLATINUM LEVEL METAL LIMITED EDITION\" is advertised to a \"TOP SUPPORTER\" who has earned Trump's \"PLATINUM RATING.\" That Trump's campaign sent it to anyone subscribed to his email list, including journalists, should provide adequate evidence about its exclusiveness. Source: Donald Trump campaign Black card Just like the gold card and the platinum card. Except it's black. The Trump campaign did not respond to Raw Story's several requests for comment. Among the questions Raw Story asked Trump's team: What are the differences among these cards other than the color? Do donors receive a physical card in the mail upon making a donation or just a digital image they can print out at home? How long does it take for someone to receive a card if physical cards are offered? Is there a minimum amount one must donate to receive a card? Do the cards entitle the bearer to any benefits or perks, and if so, what? Source: Donald Trump campaign Life member A \"2024 Trump Life Membership\" might seem like a pretty sweet deal.

The membership does not appear to come with a public television-esque tote bag or John Tesh CD. (Sad!)

Do different memberships come with different benefits, if they come with any benefit at all? The Trump campaign did not respond to Raw Story's several requests for comment.

Perhaps forgetting that they've run this promotion before, or perhaps hoping that supporters themselves have forgotten this fact, Trump is again promising to \"build a beautiful wall at my office dedicated to a select group of donors who stepped up at this critical time.\" Like another wall — say, one on the southern border — it'd be reasonable to question why the Trump Donor Wall hasn't already been built. One thing is for certain: Mexico can't pay for the Trump Donor Wall, because foreign campaign contributions are illegal, per federal election law.

        "content": "NBA Hall of Famer and broadcaster Bill Walton succumbed to cancer on Monday, the league announced. He was 71. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a press release. “His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. “Bill then translated his infections enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events -- always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” In 468 career games in the NBA, Walton, a center, averaged 13.3 points per game and 10.5 rebounds. He played for the Portland Trail Blazers, San Diego/LA Clippers and Boston Celtics, winning two NBA crowns -- in 1976-77 season with Portland and then later with the Boston Celtics during the 1985-86 season. Walton played for John Wooden at UCLA, leading the school to NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak.",

A hapless American influencer’s disastrous attempt at making a “proper” cup of tea stirred up a real brew-haha that’s left Britons seething — with some even claiming to need “therapy” after witnessing the sacrilegious display. Kelsey Pomeroy, an eager Bridgerton fan hailing from Kansas, left the special relationship more than a little strained after sharing her tea travesty on Instagram. In a cringe-inducing video celebrating the third season of the hit Netflix show set in the U.K., Pomeroy told followers she would be making “the perfect cup of British tea” — only to fail spectacularly. Eyebrows shot up when Pomeroy mixed cold water and milk in a pot, boiling it into a frothy nightmare. One outraged Brit commented, “My eye is twitching with English rage.” “I am an American learning how to make a proper cup of British tea because I’m throwing a high tea party in honor of the Bridgerton premiere,” Kelsey said, addressing her 178,000 followers. “The internet told me to buy PG Tips and Yorkshire Gold. Someone said the perfect way is to boil the milk with the water first, then pour it on top of the tea and then add sugar. But no, I’ll put it in a pan,” she said. The Kansas mom left her British followers bewildered as she heated up her unheard of concoction. Looking puzzled, she asked, “How hot am I supposed to boil? Low and slow, or hot and high? I don’t know.” Kelsey then steeped a tea bag in a mug, pouring the milky mix over it, adding a spoonful of sugar. Unsure about the brewing time, she pondered, “One tea bag or two? The box says brew for one to two minutes, but I feel like the internet said at least three to four. Do I do one to two minutes or three to four minutes? ... I let the tea bag steep for three minutes.” Desperate for advice, she asked, “If you know how to make a proper cup of British tea, what should I change? Should I have boiled it in the kettle?” British social media users didn’t hold back in the comments. One joked, “Sending hate from the UK x,” while another fumed, “As a Brit I’m going to need an obscene amount of therapy to get over the boiling milk.” Another user quipped, “I think it’s funny you said you were gonna make a ‘proper cup’ of tea and then almost instantly chose violence.” A fourth exclaimed, “WHO TF TOLD THIS WOMAN TO BOIL THE MILK.” One even joked, “Genuinely think you may be banned from the UK for this.” For the actual perfect cup, legendary British tea merchant Fortnum & Mason suggests beginning with loose tea leaves, which are easily available at higher-end grocery stores in the U.S. You’ll also need a tea strainer — which can be found for a couple of bucks on Amazon . Once you’ve handled that, here are their specific instructions for making the perfect cup of British tea:",

        "content": "Jacob Trouba’s wallet was a little lighter on Monday. The NHL fined the Rangers captain $5,000 for elbowing the Panthers’ Evan Rodrigues during the Blueshirts’ Game 3 overtime win in the Eastern Conference Final on Sunday, the league announced. The $5,000 is the maximum allowable under the collective bargaining agreement. Trouba elbowed Rodrigues high at 17:35 of the second period after slashing Sam Bennett, giving the Panthers a four-minute power play. Trouba elbows Rodrigues Rangers will have to kill off 4 minutes on both penalties committed by Trouba pic.twitter.com/7MUXHjBj7l But it was the Rangers who lit the lamp during that stretch, with Barclay Goodrow scoring shorthanded to give the Blurshirts a 4-2 lead on his second goal of the game and sixth of the playoffs. The play was controversial as some believed Trouba should’ve been assessed a major penalty for the hit. Panthers coach Paul Maurice mocked the fine on Monday. “Take the hat, pass it around. Poor lad. Poor Jake,” Maurice told reporters . “He won’t be able to eat.” The Panthers scored twice in the third to force overtime before Alex Wennberg won it for the Rangers with his first goal of the postseason, giving the Blueshirts a 2-1 series lead. Trouba, who also committed a holding penalty in the third period, has 20 penalty minutes in 13 games this postseason. Game 4 is Tuesday at 8 p.m.",

        "content": "According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, governance is “the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented). Governance can be used in several contexts such as corporate governance, international governance, national governance and local governance.” In the opinion of UNESCAP, “Good governance has eight major characteristics. It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law. It assures that corruption is minimised, the views of minorities are taken into account and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making. It is also responsive to the present and future needs of society.” In Nigeria, the governance structure is such that there are 11,082 elective political offices comprised of the seat of the president, 36 state governors, 109 senators, 360 members of the House of Representatives, 993 state Houses of Assembly members, 768 local government chairpersons, six area council chairmen and 8,809 councillors representing each of the political wards in the country. This calculation deliberately left out the positions of vice president, deputy governors and vice chairmen of local government and area councils because they are not stand-alone positions. As a notable Nigerian politician jokingly said, they are ‘spare tyres.’ Note also that there are three tiers and three arms of government in Nigeria. The three tiers are the federal, state and local government; while the three arms are the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. These tiers and arms draw their funding largely from the federal purse as laid down by law. While the arms of government receive their funding annually through the federal budget, the states and local governments draw their funding monthly through the Federation Account Allocation Committee. The three arms of government are governed by the principles of separation of powers as well as checks and balances. It is very simplistic and naïve to blame the President for bad governance and incompetence without taking into cognisance that he is not the sole administrator of the country. It is true that Nigeria has an executive president deemed to be among the most powerful individuals in the world, however, he is merely a superintendent. To succeed, he needs the collaboration and support of his lieutenants. His aides whether they are ministers or heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies must cooperate with him in order to succeed in delivering the dividends of democracy. The public servants must play their roles nobly as the engine room of the government’s bureaucracy. While it is true that the president can hire and fire, he must use his presidential powers with utmost discretion in order to avoid sabotage. A president must have eyes for details, be alive to his responsibilities and have an independent way of getting information about the public mood without excessively relying on his advisers many of whom will only tell him what he wants to hear and not what he needs to hear. For there to be good governance, the local government chairpersons and the governors must be conscientious and selfless in the performance of their duties. Personal aggrandisement should not be the sole purpose of being in government. Nigeria suffers from underdevelopment today because our political leaders across the board see their offices as avenues for corrupt enrichment and opportunities to feather their own nests. This is not in sync with the principle of good governance. If we use the eight characteristics of good governance as espoused by UNESCAP, namely – participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive, how are Nigerian political leaders going to fare? Do our leaders believe in the rule of law or the rule of thumb? How much allegiance do our leaders hold to the constitution of the country? There is a provision for the federal character principle in sections 14 (3) and (4) of the 1999 Constitution. Unfortunately, this principle meant to cement national cohesion and national loyalty is observed in the breach. Appointments into civil service and even leadership of MDAs often do not follow the federal character principle. How transparent and accountable are our political leaders? The budgeting process in many states is shrouded in secrecy. Unlike the federal budget that is online, only members of the state Houses of Assembly get to see the budget of many states. In Rivers State, the N800bn budget of the government for this year was presented to a four-member Assembly who returned it to Governor Siminalayi Fubara the following day for his signature. What a mockery of due process! Most local governments do not even have annual budgets; the local council, which is supposed to be the legislative arm, hardly meets. In fact, not a few people believe that local government is virtually non-existent in Nigeria as their roles have been taken over by the state government. Do we have participatory and inclusive governance in Nigeria? If we do, why are the vulnerable groups viz. – women, youths and persons with disability, underrepresented in the governance system of the country? The National Gender Policy of Nigeria stated 35 per cent slot for women in appointive positions but none of the tiers of government have paid due attention to that. Not even President Bola Tinubu has up to 20 per cent of women in his 48-member cabinet. There are only nine women in his cabinet with one of them, Dr. Beta Edu, suspended since the beginning of the year. There are about 11 under-50-year-olds in Tinubu’s cabinet of 48 members. As for PWDs, they don’t even have any seat at the table of the president. He only appointed a Senior Special Assistant. Not a single member of his cabinet is a PWD. This same nonchalance to the marginalised groups is replicated across the three tiers and three arms of government. How then can you claim you’re running a participatory and inclusive government? Ensuring good governance is not the responsibility of only the people holding political offices. Citizens too have a role to play. We should stop placing a heavy financial burden on political office holders. You cannot have your cake and eat it. You can’t be going to politicians for ‘chop’ money and asking them for stomach infrastructure and expect them not to steal to meet your insatiable demands. The reason many lawmakers don’t like to go to their constituency offices is due to heavy financial demands on them by their constituents who want them to send them on holy pilgrimage, help them pay school fees, bankroll the funeral of their dead parents and pay their hospital bills, among others. We’re not talking of a few individuals here but hundreds of people. Failure to meet this need gets the legislature into the black book of the constituents who will promise to punish him or her at the next election. Citizens should also pay their taxes and levies, stop vandalising government or public utilities and generally be law-abiding. It is all these collaborative efforts that will lead to good governance which has become a buzzword.",

        "content": "With the closing arguments set for Tuesday in the trial of former president Donald Trump, defense counsel are in a rather curious position. There is still debate among legal experts as to the specific crime that District Attorney Alvin Bragg is alleging. Trump’s lawyers are defending a former president who is charged under a state misdemeanor which died years ago under the statute of limitations. It was then zapped back into life in the form of roughly three dozen felonies by claiming that bookkeeping violations — allegedly hiding payments to Stormy Daniels to ensure her silence about a supposed affair with Trump — were committed to hide another crime. But what is that second crime? Even liberal legal analysts admitted that they could not figure out what was being alleged in Bragg’s indictment. Now, after weeks of trial, the situation has changed little. Originally, Bragg referenced four possible crimes, though is now claiming three: a tax violation or either a state or federal campaign financing violation. The last crime is particularly controversial because Bragg has no authority to enforce federal law and the Justice Department declined any criminal charge. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) did not even find grounds for a civil fine. Judge Merchan has ruled that the jury does not have to agree on what that crime is. The jury could split into three groups of four on which of the three crimes were being concealed and Merchan will still treat it as a unanimous verdict. The jury has been given little substantive information on these crimes, and Merchan has denied a legal expert who could have shown that there was no federal election violation. This case should have been dismissed for lack of evidence or a cognizable crime. The jury will be reminded that the burden is on the government, not the defense. However, the presumption of innocence is often hard to discern in criminal cases. Most jurors believe that clients are sitting behind the defense table for a reason. That is why many prosecution offices have conviction rates in the 80%-90% range. That presumption is even more difficult to discern when the defendant is named Trump and the jury sits in Manhattan. A classic closing pitch by lawyers is to use a physical object like a three-legged stool. If any leg is missing, the stool collapses. In this case, the government needs to show that there was a falsification of business records, that the records were falsified to conceal another crime and that Donald Trump had the specific intent to use such “unlawful means” to influence the election. Even a cursory review of the evidence shows this case does not have a leg to stand on. Subscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. The dead misdemeanor that is the foundation for this entire prosecution requires the falsification of business records. It is not clear that there was such falsification or that Trump has any knowledge or role in any falsification. Witnesses testified that Trump would sign checks prepared by others and that the specific checks in this case were signed while Trump was serving as president. Some of these checks, labeled “legal expenses,” were allegedly for attorney Michael Cohen to pay off Stormy Daniels. Most importantly, Jeffrey McConney, the Trump Organization’s retired controller and senior vice-president, testified that it was not Trump who designated these payments as “legal expenses.” Rather, the corporation used an “antiquated” drop-down menu where any payments to lawyers were designated “legal expenses.” There is a plausible reason why payments to an attorney were listed as legal expenses. The government also cites the designation of payments to Cohen as part of his “retainer,” which included reimbursement for the payment of the Daniels non-disclosure agreement. However, that designation was the result of discussions between Cohen and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, who is sitting in a jail cell in New York City. The government could have called Weisselberg, but did not. The government has made a big deal over the fact that retainer agreements are supposed to have written contracts. However, that was the failure of Cohen, who was later disbarred as an attorney. For a businessman like Weisselberg, monthly payments to an attorney could have seemed perfectly logical. Once again, there was no evidence that Trump knew of how the payments were denoted. The government must also show that any falsification was done to further or conceal another crime. This is where the defense needs to bring greater clarity to its own narrative. Trump’s team needs to drive home that a non-disclosure agreement is common in political, business and entertainment circles. The payment of money to quash a story before an election is neither unlawful nor unusual. Indeed, Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels’ attorney, described the NDA as routine and said that it was not hush money but a simple contractual transaction: “It wasn’t a payoff. It wasn’t hush money. It was consideration.” This is where the testimony of David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Inquirer, was particularly damaging to the government. Pecker detailed how killing such stories was a common practice at the National Inquirer and that he had done so for Trump for over a decade before he ran for president. He also killed stories for an impressive list of other celebrities, including Tiger Woods, Mark Wahlberg, Rahm Emanuel and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mechan has allowed the jury to repeatedly hear of “election violations,” while blocking a legal expert to explain that there is no federal election law violation. The payment of hush money is not a campaign contribution and, again, the federal government not only declined to bring any criminal charge, but found no basis for even a civil fine. Had he been allowed to testify, Bradley Smith, the former Federal Election Commission (FEC) chairman, would have explained that, even if it were a campaign contribution, it would not have been needed to be filed until after the election — demolishing the notion that this was an effort to influence an election that would have run before any filing had to be made. The defense has to hammer away on the fact that no one has testified that it was a federal campaign violation. Various witnesses, including former Trump aide Hope Hicks, testified that Trump was motivated to protect his family from embarrassment. She recounted how Trump even “wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren’t delivered to their residence that morning.” Pecker testified that he previously killed stories about Trump going back over a decade. That included stories that were demonstrably untrue, such as a claim of a doorman that he fathered a child out of wedlock. In addition to being a married man, Trump was the host of a major television program subject to a scandal clause. He was also an international businessman. Given all of those interests, it is impossible to claim absolutely that the campaign was the reason for the NDA, which was chump change for a billionaire. The government spent considerable time proving facts not in dispute. There is no dispute that there was a NDA or that Trump signed checks on these payments. It is like repeatedly telling a court that a driver drove 55 miles an hour down a highway and elected to change lanes with a signal. The intent is to convince the jury that somehow proving that an NDA was paid and that an affair occurred is proof of an offense. It is not. The supervisor in charge of processing payments said that permission to cut Cohen’s checks came not from Trump, but from Weisselberg and McConney. Trump’s White House secretary, Madeleine Westerhout, testified that it was common for Trump to sign checks in the White House without reviewing them. The entire basis for the alleged criminal intent is Michael Cohen, a disbarred lawyer and serial perjurer. Yet even Cohen did not offer a clear basis for showing a criminal intent to use unlawful means to influence the election. Everything Cohen described could be true and only show a desire to kill an embarrassing story before an election — again, not a crime. Cohen described the mechanics on the payments, but the only person who discussed these payments in detail with Cohen was Weisselberg. Even liberal experts on CNN admitted that Cohen was trashed on the stand. The only crime that was clearly established in his trial was the grand larceny that Cohen admitted to under oath (after the statute of limitations had run out). Cohen said that he stole tens of thousands from the Trump corporation, a crime far more serious than the dead misdemeanor or even the felonies alleged against Trump. However, the most significant testimony by Cohen may be his latest alleged perjury in front of the jury. Many of us guffawed when Cohen claimed that he secretly taped Trump to protect him and keep Pecker honest. No one can explain how that could possibly be true. If it were, he would have told Trump. There is nothing in the call that would have any impact on Pecker, and Cohen admitted to regularly taping others without telling them. Another alleged perjury came with the key telephone call in which Cohen claimed Trump was informed that the Daniels deal was concluded. The defense showed that that 96-second-long call was to Trump’s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, in late October 2016. It was preceded and followed by text messages that clearly shows that the conversation was about a teenager harassing Cohen, not the NDA. Other witnesses trashed Cohen as unprofessional, prone to exaggeration, bitter against Trump, at times suicidal over being denied positions like attorney general and simply “a jerk.” Hope Hicks, a former aide to Trump, said that Cohen “used to like to call himself Mister Fix It, but it was only because he first broke it.” Those were the government’s witnesses. Cohen’s lack of credibility and his admitted financial interest in attacking Trump only highlight again the absence of Weisselberg, whom Cohen references repeatedly as the key person making decisions on how these payments were made and described. If what Cohen said was true, corroboration was sitting a car ride away in Rikers Island. Traffic may be bad but it is not that bad. The only reason not to call Weisselberg was that he would contradict Cohen. The prosecution preferred to use a serial perjurer who roughly half of the country views as dishonest as almost the entirety of their case. Even beyond Weisselberg, there is no corroboration for Cohen’s vague allegations on the record. In the end, this three-legged stool is the very thing that all of us must stand on when accused. Who on the jury would want to stand on this stool with their own liberty at stake? In the end, the defense needs to be honest with these jurors. The question is whether hatred for this man is enough to ignore the obvious injustice in this case. They may have come to this case with little doubt about Donald Trump, but the question is whether there is not any reasonable doubt about the crimes alleged against him. In the end, we are all standing on that wobbly stool when the government seeks to convict people without evidence or even a clear crime. If we allow a conviction, it is more than a stool that will collapse in this Manhattan courtroom. Jonathan Turley is an attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School.",

Memorial Day travelers at LaGuardia should anticipate delays exceeding an hour on Monday, according to the FAA. At around 1 pm, all flights to and from LaGuardia Airport were grounded for at least an hour after which travelers could face average delays of 100 minutes.

It comes as a series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida . Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties.",

        "content": "While Ottawa seeks to deliver a national strategy aimed at curbing auto theft and subsequent vehicle exports, police in Saskatchewan say when it comes to stolen vehicles in the province, few are being resold. Further details were provided on the federal government’s plan last month which gathered representation from police agencies, provinces, municipalities and other partners across the country. The Liberal government proposed Criminal Code amendments and reserved $28 million in its federal budget to prevent theft. Approximately 90,000 vehicles were stolen in Canada last year, the conference heard. In a statement the Saskatchewan Chiefs of Police said to date they have not received any additional mandates from Ottawa on stolen vehicles but “welcome any renewed efforts provincially or nationally.” Mitch Yuzdepski, the executive director for the Saskatchewan Association of Chiefs of Police said auto theft presents differently in the Prairies. “Our experience in Saskatchewan is quite different than what has been an issue in Ontario, Quebec and B.C. where high-end vehicles have been stolen and shipped abroad,” Yuzdepski said in an email to paNOW . A third of stolen vehicles in the province are the result of keys being left inside the vehicle, he said, noting many cars are recovered locally. Anecdotally, many of the stolen vehicles in Saskatchewan are used for joyriding, dangerous driving or being used in conjunction with another criminal offence, such as break and enter. SGI’s spokesperson Tyler McMurchy cited a former colleague of his: “when you have stolen vehicles, there are almost always guns and/or drugs,” he wrote in an email. The province received 3,404 insurance claims for stolen vehicles last year, a decrease from last year’s 3,597 although not every theft results in an insurance claim, McMurchy said. Prince Albert Police Chief Patrick Nogier noted Prince Albert’s statistics are in line with other cities. “The context of the theft differs when compared to other areas of the country,” he said. “Anecdotally we don’t see a huge number of stolen vehicles making their way to the used market.” Nogier said PA Police does not have a unit dedicated to stolen vehicles, nor the analytics to determine whether there were exports. Last year officers responded to 495 stolen vehicle files, which was a nearly seven per cent increase from 2022. Nogier said the more alarming statistic front line officers face is roughly 80 per cent of cases in which drivers failed to stop for a police officer involved stolen vehicles. The upshot is thefts are trending downward for the police service and while prevention efforts continue, Nogier said the primary focus is reducing the threat to the public when thieves drive dangerously. —With files from the Canadian Press — glynn.brothen@pattisonmedia.com",

        "description": "Bill Walton, who helped UCLA win national titles during John Wooden's career and later won two NBA titles, has died following a cancer battle.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, a UCLA basketball legend who became an NBA star and an outspoken advocate for the virtues of the Pac-12 conference as a broadcaster, died Monday at the age of 71 following a prolonged cancer battle. The NBA announced Walton’s death, launching a series of tributes to the gregarious La Mesa, Calif., native who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame and National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton grew up listening to UCLA basketball radio broadcasts and quickly committed to joining the Bruins despite numerous other scholarship offers. His laid-back approach to life clashed at times with Wooden, but Walton called the legendary UCLA coach his lifelong mentor and friend. Freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity squad during Walton’s college career. He was the Bruins’ starting center for three seasons (1972-74), playing on UCLA’s only varsity teams to record back-to-back 30-0 seasons in 1972 and 1973. He led UCLA to back-to-back NCAA titles as a sophomore and junior (1972 and 1973). “On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men’s basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton’s passing,” Bruins coach Mick Cronin said in a statement. “... It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball. Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Following his NBA career, Walton became a star broadcaster known for his high-energy commentary and frequent tributes to the Grateful Dead. He was an unabashed cheerleader for his alma mater and the Pac-12 conference, which he tirelessly referred to as the “Conference of Champions.” He lamented UCLA and USC leading teams defecting from the Pac-12 in search of greater financial stability. The Pac-12 hosted its final event, the conference baseball tournament championship game, during the weekend. Walton was surrounded by his family when he died. He is survived by his wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and extended family. Check back soon for updates on this developing news story.",

        "content": "Brisbane legend Jason Akermanis has challenged 2017 No.1 draft pick Cam Rayner to finally deliver on his potential as the Lions claw to salvage their season. After a promising three weeks, the Lions came crashing back to earth on Sunday with a 25-point defeat to bogey team Hawthorn - their fifth-straight loss against the Hawks. It has left the Lions reeling in 12th with a 4-6-1 record heading into the bye after making last year's grand final. Rayner had just seven possessions against Hawthorn - only touching the ball more than sub Harry Sharp and tall Brandon Ryan, who was making his Lions debut. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. That quiet performance came just six weeks after Rayner produced arguably the best game of his career in a match-winning midfield turn in an upset of Melbourne at the MCG. Since being heralded for what shaped as a breakout game, the 24-year-old has again slipped back into inconsistency. \"Cam Rayner, he's an incredible player, but he hasn't really produced now he's in his seventh season,\" Akermanis told AAP. \"He's really due to play way better footy. \"More in the midfield, 20 plus possessions and a couple of shots on goal (a game) and he's just not even doing any of that - win, lose or draw. \"You watch a guy like (West Coast's No.1 draft pick) Harley Reid in his first year play incredibly well at home. \"For Cam there's not really a reason, unless he's injured and we don't know about it.\" Akermanis played tagging roles in defence and in the midfield before he became a Brownlow medallist and a genuine superstar of the AFL in 2001 when the Lions won the first of three-straight premierships. The Australian Football Hall of Famer suggested the Lions try something similar with Rayner to boost his output. \"Unless you're a natural ball-winner, which he he doesn't really seem to be a guy that accumulates and gets in the right spots, like other players who play midfield all the time,\" Akermanis said. \"He's not getting anywhere near the ball so let's put him in a spot, whether he tags straight out in the midfield and learns where to run and how to run on good players who can take him near the ball.\" Despite the Lions staring at missing the finals for the first time since 2018, Akermanis insists the future is bright for Brisbane and they could use the second half of the season as a springboard into 2025. The Lions have been hit hard by injury with five players - Will Ashcroft, Keidean Coleman, Tom Doedee, Lincoln McCarthy and Darcy Gardiner - sidelined with long-term knee issues. \"The younger guys are getting a taste, where they've just been denied for the last number of years,\" said Akermanis, adding there was \"so much to like\" amongst the Lions' group of less experienced players. \"If I was Chris (Fagan) I would keep working on the six, seven role players you need, to keep them hungry. \"Get them playing a brand that is slightly different to what it is now - even though when they play it well, it works - but the tweaks that they need.\"",

Since being heralded for what shaped as a breakout game, the 24-year-old has again slipped back into inconsistency. \"Cam Rayner, he's an incredible player, but he hasn't really produced now he's in his seventh season,\" Akermanis told AAP. \"He's really due to play way better footy. \"More in the midfield, 20 plus possessions and a couple of shots on goal (a game) and he's just not even doing any of that - win, lose or draw. \"You watch a guy like (West Coast's No.1 draft pick) Harley Reid in his first year play incredibly well at home. \"For Cam there's not really a reason, unless he's injured and we don't know about it.\" Akermanis played tagging roles in defence and in the midfield before he became a Brownlow medallist and a genuine superstar of the AFL in 2001 when the Lions won the first of three-straight premierships. The Australian Football Hall of Famer suggested the Lions try something similar with Rayner to boost his output. \"Unless you're a natural ball-winner, which he he doesn't really seem to be a guy that accumulates and gets in the right spots, like other players who play midfield all the time,\" Akermanis said. \"He's not getting anywhere near the ball so let's put him in a spot, whether he tags straight out in the midfield and learns where to run and how to run on good players who can take him near the ball.\" Despite the Lions staring at missing the finals for the first time since 2018, Akermanis insists the future is bright for Brisbane and they could use the second half of the season as a springboard into 2025. The Lions have been hit hard by injury with five players - Will Ashcroft, Keidean Coleman, Tom Doedee, Lincoln McCarthy and Darcy Gardiner - sidelined with long-term knee issues. \"The younger guys are getting a taste, where they've just been denied for the last number of years,\" said Akermanis, adding there was \"so much to like\" amongst the Lions' group of less experienced players. \"If I was Chris (Fagan) I would keep working on the six, seven role players you need, to keep them hungry. \"Get them playing a brand that is slightly different to what it is now - even though when they play it well, it works - but the tweaks that they need.\"",

Follow Us On May 27, the concept car drawing of a joint sedan between GAC Trumpchi and Huawei was exposed by Huang Yongqiang, General Manager of GAC, on social media. The new car will be launched in 2025. Trumpchi is a brand under GAC Motor. - Advertisement - Earlier, at the 2024 Beijing Auto Show in April, GAC Trumpchi announced a joint innovation plan with Huawei to launch models equipped with Huawei’s Qiankun ADS 3.0 intelligent driving system and Huawei’s latest generation HarmonyOS cockpit system. Furthermore, according to previous news, the two parties will cooperate on three models, namely a large luxury flagship MPV, a large luxury flagship SUV, and a large luxury flagship sedan. The first model will be launched and delivered in the first quarter of 2025. The concept car drawing exposed this time is consistent with the previously announced sketch of the new large luxury flagship sedan. - Advertisement - Cooperation between GAC and Huawei began in 2017 as one of the first Chinese automotive companies to collaborate with Huawei in the field of intelligent connected electric vehicle technology. Then in September 2020, the two companies signed another deepening strategic cooperation agreement to jointly create a digital platform. Later in July 2021, GAC Aion announced its plan to jointly develop a model internally codenamed AH8. However, in March last year, GAC Aion announced that Huawei would no longer participate in this joint development, but would instead serve as a supplier. This termination could potentially be due to Huawei’s style of being deeply involved in the product definition, making it difficult for GAC Aion to adapt since GAC Aion treated Huawei as its supplier and managed it like other traditional suppliers. But this hiccup did not stop the two parties from continuing their collaboration. In fact, in February this year, GAC Trumpchi launched its Trumpchi M8 Grandmaster Pioneer Edition, equipped with Huawei’s HarmonyOS smart cockpit system. Then on March 15, GAC Trumpchi signed a contract with Huawei to join the Harmony Ecosystem and start the development of native applications based on the HarmonyOS NEXT. - Advertisement - Source: Leiphone , Weibo , AutoHome Recommended For You Deepal L07 official images revealed, jointly built by Changan and Huawei New Aito M7 MAX refreshed version starts pre-sale at 41,200 USD in China Avatr 07 from Changan, CATL, and Huawei revealed specs - Advertisement - Join Our Telegram Channel Follow Us On Google News News to your inbox?

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, . Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” The following has been released by the NBA. — NBA Communications (@NBAPR) Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA:",

If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game.

        "content": "Jeopardy! fans stunned by rule shake-up that allows four-day winner Grant DeYoung to compete in Tournament of Champions DeYoung enjoyed a winning streak last week on the beloved game show Host Ken Jennings hinted that he would return for Tournament of Champions However, fan argued that contestants needed to have at least five wins streak By Nola Ojomu For Dailymail.Com Published: 13:22 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:37 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 10 shares 1 View comments Jeopardy! viewers were left puzzled by an apparent shake-up in the show's rules after it was hinted that four-day winner Grant DeYoung would likely be taking part in the next Tournament of Champions. DeYoung, who works as a grocery store clerk, thrilled viewers with a four-day winning streak earlier this month - which officially came to an end on May 21 after he racked up a $81,203 haul. Host Ken Jennings then told DeYoung that 'with your four wins I think that it is very likely that we will be seeing you in the Tournament of Champions.' This raised several eyebrows of fans who believed that the Arizona native couldn't take part due to the fact he had failed to reach the usual requirement of five consecutive wins. Viewers soon took to social media to question how DeYoung would be allowed to take part despite not meeting the necessary number of wins. Jeopardy! viewers were left puzzled by a shake-up in the show's rules for eligibility that would allow contestant Grant DeYoung (pictured) to take part in the Tournament of Champions It was hinted by host Ken Jennings (pictured) that the four-day winner would likely be taking part in the next Tournament of Champions Read More Jeopardy! contestant leaves host Ken Jennings STUNNED with shock on-air confession about the moment he learned he had landed a spot on the hit game show When one fan commented on Instagram, 'Why will he be back? I thought 5 wins for toc (Tournament of Champions)?' To which another replied: 'All 4 game champions were eventually qualified at TOC in the last 3 editions.' They then added: 'With a shorter eligibility window and the expansion of TOC field in the last 2 editions. I think Grant might get in the 32nd TOC. 'Since 2021 TOC where all 4 game champions competed, some of them made it to the semifinals like: Veronica, Ryan B, Ryan H, Maureen, John & David.' Another fan stated that they hoped DeYoung would get the chance to compete as they wrote: 'I hope so. They brought back Yogesh and I think he only won a couple of games.' The last tournament in March saw Yogesh Raut, Ben Chan, and Troy Meyer battle it out in the finals, with Raut being crowed the winner. It wasn't the only rule that DeYoung has ended up revealing to viewers during his run on the show, as many fans were also shocked by the fact that contestants could use chairs. Throughout the rounds he participated in, eagle-eyed viewers spotted that DeYoung was seated in a chair , which is a rarity on the show, with most competitors opting to stand behind their podiums. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jeopardy! (@jeopardy) Fans believed that the Arizona native couldn't take part due to the fact he had failed to reach the usual requirement of five consecutive wins - but that has not been the case recently Another fan explained that 'they brought back Yogesh and I think he only won a couple of games' highlighting a recent change in the rules In a podcast Inside Jeopardy!, producer Sarah Whitcomb explained why Grant was seated rather than standing - revealing all contestants have the option. 'Fans have been noticing that Grant is sitting in a chair during his games. This is something that we always offer to contestants,' she shared. She added: 'We don't ask why. It's not our business. If you want a chair, we'll give it to you... So there you have it!' DeYoung was sitting on a black swivel chair that was adjusted up to the same standing height as the others, allowing him to see out over the podium. In the Jeopardy! subreddit from last week, a curious viewer asked why the contestant was in a chair. 'They give it if you ask - I have some back arthritis that makes standing still for that long very difficult,' DeYoung explained in a comment in the discussion thread. 'I wouldn't expect everyone who sits for Jeopardy! to disclose their reason for needing one but I don't mind saying mine.' While he appeared on the show, DeYoung also revealed he was hit by a car after learning he had made it onto the hit ABC show - but he was so excited he didn't even notice. It wasn't the only rule that DeYoung has ended up revealing to viewers during his run on the show Many fans were shocked by the fact that contestants could use chairs, and DeYoung explained that he suffered from 'back arthritis that makes standing still for that long very difficult' The grocery clerk, who hails from Prescott, Arizona, revealed that he was involved in a road traffic accident at the exact moment he received a text message confirming the news. 'I got off work and got in the car and pulled my phone out and it was sinking in,' he recalled on Wednesday night's show. 'I'm on the verge of tears there staring down at it, and I got hit and ran....' A stunned Ken asked: 'A car hit you while you were getting the text?' 'I had people coming up to me after [saying]: \"Are you aware you just got your car hit?\" and I was like \"no\" holding my phone and staring at the message.' Ken then asked whether he was doing okay. 'The car needs some work but I'm certainly fine, thank you,' Grant said. Earlier in May it was announced that a Jeopardy! spinoff was coming to Amazon Prime and it would give the web-obsessed a chance to test their knowledge. Pop Culture Jeopardy! marks the first time that the brainy series, which was created by Sony Pictures Television's game show division, will hit a streaming service. It will mimic the set up of the original game show - but the question segment will focus on music, films, TV shows, sports, and more.

        "content": "Texas city at war with nearby small town that's been dumping sewage into popular tourist lake for seven years Raw sewage from Plano, affluent suburb, spilled into Dallas' White Rock Lake Since 2017, Plano poop has spilled into waterway 30 times READ MORE: Trump says he wants to move to Texas during Dallas visit By Maryann Martinez, Texas Bureau Chief For Dailymail.Com Published: 13:37 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:54 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 6 View comments Over one million gallons of human waste has been dumped in Dallas' White Rock Lake over the last seven years by a neighboring small town using it as a sewage landfill. The untreated raw sewage came from Plano, a rich suburb north of Dallas, and it turns out, this wasn't the first time. Plano's sewage has ended up in the Texas lake 30 times in the last seven years, according to environmental records obtained by D Magazine . With such a disgusting track record, the City of Dallas is considering suing Plano, best known as home to posh soccer moms with $1,000 baby strollers and major corporate headquarters (Toyota Motor North America, JC Penney and Frito Lay [PepsiCo] to name a few.) 'Same sh**, different day,' Paula Blackmon, the Dallas council representative for White Rock Lake told the magazine. White Rock Lake, where over one millions gallons of untreated sewage have been dumped over the last seven years, is popular with Dallas crowds in the summer 'They [Plano] are aware that we [Dallas] are not happy and that they need to stop. I did call Plano myself and talked to [Director of Policy and Government Relations] Andrew Fortune. They need to get their stuff working. 'B****ing and yelling from the highest mountain isn’t going to solve the problem. They need to fix their infrastructure.' The Dallas official added there were other conversations that happened in executive session regarding the matter, but she couldn't speak about them publicly. The latest spill happened March 14 when a valve at a Plano waste water facility failed, according to Dallas Morning News . It flooded the station and overflowed into a creek that empties in White Rock Lake- some 30 miles south. For 38 hours, brown water gushed into the lake, with an estimated 500 gallons of sewage per minute flowing in. A waste water treatment plant in Plano has repeatedly been the source of sewage leaks into a lake downstream in Dallas White Rock Lake is a popular outdoor venue in East Dallas, surrounded by multi-million dollar homes When the water was tested on March 21, high levels of E. coli were still detected, although it wasn't clear how bad the contamination was. Water sports and other recreational activities were suspended until a clean-up effort or chlorine tablets and clean waster were added to the lake to return the water to safe levels. It's unclear whether the City of Plano has been fined for this or any of its previous sewer spills. In November 2021 more than 320,000 gallons of sewage spilled into the creek after a storm damaged a sewage line. In June 2018, recreational activities at White Rock Lake were also suspended after 1 million gallons of feces water escaped into the lake-- blamed on a broken pipe in Plano. In that case, the contractor breaking the pipe was fine $7,500, according to the local paper. For its part, the City of Plano claims it is replacing old sewer pipes and making improvements to facilities. After sewage leaks into White Rock Lake, outdoor recreational activities have been suspended until water levels are safe E.Coli Texas Share or comment on this article: Texas city at war with nearby small town that's been dumping sewage into popular tourist lake for seven years e-mail Add comment",

        "description": "With summer around the corner, telehealth outlets and medical spas are going into hyperdrive advertising the sale of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.",
        "content": "With summer around the corner, telehealth outlets and medical spas are going into hyperdrive advertising the sale of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Recent shortages of the brand-name drugs have opened the door to copycat versions that, while legal, also raise some concerns for consumers, says Kelly Ann Barnes, Northeastern professor of pharmacy law. The copycat drugs are made by specialized pharmacies known as compounding pharmacies, which are allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make off-label versions of pharmaceutical products that are in short supply, she says. But recently the FDA has warned that some compounding pharmacies are producing counterfeit or improperly formulated versions of semaglutide, Barnes says. She urges consumers to exercise caution when shopping around for weight-loss drugs. Compounding is the process of combining two or more drugs to create a medication, according to the FDA . The process is often used to tailor a medication to the needs of an individual patient, such as to create a liquid version of a pill for an individual who has trouble swallowing, Barnes says. Compounding pharmacies also are allowed to copy formulations of commercially available drugs if the latter are in short supply, as is the case with Wegovy and the diabetes drug Ozempic, she says. Popular demand for the brand-name drugs for weight loss has outstripped supply from parent company Novo Nordisk and placed them on the FDA's backorder list, Barnes says. The supply shortage opened the door for compounding pharmacies to mix their own semaglutide formulations, resulting in an explosion of sale offerings from online telehealth outlets and medical spas. Some customers are mistakenly under the impression that injectable compounded semaglutide is a generic version of Ozempic, Barnes says. \"A compounded product is never a generic (drug). Generic products are approved by the FDA\" in a similar manner to brand-name drugs, although the process is streamlined, Barnes says. The FDA neither approves compounded drugs nor does it evaluate them for safety and efficacy, she says. The day-to-day responsibility for monitoring compounding pharmacies to make sure they follow best pharmacy and sterile compounding practices generally falls to state boards of pharmacy, Barnes says. She says Massachusetts regulations and oversight of pharmacies located within Massachusetts are particularly stringent, tightening after improper practices at the New England Compounding Center led to a nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak that sickened 793 patients and killed 64 people in 2012. The FDA says it has received adverse event reports after patients used compounded semaglutide and advised that patients not use a \"compounded drug if an approved drug is available.\" The federal agency also says it has received reports that some compounders may be using salt forms of semaglutide that are different from the active ingredients used in the approved drugs. It says it's not aware of \"whether the semaglutide salts have the same safety and efficacy profile as semaglutide.\" \"You're not getting the exact same thing,\" Barnes says. She says that's a concern, especially since many people are ordering the drugs online without a physical, lab tests or follow-up appointments. WCVB reporter Brittany Johnson, who interviewed Barnes for a Boston Channel 5 report on compounded semaglutide that aired May 20, says when she ordered the weight-loss drugs online in the course of her reporting, she was promised a telehealth visit. Instead, Johnson got approval via video messages from board-certified physicians and received the compounded products within days. \"In a true telehealth visit, you're communicating person to person,\" Barnes says. It's easy to order semaglutide online, with many telehealth sites offering Memorial Day or summer specials. But before ordering, customers should ask which compounding pharmacy is being used and check to make sure it is licensed in the state it is operating in, Barnes says. She says it's also a good idea to see if the pharmacy is accredited by the national Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board or similar accreditation organization because accredited pharmacies are inspected to ensure high standards. \"You have to do your homework,\" Barnes says.",

        "content": "Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used additive manufacturing to produce the first defect-free complex tungsten parts for use in extreme environments. The accomplishment could have positive implications for clean-energy technologies such as fusion energy. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, making it ideal for fusion reactors where plasma temperatures exceed 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the sun's center is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. In its pure form, tungsten is brittle at room temperature and easily shatters. To counter this, ORNL researchers developed an electron-beam 3D-printer to deposit tungsten, layer by layer, into precise three-dimensional shapes. This technology uses a magnetically directed stream of particles in a high-vacuum enclosure to melt and bind metal powder into a solid-metal object. The vacuum environment reduces foreign material contamination and residual stress formation. \"Electron-beam is promising for the processing of complex tungsten geometries,\" said ORNL's Michael Kirka. \"This is an important step for expanding the use of temperature-resistant metals in that will support a sustainable, carbon-free future.\"",

        "description": "An Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah killed at least 45 people, according to local officials.",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. Video below: Why are war crimes hard to prosecute? In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "content": "REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA— The question of reason is raised specifically in the Quran. The Arabic word aql is mentioned in the Quran 49 times. Many verses even encourage man to maximize the use of his intellect in order to lead a better life in the world. The expert on the interpretation of the Quran, Prof. M. Quraish Shihab, in the book Religious Logic: The Position of Revelation and the Limits of Reason in Islam explains that the word reason itself, citing the opinion of Imam Ghazali, has many meanings. Reason is the potential that distinguishes man from animal and that makes man capable of receiving a wide range of theoretical knowledge. In addition, reason is also knowledge that is digested by a child who has approached adulthood. Intellect can also be understood as the knowledge acquired by a person based on his experience which in turn refines his spirit. Nevertheless, there are limits that need to be known regarding the existence of this reason. As quoted from Chapter al-Mulk verse 10, the word na'qil (we are intelligent) is mentioned, according to its linguistic meaning, aql (sense), which means a leash.” It is a human potential whose function is as a leash that will prevent him from falling into sin.” Such wisdom must be sought to attain it, because it can save a person later. For without reason, he said, anyone will surely fall into trouble even if he has competent theoretical knowledge. Likewise, if what reason is meant is the potential of human thinking that leads it to be able to reach and understand all problems, but it must be said that that potential is not adequate. It is explained that in every religion there are teachings that cannot be digested by reason and practices whose nature is ta'abbudiy that is inaccessible to reason, although they do not contradict reason. “Descriptions concerning metaphysical questions are not within the realm of reason and its ability to digest it let alone reject it,” the Quraish states in his book. He pointed out that there are people who want to see God, but they cannot see the sun alone because all that can be seen is the light. “Even the light we can't catch for long. It shows that humans are cavalier,” he said later. Therefore, in this regard, the Quraish once again emphasizes that the Dzat of God is unlimited. Wherever man is, God is there. “He knows you and is always watching. If I say there is no God, then I cannot accept how something can exist when no one exists.” Also known as rational, this is what is affordable and justified by reason. There is also the irrational, which is contrary to reason and there is the so-called supra-rational which is the true but indigestible essence of reason. Therefore, he said, reason has its territory, and so does religion. The two must recognize each other and must not contradict each other.” Because it is so controversial, one of them must be mistaken,” said the former ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to Egypt, Djibouti and Somalia, adding that there is a difference between something that contradicts reason and something that reason does not yet understand. So in essence, reason and logic can only reach those things that are born and manifest to the human eye. While things are unseen and hidden behind the words, the truth is that if they are not explained by Allah or the Messenger of Allah, it will be difficult and impossible for human reason to reach them.",

        "content": "Photo: District of Coldstream Construction on Rotary Pier in Coldstream has been pushed back. Mayor Ruth Hoyte told Castanet in January that work on the pier was ready to begin this summer as long as provincial permits came through in a timely manner. An update to Coldstream Council ahead of its meeting Monday says work will now begin in the fall. “Archaeological (land disturbance) permits are approved. The environmental permit is expected shortly, with construction expected to begin mid-September,” reads the update. “In the interim, Parks continues to monitor the pier and ensure it remains safe for use.” In January 2023 council heard the pier could collapse in five years. Castanet asked the Ministry of Forests for a status update on permits in January. The ministry was unable to provide a timeline at the time, but said it continued to work with the district. \"The Ministry of Forests’ Archaeology Branch administers the Heritage Conservation Act (HCA) and applications for permits to identify, investigate and/or alter heritage sites across British Columbia, in compliance with the HCA,\" said the ministry in an email. \"The Archaeology Branch is consulting with all affected First Nations on the proposed Rotary Pier Heritage inspection and alteration permits that were submitted to the Province.\"",

The Poland star breezed past Jeanjean with a 6-1, 6-2 win after just over an hour. Swiatek, who won her 15th straight match at Roland Garros, will take on Naomi Osaka in second round. The former has won 29 of her first 31 French Open matches. A look at match stats Swiatek won a total of 54 points and 26 winners throughout the match. She served one ace compared to Jeanjean's none. The Polish star had a win percentage of 78 and 50 in the first and second serves, respectively. She won 10 of her 12 net points. Swiatek (18) had more unforced errors than Jeanjean (5). Jeanjean recorded two double-faults. Swiatek only behind these stars It is worth noting that Swiatek has won 29 of her first 31 matches at the French Open. As per Opta , she is only behind Monica Seles and Chris Evert in this regard, each of whom won 30 matches. Notably, Swiatek reigned supreme after beating Karolina Muchova to win the 2023 French Open. She claimed her second successive Roland Garros honor. First player with this feat As per Opta , Swiatek has become the first player to win 15 consecutive matches at the French Open since Justine Henin.

        "content": "Pitcher Zach Penrod was promoted from the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs to Triple-A Worcester. Shawn Patrick Ouellette/Staff Photographer The Red Sox promoted left-handed starting pitching prospect Zach Penrod to Triple-A Worcester after he dominated at Double-A for the Portland Sea Dogs. Penrod made seven starts for Portland. He went 4-0 with a 2.80 ERA, 1.02 WHIP, 53 strikeouts and 13 walks in 35 1/3 innings. Opponents batted .183 against him. He averaged 13.5 strikeouts and 3.3 walks per nine innings. Penrod is an interesting pitcher to keep an eye as someone who could make his big league debut this year. Boston signed him out of the independent Pioneer League last Aug. 16. He went on to post a 2.18 ERA (20 2/3 innings, five earned runs) in four regular season starts for High-A Greenville, then made four starts for Glendale in the Arizona Fall League. He led all AFL starters in ERA (1.29). The 26-year-old throws a 94-97 mph fastball, 85-89 mph power slider and changeup. On his journey to signing with the Red Sox, he laid floors with his dad and paid for his own MRI. Texas initially signed him as a non-drafted free agent in 2018. But he missed the 2019 season because he underwent Tommy John surgery in April 2019 and the Rangers released him June 1, 2020. At the time, many minor leaguers throughout the league were released due to the COVID shutdown. Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

        "content": "Time is running out to find survivors of a huge landslide that buried many hundreds of people in a remote Papua New Guinea village as Australia prepares a $2.5 million aid package to assist. PNG's National Disaster Centre said more than 2000 people had been buried alive by Friday's landslide in remote Enga province. Australia will send technical experts and $2.5 million in initial aid to PNG as the death toll continues to rise following the catastrophic landslide. Under the Australian aid package experts will provide incident management assistance, support geo-hazard assessments and help early recovery efforts, with the Australian Defence Force also assisting. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"As a close neighbour and friend, we will be doing all we can to provide support,\" Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said in a statement late on Monday. Treacherous terrain in the region and difficulty getting in aid has hampered rescue efforts, raising fears few survivors will be found. Australia is ready to consider additional support beyond Monday's announcement, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. \"(This) package will assist the urgent needs of those affected by this devastating landslide,\" she said. The head of the International Organisation for Migration in PNG Serhan Aktoprak said the conditions on the ground were hampering rescue and aid efforts. Rocks were still falling from the mountain, soil was cracking and water was flowing under the debris. \"We're just hoping that in the remaining short window of time that we have, we can at least contribute to the relief efforts in saving some more lives,\" Mr Aktoprak said. \"But unfortunately, (time) is not on our side.\" Mr Marles said Australia would continue to work with PNG officials as to how best to deliver aid. A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the reported loss of hundreds of lives. \"He extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and expresses his solidarity with the people and government of Papua New Guinea,\" the spokesperson said. \"The United Nations and its partners are supporting the government's response efforts.",

        "content": "A rapid-fire probe into gendered-violence prevention has been launched following a sharp rise in the number of women killed this year. A team of experts on gender-based violence, social policy, diversity and inclusion, men's mental health and the justice system has been assembled to offer practical advice to the federal government. The first part of the research will be completed by the end of June. A number of high-profile cases involving women who were killed by men they knew has sparked public outcry and put the government under pressure to do more. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth said one life lost to intimate partner homicide was one too many. \"In order to reach our shared goal of ending violence against women and children in one generation we must have a considered focus on perpetrator intervention and prevention activities,\" she said in a statement. Labor has promised to end violence against women and children in one generation. The newly-assembled panel will consider all opportunities to intervene and prevent incidents, including \"stronger accountability and consequences for people who choose to use violence\". Shifting attitudes and accelerating that process will also be investigated. Australia's Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner Micaela Cronin, Commonwealth Office for Women executive director Padma Raman and Department of Social Services secretary Ray Griggs will co-convene the panel. Leigh Gassner, assistant commissioner at Victoria Police, will also be on the panel, as will journalist and coercive control educator Jess Hill, along with other experts from relevant fields. In Australia, one-in-five women and one-in-16 men have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. Women were most likely to experience harm at the hands of an intimate partner. National cabinet held an emergency meeting earlier in May on domestic violence prevention. Following the meeting, the government pledged more than $900 million to make permanent a program to provide one-off $5000 payments to women fleeing violence. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14",

        "content": "After a lengthy delay, Android’s Find My Device network is finally here and, with it, AirTag-like trackers for Android. As shipping begins, we’ve just had a chance to set up Chipolo’s new One Point and One Card trackers for the Android Find My Device network – here’s how they work. What’s in the box with Chipolo One Point and Card? Chipolo sells two trackers compatible with the Android Find My Device network. The first is the One Point , a device similar in design and size to Apple’s AirTag. The other is the One Card , which is a thin device similar in size to a credit card. It’s designed to fit in a wallet. Both trackers ship in small, colorful packages. After removing a sticker, you can slide the inner portion out and then pull out the tracker itself. There are instructions printed on the packaging as well as a small user manual in the back. These include setup assistance, troubleshooting, warranty information, and, in the case of the Point, information on how to replace the battery. You can’t replace the battery on the One Card, but there is a discount code in the box for a 50% off replacement when the battery wears out after “at least” two years. Both devices come with a 2-year warranty. How to set up Chipolo tracker with Android Find My Device After opening up each device, the setup process is incredibly simple. Everything is handled through Fast Pair. With a simple tap of the button on each tracker (dead center on Point, in the bottom left corner on Card), you’ll activate it and trigger Fast Pair setup on your nearby Android phone. Or, at least that’s how it’s supposed to work. My Pixel 8 Pro didn’t get the pop-up immediately on the One Point despite already having the Find My Device network available on the phone but, eventually , it did kick in. There is no way to manually add a tracker. Fast Pair is the only way to add a Chipolo tracker to your account. During setup, you’ll be asked to link the device to your Google account and reminded to use the device in a “responsible, safe, and legal way.” You have to agree to the “Acceptable Use Policy” to continue with setup, with the policy largely focusing on the inappropriate use of trackers to track and individual without their knowledge. Google explains three key points on a support page saying that you cannot use one of these trackers to: Track people or track property that does not belong to you. Identify a person’s presence or lack thereof in a physical location without their knowledge and consent. Otherwise attempt to obtain any information about another individual through the placement of a tracker tag without their knowledge and consent. Once you agree to the policy (clicking to read the full policy restarts the pairing process, frustratingly) you can finish setup and the tracker will then appear in the Find My Device app. The process is identical for both trackers. What if you don’t have the Find My Device available? In our testing, setting up one of these trackers can flip the switch and activate the network if it hasn’t shown up prior to that. Your results may vary. What can you do with Chipolo tracker in the Find My Device app? Once paired, what can you actually do with the tracker in Google’s Find My Device app? You can: See the tracker’s location Play a sound from the tracker Share the tracker with someone else Sharing, notably, is handled through a simple link share. When the device is not with you, you can also mark it as lost and get directions to its last known location. Those options only appear if the device is not with you, though. There’s a settings menu where you can rename the tracker (it defaults to the product name) and change the “category” of the object it’s attached to with options such as bag, wallet, and others. Notably, there’s also a way to be “guided” to the tracker’s location. While no UWB is used, the Find My Device app will point you in the general direction of the tracker as you approach it simply by telling you that you’re getting closer. What else do you want to know? We’ll be testing out these Find My Device network trackers from Chipolo as well as ones from Pebblebee in the weeks to come. But, in the meantime, what else do you want to know? Leave comments below and let us know any specific aspects of these trackers you’d like to see tested. The Find My Device network is rolling out to all Android users now, and early tracker orders are shipping starting today. You can pre-order Chipolo One Point and One Card now starting at $28, with new orders shipping in July.

        "content": "( KRON ) — The Fremont Police Department arrested a man who barricaded himself in a box truck earlier this month, the department announced on Facebook. Around 11 a.m. on May 8, an observer heard a woman screaming inside a box truck in the 5500 block of Auto Mall Parkway. Responding officers located the box truck and the woman informed them she had an argument with a man she knew. According to police, the man was identified as 28-year-old Fremont resident Timothy Kime. After the police investigation, officers discovered the suspect had a misdemeanor warrant for theft and a felony warrant for identity theft and evading police. Officers also learned that Kime barricaded himself inside the box truck and refused to leave. The Fremont PD Hostage Negotiation Team responded to the scene and contacted the suspect. The truck’s owner allowed officers to enter and remove Kime from the vehicle. He was arrested for obstructing or delaying a peace officer and outstanding warrants.",

        "description": "The mother of a schoolgirl whose body was found inside a barrel with gunshot wounds will testify for a second day in the murder trial of her former partner.",
        "content": "Kallista Mutten could face claims that she shot her own daughter Charlise as she continues giving evidence in the murder trial of her former partner. Justin Stein's trial continues in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday with Ms Mutten returning for a second day of testimony. Stein, 33, has pleaded not guilty to murdering nine-year-old Charlise, claiming he witnessed Ms Mutten shoot her own daughter. Charlise's body was found by police in a barrel by the Blue Mountains' Colo River on January 18, 2022 with gunshot wounds to her face and back. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Following a full day of evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten will now face cross-examination by Stein's lawyer, Carolyn Davenport SC. The court heard last week that following his arrest, Stein told a corrections officer he was traumatised after seeing Ms Mutten shoot the girl. \"I heard a shot and then I heard her screaming out for me. Then I ran back and she shot her again,\" Stein said, according to the officer. Ms Davenport told the jury during her opening address that it would become apparent Ms Mutten, not Stein, had motive to kill the girl. At the time of her death, Charlise had been visiting her mother and Stein over the Christmas holidays from Tweed Heads, where she lived full-time with her grandparents. During the visit, the group spent their time between a Mount Wilson property owned by Stein's mother, and a caravan at the Riviera Ski Park about a 90-minute drive away. The trial heard earlier from neighbours of the Mount Wilson property who said they heard conversations regarding Charlise's parental custody which hinted at plans not to send her back to Queensland. One neighbour had previously attended a dinner with his wife and mother-in-law where Stein, his mother, Charlise and her mother were also present. \"(Stein) said that if anything happened and the child didn't go back to Queensland that he would end up in prison again,\" the neighbour said. During her evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten told the trial she saw her daughter for the last time on January 11, when the nine-year-old travelled alone to spend the night with Stein at Mount Wilson while she remained at the caravan park. She said the following day Stein told her he left Charlise in the care of an auctioneer who was working at the Blue Mountains property where they were staying. Stein claimed Charlise had been vomiting and was too unwell to travel, and that she was in good hands because the woman was a mother of three and \"practically a nurse\", the court was told. Stein later said he believed the woman was not who she said she was and that Charlise may have taken by former associates from his criminal past. \"I said, 'we should go to police',\" Ms Mutten told the court through tears. \"He said, 'no, because if you ring the police they will kill her'.\" On January 13, while phone data tracked Stein allegedly travelling to three boat ramps across Sydney and eventually the exact location where Charlise's body was found, Ms Mutten believed he was \"going to war\" to find her daughter, the court heard. \"Justin said he's gonna go to war and go to places that he might think that she might be and go look for her and get her,\" Ms Mutten said. Later, she said, \"Justin had called me and said that he 'badly hurt' the man that was in the house (where) he thought Charlise was ... and stabbed him\". When he returned in the early hours of the next day, Ms Mutten says Stein told her, \"It's not them, you can call the police in the morning\".

        "description": "The mother of a schoolgirl whose body was found inside a barrel with gunshot wounds will testify for a second day in the murder trial of her former partner.",
        "content": "Kallista Mutten could face claims that she shot her own daughter Charlise as she continues giving evidence in the murder trial of her former partner. Justin Stein's trial continues in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday with Ms Mutten returning for a second day of testimony. Stein, 33, has pleaded not guilty to murdering nine-year-old Charlise, claiming he witnessed Ms Mutten shoot her own daughter. Charlise's body was found by police in a barrel by the Blue Mountains' Colo River on January 18, 2022 with gunshot wounds to her face and back. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Following a full day of evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten will now face cross-examination by Stein's lawyer, Carolyn Davenport SC. The court heard last week that following his arrest, Stein told a corrections officer he was traumatised after seeing Ms Mutten shoot the girl. \"I heard a shot and then I heard her screaming out for me. Then I ran back and she shot her again,\" Stein said, according to the officer. Ms Davenport told the jury during her opening address that it would become apparent Ms Mutten, not Stein, had motive to kill the girl. At the time of her death, Charlise had been visiting her mother and Stein over the Christmas holidays from Tweed Heads, where she lived full-time with her grandparents. During the visit, the group spent their time between a Mount Wilson property owned by Stein's mother, and a caravan at the Riviera Ski Park about a 90-minute drive away. The trial heard earlier from neighbours of the Mount Wilson property who said they heard conversations regarding Charlise's parental custody which hinted at plans not to send her back to Queensland. One neighbour had previously attended a dinner with his wife and mother-in-law where Stein, his mother, Charlise and her mother were also present. \"(Stein) said that if anything happened and the child didn't go back to Queensland that he would end up in prison again,\" the neighbour said. During her evidence on Monday, Ms Mutten told the trial she saw her daughter for the last time on January 11, when the nine-year-old travelled alone to spend the night with Stein at Mount Wilson while she remained at the caravan park. She said the following day Stein told her he left Charlise in the care of an auctioneer who was working at the Blue Mountains property where they were staying. Stein claimed Charlise had been vomiting and was too unwell to travel, and that she was in good hands because the woman was a mother of three and \"practically a nurse\", the court was told. Stein later said he believed the woman was not who she said she was and that Charlise may have taken by former associates from his criminal past. \"I said, 'we should go to police',\" Ms Mutten told the court through tears. \"He said, 'no, because if you ring the police they will kill her'.\" On January 13, while phone data tracked Stein allegedly travelling to three boat ramps across Sydney and eventually the exact location where Charlise's body was found, Ms Mutten believed he was \"going to war\" to find her daughter, the court heard. \"Justin said he's gonna go to war and go to places that he might think that she might be and go look for her and get her,\" Ms Mutten said. Later, she said, \"Justin had called me and said that he 'badly hurt' the man that was in the house (where) he thought Charlise was ... and stabbed him\". When he returned in the early hours of the next day, Ms Mutten says Stein told her, \"It's not them, you can call the police in the morning\". Ms Mutten called police to report her daughter missing shortly after 8am the next morning.",

        "content": "Dumka (Jharkhand) [India], May 27 (ANI): Asserting that Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) will win all 14 seats in the Lok Sabha polls, former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren's wife Kalpana Soren on Monday compared Bharatiya Janata Party with Bririshers, \"who were known for looting people.\" She also vented her ire on BJP for calling them Vanvasi instead of Adivasi adding that they take pride in their jal, jungle and zameen, calling Adivasis as true revolutionaries, who fought against the Britishers when nobody thought to do so. \"The people of Jharkhand have made up their minds to support the candidates of the INDIA bloc. I cannot say about the country, but in Jharkhand, we are winning all 14 seats...\" she said. \"We are fulfilling our political obligations with all honesty. Election campaigning is on in full swing... Dumka has been the stronghold of JMM and we are going to win here again,\" she added. Kalpana formally made an entry into politics on March 4, this year. In the last few months, she has become a key face of the INDIA bloc in Jharkhand. She is contesting the bypoll from Gandey Assembly seat on a Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) ticket. Launching an attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party, she said, \"BJP feels irritated to even utter the word Adivasi. They don't even call us Adivasi. They call us Vanvasi. But we have been here since the beginning. We take pride in our jal, jungle and zameen. Our great ancestors were true revolutionaries. They fought against the Britishers even when nobody thought to do so. We have the same blood in our veins. BJP is another form of British to loot people.\" Notably, the Santhal revolt (also known as the Hul revolt ) started on 30th June 1855, with the help of prominent leaders like Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand, and Bhairav, and also their two sisters Phulo and Jhano.The depressed and anguished Santhals engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Britishers and formed their own troops which included the farmers, villagers, and the women. In this quest, they were able to capture large parts of land including Rajmahal Hills, Bhagalpur district, and Birbhum. Regarding Kalpana Soren's statement about comparing BJP with Britishers, Jharkhand BJP chief, Babulal Marandi said, \"The Congress party with which they have formed an alliance, their founders were Britishers...Congress party is a remnant of the British...BJP which was earlier JanSangh, was founded by leaders of India on Indian soil.\" Notably, in 2019, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 12 seats in Jharkhand, with the BJP alone winning 11. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Congress got one seat each. (ANI)",

        "content": "The academic year 2024-25 will begin on May 29 across the State, and the Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL) has decided to distribute two sets of unstitched uniform cloth for students of classes 1 to 10 of government and aided schools at the beginning of the academic year itself. Chudidars, which were distributed only to girls in classes 8, 9, and 10, will also be given to girls in classes 6 and 7. Officials said the department supplied the cloth to all the schools. Earlier, for students of classes 1 to 10, the first set of uniforms was distributed by the DSEL at the beginning of the academic year, and a second set of stitched uniforms was distributed by Samagra Shikshana-Karnataka (SSK) by November or December. The SSK released the funds to the joint account of the school headmaster and School Development and Monitoring Committee (SDMCs), which issued tenders at the taluk level and distributed the second set. However, this used to be delayed because of a delay in the release of funds. So, instead of releasing grants to the joint account, the SSK has released the grant directly to the DSEL. The department has taken steps to distribute two sets of uniforms at the beginning of the year. “The cloths have been supplied to the schools, and we will distribute them to children as soon as the school reopens. The parents should stitch the uniforms with their own money,” said the Vice Principal of a public school in Bengaluru South. SDMCs oppose move SDMCs have opposed the release of funds directly to the DSEL. “SSK has violated the rules by releasing money directly to the department. The parents should pay the stitching charges, and it is an additional burden for them. A petition will be submitted to the Chief Minister against this decision of the department,” said Umesh G. Gangavadi, State President, SDMC. Only 60% textbooks supplied Last year, the department supplied textbooks to all schools before the start of the academic year. However, this time, only 60% of textbooks have been supplied. Sources said the textbooks were delayed due to the delay in submitting the textbook revision committee report. “The committee submitted its report to the government on March 5, 2024. In addition, there has been a delay in the printing of textbooks as they have been bifurcated into two books per year from 2024-25. The department will supply necessary textbooks to all schools by the end of June,” said an official. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

        "description": "\"Walton was truly one of a kind,\" said NBA commissioner Adam SIlver. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position.\"",
        "content": "Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton, who played two seasons for the Celtics during the 1980s, has died at age 71, the NBA announced Monday. Walton died “following a prolonged battle with cancer,” the NBA said. Walton played in the NBA from 1974 to 1987 for the Trail Blazers, Clippers, and Celtics. He was the NBA’s most valuable player in 1978 with the Trail Blazers and the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year in 1986 with the Celtics, and he was chosen as an NBA All-Star twice. Walton starred for legendary coach John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting. He was a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued the following statement: Advertisement “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. “As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.” Advertisement Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games. Walton missed the 1978-79, 1980-81, 1981-82, and 1987-88 seasons because of foot injuries. He won NBA championships in 1986 with the Celtics and Trail Blazers in 1977. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game – UCLA against Memphis – in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. Advertisement “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton was also known for his fanaticism for the music group The Grateful Dead. He frequently appeared on television broadcasts and other events wearing tie-dyed shirts with the band’s logos and markings. Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris, and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade & one of the sports worlds most beloved champions & characters has passed,” former NBA star Julius Erving write on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him & to work with him was a blessing in my life. Sorry for your loss Walton family. We’ll miss him too. Doc.” The NBA’s Clippers, for whom Walton played when they were located in both San Diego and Los Angeles, shared a message on social media. “We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport, and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. Advertisement “He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd. The Clippers organization extends our deepest condolences to the Walton family, as well as our utmost gratitude. Bill was a singular force, and we were privileged to know him.” the Clippers wrote.

        "content": "Prey Veng Football Club, a Cambodian Premier League (CPL) member, officially announced on Monday that it has decided to dissolve the club and will no longer participate in football tournaments due to financial issues. There have been better days than this for Cambodian football fans and for football development in Cambodia with the unfortunate news that Prey Veng is withdrawing from CPL competition. The reason that the club is ending its run is an all too common story in Cambodia: the club does not possess enough financial resources to continue operations, leaving it with no choice except to dissolve. “The club has chosen to discontinue participation in football events since we recognise that our financial resources are far insufficient to meet our requirements. With this, we also ask to remove our membership from the Football Federation of Cambodia (FFC) and dissolve the club from now on,” the club said in an official statement. Prey Veng fans expressed their sadness at the news, and they are urging sponsors and others with substantial assets to help out the club to that it may re-enter the league. Satoshi Saito, previous CEO of the CPL, said during a meeting with journalists in September last year that the Cambodian football league is experiencing issues, and pointed out that the CPL is not as competitive as leagues in neighbouring countries like Thailand and Vietnam. This makes it more difficult to attract serious investment, he said. He suggested that several improvements must be made to the league to make it more interesting to football fans. One of them is to strengthen the league’s level of competition, its infrastructure, and promotion to a larger audience. By doing so, CPL teams can attract more spectators to the stadium, thereby encouraging sponsors to invest in football during a time when the league is receiving more attention than ever. Prey Veng is one of two clubs promoted from Cambodian League 2 (CL2) to the CPL for the 2023-2024 season. This season, Prey Veng finished eighth out of the ten league clubs. Puth Thyda, president of the Boeung Ket Football Club, another CPL member, revealed in an interview with reporters in March of this year, that her club is among those experiencing financial difficulties. She admitted that she considered dissolving the club due to the difficulty of finding sponsors to fund the team. “We love football and want to continue operating our club, but it is difficult to obtain sponsors to finance the team. There are few investors interested in financing Cambodian football clubs. It’s hard,” she said. Local media has reported that Prey Veng FC players will try to further their football careers with other local clubs.",

        "content": "Fight fans were waiting with bated breath after a much-ballyhooed boxing match seemed as though it might be put at risk by a health issue. Legendary heavyweight had an apparent medical emergency during a weekend flight, according to multiple reports. first shared details about the scary incident in a report on Monday. According to an unnamed eyewitness, the 57-year-old boxer suffered “some kind of medical emergency” during a flight on Sunday. The issue flared up as he was traveling from Miami to Los Angeles. When the aircraft landed in California, paramedics boarded the aircraft to attend to Tyson, the witness told In Touch. “Before the paramedics arrived, the flight issued an announcement asking for a doctor,” the person said. Is Mike Tyson OK? — In Touch Weekly (@intouchweekly) Tyson’s representatives, however, tried to assuage fears, telling the that all was well. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” they said. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Tyson’s representatives also cleared up confusion about a delay in the flight; the plane had left Miami two hours late. They said that was caused by an air conditioning issue on the aircraft. It was unknown whether the “ulcer flare up” would impact Tyson’s blockbuster fight this summer. He is scheduled to fight social-media star-turned-boxer Jake Paul in a hyped on July 20 in Arlington, Texas. It will be a Netflix special. It’s JAKE PAUL vs. MIKE TYSON — yes, really! — in a LIVE BOXING event at AT&T Stadium you won’t want to miss. Airing live on Netflix Saturday, July 20 — Netflix (@netflix) Tyson agreed to fight the 27-year-old Paul in March, and fight fans have been buzzing about the showdown ever since. Many have bemoaned the 30-plus-years between the two men, which makes this feel more like a vanity project for Paul than an actual fight. That being said, just as many fight fans are interested to see Tyson — arguably the most feared and dominant boxer of the ’90s — return to the ring against the upstart. Paul, who began boxing in 2018, has a record of 9-1 with six knockouts. Tyson, through his illustrious career, has garnered a record of 50-6 with 44 knockouts. However, he lost bouts in 2004 and 2005 — his last two professional boxing matches. Paul is favored over his much older opponent. But as any boxing fan can tell you, sometimes a single punch can completely change formulas in the sweet science — and few punches packed the wallop that Tyson’s did. So long as Tyson’s ulcer issues don’t flare up again, the legendary boxer will have a chance to prove that adage against Paul in July. We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

(NASDAQ: ASTS) between November 14, 2023 and April 1, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important June 17, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline . SO WHAT: If you purchased AST SpaceMobile securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the AST SpaceMobile class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24272 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 17, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) production of AST SpaceMobile’s five Block 1 BlueBird satellites had been negatively impacted by two suppliers of key subsystems; (2) as a result, AST SpaceMobile had not substantially completed the production of the Block 1 BlueBird satellites; (3) as a result, AST SpaceMobile’s five Block 1 BlueBird satellites were not on track to launch in the first quarter of 2024; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about AST SpaceMobile’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

        "content": "Sauce Gardner has a robust YouTube channel where he puts up everything interesting from his life. It all started when he burned a cheesehead to summon Rodgers to New York. And from there, today he uploads videos trying new things or wagering over NFL Madden. The Jets cornerback has created quite a following on his YT channel. And now, in a quest to improve the quality of his content, he has asked his loyal social media followers to help him out. Earlier today, in a post on platform X, Sauce Gardner put up a job opening. He wants to hire someone to make him an introduction video for all his content. A standard intro that encapsulates the vibe of his creative output. Here’s the X post: Gardner is looking for someone who can creatively put together clips from his playing days as well as his luxurious lifestyle. Most YouTube channels, like TV shows and OTT series, have a theme intro and sometimes an outro as well. Recent uploads from his channel showcase that he’s taking his side gig seriously now. And actually putting up content aligned with the needs of the platform. He started the channel a year ago, primarily looking to create buzz around Rodgers coming to New York. From there, he’s been experimenting with the platform in the time he got amidst the season. And now as the off-season is in full flow, he is looking to make the most of it. Sauce Gardner’s Unique YouTube Journey The channel which is named after him, has garnered 37k followers in its year-long existence. Before Aaron Rodgers’ move to New York was finalized, the cornerback posted a video titled ‘I Burned The Cheesehead, Aaron Rodgers to Jets?’ It was more of a humorous try at creating unique content and making Rodgers feel wanted so he chooses the green gang. Although it became a viral video getting over 200k views, the rest of the year was not very successful for Gardner on the biggest video platform in the world. He was not going to stop at just the Rodgers video and had other things planned. But with the incoming season and the barrage of responsibilities that come with it, his videos obviously started taking a hit. The next video that he uploaded was a trailer for his documentary. It did not generate interest amongst viewers and ended up with just around 8,000 views. A mighty fall from his lucrative debut. But he had a plan. After another video where he tried the world’s hottest chocolate, he surprised the world yet again. Releasing a 57-minute documentary , Gardner achieved 282k views on his work. It was a heartfelt piece of content portraying his journey to the NFL. A journey filled with ups and downs. And one that he dedicated to all the young ones out there, who can watch and feel inspired if they’re at a low point in their lives.",

        "description": "Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Mr. Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy,” he said. Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Mr. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel’s close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks. Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Mr. Netanyahu and Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its October 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.

        "description": "As Americans commemorate the sacrifices of wars past, Ukrainians are serving, donating, volunteering and dying now.",
        "content": "It looks like a video shot with a phone from an apartment window. The camera pans a line of cars stopped on the roadway below, and it takes a minute to understand what we’re looking at. Then a cortege comes into view : about 50 people walking slowly behind a coffin draped with the Ukrainian flag. When the shot widens, we see that traffic traveling in the other direction on the eight-lane road has come to a halt, and people have gotten out of their cars. A few are standing solemnly as the funeral passes; most are kneeling on the asphalt, heads bowed in respect. By the time I see the social media post, “The funeral of a fallen defender in Kyiv today,” nearly a thousand viewers have reacted with comments or emojis. Among the most common: Heroyam slava — glory to the heroes. Memorial Day in the U.S. was set aside to honor those who fell in the Civil War. Now Americans play “Taps” and put flowers on graves of those who died in many wars, all in the past. Here in Ukraine, people can only dream of the day when the flag-draped funerals have ended and battles are distant memories commemorated by a nation at peace. More than two years after the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukrainians are tired. The war hasn’t been going well. Many of Ukraine’s friends abroad, particularly in the U.S., appear to be losing interest. According to a March 2024 survey, more than two-thirds of Ukrainians have a close friend or relative who is serving or has served at the front, and with the death toll reaching into the tens of thousands, all too many have lost someone. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the ardor and enthusiasm of 2022 have faded. The most conspicuous sign: In contrast to the first days of the war, when thousands rushed to recruitment centers and waited, often more than 12 hours, for a gun and a uniform, today the army is struggling to enlist fresh fighters , and the troops are suffering for it. It’s one of Russia’s main advantages on the battlefield. Still, even now, exhausted and disheartened as many are, Ukrainians have not lost their respect for sacrifice and honor. On the contrary, it seems to come up one way or another in almost every conversation. Some of my friends, civilians who have not served, argue that we’re all sacrificing just by remaining in the country. Nearly 6.4 million Ukrainians, some 16% of the population, remain abroad, after all, and those still here pay some price every day. “I could be in graduate school in Europe,” said one young man, a civil servant who doesn’t want to be named. “Instead, I’m sitting in the dark, with no running water and no way to heat food, waiting for the next air alert — a siren warning that a ballistic missile is heading my way.” Others dispute that civilian life requires heroism. “The only people sacrificing are those who are risking — and giving — their lives,” economic researcher Alvina Seliutina, 33, insists. “I can’t compare myself to them.” Still, there’s no mistaking her sense of duty. “It’s my country, it’s my family. You don’t abandon your family just because times are tough.” In fact, a recent poll suggests, 83% of Ukrainians are still donating regularly or volunteering, mostly to help the armed forces. Every business seems to have a fund; every social media channel solicits daily. Even students find ways to give. One tries to spare a few hryvnia every time he’s asked. “I don’t want to be the kind of person who ever ignores a fundraising request,” he tells me. Others give on a schedule. One volunteers at a clinic every third weekend; another shells out several thousand dollars every other month to pay for a drone for a friend at the front. Soldiers have mixed views, some more bitter than others, about the growing reluctance to enlist. Valery Shyrokov, 47, an infantryman and mortar gunner who volunteered in 2022 and served, among other places, in the bloody battle for Bakhmut, uses the word “disappointed,” but his manner suggests something far stronger. “I no longer speak to friends who haven’t served,” he tells me. “I can’t stand to be around them.” Yevhen Shramkov, 46, recently wounded in the fighting near Chasiv Yar, is more baffled than angry. “I’m not in the habit of judging other people,” he explains on a Zoom call from the hospital where he is recovering. “But I don’t understand those sitting it out. It’s like passing someone in the street who’s injured or endangered. Who doesn’t stop to help?” He expects to spend another month in the hospital and then head back to the front to join his unit. Both those who are serving and those who aren’t think that if the war were going better, more men would be enlisting. “If we had enough ammunition, if we felt the West were standing by us, things would be different,” one friend explained. “No one wants to be a meat shield for Europe. No one wants to die if we can’t win.” Maybe, maybe not. But the mood is nothing like in the U.S. in the Vietnam era or Europe at the end World War I. Elite units that promise skilled commanders and adequate training have no trouble recruiting. The legendary Azov Battalion is said to attract more applicants than it can accept. And it isn’t hard to sense the guilt, conscious or unconscious, that eats at most of my male friends who aren’t serving. “We know what the fight’s about,” my friend the civil servant reminded me. “Whatever sacrifice they’re making, however big or small, everybody understands why. Our lives are at stake and our existence as free Ukrainians.” Tamar Jacoby is the Kyiv-based director of the Progressive Policy Institute’s New Ukraine Project.",

        "description": "A new study has found that the common over-the-counter painkiller paracetamol does not cause in ADHD in children, a fear that has led many pregnant mums-to-be to worry needlessly, writes Dr Miriam Stoppard",
        "content": "When a woman is pregnant , she instinctively wants to protect her unborn baby from any harm and often refuses to take even the most ­commonly used over-the-counter drugs, such as paracetamol. Well, now pregnant mums can rest easy and take that painkiller. A study has given paracetamol a virtually clean bill of health . This new work is doubly important as it scotches the rumours that paracetamol causes autism and ADHD in the unborn babies of mothers who take it. Mums-to-be should now be freed of those anxieties, as should doctors. The study by Drexel University in ­Philadelphia, US, is the largest ever ­undertaken on paracetamol use, and was done in collaboration with the Karolinska Institute in ­Stockholm, Sweden. Together, they carried out the most robust risk analysis on giving birth to children with autism, ADHD or ­intellectual disability. Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress The strength of the study lies in the fact comparisons were made between siblings, where one baby had been exposed to paracetamol in the womb because the mum took it, and the other had not. The study encompassed data from 186,000 children whose mothers were prescribed paracetamol during pregnancy. “By comparing siblings, we can control for important family factors,” says Brian Lee, an associate professor at Drexel University and co-author of the study. During its follow-up, which spanned up to 26 years, the researchers saw a slight increase in the prevalence of autism, ADHD and intellectual disability in the entire population. So this study is important as it ­distinguished between trends in the general population and trends in the specific group of mums-to-be who take paracetamol. But when siblings exposed and unexposed to paracetamol in utero were compared, the researchers found no differences. This is very good news. “We did not see any increased risk of ADHD, autism or ­intellectual disability in the children that could be attributed to paracetamol use during pregnancy”, says Renee Gardner, associate professor of ­epidemiology and researcher at the Department of Global Public Health at Karolinska Institute, and co-author of the study. “We hope that our findings can ­reassure parents-to-be who are faced with the choice of whether or not to use paracetamol during pregnancy. “However, you should always listen to your doctor’s assessment of whether or not the medication is safe in each individual case,” she adds. I feel sure this is reassuring news for mums-to-be, midwives, health visitors and doctors. Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather'",

The aptly-named The Haven is one of just a handful of homes on a secluded headland, hidden out of sight and only accessible by foot. The five-bedroom property is on Hawks Point, on the edge of Carbis Bay in Cornwall and boasts an incredible uninterrupted sea view . It looks down on Porthkidney Sands, one of Cornwall's prettiest and most unspoilt beaches, just a five-minute walk away down a coastal path. The current owners knocked down the original old structure and built the existing property in 2011. An idyllic coastal home in Cornwall has gone on the market for £2.5million The five-bedroom property is on Hawks Point, on the edge of Carbis Bay in Cornwall It looks down on Porthkidney Sands, one of Cornwall's prettiest and most unspoilt beaches The property comes with breathtaking views, close access to nearby beaches and a sea-facing terrace complete with a hot tub The bedrooms look out onto the picturesque coast of Carbis Bay, Cornwall They used it as a family holiday home and also made a good income renting it out but have decided to sell. The property has 2,296 sq ft of accommodation with a reception hall, open plan kitchen/dining/sitting room, bedroom, bathroom and utility room on the ground floor and four more bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms, on the first floor. There is a sea-facing terrace off the main living space and a hot tub to enjoy the views from. Off two of the bedrooms is a decked balcony which agents Lillicrap Chilcott says has some of the finest coastal views in Cornwall. The breathtaking views span the entirety of St Ives Ba, stretching to Hayle Estuary and along the coast to Godrevy and its famous lighthouse. Porthkidney Sands is a beautiful and unspoilt tidal beach, popular with surfers and dog walkers but remains fairly quiet even in the height of summer due to its relative inaccessibility - there are no near car parks and its sole access is from the coastal footpath. Carbis Bay is a popular area on the outskirts of St Ives and the beach there, renowned for water sports, was the site of the 2021 G7 Summit. Porthkidney Sands is a relatively quiet and unspoilt cove in Cornwall, remaining tranquil even in the height of summer thanks to low accessibility The spacious and airy home has an open plan kitchen, dining room and living space The 'magical property' sits almost within touching distance of the water and has an other-worldly feel Aptly named The Haven, the home is one of just a handful situated on the secluded headland Mark Bracey, from Lillicrap Chilcott, said: 'This house is in a magical setting with truly world class panoramic views. 'It sits out on a promontory above Porthkidney Sands beach and there are about half a dozen properties that can only be accessed on foot. 'That access might mean it is not likely to be someone's first home, but as a holiday home it is ideal. It feels like you are really in a different world. 'It is like no other house I have been to. You hear nothing but birdsong and the waves crashing below. 'Porthkidney is one of the most unspoilt beaches in Cornwall and one of the most beautiful, and it does not get too busy even in summer due to its remote position away from roads. 'The Carbis Bay branch line that takes you into St Ives is a short walk away. If you want the hustle and bustle it's just a short distance away but you can step out of that into this blissful enclave for peace and tranquillity. 'The view and the outlook are second to none. You have a private path that joins up to the coastal path and it's just a couple hundred steps and you're down on the beach within a few minutes.'

He was 71. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "A FAMILY-owned restaurant chain has shut another one of its stores for good after its parent company announced plans to restructure its operations. The Italian restaurant, Wildwood , in Nottingham City Centre is one of 18 sites set to shut across the UK . Fans of the restaurant chain were greeted with signs on the window which said: \"We have to say goodbye. \"Thank you to all who have supported us over the years.\" The restaurant was still getting top reviews before the branch's closure. One customer who took his family to the chain: \"Absolutely fantastic service.\" \"The food is delicious,\" said another. While a third added: \"The food is delicious and the staff very helpful and friendly.\" Tasty , who owns Wildwood and Dim T Asain restaurants, announced more than a dozen eateries would shut following a \"challenging\" start to the year. At the time, a company spokesperson said: \"We understand the impact of these difficult decisions but unfortunately they represent the steps needed to navigate a path through the challenges which are prevalent in our industry specifically, and the economy in general.\" \"We are confident that the changes will ensure the long-term viability of the company and will protect the employment of the majority of our staff.\" Tasty added that they will focus on getting the best out of their remaining stores. A spokesperson for Wildwood said: \"The use of a restructuring plan is considered the most effective means to reorganise the group to return it to profitability and secure its long-term future which should change the financial viability, profitability profile and long-term prospects of the group.\" The company has removed the Nottingham restaurant from their website. The family-owned chain is still serving pizza, pasta and grilled dishes in three midland restaurants - Lioncoln, Hinckley and Rushden Lakes. Tasty isn't the only chain which has struggled in recent times. Food and drink chains in general have been suffering in recent months as the cost of living has led to fewer people spending on eating out. Businesses had been struggling to bounce back after the pandemic , only to be hit with soaring energy bills and inflation . Pizza giant, Papa Johns is shutting down 43 of its stores by next month. Papa Johns currently operates 524 locations in the UK, which are a mixture of owned stores and franchises. Multiple chains have been affected, resulting in big-name brands like Wetherspoons and Frankie & Benny's closing branches. In January 2023, Byron Burger fell into administration , with owners saying it would result in the loss of over 200 jobs . Italian dining chain Prezzo revealed plans to shut 46 restaurants back in April due to soaring energy and food costs, putting 810 jobs at risk. In January 2024 many restaurants just did not reopen after Christmas . Marco Pierre White's restaurant Mr White's Steak, Pizza and Gin House , located in London's iconic West End, closed indefinitely. Meanwhile, Marco Pierre White 's Steakhouse Bar & Grill in Cardiff also permanently shut. Ex-masterchef finalist Tony Rodd was also forced to close his restaurant Copper & Ink earlier this month after he reportedly received a \"terrifying\" £80,000 energy bill. Also, other chains have been forced to put expansion plans on hold. Hostmore, the owner of restaurant chain TGI Fridays and 63rd+1st has said that it will no longer open any new restaurants until at least 2025 , after confirming a drop in earnings. Caffè Nero , which launched in the UK in 1997, pulled down the shutters on half a dozen sites in 2023 in a blow to caffeine lovers . It is not just the hospitality industry, high street retailers have been shutting at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, a major coffee chain with 2,000 branches is pulling down the shutters on an \"exceptional\" store in days. Plus, Superdry is set to close a branch in Dundee this month in another blow to the British high street. RETAILERS have been feeling the squeeze since the pandemic, while shoppers are cutting back on spending due to the soaring cost of living crisis. High energy costs and a move to shopping online after the pandemic are also taking a toll, and many high street shops have struggled to keep going. The high street has seen a whole raft of closures over the past year, and more are coming. The number of jobs lost in British retail dropped last year, but 120,000 people still lost their employment, figures have suggested. Figures from the Centre for Retail Research revealed that 10,494 shops closed for the last time during 2023, and 119,405 jobs were lost in the sector. It was fewer shops than had been lost for several years, and a reduction from 151,641 jobs lost in 2022. The centre's director, Professor Joshua Bamfield, said the improvement is \"less bad\" than good. Although there were some big-name losses from the high street, including Wilko, many large companies had already gone bust before 2022, the centre said, such as Topshop owner Arcadia, Jessops and Debenhams. \"The cost-of-living crisis, inflation and increases in interest rates have led many consumers to tighten their belts, reducing retail spend,\" Prof Bamfield said. \"Retailers themselves have suffered increasing energy and occupancy costs, staff shortages and falling demand that have made rebuilding profits after extensive store closures during the pandemic exceptionally difficult.\" Alongside Wilko, which employed around 12,000 people when it collapsed, 2023's biggest failures included Paperchase, Cath Kidston, Planet Organic, Snug and Tile Giant. The Centre for Retail Research said most stores were closed because companies were trying to reorganise and cut costs rather than the business failing. However, experts have warned there will likely be more failures this year as consumers keep their belts tight and borrowing costs soar for businesses. The Body Shop and Ted Baker are the biggest names to have already collapsed into administration this year.",

        "content": "The clock is ticking for students camped at the Australian National University as a police deadline to vacate the area by noon approaches and those refusing to leave risk further action. Police told the protesters on Monday they could continue to protest but that it had to be at another location. \"Your current position is situated within the primary fire evacuation zone for the Kambri precinct,\" the police said on Monday. \"Non-compliance with this direction by 12pm tomorrow may result in further action by ACT Police.\" Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Those at the camp said they would hold on as they prepared to spend another night in tents amid chilly temperatures. \"We currently have no plans to shut down,\" one protester told AAP. \"There will be discussions based on how this plays out.\" The escalation at ANU follows news of other camps at the University of Melbourne and Curtin University in Western Australia packing up and going home. Campus security told the Canberra protesters to clear the area early on Monday following a directive from ANU. However, the students dug their heels in and put out a call for support from the community. More than 100 people showed up to support the camp as protesters linked arms around the tents to stop anyone from entering. As pressure mounted to make a decision on whether to stay or leave as the police presence grew, protesting students held a vote in which an overwhelming majority voted to stay. The ANU pro-Palestine encampment is demanding the university cut ties with weapons manufacturing companies, disclose and divest from all entities complicit in the \"genocide in Gaza\" and cut academic ties with Israel. The university maintains it has never told the students to stop protesting but they must move to another area to avoid safety risks to all students on the campus. The encampment currently sits in a main evacuation route for the campus and a failed evacuation on Wednesday highlighted \"intolerable risk to students, staff and wider public\". \"Everyone at ANU shares the same sense of responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of our community,\" the university said in a statement. Students at the encampment say the university has refused to meet with them to discuss a compromise before they were surprised with an eviction notice early Monday morning. On October 7, designated terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1200 people and taking more than 200 hostages, according to Tel Aviv. Israel retaliated, launching a bombing campaign and counter-offensive in Gaza that, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians, injured more than 80,000 and displaced more than 1.7 million.",

        "content": "Rugby league player Taylan May is expected to face court accused of punching a woman in the face during an argument. The 22-year-old centre from NRL club Panthers is due to appear in Penrith Local Court on Tuesday to plead on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of stalking or intimidating another person with the intention of causing them to fear physical or mental harm. May was arrested on May 18 after police allege he assaulted the woman on April 8 by punching her in the face during an altercation between the two. He was stood down indefinitely by the NRL on May 23, falling under the game's no-fault stand-down policy, which excludes him from playing until his court case is finalised. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. The league's decision comes after the player recently signed a two-year extension at Penrith Panthers worth close to $1.5 million. Despite their decision, the NRL has said it \"should in no way be interpreted as a view on the innocence or guilt\" of May. A statement issued by the club following May's arrest said they \"will continue to provide support to all parties involved and will not make any further comment at this time\". 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14",

Paris, for its part, rejected the information as \" manipulation .\" Following a Paris-hosted conference on Ukraine held on February 26, French President Emmanuel Macron said Western leaders had discussed the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine and, although no consensus had been reached in this regard, nothing could be ruled out.

As per Hamas health authorities, 35 people and two senior Hamas commanders were killed in Israel’s airstrikes injuring many more. Meanwhile, the Israel Defence Forces said the intelligence-based targeted strike had killed Yassin Rabia, the Hamas commander of the West Bank and Khaled Najjar, another senior member of the unit. In 2001 and 2002, Rabia committed several deadly attacks killing Israeli soldiers while Najjar was involved in commanding shooting attacks and other terror activities in the West Bank. He carried out several attacks during 2001 and 2003 killing Israeli citizens and soldiers. Najjar was also involved in funding Hamas terror activities, said the IDF.",

        "content": "There was a heavy presence of security personnel, including policemen, soldiers, and officials of the Department of State Services, among others, on Saturday at the Gidan Sarki Nasarawa, which is home to the dethroned Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, Sunday PRIMANEWS can confirm. One of our correspondents, who monitored the development, also sighted some soldiers at the residence of the current Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi II; the Kano State Government House and some strategic places within the metropolis as part of efforts to beef up security following the tussle for power in the emirate. Following a new law repealing four emirates earlier created by a former governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, Governor Abba Yusuf of Kano installed Sanusi as the 16th Emir of the state. Sanusi had in 2020 been dethroned by Ganduje over allegations of corruption and other allegations. He was replaced by Bayero, who was enthroned as the 15th Emir of Kano. Ganduje also appointed Emirs for each of the five Emirates, but the controversial splitting of the ancient Kano Emirate into five domains resulted in widespread criticism across the state. Following his dethronement in 2020, Sanusi found himself at the centre of a contentious power struggle but his eventual reinstatement came alive on Friday, May 24, 2024, when the House of Assembly repealed the law signed by the former governor on December 5, 2019. The new law abrogated the establishment of the five new emirates in the state and reverted to the former status of a single Emir in Kano, thereby removing all the current Emirs except for the central Emir of Kano. Governor Yusuf, upon signing the law, gave all the Emirs affected by the law 48 hours to vacate their palaces and hand them over to the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. The governor subsequently announced the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi, whom Ganduje had deposed in 2020 as Emir of Kano. Yusuf said, “By the powers conferred on me by the Kano Emirate Council Law of 1984 and 2024, and supported by the recommendation of the kingmakers, I have the singular pleasure of confirming the reappointment of Muhammadu Sanusi II as the Emir of Kano and the head of the Kano Emirate Council.” Meanwhile, after receiving his reappointment letter on Friday, Sanusi led the Jumat prayers at the Government House, Kano, and returned to the palace early Saturday. A viral video sighted by one of our correspondents showed the moment he was driven back to the palace in a convoy. He was accompanied by the governor, his deputy, Aminu Abdussalam, and other government officials. However, his reinstatement heightened tension within the state as the deposed Emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, whose whereabouts were unknown after the governor deposed him on Thursday, also returned to Kano on Saturday. After his dethronment, a deployment of soldiers arrived at his mini-palace on Thursday. It was reported that other dethroned Emirs – Alhaji Nasir Ado Bayero (Bichi), Alhaji Kabiru Muhammad Inuwa (Rano), Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar II (Karaye), and Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim Abdulkadir (Gaya), complied with the directive. Meanwhile, Bayero’s aircraft landed at the Aminu Kano International Airport on Saturday at 4:30 am, where he was immediately greeted by supporters. He then urged residents to maintain law and order, pledged to obey the position of the law, and called on appropriate authority to deliver justice in the matter, saying justice would prevail. He said, “I call on the people to remain law-abiding while awaiting the outcome of the legal process in this tussle. We call on the authorities to do justice in this matter. Kano is a very influential state in Nigeria. Whatever affects Kano affects Nigeria. “May peace reign in Kano. We pray for Allah to bless Kano with responsible and just leaders. Justice is the way to go on every issue. There will be justice. Nobody is above the law. We will accept whatever the law says. I appreciate all the people who have shown concern. As I said, justice will take its course. We will keep on praying for peace in Kano State. May Allah the Almighty protect us.” ‘Arrest Bayero’ But, in a statement on Saturday by the Director-General, Media and Publicity, Government House, Kano, Sanusi Tofa, the governor ordered the immediate arrest of the deposed monarch for allegedly creating tension in the state. The statement partly read, “As the Chief Security Officer of the state, His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Kano State, Alhaji Abba Kabir Yusuf, has directed the Commissioner of Police to arrest the deposed Emir with immediate effect for disturbing public peace and attempting to destroy the relative peace the state enjoys.” Kano CP speaks Although no official statement has been given regarding the reason for the heavy presence of security operatives, an impeccable security source told one of our correspondents that the men were deployed by the Inspector General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, to the three places to enhance security. According to the source, the deployment of security personnel to all the places was necessary to prevent aggrieved supporters of the two monarchs from attacking one another other. One of our correspondents monitoring the situation gathered that despite the ongoing debacle, the ancient city remained calm as residents continued to go about with their normal and lawful businesses. Meanwhile, the governor and other top officials were still with Emir Sanusi at the main palace while the deposed Emir remained in the Nasarawa palace. Closed-door meeting Earlier in the day, Governor Yusuf and Sanusi had a closed-door meeting with top security chiefs in the state. The top security chiefs who also had similar meetings with the deposed monarch included the Commissioner of Police, the Director of the DSS, the Army Brigade Commander, and the NSCDC commander at the mini palace in the Nasarawa area of the state. When contacted to give insight on the agenda of the meeting, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Abdullahi Haruna, declined to speak. He, however, said the deployment of security agents was a normal security deployment. “The deployment of the security personnel is all over the state and it’s meant to enhance security given the current happenings,” Haruna said. ‘No breakdown on law, order’ Meanwhile, security agencies in the state had promised to prevent a breakdown of law and order as the safety and security of all the residents in the state remain sacrosanct. The Commissioner of Police, Usaini Gumel, in a joint security press conference at the command’s headquarters in Bompai Kano, on Saturday, said security agencies would enforce the court order restraining the state government from dissolving five newly created emirates in the state. Gumel said, “We are calling on members of the public to know that the police in the state are working together with the military and other security agencies and are at full capacity for providing adequate security to everyone as we are committed to carrying out our statutory duties as provided by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Atiku sues for peace Meanwhile, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has said the action of the Federal Government in deploying soldiers in Kano in the tussle over the throne of the ancient city is an “upset to the peace and security of the state, and a breach of the constitution”. He said the Kano State House of Assembly passed the amended Kano State Emirate Council (Repeal) Bill (2024) in consonance with the provision of Section 4 of the Constitution 1999 (as Amended). “Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf’s signature on the bill repealed the 2019 version which balkanised the ancient Kano Emirate into five. The foregoing circumstances happened within the confines of the law and in compliance with the powers conferred on the Governor as provided by Section 5(2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended; and also in consultation with the Kingmakers of Kano, reappointed Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (also known as Muhammadu Sanusi II) as the 16th Emir of Kano State and accordingly handed him a letter of appointment,” he said. Speaking in a statement by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, on Saturday, Atiku said the former Emir could not have made his way into the Nasarawa Palace without the support of the Federal Government, alleging that he did so with the support of the army and other security agencies in his company. “We wish to state unequivocally that if for any reason, law and order breaks down in Kano State, particularly Kano Municipal, the Federal Government should be held responsible for the act of providing security cover to the former Emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, to come back to Kano is an invitation to anarchy,” he wrote. NNPP fingers Ganduje Meanwhile, the New Nigeria People’s Party, on Saturday, accused supporters of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, who is a former governor of Kano State, of attempting to cause chaos in Kano to pave the way for a state of emergency. But Ganduje’s aide and the ruling APC described the immediate dissolution of the state’s four emirates and Thursday’s reinstatement of the 16th Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido, as a “vendetta mission”. The development comes in the wake of two demonstrations on Friday where protesters marched to the Aso Rock Villa and the National Assembly over Sanusi’s reinstatement. Speaking on the issue, the National Publicity Secretary of the NNPP, Ladipo Johnson, said the action of the NSA and the recent weird behaviour of the police showed that they were truly deploying federal might. He said, “It is not a surprise to us anymore as the police commissioner in Kano is beginning to say it is that court order he is following. That was why they used soldiers to take Ado Bayero to wherever they took him to. These people are the ones we believe want to cause a crisis in Kano.” Efforts to get the National Publicity of the APC, Felix Morka, to comment on the matter were unsuccessful. As of the time of filing this report, he had yet to respond to text messages sent to his line for clarification nor did he answer his phone calls when Sunday PRIMANEWS tried to reach him for a comment. Ganduje’s aide alleges coup But Ganduje’s Senior Special Assistant on Public Enlightenment, Chief Oliver Okpala, described the “palace coup” in Kano as a desperate move by the Kwankwasiyya movement and the governor to desecrate his principal’s legacies in the state. “Everybody knows that the government is a continuum. When Ganduje was in power, we all know he did his best and the people of Kano State can testify to that. He left some legacies that are yet to be matched by anybody. “What Ganduje has done in Kano cannot be destroyed overnight by political malice from any quarter. This is because what he left in Kano are monumental legacies,” he said. The APC National Director of Publicity, Bala Ibrahim, also shared Okpala’s sentiments. Ibrahim said he found it surprising that it was the same NNPP government that used to cry that is now ‘approbating and reprobating’ on the issue of Kano emirate. “When it suits them, they obey the court. When it doesn’t, they will disobey. They are forgetting the fact that they are products of a court order. No problem. This is the beauty of democracy though,” he said. When prodded to explain why Aminu Bayero is refusing to let go of the throne after Sanusi’s reinstatement, the APC publicity director believed his action was justified because he has not been officially dethroned. Ibrahim also knocked Governor Yusuf for rushing to issue the former Central Bank of Nigeria governor a reinstatement letter instead of borrowing a leaf from Ganduje’s diplomacy. The APC spokesman also faulted the Kano government over his claim that the judge issued the ex parte order from the United States. Ibrahim said argued that a court order can be secured from a serving judge even outside the courtroom. Don’t resort to self-help The Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, Kano State chapter, Sagir Gezawa, has begged all parties involved in the matter not to resort to self-help. Gezawa emphasised the constitutional duty of state assemblies to legislate and the governor’s prerogative to assent to such laws. According to the NBA, the implementation of law falls under the state’s apparatus and enforcement by a competent court of law once it is assented to by the governor. He also said that it is within the purview of courts to interpret such law to be in tandem with other existing laws or the Constitution. Gezawa urged NBA members to approach courts with competent jurisdiction responsibly. “Anyone found disobeying a court order must be proved to have been notified of its existence through the issuance of Form 48 and subsequently Form 49, as per the Sheriff and Civil Processes Act and various state laws,” Gezawa said. ‘Let peace reign’ The forum of Islamic clergy in Kano, Ulama, has urged President Bola Tinubu to intervene and prevent any actions that may lead to a disruption of law and order in the state. In a statement signed by 18 members of the Ulama, the clergies expressed their concerns regarding the ongoing dispute over the monarchy. The Ulama said, “Kano State is one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria despite its political complexity. The recent happenings in the Emirate if not carefully handled could escalate and degenerate into chaos. “President Bola Ahmed Tinubu must take all necessary steps to maintain peace in the State. Mr President as the leader of the nation should not allow the contest for a royal stool to degenerate into violence. We are calling on Mr President to allow the people of Kano State to resolve these issues amicably without the use of any force and loss of lives. They also maintained that the state government needed the cooperation and support of the Federal Government. Additional reports by Solomon Odeniyi and Daniel Ayantoye",

        "content": "President Joe Biden recalled the loss nine years ago of his eldest son Beau during his Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery . Acknowledging that his grief was not the same as that of families who lost loved ones during the course of their military service, Joe Biden told those in the audience that he understood \"how hard it can be to reopen that black hole in the middle of your chest\" whenever they remember them. \"As it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, still sharp, still clear,\" he said Monday. Beau Biden, a former Delaware state attorney general who reached the rank of major in the Judge Advocate General's Corps before he died from brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46, was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for his yearlong service in Iraq . Joe Biden has repeated that his son's cancer was caused by his exposure to toxic burn pits while he was abroad. Biden also indirectly alluded to former President Donald Trump with a statement of the importance of democracy and respecting those who serve or have served. \"We gather at this sacred place for this solemn moment to remember, to honor, the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives to this nation,\" he said. \"Each one bound by a common commitment, not to a place, not to a person, not to a president, but to an idea unlike any idea in human history: the idea of the United States.\" Earlier Monday, Biden hosted a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leadership, veterans, and Gold Star family members before taking part in the wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with Vice President Kamala Harris , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin , and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Q. Brown, Jr . \"Thanks to our fallen, the bedrock of our liberty remains unshaken,\" Brown said during the event at the nearby Memorial Amphitheater. \"It's up to us to further the cause for which our fallen died and uphold the freedoms for which they fought.\" \"In the end, America's greatest strategic asset will always be our people,\" Austin said. \"So let us always remember our fallen heroes and let us always strive to defend the democracy, [for] which they fought and die. They did their duty and we must too.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Earlier, Joe Biden marked the holiday by spending time with the widow of Beau Biden, Hallie Olivere, in Delaware on Sunday.",

        "content": "Business in Cameroon | Fitch Ratings maintained Cameroon’s long-term foreign currency rating at “B” in its recent assessment published on May 17, 2024. This decision reflects a diversified regional economy and robust GDP growth. However, Fitch has downgraded the outlook from stable to negative. The agency said the state debt of Cameroon, including guarantees, arrears, and debts of the National Refining Company (Sonara), is expected to decrease to 39.2% of GDP by 2025, down from 43.2% of GDP at the end of 2023. This performance, significantly below the median expected “B” rating of 52.3%, is attributed to robust nominal GDP growth and low fiscal deficits. Despite these positive aspects, Fitch highlighted ongoing debt management issues. Cameroon temporarily accumulated a moderate amount of external arrears to the European Investment Bank (EIB) in August and September 2023, before settling all external arrears in a matter of days. This is a further non-compliance with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) target of no external arrears after 0.1% of GDP in 2022 and 0.2% of GDP in the first half of 2023, according to the agency. Persistent weaknesses in public finance management are also underscored by Fitch, with poor cash management and underestimated expenditures, notably fuel subsidies and unplanned security expenses, leading to off-budget expenditures and the accumulation of previous arrears. Although the stock of domestic arrears decreased to 0.6% in 2023 from 0.7% of GDP in 2022, it increased to 1.6% by the end of March 2024. Furthermore, Fitch noted that the government’s debt deficit narrowed to 0.6% in 2023 based on commitments, down from 1.1% of GDP in 2022, due to higher revenues, lower capital expenditure execution, and the deferral of fuel subsidies (0.4% of GDP) to 2024. On a cash basis, Fitch estimated that the deficit decreased to 0.4% of GDP in 2023 from 1.2% in 2022, with net arrears amounting to 0.2% of GDP. The agency forecasted that Cameroon’s financing needs will rise to 5.2% of GDP in 2024 and 4.6% in 2025, up from 4.3% in 2023, due to higher cash deficits. External debt amortization will average 1.9% of GDP in 2024 and 2025, including an annual Eurobond payment of 0.1% of GDP. IMF programs will provide access to financing and support reform efforts. Fitch also forecasts that the current account deficit will average 3.9% of GDP in 2024, compared to an estimated 4.0% in 2023. In political terms, the uncertainty surrounding the next presidential elections scheduled for 2025 contributes to the negative outlook. President Paul Biya, re-elected in 2018 for a seventh term, could run again, increasing political risk in an already tense political climate, according to the rating agency. Despite these challenges, Cameroon is showing resilient economic growth, with GDP growth forecasts of 3.9% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025, driven by non-oil sectors such as agriculture, forestry, transport and energy infrastructure. By maintaining Cameroon’s “B” rating with a negative outlook, Fitch Ratings acknowledged both the country’s strengths and challenges. This decision comes amid varied positions taken by other rating agencies. In a recent analysis, Moody’s decided to maintain a harsh rating (Caa) for Cameroon, despite projections of debt stability until 2027. On the other hand, Standard & Poor’s recently upgraded Cameroon’s rating from CCC+ (high risk) to B- (highly speculative) with stable outlooks.",

        "description": "Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA has announced.",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton was surrounded by his family, according to the statement. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. Walton originally joined ESPN in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009.. \"But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth.

Insights into all the reactions that have since come to light, regarding Prince Harry’s absence from the upcoming wedding have been shared by a pal. This pal in question spoke to The Times and was quoted saying, “‘It’s incredibly sad it has come to this. Hugh is one of the very few close friends of William and Harry who has maintained strong bonds... with both.” In reference to this admission Ms Rebecca English also stepped forward with her own take to the matter. She dished over everything in one of her pieces for The Daily Mai land wrote, “It’s like a game of Twister, a tangled web of turbulent toffs that has sadly been pulled apart.” “I imagine William, though outwardly beaming, will actually feel a great deal of sadness that such a happy day cannot be shared. Catherine will not be by his side, as she continues her recovery from surgery.”",

Their appearance comes after the record producer was involved in a brawl with the rapper at Richie Akiva’s annual “The After” afterparty in Cannes, France. According to Page Six , the fight broke out last Friday around 5 a.m when Travis and Alexander’s friend Tyga were both in the DJ booth at the same time. Richie pulled out the mic and gave a shout out to Tyga and Alexander saying, “We got T-Raww and A.E in the house.” This didn’t sit well with Travis who returned to the stage, allegedly pushing Alexander which prompted him to drag Travis as well. Recently, the couple was seen putting on a united front while strolling around Monaco after arriving via helicopter from St Tropez. Cher and Alexander were also seen entering the celeb favorite hotspot Club 55. Their appearance also comes after the legendary singer said that she’s working on new music with her beau. Cher told a reporter at the 2024 Cannes Festival, “He and I are gonna start a new album. We haven't started yet; he's going to produce it.”",

        "description": "Cars show their terrifying reacting after seeing cucumber because of this",
        "content": "Social media is amassed with funny and viral videos showing how cats react to cucumbers after seeing them suddenly near them while eating. A number of clips show that the owner of cats subtly places a cucumber when their pet is eating. After suddenly seeing a cucumber near them, cats jump and go far away, making it funny for the onlookers. An expert in animal behaviour Jill Goldman told while speaking with the National Geographic Channel that the cucumbers were triggering the cats' natural startle reflexes, reported Independent . She said while explaining cats' terrifying reaction: \"With a startle response, a cat will often try to get out of there as quickly as possible and then reassess from a distance.\" Pam Johnson-Bennett, who is the author of Think Like a Cat was also quoted by the publication that placing cucumbers near where cats eat may confuse the cats further because they often associate those areas with safety and security. Goldman added that it was also possible cats may associate the cucumber with snakes, which can be deadly predators. \"If you cause stress to an animal that's probably not a good thing,\" Goldman stated.",
