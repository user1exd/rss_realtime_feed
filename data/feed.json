Royal author and biographer Tom Quinn issued all these insights into the couple’s dynamic with the Duke’s friends. During Mr Quinn’s interview with The Mirror he was quoted saying, “He is aware that Meghan detests many of his old woke-hating, pheasant-shooting friends and those old friendships are still intertwined with a past that Harry is, in many ways, happy to leave behind.” “The truth is that many of Harry's old friends especially from the military and Eton just don't get on with Meghan.” “Hugh van Cutsem's decision to work with Jeremy Clarkson famous for his savage attacks on Meghan is seen by Harry as an unforgiveable betrayal,” Mr Quinn also added. “The only thing that makes it bearable is that Harry knows Meghan dislikes van Cutsem and his one claim to fame: his ability to shoot deer.” All in all, “For Harry the end of his friendship with van Cutsem is just cutting one of the last few ties with his old life; a life he never much enjoyed anyway.”",

Xavi Hernández was kicked out from Barcelona last week after he agreed to stay in the club till June 30, 2025. He said on Sunday that his skills were not valued in Barca, according to DAZN . \"I don't think the work we have done has been sufficiently valued considering the adverse situation we came into,\" Xavi told the outlet after his team crushed Sevilla at Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán. \"Barça were ninth in the table when we arrived at the end of 2021. We finished second. Then, in the first full season [in charge], we won two trophies [LaLiga and the Spanish Supercopa],” the 44-year-old said. \"This year has not been at the level required, but it's come down to details in several key games. It's a shame. I am sad, but this is the job of a coach.\" Reports from ESPN suggested that Xavi is set to be replaced by Hansi Flick, and the official announcement is expected soon. \"They have to know it is a difficult situation because Barcelona is a difficult club, but also because of the adverse financial situation, above all [LaLiga's] financial fair play rules,\" Xavi told the outlet about his successor. \"It won't be easy at all. They will suffer and they will need patience because it's a really difficult job. The only thing that can save them is winning, whether they have been part of the club or not [previously].”",

        "description": "Following meeting with ministers, CM Gandapur says they have found way through which KP people will get relief",
        "content": "Following months-long tussle and exchange of heated arguments over arrears, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Centre have finally agreed to bury the hatchet and work together for public relief. The development came during a meeting between KP’s firebrand Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in Islamabad on Monday. Federal Minister for Energy Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari and the federal interior secretary were also among the attendees of the meeting. It is pertinent to mention here that the KP government and the Centre had been at odds over multiple issues, including the prolonged power cuts in the province with CM Gandapur even threatening to take control of the power distribution company, the Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) after decrying the excessive power outages in the province. In addition to this, the KP government and Centre have been engaged in a verbal spat in recent days with the former complaining of dues that are owed to the province by the federal government. In March, CM Gandapur threatened to take the Centre to court over the arrears issue. Addressing a joint presser, following a “meaningful” dialogue, CM Gandapur said: “The federal and provincial institutions will work together. [We] will work together to remove the causes of line losses.” Referring to the “consensus” developed between the two sides, the provincial chief executive said that they had found a way through which people would get relief. \"Even though KP provides electricity to the entire country,” he said, \"the province itself is experiencing prolonged power cuts.\" The chief minister further said that he engaged in talks to solve the problems being faced by the province. “We will have to come to the table for the rights and issues of the province.” Since KP itself generates electricity, he said, the people of the province wanted to end loadshedding and seek cheap electricity. CM Gandapur also thanked the federal government for realising the grievances of the people of the province. Quoting PTI founder Imran Khan, he said that their \"fight is not against the state's intuitions\". On his part, the energy minister thanked Interior Minister Naqvi for playing a key role in defusing tensions between KP and Centre and bridging the gap between the two sides. Without revealing details, the federal minister said: “We have found a solution to the problems.” A uniform model will be implemented in KP and other provinces, he added. Referring to the decisions made in the meeting, the minister said that PTI, PML-N and allied parties have taken a “big step” to recover the economy and steer the country out of crisis. Despite having a different political narrative, the energy minister said that they agreed on this agenda for the sake of the people and the country. “We have found a solution to the problems. The solution will be applied to other provinces too.” He vowed to address the issues of power theft and line losses across the country. “The PTI and the PML-N have jointly taken this step to improve the country’s economy.” Talking to journalists, the interior minister revealed that the meeting concluded with a “breakthrough”. He, however, did not give details about the breakthrough and said that the session was held in a pleasant atmosphere. Matters related to public relief were discussed in the meeting, he added. Ahead of the crucial huddle, Naqvi welcomed CM Gandapur upon his arrival at the Foreign Ministry. During his interaction with the media, the chief minister said: Our cases are in the courts and we hope that we will get relief from the courts. I am sitting with them [federal ministers] to solve the problems of the people of his province. In political matters, different things should not be mixed.”",

        "description": "Skin allergies and heat rashes are most common during the scorching months, says skin specialist",
        "content": "ISLAMABAD: Skin specialists have warned that citizens need to adopt adequate steps to avoid skin ailments during the current weather conditions as harsh ultraviolet rays and the increasing humidity can lead to a lot of sweating, which in turn results in skin ailments like skin burns and infections. Talking to PTV News channel on Monday, a renowned skin specialist Dr Mubashir Mushtaq Daha said that skin allergies and heat rashes are most common during the scorching months when the mercury shoots up, adding, that sunburn can increase the chance of skin cancer. However, citizens should protect their skin from harmful rays all year round, but especially in the extra-sunny days of summer, he added. The specialist further explained that the sun and heat can dry out your skin. Dry skin in the summer can occur due to a variety of factors, such as excessive sun exposure, hot showers, and not drinking enough water. The cases of fungal infection are at their peak this summer. The cases are common in all age groups, mostly in the moving population from one city to another, he added. Aloe vera and rose water can soothe the skin, so people can apply them to the skin to bring relief from itching, he advised. Citizens should wear lightweight and breathable fabrics like cotton or linen which allow human skin to breathe and prevent the build-up of moisture. Wearing tight clothes can cause more sweating which creates an ideal environment for growth, increasing the susceptibility to infection, he warned. Insects become more active during the summer, and their stings or bites can cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Bee stings, ant bites, and mosquito bites are common triggers. These reactions can vary from mild redness to severe swelling, Dr Khurram Mushir, another skin specialist added. Seasonal allergies can also affect the skin, especially during the high pollen season. Allergic individuals may experience contact dermatitis. The typical symptom is an itchy rash after contact or indirect exposure to plants or grasses, he mentioned. Additionally, keep in mind that home remedies provide soothing relief for mild reactions, but for severe symptoms, it is best to seek medical attention, the expert added.",

(Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND / AFP) From Australia, China and the United States, Rafael Nadal fans descended on a chilly and damp Roland Garros on Monday, hoping to inspire their “super hero” to victory at the French Open. Nadal, the record 14-time champion, was taking on Alexander Zverev in a tough first round encounter for a player whose career twilight has been stalled by injury. His army of fans hope that whatever happens on the Philippe Chatrier Court, which the Spanish star has dominated for the best part of 20 years, he will remain true to his word and not retire despite his 38th birthday fast approaching. Chills ❤️ #RolandGarros @RafaelNadal pic.twitter.com/K44H0v2wrD — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 “You always have to keep the faith in Rafa, he will win,” Hazel, a 28-year-old fan who had flown in from China for a second straight year after being left disappointed when Nadal withdrew in 2023, told AFP. “The most important thing is that he stays healthy,” she says, as she proudly showed the banners she had made with the colors of Spain, Nadal’s face and the message “Welcome back my super hero”. Nadal has only lost three times in 115 matches at the tournament since his title-winning debut as a 19-year-old in 2005. He said at the weekend that there was a chance this may be his last French Open but insisted he was still keeping the door “100% open” on continuing his career. “You see a lot of ‘Thank you Rafa’ shirts. He’s a monument at this tournament,” said 41-year-old Manolo who has come to Europe from the United States to watch Nadal and then Real Madrid play in the Champions League final in London this Saturday. He has seen Nadal win at Wimbledon and the US Open as well as Paris but admits Monday’s clash with world number four Zverev “will be very difficult”. “I hope he beats Zverev... Rafa is Rafa,” he said. “It’s possibly the last time he plays here, so we’re very happy to watch him,” said Alsi, a 40-year-old fan living in Australia.

Deputy Governor Adnan Zaylani Mohamad Zahid said the foreign exchange policy flexibilities, as a package, are expected to reduce the concern of foreign exchange mismatch for both the lender and the borrower. “Another shared priority is our respective focus on green finance and sustainability agenda. “We would also like to welcome greater engagement from multilateral development banks such as the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) to participate in providing financing and critical expertise in the area of sustainable development in Malaysia, particularly in green finance and sustainability,” he said during a keynote address at the roundtable discussion between the IsDB and Malaysia’s Islamic Financial Markets Subcommittee (IFMC) today. According to Adnan, identifying common priorities for the IsDB and Malaysia will enable the banks to channel resources and focus efforts more effectively. “It is instrumental in facilitating a deeper understanding of each other’s investment preferences and risk appetites, paving the way for mutually beneficial investment linkages,” he added. — Bernama",

        "content": "A millennial mom-of-three has shared a story online about how her children under 10 reacted when they found out how she was punished as a kid. Lisa Pontius, 36, told her 9-year-old daughter that she had to stand in a corner for a time-out and had soap or chili peppers put on her tongue if she used a bad word or talked back to her parents. Pontius, from Charleston, South Carolina, said that her child was shocked, to say the least, and extremely grateful that these methods aren't used in their home. discussed the clip that has over 481,200 views on with homemaker Pontius. According to a 2023 study of 1,000 millennial parents across the United States, 88 percent say their current parenting style is different from how they were raised. \"It takes practice!\" Pontius said. \"It took time to rewrite my brain, and I still have more work to do. But perfection isn't the goal. Being human is OK, and no one is too high and mighty to offer an apology when they react out of anger, especially to their kids. \"Over time, I have managed to increase my patience and my reactions to my kids, and they are now coming from a much more logical place than a reactive place—that doesn't mean it's not still driving me nuts on the inside.\" During the video, Lisa said that her daughter asked why her parents would do such things, and she pointed out that they wanted her to \"hurt.\" \"They wanted to cause me suffering as a punishment,\" she said. In the previously mentioned study conducted by Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, 74 percent of millennial parents embrace gentle parenting. This approach involves guiding children through decision-making without resorting to threats or punishment. emphasizes a collaborative relationship between parents and children, prioritizing communication, empathy, respect, and clear boundaries. Pontius told how she disciplines her children without creating fear or pain. \"I set boundaries and follow through with consequences that make sense, not arbitrary punishments,\" she said. \"I always have with my kids about why we have the rules we do, and they are allowed to ask questions or debate a punishment reason; if they make a good argument, I will hear them out. \"I try to guide my kids, who are 9, 8, and 2, to make good decisions and show them why bad decisions will hurt them in the long run. When the consequences are more natural, I feel kids will learn the necessary lesson rather than just be afraid of me as a harbinger of punishment.\" Pontius said that she researched respectful parenting and learned that it requires patience, reasoning and emotional regulation, and apologizing. So far, the clip has over 59,000 likes and more than 2,000 comments—many from parents sharing their childhood experiences. \"The sound of my own belt coming off at the end of the day still scares me sometimes,\" said one TikTok user. Another person wrote: \"And 'talking back' was us defending ourselves or asking more questions.\" \"My dad looked at me one day and told me 'I see you and than we did for you, and I'm sorry.' It was validating,\" said one commenter. A fourth person wrote, \"My kid dropped a plate of food upstairs, on the carpet. No big deal - no need to get upset - let's fix the problem together... vs me would have been grounded for a week and yelled at for a while.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "THE Transportation department is considering the realignment proposal for the Bulacan segment of the Metro Rail Transit 7 (MRT-7). “The Department of Transportation (DoTr) is studying the best possible alignment for San Jose City,” Jeremy S. Regino, undersecretary for railways, said in a Viber message to BusinessWorld . The DoTr has said that the MRT-7 project is experiencing delays due to the right-of-way issues particularly in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. Last week, Bulacan province said the possible realignment of MRT-7 went through the required consultation process. According to the Bulacan government, it has proposed to divert the Quirino highway route as it is considered a key thoroughfare in the area. The MRT-7 has a total of 14 stations. It will run from Quezon City to San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, and is expected to carry 300,000 passengers daily in its first year, and up to 850,000 passengers a day in its 12 th year. The commuter rail line’s stations are Quezon North Avenue Joint Station, Quezon Memorial Circle, University Avenue, Tandang Sora, Don Antonio, Batasan, Manggahan, Doña Carmen, Regalado, Mindanao Avenue, Quirino, Sacred Heart, Tala, and San Jose del Monte. The project is run by San Miguel Corp., with the company financing the construction and set to operate the 23-kilometer commuter rail system under a 25-year concession agreement with the government. The Transportation department has said it is looking at opening the Quezon North Avenue Joint Station to Lagro by the first quarter of 2025. The full completion of the MRT-7 Bulacan segment is facing some right-of-way issues particularly in its Bulacan segment, the DoTr said, noting that oppositors are saying that the construction will cause heavy traffic flow in the area. The Bulacan leg of the MRT-7 will not be completed by 2025 as only 12 stations of the commuter rail line will be operating by then, the DoTr said, adding that the new target for the line’s full operations is between 2027 and 2028. — Ashley Erika O.

        "content": "With the Boston Celtics cakewalking their way to the NBA Finals, one can’t help but reflect on the seven other playoff teams that couldn’t make the cut in the decimated Eastern Conference. The Pacers and Magic, both brimming with youthful potential, still need reinforcements. The Cavaliers and Knicks, both plagued by injuries, were always more pretenders than contenders. The Heat and Bucks, both victims of aging rosters and injury woes, find themselves in need of something fresh. And then there’s the Philadelphia 76ers. Yet again, they crumbled in the first round, marking the seventh straight season they have reached the playoffs but lost in the first two rounds. But this season felt different, didn’t it? Joel Embiid was outperforming his MVP campaign from a year before, Tyrese Maxey emerged as an All-Star, and Nick Nurse’s system had the team on a blistering 66-win pace when Embiid and Maxey were healthy. But Embiid’s meniscus injury derailed everything, and he and the Sixers never fully recovered. We’re in the middle of the conference finals, and the Sixers are sitting at home again. How can they get over the hump to play this time next year? Or are they destined to restart the Process? For all the talk about how superstars win titles, good health and quality depth are also crucial components of the equation. Even great players like Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic needed the right pieces around them to maximize their potential. Dallas has won every trade in recent years, acquiring Kyrie Irving in an all-time great buy low before last season and adding P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford at the most recent deadline. Boston has assembled a roster of high-caliber players so deep that it can withstand the loss of an All-Star like Kristaps Porzingis. Yes, the Celtics have benefited from the fact that their playoff opponents lost their best players: Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, and Tyrese Haliburton. Their path has been easy, but it speaks volumes that they’ve managed to waltz through three rounds despite the loss of their starting center. Related Contrast that with the Sixers, who plummeted without Embiid this season, playing at a miserable 30-win pace in his combined absences. As good as Maxey was all year, he couldn’t help the Sixers stay afloat by himself. Even more support will be needed in the years to come. (Sorry, Buddy Hield isn’t getting it done.) Embiid, now 30, adds to his list of injuries nearly every year. The Sixers can’t just aim to build a solid roster around Embiid; they must construct a team capable of thriving without him, whether it’s because of an absence or load management. Otherwise, they’ll just keep risking low seeding and grueling paths to the playoffs. To support Tatum and Jaylen Brown, Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens shrewdly targeted undervalued assets like Porzingis and Derrick White. Then he nabbed Jrue Holiday, who surprisingly became available last summer after the Bucks reshuffled. Stevens executed the classic championship strategy, much like Milwaukee once did with Holiday and Denver did with Aaron Gordon: build a robust supporting cast for your stars by turning other teams’ starters into star role players. This is the blueprint for any team aspiring to be a title favorite, but no team with an MVP talent has the flexibility the Sixers will enjoy this summer. The Sixers can create more than $60 million in cap space this offseason; plus, they can deal up to four first-round picks and two pick swaps. With this type of arsenal, Sixers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey is positioned to dramatically reshape the roster around Embiid and Maxey. The question is whether he’ll be able to capitalize on this golden opportunity. Last week on The Bill Simmons Podcast , I shared that sources around the NBA believe the 76ers have a real chance of signing Paul George this summer. Although George just turned 34, he’s still a tremendous scorer, facilitator, and defender. As The Ringer ’s Chris Ryan aptly described him : “The Robin who plays like Batman, he’s capable of MVP-like play, as well as a myriad of complementary contributions.” Spot-on. One night, George plays like an MVP. The next, he’s an elite 3-and-D role player. This type of versatility is exactly what the Sixers need. They’re looking for another star, but they also need players who can fill various roles. PG-13 is both, which is why sources familiar with Philly’s strategy say he is the team’s plan A in free agency. I was floored by some of the responses on X and Instagram to my BS Pod appearance: George is the next Tobias Harris . Sign Kentavious Caldwell-Pope instead . George is washed! There will never be a consensus on anything, but I’m surprised Philly fans aren’t over the moon about George’s possibility. He’s never played with a star like Embiid, and the last time he played with a speedy guard like Maxey, he turned in the best basketball of his career in Oklahoma City. Or maybe it’s more simple: Sixers fans are just traumatized by previous failed acquisitions during the Embiid era. But let’s get real—Harris has never been a top 30 or maybe even top 50 player. George, on the other hand, has been one of the league’s best players for a decade and remains a top 25 guy today. Even if he played a reduced role in Philly’s offense, his knockdown shooting ability is invaluable. George shot 45.4 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s last season, per NBA Advanced Stats. That’s a higher percentage than Harris (36.5) even though George has put up way more attempts per game and faced a higher degree of difficulty; he’s taken a diverse array of shots off movement and garnered more defensive attention than a standstill shooter. From Roy Hibbert to Steven Adams to Ivica Zubac, George has never played with a center possessing the offensive versatility of Embiid. Together, they could form a potent two-man combination, much like Embiid and Maxey did this past season. George has a deep bag coming off actions like handoffs, off-ball screens, and pick-and-rolls. George’s demeanor could be an asset in Philadelphia, too. He’s always been willing to defer, whether it was to Kawhi Leonard or Prime Russell Westbrook. In Philly, Embiid is the man. Maxey is the energizer. George could be that chill presence who offers steady buckets on a nightly basis but can also go off on any night he’s feeling it or has the best matchup. Since he is capable of offering so much as a shot creator himself, he could also support Maxey when Embiid is resting or sidelined. Sure, there’s a possibility that George could go into decline by the end of his next contract. But the Sixers can’t afford to worry about that possible downside. The time to win is now, before Embiid ages further into his 30s and potentially faces the same decline that many players of his height and weight have historically experienced. The Sixers can offer George a deal of up to four years and $212 million this summer. The Clippers can give four years and $221 million, but league sources say they haven’t offered George a dollar more than what they paid Leonard: three years, $152.4 million. The annual salaries of the potential Sixers and Clippers contracts are similar; the big difference is the additional year. If the Clippers insist on keeping Leonard as their highest-paid player while retaining long-term cap flexibility with a shorter-term contract, then he would be in the right to review his options and look for more leverage. So why Philly? So much has been made of location throughout his entire career. When George wanted out of Indiana, he asked to go to the Lakers since he is a native of Palmdale, California. But the Thunder jumped in and acquired him. And then when it was time to leave OKC, he still wanted to return to Los Angeles. But in the five years since the Clippers first acquired him, life has changed. George is now married, and his wife was born and raised in New York. A move east could be more appealing than it was when he was younger. But would he be willing to move across the country for one additional guaranteed year on his contract? I’m reminded of a classic quote from Dave Chappelle on whether he regretted leaving Chappelle’s Show and his large Comedy Central contract: “I don’t have $50 million or whatever it was. But say I have $10 million in the bank. The difference in lifestyle is minuscule. The only difference between having $10 million and $50 million is an astounding $40 million . Of course, I would have liked to have that money.” And George probably would too. It’s possible that the Sixers are being used as leverage by George’s agency, CAA, to secure a longer deal from the Clippers. But if the Sixers do end up putting a huge offer on the table, would Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, one of the richest people on the planet, really balk at George’s asking price as he opens a new arena with no other assets to improve the roster? Would he really let George leave for nothing? I doubt it. George could help L.A. pursue a title, even if he’s more expensive than the front office would prefer. The Clippers could also always re-sign George and trade him down the line, just like they did with Blake Griffin seven months after telling him that he’d be a Clipper for life . Then again, maybe family, money, and location aren’t the only motivators here. After all, even though he didn’t want to land in Oklahoma City, George did end up re-signing there. Perhaps now, it’s about chasing a championship. If that’s the case, then the argument is in Philadelphia’s favor. George would fit seamlessly alongside Embiid and Maxey, without the positional overlap he has with Leonard. Next season, Embiid (30) and Maxey (24) will be much younger than Leonard (33) and James Harden (35). The Sixers have far more assets, including some of L.A.’s own picks, to bolster the roster, too. And in a much weaker conference, George would have to feel better about his title odds. Life is certainly good in Southern California, but George must make a decision that will not only write the next chapter of his life but could also define the story of his entire career. It’s a weak free agent market after George. Unless a surprise is coming, LeBron James is expected to remain with the Lakers. League sources say that OG Anunoby is also expected to remain with the Knicks, although he doesn’t provide the type of scoring punch the Sixers are seeking anyway. Maybe DeMar DeRozan or Miles Bridges would make sense in Philly? Realistically, if George falls through, the Sixers would start looking at trades. Aside from the pipe dream that Kevin Durant or Jimmy Butler would ask to be dealt directly to Philly, sources familiar with the Sixers’ thinking say that Brandon Ingram is the primary fallback plan. Ingram would have to be acquired in a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans since he’s under contract for $36 million with a 15 percent trade kicker through the 2024-25 season. But the Sixers could absorb him without sacrificing any salary, a major benefit to the Pelicans, who could then operate with cap space and receive draft picks from the Sixers. For the same reasons the Pelicans are even considering moving Ingram, he would be an imperfect fit for the Sixers. He brings his own set of durability concerns, defensive shortcomings, and offensive inconsistencies. If there’s any “next Tobias Harris” for Philly, it’s Ingram. But he does provide go-to scoring ability, and maybe Embiid and Maxey, two uniquely talented teammates, could unlock him. Ingram is excellent coming off handoff and screening actions, but the Pelicans don’t have the personnel to feature him at a high frequency in that way like the Sixers could with Embiid. And if Nurse could get him to embrace a shot profile with more 3s and fewer midrange jumpers, then his scoring efficiency could improve. If both George and Ingram fall through, the Sixers would have to get creative or hope for unexpected opportunities. What if the Timberwolves are looking to escape the second apron and move on from Karl-Anthony Towns? If the Hornets draft a point guard, what would that mean for LaMelo Ball? Is there a way to overpay the Spurs for Devin Vassell? Maybe the Nets would move away from Mikal Bridges, who could return home to Philadelphia and the team that originally drafted him. Or how about making the Jazz an offer for Lauri Markkanen that they can’t refuse? These scenarios might sound far-fetched, but they illustrate the level of creativity the Sixers must employ if they whiff on George. They’re also all pretty random. The roster is empty, and anyone can work with Embiid and Maxey. The Sixers just need talent. And if a trade for a key player isn’t available to Philadelphia, then league sources expect the Sixers to target players on one- or two-year contracts, like the Indiana Pacers did with Bruce Brown last summer. Brown (along with other assets) was later dealt ahead of the deadline for Pascal Siakam, who helped guide the Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals. Brown’s deal featured a team option in the second season, a structure that enabled the Pacers to remain flexible, which is precisely what the Sixers would be looking for if they go this route. Then, using that hypothetical player’s salary and draft picks, Philly could be the team that trades for the next All-Star who becomes available. Morey and Nurse are signed through the 2027-28 season, so the Sixers have a lot of time to make this work. But they need to feel urgency because of Embiid’s lack of durability and because of the opportunity that all of this cap space gives them. But after all the hype about retaining cap flexibility and the possibility that they could pursue a star like George, if they stand relatively pat this summer, it would probably cause a riot in Philadelphia. In the end, what truly matters is how Embiid feels about the Sixers’ future. From what I’ve gathered, he has always wanted to be like Kobe Bryant or Tim Duncan, playing his entire career with one team. But as situations evolve, so do perspectives, and the Sixers need to move fast to arm their future Hall of Famer with the strongest supporting cast he’s ever had—especially as they watch the Celtics effortlessly own a battered East. The pressure is on Philly’s front office to make something happen. The time to win is now. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong.

        "description": "THE PHILIPPINES needs to do more business with new markets to diversify its economy away from China, whose companies have been willing to invest in areas where other foreign entities have not, raising security concerns, analysts said.",
        "content": "By Kyle Aristophere T. Atienza, Reporter THE PHILIPPINES needs to do more business with new markets to diversify its economy away from China, whose companies have been willing to invest in areas where other foreign entities have not, raising security concerns, analysts said. The Philippines also needs to solidify its industrial base to climb the global value chain in response to Chinese moves to invest in strategic industries here, they added. Brian Poe-Llamanzares, a political scientist and chief of staff to Senator Mary Grace Natividad S. Poe-Llamanzares, said China has made “significant investments” in key Philippine industries like electricity, telecommunications, and water, enabled by the absence of competing foreign investors. “There are only a few investors who are looking at the Philippines, and many of us would question what China’s intention is in investing in these industries,” he said, speaking at a forum organized by WR Numero Research (WRN). The National Grid Corp. of the Philippines, in which the State Grid Corp. of China has a 40% stake, has been flagged in various Senate inquiries as a possible national security threat. China claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety, including areas that are well within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. Its Coast Guard has been performing dangerous maneuvers and deploying water cannon to block Philippine resupply missions to its outposts in disputed waters. Under the previous administration, the Philippines welcomed DITO Telecommunity, in which China Telecom has a 40% stake, as a the third player in the telecommunications market. “In the spirit of a free-market economy and with the lack of competitors, it became necessary to bring in a third telco player that was willing to go through congressional scrutiny and service the unserved and underserved areas,” he said. “It’s not like DITO was our first choice. It was our only option,” he added. “We were yet to see a serious attempt by any American or European player in the telco market.” In 2019, DITO and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) signed a deal allowing the company to build facilities in military camps supposedly to help improve the AFP’s ICT infrastructure. While the Philippines has been touting interest from other countries in helping build the Philippines’ telco and ICT infrastructure, “very few of them actually have put a bet on the table,” he said. “A lot of them talk about building relations economically with the Philippines but we are yet to see the fruits of those economic (pledges),” he added, “and this becomes a problem for us because we’re a free market; anyone can come in.” Mr. Poe noted that under the Duterte administration, China effectively entered the water industry by financing a dam. He was referring to a $283.2-million loan secured by the past administration from China to build a dam to support Metro Manila’s water needs. Chinese contractor China Energy Engineering Corp. Ltd was selected to build the dam on the Kaliwa River, which straddles Rizal and Quezon provinces. “We are facing an impending water crisis. And so we’re pushed against the wall and who comes to save the day? China,” he said. “See if there’s anyone else willing to offer us a loan. No one. And so what happens is, China ends up entering the bid and they get the loan,” he added. “And you can’t fault them for doing it. It’s a free market. They can do it. They can provide it.” Mr. Poe said Manila needs to harness the potential of its amended Public Service Act, which allows full foreign ownership in key domestic industries, by conducting more road shows overseas. “It’s really important that we continue to expose ourselves to the international community because we were closed off for six years,” he said. “Next thing is we must create a competitive business climate.” He noted that red tape continues to be a major concern among investors, limiting the sources of foreign investments. “We need more options,” he said. He said the Philippines also needs to build industry and make its educational system competitive by “removing the stigma of vocational work.” Bernardo M. Villegas, one of the founders of the University of Asia and the Pacific and a framer of the 1987 Constitution, said at the WRN forum that the Philippines can only make critical utilities independent from China if it embarks on road shows in more countries including Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. “The only way we can make sure that we declare our independence from China with regard to water and electricity is for us in the private sector to have dozens of road shows,” he said. Mr. Villegas said expects the planned establishment of a Luzon economic corridor to help the Philippines bag investments from companies themselves seeking to diversify away from China or do business with friendly nations. The US announced its plan to help establish a Luzon corridor with the help of Japan in April. The proposed corridor seeks to boost connectivity between Manila, Batangas, and two former US military bases such as Subic Bay and Clark, with a focus on “high-impact” infrastructure such as rails and ports and strategic investments involving semiconductors, clean energy, and supply chains. China is the Philippines’ largest source of imports and the second-biggest market for exports. The US, on the other hand, is the largest destination of Philippine products and the fifth-largest source of imports. Mr. Poe said a potential escalation of tensions between the Philippines and China would have little to no impact on the Chinese economy because “what we’re providing them is not critical to China.” “If they decided to stop trading and buying our fresh fruits and products, then it’s not going to hurt their economy too much.” “But if we were to develop something more critical — like Taiwan did — an industry that’s indispensable not just to China but also the international community, then suddenly we’re on negotiating terms.”",

        "description": "Very few stocks can be expected to build a million-dollar nest egg over several decades -- but Alphabet just might fit the bill.",
        "content": "Online services giant Alphabet ( GOOG 0.72% ) ( GOOGL 0.83% ) has made plenty of millionaires over the years. You'd have more than a million dollars in the Google parent's stock today if you invested just $15,000 when it entered the public stock market in 2004. If you put the same cash to work in a broad market tracker like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY 0.66% ) instead, you'd have a total return of just $105,000: GOOGL Total Return Level data by YCharts The secret sauce in million-dollar portfolios: Time and patience But you can build a million-dollar portfolio without market-crushing stars. Take the index tracker's compound average returns of 10.3% over that 20-year period, commit to making a modest investment every month, and let it run for a few more years. For example, imagine setting up an automatic investment of $100 per month at the age of 20. There's no seed money to start that portfolio, no contribution increases over time, and you're sticking with that S&P 500 ( ^GSPC 0.70% ) index tracker, automatically reinvesting its dividends in more shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) along the way. $100 a month isn't nothing, but the commitment is arguably small enough to work for most people with a day job. 44 years later, at the reasonable retirement age of 64, you will have invested a grand total of $52,800 in a simple index ETF. And thanks to the magic of compound returns, you'd have about $1.07 million in your retirement account. The bigger they are, the harder they fall Many diversified mutual funds or ETFs can handle a long-term investment like the example above. Set it, forget it, and laugh all the way to the bank after a few decades. But very few single stocks can carry that load. Oceans rise, empires fall, and even the most robust giants aren't immune to unexpected downturns, shifting consumer tastes, and technological progress. Let's check out a couple of examples. At the turn of the millennium, General Electric ( GE 1.25% ) boasted the second-largest market cap of all at $508 billion. By now, the industrial empire has split into three separate companies whose market caps add up to about half of the January 2000 footprint. Enron or Lehman Brothers are more dramatic examples of crumbling empires, and the list is long. Among the 1,925 stocks in the Russell 2000 index, only 640 have a stock market history of at least 25 years. Once, I bought a couch with a lifetime warranty from what had once been the largest department store of all. Six months and a bad holiday season later, Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy and liquidated the whole business. the company couldn't handle the one-two punch of big-box retailers and the early years of online shopping. So much for lifetime warranties. Why Alphabet is built to last In light of these examples, it's clear that very few companies can be expected to thrive over several decades. However, there are exceptions to the rule -- and I believe Alphabet is one of those rare survivors. Built to thrive in a variety of economic environments thanks to the ultra-flexible Alphabet umbrella organization, Alphabet has the ability to expand and explore in many different industries. If the online search and advertising revenues dry up, Alphabet would rely on the Android smartphone, YouTube video platform, and Google Cloud decentralized computing service in the short term. Meanwhile, promising side gigs like the Waymo self-driving taxi service, Calico medical research group, or Verily health data unit could pick up the long-term baton. Or maybe Google Cloud will just run with it instead, powered by its artificial intelligence expertise. Alphabet's portfolio of potential business stars will change over time, and I probably haven't even seen their best ideas yet. And that's exactly why I think the company is ready to run for decades to come. I don't recommend putting your entire nest egg in one basket, unless that basket holds a diversified fund -- but if you absolutely have to do it, Alphabet's stock is at the top of my candidates list. A flexible business model and proven success in building strong technology solutions position Alphabet to match or even exceed the S&P 500's long-term returns. And if the stock can indeed outperform the average S&P 500 returns in the long run, you'll reach your million-dollar retirement goal even faster. And a small boost to the return rate would make a big difference in 44 years -- beating the Street's average returns by a single percentage point gives you a $1.5 million portfolio in the end:",

While his team suffered a tough home loss, D-Wade drew everyone’s attention to his “beautiful” wife. The three-time NBA Champion posted multiple photos on Instagram of Gabrielle and the entire family enjoying the game from the sidelines. He wrote in the caption, “Let me interrupt this program to say DAMN my wife is Beautiful!” Gabrielle was really looking gorgeous in her black crop top and baggy jeans. On the other hand, Wade looked fly as well in his black jacket and cool shades. Wade always wants to inspire his daughters by showing them what women athletes are capable of doing on the court, which is a huge reason why Kaavia was also present at the contest. However, this won’t be the only game of the Sky that The Flash will be attending. Considering that the Miami Heat legend is part of the franchise’s ownership group, he will be cheering on Angel Reese and Co. from the sidelines on numerous more occasions. Dwayne Wade wants his daughters to be inspired by Angel Reese Dwyane Wade was ecstatic when the Chicago Sky was able to select Angel Reese during the 2024 WNBA Draft. While Reese brings a large number of eyeballs to the franchise, increasing the Sky’s popularity, Wade is more excited for his daughters to get a first-hand POV of Reese as a role model. Since becoming a household name during her college days, Reese has become an inspiration for several young girls across the country and even internationally. Following yesterday night’s game, Wade ensured that his daughter got to meet her idol. Obliging the NBA Hall-Of-Famer’s request, Reese shared a wholesome moment with Wade’s daughter, hugging Kaavia after the game. Wade managed to catch this beautiful moment on camera and put it on his Instagram Story. Wade wrote, “Seeing is believing! Thank you @angelreese5 for being a model for all of our daughters!” Reese has had a huge impact on women’s basketball. Now, the Chicago Sky will hope that the 22-year-old is able to influence the team’s performance into a winning record. Currently, the team is 9 th in the league with a 2-2 record.",

        "content": "Tshegofatso Mabasa, whose non-selection into the Bafana Bafana squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Nigeria and Zimbabwe cause a bit of a stir, has been confirmed as the recipient of the Player of the Month award for his exploits towards the end of the season. “In the Buccaneers' five matches in May, Mabasa led the domestic league with his five goals including one in the final day, which secured a place in the CAF Champions League for his club, narrowly ahead of Stellenbosch FC on goal difference. “His goals in May also saw the formidable Mabasa win the league's top goal scorer award, which was also secured on the last day of the season ahead of his nearest rival. He is the second Pirates player to win a monthly individual award this season, after Thabiso Lebitso,” said the PSL in a statement on Monday afternoon. The Coach of the Season honour has gone to Rulani Mokwena, who has just led Mamelodi Sundowns to a seventh league title in a row. “During the last month of league football this May, Mokwena oversaw four wins, two draws and a defeat from their seven matches, a period in which Sundowns were unstoppable until the slip up to suffer their first defeat of the season to Cape Town City on the last day of the season. During this period, Sundowns scored 10 goals, and only conceded three. “With his May success, Mokwena has won the award for the third time this season, having previously won it in August and April. Mokwena beat Cape Town City's coach Eric Tinkler to the award, with the Citizens also having had a good month and getting the big scalp away to Sundowns,” said the League. Meanwhile, Moroka Swallows midfielder Lindokuhle Mtshali has won the DStv Premiership Goal of the Month award for his strike against Stellenbosch FC. All the three winners will each receive R7000 from league sponsors DStv, for their latest achievements.",

They started moving in different directions in their careers and their priorities started to change.' 'Eamonn was desperate to return to Belfast, which he thinks of as home, but Ruth would never move. It became a bone of contention. 'As her ITV career continued, Eamonn went down another path and they became ships in the night. For the past two years they had led separate lives, professionally and personally.' Eamonn spoke about his desire to return to Belfast last year, revealing how his wife was always 'very irritated' when he called it home. He said last year, when asked where he thinks of as home: 'Well, it's not Surrey. When people ask me what I'm doing at the weekend, I tell them I'm going home. 'Then my wife gets very irritated by this. She says, 'This is your home. And I say, 'No Ruth, this is where I work. This is where I have to be, but home...'

Read More Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford look stony-faced as they leave their last public outing separately - before news of their divorce plans emerged following 14 years of marriage The Sun have reported that Ruth has been preparing for the split for over a year, with paperwork from her TV company, Hey Ho Ltd, revealing she paid herself a dividend of £2.2million last year, compared to the £85,000 she claimed the year before. The couple were last seen together at the Tric Awards in 2022. They arrived together and smiled on the red carpet at the event in London but were seen leaving separately. In unearthed photos of the event , Loose Women star Ruth was seen chatting on the phone as she left Grosvenor House Hotel after the bash. Eamonn appeared to have left by the back door before walking down the street on his own while clutching his News Presenter award after stopping to chat to his GB News colleague Bev Turner. Yesterday it emerged Eamonn and Ruth's marriage had been 'over for a year', with friends saying the couple were 'determined to keep it a secret' as they struggled to save their 27-year relationship . So keen they were to avoid it becoming public, both Ruth and Eamonn denied there were any problems when asked in recent months. It has been reported that Eamonn will address the split on his show on GB News on Monday, after they confirmed the end of their marriage. The presenter hosts a breakfast show with Isabel Webster, which sees them talk through the big news stories of the world. Speaking to The Sun , a source said: 'Eamonn is always frank on camera and knows it will be odd for him to discuss the day's news without mentioning his split so he'll say a few words. 'He is putting on a brave face and will be the true professional he always is. Focusing on work will be a welcome distraction.' It would mark the first time either Ruth or Eamonn have spoken about the split since their initial announcement, but sources close to the pair say that a 'statement is being prepared by Ruth's representatives ', to share the news with their followers. The TV couple, who friends say were 'as close to Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan as you could get', have sparked rumours over the last few months as neither appeared on the other's Instagram posts.

The Magic of The Cup. Congratulations to the whole squad' Two years later, he had split from his first wife Gabrielle Holmes, the mother of his three eldest children. And despite Ruth and Eamonn feeling an instant connection, he ensured it was the nation's best-kept secret, as he did not publicly confess his love for Ruth for two years.

But after just a year of having their relationship out in the open , they welcomed their son Jack in 2002. But now, more than 20 years later as the beloved pair have split, one friend told MailOnline: 'Ruth and her team have been telling their friends to look out for the comments, which they are planning to put on social media. 'It's a very sorry tale. They are both so loved by the British public, they won over so many people on This Morning which they hosted for more than a decade.' The couple, who live in Surrey, have prompted many rumours throughout the showbusiness industry in recent months by not appearing together on their individual Instagram accounts.

Their split comes just days after Ruth revealed she fears Eamonn 'might never be 100 per cent right' after undergoing back surgery due to suffering chronic back pain for almost two years. The GB News breakfast presenter is still recovering from the surgery and an injury to his shoulder, which saw him take four months off work at the end of last year.

Speaking to Woman's Weekly, Ruth said: 'I don't know how much Eamonn's mobility will improve. We live in hope. 'He does the physio, but there might have to be some acceptance that this might never be 100% right. With any care situation - and there are millions of carers in this country - it isn't always easy. It's testing but we manage as a family.' Ruth added: 'I look at Eamonn, who's had his health and back problems, and it makes you realise how important your health is.'

        "content": "THE RETAIL PRICE of rice is expected to drop by September by as much as 20% due to the impact of improved domestic production and the relaxation of import procedures and tariffs, the Department of Finance said. “We expect rice prices to go down by 20%, maybe by September. This would entail one, increasing production, and second, reducing tariffs,” Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto said during the Philippine Economic Briefing on Monday. The average retail price of well milled rice was P56.52 per kilogram as of early May, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. A kilo of regular milled rice averaged P51.24 during the period. “I think we have a game plan as far as that is concerned,” Mr. Recto added. National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan said that the domestic price of rice has been a challenge for the past few months. “The forecast on global rice prices by the second half of the year, particularly by September, is going down... It’s past El Niño and the election in India is over,” he added. Mr. Balisacan said that by September, all restrictions on exports by major producing countries will have been lifted. “Domestic prices simply reflect the trends in global prices, particularly for rice. So, as global prices come down, provided our exchange rate does not sharply depreciate, which I don’t expect, then we should see domestic prices coming down,” he added. Separately, Agriculture Undersecretary Asis G. Perez said the decline in rice prices will require not just an increase in rice production, but also imports. “That’s a common aspiration. That’s been discussed, and 20% is around P10 less in price. (We are) looking at whether we can increase our production,” Mr. Perez said on the sidelines of the briefing. He added that rice prices could still be influenced by external factors like global price surges. The Department of Agriculture (DA) downgraded its palay (unmilled rice) target to 20.4 million metric tons (MT) this year, citing the impact of El Niño on domestic production. Its initial target had been 20.8 million MT. It had hoped to exceed the 20.06 million MT recorded in 2023. The reduced tariffs on rice imports were extended until December. Rates for rice imports were kept at 35%, regardless of the minimum access volume and country of origin. Rice imports have totaled 1.89 million MT as of May 9, according to the Bureau of Plant Industry. — Adrian H. Halili",

        "content": "It still remains unclear whether Nigeria men’s U-17 team, the Golden Eaglets, will be a part of the 2025 U-17 AFCON which will also serve as qualifiers for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Qatar as the Confederation of African Football is yet to decide on the number of slots for each zone in the zonal qualifiers, The PRIMANEWS reports. The Golden Eaglets were beaten 1-0 by Ivory Coast in the semi-finals of the WAFU B zone on Saturday, dashing the hopes of Manu Garba’s side of advancing to the U-17 AFCON as one of the finallists in the zonal qualifiers. Garba’s team are now clinging to a tiny of expansion by CAF, with the continent’s football governing body still mum on the decision. Two teams were expected to qualify from each zonal qualifier organised by CAF, but many followers are expecting a change in the number of teams for the U-17 AFCON to be increased from 16 after FIFA has also expanded the World Cup to 32 teams. Following their defeat on Saturday in Accra, media officer of the team, Francis Achi noted, “Lifeline for Golden Eaglets. It is likely that three teams will qualify from WAFU Zone B for the U-17 AFCON. There is still all to play for in the third-place game against Ghana. “CAF will confirm in the coming days if three or four teams will qualify from WAFU B,” he added. Ahead of their third-place game on Tuesday against hosts Ghana who were also beaten 2-1 by Burkina Faso, head coach Garba also dropped a glimmer of hope. “There is a plan for everything in life because with God we have trust in him. We appreciate your support. All the boys are saying a big thanks for you guys support once again. “We go again for the third place with Ghana. Your support will go a long way for the third place.” Meanwhile, 1993 U-17 World Cup winner, Festus Odini, has blamed the team’s inability to make the final and its potential damage on age-grade football on lack of adequate preparation. “Everything is down to the schedule for the preparation. The team didn’t use up to a month together before the tournament and look at the issues of MRI they had too,” Odini told our correspondent. “That is what is affecting us. There should be proper and adequate preparations for teams like this. I remember during our time, there were bunch of talents in camp for almost a year before some of us joined as additions.” Aside from the expected decision on the number of slots for the U-17 AFCON, CAF is also expected to make decisions on the schedule of the 2024 WAFCON as well as the 2025 AFCON.",

        "content": "SHARK TWO ONE can strike fear into the bookies with a victory at Leicester on Tuesday. The six-year-old, trained by Jessica Macey, was a course and distance winner in October and bounced back to form when keeping on well to finish second of 13 over six furlongs on this course earlier this month. My selection was always prominent but was just held by the well-regarded Catherine Chroi, who was completing a hat-trick of wins and has now won five out of her last six races. The extra furlong of Tuesday's Sipp Cafebar Handicap can get the son of Adaay back in the winners' enclosure in the hands of Jack Doughty. Leicester hosts a Flat meeting on Tuesday when Newsboy’s nap, Shark Two One, is fancied to win the 6f handicap (4.55) At Brighton, MAYZ (4.45, nb) should go well at a decent price in the Free Digital Racecard At raceday-ready.com Handicap for trainer John Gallagher. The four-year-old daughter of Mayson has been third in her last two races, the latest when three and a quarter lengths behind Flame Of Kodiac at Chepstow on heavy ground a fortnight ago.

        "content": "A woman appears to have given birth beside an inner-Sydney river then disappeared, prompting a desperate overnight search for mother and child amid grave fears for their welfare. Emergency services were called to the banks of the Cooks River at Earlwood, near a field where children were practicing soccer, after a person walking their dog found what police described as “evidence of a birth” on Monday afternoon. An area near the Cooks River was taped off on Monday night following the discovery of evidence that a mother had given birth on the banks of the river. Credit: Jordan Baker Burwood Superintendent Christine McDonald said police conducted urgent forensic tests. “I can confirm that a placenta and an umbilical cord of a human has been located,” she told reporters late on Monday night. “Our immediate concern is for the health and safety of the mother and child.” Officers are urging the mother to attend her nearest hospital to seek care for herself and the baby. “It is of extreme urgency that we find the mother and baby as soon as we can,” said McDonald. The red dot marks a spot where police believe a woman may have given birth near the banks of the Cooks River. Credit: Google Maps Police are bringing in lights and will “conduct a large-scale search” of the area overnight, McDonald said. A rising tide is causing concern that evidence may be washed away. Divers might also be called. Police investigations will confirm whether the mother gave birth at that point on the bank of the river. They believe the material is too far from the road to have been thrown from the Wardell Road bridge. That section of the riverbank is lined with mangroves and is behind a rugby field, away from the bike path and homes. The path to the road bridge is steep, so it is more likely she walked a few hundred metres around the river.",

        "content": "In her seventh season as head coach, a tenure that spans the entire existence of the Duke softball program, Marissa Young has established the Blue Devils as a national power. The former Michigan pitcher led Duke to the program’s first appearance in the College Softball World Series with a thrilling win over No. 10 Missouri on Sunday night. Young was a three-time All-America selection at Michigan during her four-year career. She was the 2003 Big Ten Player of the Year as a senior and the conference’s Pitcher of the Year the season prior. She graduated in 2003 as the program’s all-time strikeout leader. Young could hit, too, matching a then-program record with 13 home runs as a senior. The Santa Ana, California, native played a couple of years of professional softball before eventually getting into coaching, beginning with three seasons at Concordia University, an NAIA program in Ann Arbor. She moved down the road for two seasons an assistant at Eastern Michigan before leveling up to the ACC. Young was an assistant at North Carolina for two seasons before moving across town to rival Duke in 2015. At the time, Duke did not have a varsity softball program. That started in 2018, and Duke finished 13-11 in the ACC. In 2021, the Blue Devils won the conference tournament and reached the NCAA Tournament. They made the Super Regional the next year. They got there again last year and hosted, but lost to Stanford. This past weekend, they topped Missouri in a best-of-three series at Missouri to advance to the College World Series. Duke won the deciding game on Sunday 4-3, with all the scoring coming in the ninth, the second extra inning. Duke is coming off ACC regular-season and tournament titles and is ranked No. 10 in the country. “We’re making history here and we’re excited to take this team to Oklahoma City,” Young told reporters after the game. Duke will play No. 2 Oklahoma, the three-time defending national champions, on Thursday. The World Series is a double-elimination event featuring eight teams.",

As we draw curtains to the season, here is The Quint 's IPL 2024 Team of the Tournament: ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Openers – Sunil Narine & Abhishek Sharma Sunil Narine had an excellent season with the bat in 2018, but it was followed by a couple of underwhelming campaigns. After the 2020 season, he pulled the plug on his time as a pinch-hitting opener – not because the KKR management wanted him to do so, but owing to a confidence dip in this facet of the game. Returning in KKR colours this season was Gautam Gambhir, who was responsible for Narine’s transition from a specialist spinner to an all-rounder in 2017. Fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate revealed how the management’s pleas to return as an opener the innings fell on deaf ears, until Gambhir somehow convinced him to take the leap of faith. The leap turned out to be an almighty jump, as Narine scored 488 runs this season, finishing as the ninth-highest run-scorer. His strike rate of 180.74 highlights the role he was assigned – numbing any and every threat of the opposition bowlers in the powerplay overs. He scored his maiden IPL century this year – a 56-ball 109 against Rajasthan Royals – and also got three half-centuries. ðð®ð«ð«ððð¥ Narine ð¤ ̄ #RCBvKKR #IPLonJioCinema #JioCinemaSports Â #TATAIPL pic.twitter.com/6dfsPr9S9S — JioCinema (@JioCinema) March 29, 2024 0 Travis Head could easily have been selected for the vacant opening slot, albeit selecting two overseas players upfront runs the risk of strength disparity across departments. Hence, this position goes to Head’s opening partner – Abhishek Sharma. Despite a forgettable campaign in IPL 2023, Sunrisers Hyderabad deserve credit for continuing with him as their opener, whilst skipper Pat Cummins should be credited for giving Abhishek the license to play his natural, uninhibited game.

But that figure, in isolation, does not portray the influence his batting had on his team. The 23-year-old scored those runs at a strike rate of 204.21, which is the highest among any batter who scored over 350 runs. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Number 3 – Virat Kohli IPL 2024 served as a testament to individual brilliance not warranting collective success in a team sport, as whilst Virat Kohli successfully secured his second Orange Cap, his team – Royal Challengers Bengaluru – remained unsuccessful in their search for the elusive trophy. That being said, there was nothing that Kohli could have offered more. He scored 741 runs – 158 more than his nearest competitor. The former Indian skipper had an average of 61.75 – the highest among the players who scored in excess of 500 runs, and for all debates about his scoring rate, he declared the discourse null and void by accumulating those runs at a strike rate of 154.70 – his highest-ever figure in an IPL season.

This year was a deviation from the usual, as for the first time since his debut 11 years ago, Samson crossed the 500-run barrier in a singular IPL edition. He scored 531 runs at an average of 48.27, which also happens to be his best-ever tally in this tournament. The Rajasthan Royals captain might not have led his team to a second title, but he struck five half-centuries – joint-highest alongside Kohli. The wicketkeeper-batter has been duly rewarded with a place in the Indian team for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. ð¥ Left handed Sanju Samson ð #RR skipper switching on gears with that switch hit ð©· ð¥ Watch the match LIVE on @StarSportsIndia and @JioCinema ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #LSGvRR | @rajasthanroyals pic.twitter.com/IaSCJse7tx — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 27, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Number 5 – Riyan Parag Having made his IPL debut in 2019, Riyan Parag had scored merely 600 runs across five seasons. It led to incessant scrutiny, as questions were raised on Rajasthan’s decision to persist with the youngster. In his sixth season, Parag proved that eventually, if not immediately, persistence is certain to pay off. ð toð half-centuries for Riyan Parag He continues his good form with the bat ðð Watch the match LIVE on @JioCinema and @StarSportsIndia ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #MIvRR | @rajasthanroyals pic.twitter.com/tAnDaCghYm — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 1, 2024 He scored 537 runs in 16 matches at an average of 52.09, finishing as the third-highest run-scorer. While he scored four half-centuries, it was his consistency which was more impressive, for Parag scored north of 30 runs in 10 of his fourteen innings. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Number 6 – Nicholas Pooran Nicholas Pooran happens to be the only player on our team whose team could not qualify for the playoffs, which might indicate a thing or two about the season he had. Signed for Rs 16 crore in the 2022 mega auction, the Trinidadian wicketkeeper-batter’s performances in the last couple of seasons were far from unsatisfactory, yet he never really was successful in rationalising the hype around him. That was, until this season, where he scored 499 runs at an average of 62.37, and finished as the eighth-highest run-scorer. In a team where the top-order batters are not particularly renowned for their hitting prowess, Pooran was tasked with the seemingly improbable role of accumulating runs at a brisk pace whilst not losing his wicket, but he was successful in his ordeal, highlighted by his strike rate and average – 178.21 and 62.38 respectively.

In their second triumph in 2014, he was a member of the KKR team, but could only feature in two matches.

He was, however, needed to deliver with the ball, and deliver he did, by picking up 19 wickets at an average of 15.53. He was also KKR’s leading wicket-taker in the final. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Pacer 1 – Pat Cummins (Captain) Though Pat Cummins is among the top 10 on the list of leading wicket-takers, with 18 scalps at an average of 31.44, his numbers with the ball is not the solitary reason why he has made the cut. Instead, it was his leadership qualities which led to the rather unforeseen Sunrisers Hyderabad resurgence. Having finished in tenth place last season, Hyderabad were second to only Kolkata this year, both in the final and the league stage. Cummins was flawless with his bowling changes, whilst the inculcation of his fearless approach saw the batters breaking records of all sorts.

Fair point, but a few factors need to be considered. Firstly, specialist death bowlers are always likely to pick more wickets than all-phase bowlers, with risk-taking shots increasing exponentially in the latter overs. Moreover, Patel scalped 24 wickets at an economy rate of 9.73 runs per over, whilst Bumrah scalped 20 wickets at an economy rate of 6.48 runs per over, plotting the batters’ downfall when their predominant approach was defensive. ðððð ð¥ ð¢ð¡ ð§ðð¥ððð§ ð ̄ Just Bumrah doing Bumrah things ð¤·ââï ̧ Watch the match LIVE on @starsportsindia and @JioCinema ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #MIvDC pic.twitter.com/rO1Hnqd3Od — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 7, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Spinner 1 – Yuzvendra Chahal Yuzvendra Chahal became the only player to scalp 200 wickets in this competition, and rightfully so, has reclaimed his place in the Indian T20 team. The second-highest wicket-taker among spinners, Chahal had 18 scalps to his name. Among the more impressive facets of Chahal’s game was his prowess to break partnerships, and having a trick or two up his sleeve in every game. In the 16 matches he featured for Rajasthan Royals this season, Chahal could not open his wickets tally only thrice.

It seemed that the presumed mystery spinner had no mystery to his game, until he found the incantation to unlock his expertise. Chakaravarthy was the second-highest wicket-taker with 21 scalps, and the highest among spinners. He had an average of 19.14 and an economy rate of 8.04 – second to only Jasprit Bumrah among the top 10 on the wicket-takers’ list. âï ̧ in âï ̧ for Varun Chakaravarthy ð @KKRiders bowlers keeping things under control with a clinical passage of bowling ðð Watch the match LIVE on @StarSportsIndia and @JioCinema ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #KKRvRR pic.twitter.com/p0nPVJ3yLR — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 16, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD The Quint's Team of the Tournament Sunil Narine Abhishek Sharma Virat Kohli Sanju Samson (Wicketkeeper) Riyan Parag Nicholas Pooran Andre Russell Pat Cummins (Captain) Jasprit Bumrah Yuzvendra Chahal Varun Chakaravarthy Impact Subs: Travis Head, Harshit Rana, T Natarajan, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sai Sudharsan.

The Leeds cult hero, 32, quickly established himself in the Boro ranks in the absence of the injured Tommy Smith and made a total of 19 appearances, contributing eight assists and played a full part in the club's strong finish to the season which saw them just miss out on a Championship play-off place.

What was previously Aloha on became underground retro games bar NQ64 in September 2019, after At the time, fans of Aloha were , and I for one was not aware something else had opened in its place. But if you go down the steps and into this underground bar, you'll find NQ64. NQ64 is a retro arcade bar that , featuring 80s and 90s video game classics such as Pac-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario Kart. The bar also has branches in Manchester, London and Glasgow, to name a few. I am a huge fan of video games, having previously tried to While my Wii skills didn't really translate into real life, I felt right at home in NQ64. When visitors go inside, they can pay for game tokens to be used in consoles, such as classic Dance Dance Revolution or racing games. It was a nice touch that some of the consoles, such as the Nintendo 64, are free to play on, so visitors can still experience the video games without getting tokens. Another great aspect of the bar are , as they are all named after classic video game characters. My personal favourite, which you can see in the video above, was the Kirby, named after Nintendo's cute protagonist of the Kirby games. It was made up of beefeater pink gin, poppy liqueur, grapefruit, lime and vanilla, but it had a special visual twist that I couldn't get enough of.

        "content": "Drug shortage in the US generic market will help Indian pharma companies see improved volume growth as well as higher returns in FY25. Indian companies also have an opportunity to increase their market share. The US is facing an active shortage of 233 drugs across 22 therapeutic categories, led mainly by discontinuation of drug production, rising demand and delays in shipments. Generic pharma manufacturing is a competitive industry with low margins. Price erosion on account of purchase concentration, increasing regulatory costs and limited commercial viability in some cases has led to many US-based generic pharma manufacturers to halt the production of financially unsustainable products. Large Indian generic players have exited non-profitable molecules, contributing to increasing shortages. Further, there has been a consistent decline in the filing of original abbreviated new drug application (ANDAs) on account of increased filing complexities, leading to higher research and development spend per molecule. The median timeline for approval had increased to 26 months which is a six-quarter high, from 21 months. With the reduced ANDA filing intensity, the pricing scenario will improve amid decreasing competition. Due to drug shortages, now there is an improvement in USFDA approvals and tentative approvals of the original ANDAs filed by pharma companies. India Ratings finds that US-focused pharma companies will sustain their revenue improvement trend in FY25 on account of heightened drug shortages. This will not only provide potential for volume growth, but also limit price erosion to single digits over the next 12-18 months, leading to improved returns. Expanding the supply chains and increasing participation from manufacturers across therapeutic categories are ideal long-term solutions to address drug shortage. The agency believes Indian pharma companies with a reasonable track record, recent cost rationalisation and enhanced research and development capabilities can capture a higher market share in many of these therapeutic categories. Also, given the limited ANDA filings and delays in approvals provided by the USFDA, the drug shortage in the US provides an opportunity for Indian players with necessary approvals to gain market share in a competitive-but-attractive market.",

        "content": "( ) mengatakan Indonesia patut bersyukur telah mampu menghadapi berbagai krisis yang ada di dunia saat banyak negara lain menjadi 'pasien' dari dana moneter internasional ( ) alias bergantung pada lembaga tersebut. Lebih dari 96 negara menjadi pasien IMF. \"Kalau kita melihat di jajaran negara besar G20, selalu kita masuk tiga besar atau lima besar,\" kata Jokowi pada Inaugurasi Menuju Ansor Masa Depan di kawasan GBK, Jakarta, Senin (27/5). Menurut dia, ada tiga hal yang ditakuti oleh negara-negara di dunia. Pertama berkaitan dengan nilai tukar atau kurs terhadap dolar AS. Sebab hal ini akan berpengaruh pada naik tidaknya harga barang-barang, terutama barang impor. Kedua terkait harga minyak. Perang geopolitik yang terjadi di Palestina dan mengikutsertakan Iran juga mengkhawatirkan dunia. Karenanya harga minyak sempat naik. Jokowi meminta agar kenaikan harga minyak dunia tidak dianggap remeh. Alasannya, kenaikan harga minyak bisa berpengaruh ke Indonesia, yaitu harga-harga barang akan ikut terkerek lebih mahal. Sama dengan perang di Ukraina-Rusia yang berpengaruh pada kenaikan harga gandum karena kedua negara perangnya sama-sama menyimpan stok gandum dan menahan ekspor mereka. Akibatnya, harga gandum sempat naik hampir 50% dan harga roti serta mi ikut naik. \"Kelihatannya tidak ada hubungannya. Padahal ada. Geopolitik kalau tidak dicermati bisa membuat harga-harga naik,\" kata Jokowi. Ketiga, yang ditakuti semua negara yaitu bunga pinjaman. Semua negara, kata Jokowi, memiliki pinjaman. \"Ada yang sampai 220% lalu ada yang 130%. Dan kita (Indonesia) pada tataran dibandingkan negara-negara lain, berada di 39%, jauh dari UU yang diperbolehkan dan jauh dari negara-negara lain yang saya sebutkan. Ini patut kita syukuri bersama,\" kata Jokowi. Karena itu, paling penting ialah menjaga agar tidak ada turbulensi politik. Kestabilan politik menjadi kunci pembangunan di negara manapun. \"Kalau ini tidak bisa kita pertahankan, yang terjadi kerugian ekonomi,\" kata Jokowi. Oleh sebab itu, pembangunan merata, hilirisasi industri, program-program kerakyatan, transformasi menuju ekonomi hijau, dan pengembalian aset seperti Freeport dan Blok Rokan juga perlu berkelanjutan.

While some campers are equipped with a heater or even heated beds, not all of them are, so having the appropriate attire is crucial. Lastly, you should keep in mind that not all campsites are open during the wintertime, and campsites are the only place you’re allowed to park your camper overnight in Iceland. For an overview of campsites open all year round, have a look at the map in the ‘Campsites in Iceland’ section. Above is a map of some of the most popular campsites in Iceland, some more secluded ones and ones that are open all year round. It was updated in 2024 and is not a full list of campsites in Iceland. At the same time, they give you added comfort compared to sleeping in a tent, and as mentioned above, they can potentially save you money on the accommodation front. Besides that, travelling in a camper means that the kids will have plenty of space to run around and play in when you set up camp. A lot of campsites in Iceland have playgrounds, areas for ball games and sometimes even mini-golf. Usually, they are also located close to swimming pools.

Dallas Stars vs. Edmonton Oilers (Series tied, 1-1) Just like they did in the second round, the Stars fought back after relinquishing home-ice advantage to start a series. It was not easy, though, as the Oilers came out flying in the first 20 minutes of Game 2 on Saturday night, outshooting Dallas 16-4. Yet, the game was tied at one after the first period, thanks to some important saves from Jake Oettinger. The home side settled into the game as it went along and began taking the play to Edmonton. The Stars’ pressure was rewarded with a goal from Mason Marchment early in the third, and they would hang to tie the series with a 3-1 win. Oettinger ended up making 28 saves in the victory, proving once again he is more than capable of being a difference-maker in these playoffs. The Oilers have to find a way to not take their foot off the gas. If they continued to create scoring chances at the rate they did in the first period throughout the rest of the game, they might be returning to Edmonton with a 2-0 series lead. The Oilers are 4-2 on home ice in these playoffs, while the Stars are 5-1 on the road. Follow the Stanley Cup Playoffs here",

        "content": "As we embarked on our journey, camaraderie filled the air. While travelling alongside fellow prospective corps members, the sense of unity was palpable. From shared laughter to prayers for safe travels, each moment cemented the bonds of camaraderie that NYSC fosters. My journey was interesting, especially travelling with a friend also assigned to the same state. “Corpers on board” was boldly written on our vehicle, and people we passed hailed and prayed for our safe journey. Upon graduating from the university, I eagerly anticipated joining the mandatory one year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). I shared my excitement with friends, but not all of them were keen to join immediately. One friend said he needed to hustle and build his career first. However, I wanted to get it done quickly and move on to the next phase of my life. So, I registered and subsequently got mobilised for a three-week-long camping/orientation. Embarking on the journey to join the NYSC is more than just a transition to adulthood; it is a rollercoaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns. The call up letter came and its stated that I am to camp at the Paiko camp in Paikoro Local Government Area of Niger state, but that after the three weeks, I am to complete my service in Abuja. I was happy and prepared to travel, as I had never been to Niger State. I learnt that it is one of the largest states in terms of land mass. I thought about how beneficial it would be for the Federal Government to collaborate with the NYSC, and invest in agriculture to empower graduates, so as to develop their future. This would surely boost the economy at both the federal and state levels. NYSC is a mandatory scheme for all graduates except those over thirty years old, who are usually issued with an exemption letter. The night before departure, a subtle warning on the NYSC documentation reminded us not to travel at night — a precaution that resonated deeply. Despite the allure of reaching our destination quickly, we chose safety over haste, breaking our journey when dusk fell. This lesson is applicable beyond NYSC, reminding us that even in seemingly safe spaces, vigilance is key. As we embarked on our journey, camaraderie filled the air. While travelling alongside fellow prospective corps members, the sense of unity was palpable. From shared laughter to prayers for safe travels, each moment cemented the bonds of camaraderie that NYSC fosters. My journey was interesting, especially travelling with a friend also assigned to the same state. “Corpers on board” was boldly written on our vehicle, and people we passed hailed and prayed for our safe journey. We chatted and played music, making the journey memorable. Yet, amidst the laughter and anticipation, a moment of stark reality halted us in our tracks. In the midst of lush landscapes, armed men appeared — a stark reminder of the world’s unpredictability. It was a wake-up call, underscoring the importance of vigilance, even in seemingly serene surroundings. We stopped at a canteen to eat a sumptuous meal, enjoying the privileges of being a corper. Continuing our journey, we enjoyed the natural beauty of Nigeria’s landscapes.

Security checkpoints manned by dedicated officers reassured us of their commitment to our safety. Their professionalism and integrity stood as beacons of hope on an otherwise uncertain journey. The most unexpected twist came when a seemingly menacing encounter turned into a moment of levity. Startled awake by a tap on the shoulder, I found myself face-to-face with an armed security officer, his stern demeanour giving way to a shared joke. In that moment, fear melted into laughter, reminding me that amidst life’s uncertainties, moments of joy abound. As we finally arrived at our destination, the journey left an indelible mark. From cautionary tales to unexpected camaraderie, each moment was a testament to the importance of preparation and vigilance. As I shared my tale with my hustling friend, who had chosen a different path, I couldn’t help but wonder what adventures awaited him. For in the journey of NYSC, every twist and turn is a chapter waiting to be written, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the bonds that unite us all. This is the essence of NYSC, preaching national unity and peace. Apart from the interesting aspects of NYSC, there are numerous advantages that I believe will convince you to join the programme. If you want to know the funny joke the officer cracked with me, I guess you should also prepare to go for your NYSC, so you can experience how interesting and memorable the journey was. As long as we take the necessary security precautions and avoid rough driving, NYSC ensures our safety because we are all dear to the government.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 — The government assured that the Specialisation Degree Training Programme or “Parallel Pathway” issue will be resolved promptly, and that a proposed solution framework has been submitted to the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) for evaluation. Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Zambry Abdul Kadir stated that discussions with the Ministry of Health have been held recently to find a solution regarding legal aspects, in addition to issues related to the recognition of medical programmes, offered in universities. “The government is currently examining comprehensive solutions that also involve legal aspects such as a need for any amendments to the Medical Act 1971, in addition to matters related to the recognition of medical programmes offered at universities. “We have looked into it more deeply and identified that it needs to be resolved regarding matters within legal provisions,” he said after attending the investED training programme graduation ceremony organised by the Securities Commission here today. The Parallel Pathway issue gained attention when the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) requested Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) to allow entry of non-Bumiputera medical officers who wished to undergo specialised training in cardiothoracic fields, just like how the institution accepts international students. This comes after the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC) rejected the applications of four cardiothoracic surgeons to be listed in the National Specialist Register due to their Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in Cardiothoracic Surgery (FRCS Ed) qualification not being recognised. Commenting further, Zambry said the issue should not only focus on the matter of admitting these four doctors to UiTM but also on why the MMC does not recognise their academic qualifications. “It is unfair if we accuse UiTM of being too rigid and not providing space, showing no compassion to urgent cases. This involves the MMC. Even though they (doctors) may be allowed to temporarily pass out if UiTM provides space, ultimately will the MMC accept them or not? This is the real question,” he said. He also urged the public to have confidence in the ongoing solution efforts and emphasised that the issue should not be exploited for political gains by any party trying to exaggerate the matter. — Bernama",

        "content": "Lagos-based amputee, Idris Aliu, 31, shares with ABDULLATEEF FOWEWE how the amputation of his hand from a tender age hindered his pursuit of becoming a professional footballer Could you recount the events that led to the amputation of your hand? I’m Idris Aliu, and I’m 31 years old. I am from Kogi State but was born and raised in Ikorodu, Lagos State. The journey toward amputation began in 2005. One day, while I was holding onto a tree branch, it unexpectedly broke, causing me to fall and fracture my left wrist. I was promptly taken to a herbal healer for treatment, and initially, the recovery seemed to be progressing well. However, one night, my condition took a turn for the worse. My hand began to deteriorate rapidly, with the decay spreading from my wrist toward my elbow and almost reaching my shoulder. While I’m not suggesting it was a supernatural occurrence, there’s a certain unpredictability to life. Faced with this dire situation, the only option left was to undergo amputation to save my life. And thus, my journey as an amputee began, marking a new chapter in my life. At which hospital did you undergo the procedure to have your hand amputated? My hand was amputated at Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in Ogun State. Initially, they were not the ones treating me when the incident occurred. I was taken to OSUTH to explore any possible remedies, but the only viable option at that point was amputation. Can you recall what transpired when you arrived at OSUTH? I distinctly remember the doctors and nurses expressing anger towards my parents for what they perceived as recklessness in delaying my treatment until my condition had significantly worsened. They found it hard to believe that my injury was less than a month old. It was only after the surgery that they discovered something unusual that was causing the decay in my hand. Surprisingly, this was not mentioned in my medical report. Initially, they attributed the decay to improper care, but a specific doctor who later took charge of my case explained certain aspects to my father. What did the doctor say to your father? My father didn’t delve into many details, possibly because I was young at the time. However, I recall him saying, “Aliu, everything you mentioned about your hand was accurate. The doctor confirmed it.” Interestingly, I used to complain about hearing strange sounds, as if something was burning inside my hand. Strangely, I was the only one who could hear these sounds. Why did you think it was a spiritual issue? One of the doctors explained to us after the surgery that there was a substance, akin to poison, rapidly consuming my hand. It was eating away at my hand so quickly that I was fortunate to have survived as long as I did before the surgery. What was your initial reaction upon learning about the amputation? Initially, I wasn’t informed directly about the amputation. Instead, I was simply told I had an appointment with the doctor in the theatre room. Being young, only 13 years old at the time and in Junior Secondary School, I didn’t fully grasp the gravity of the situation. However, upon regaining consciousness after the surgery, I became aware that my hand had been amputated. Were you not informed about the amputation beforehand? No, I wasn’t informed directly, but I sensed that my appointment with the doctor was different from the usual. I was perceptive enough to realise something was amiss, but I didn’t want to pry too much, especially since I could sense my mother’s unease with my meeting with the doctors that day. Despite feeling devastated upon waking up and realising my hand was gone, I understood deep down that my parents wouldn’t have consented to amputate my hand if there had been any other viable option. How did you manage to cope after the amputation? Coping with the reality of living with a hand amputation was incredibly challenging. I found myself in tears almost every day, struggling to come to terms with the fact that my life had been altered forever. However, the unwavering support of my parents, particularly my late mother, as well as my siblings, and the compassionate care from the doctors and nurses, especially my physician, played a significant role in helping me navigate the difficult period. Their love and encouragement made me realise that despite my disability, I still possessed immense potential. What has been the most difficult aspect of adjusting to life with a missing hand? One of the most challenging aspects has been the realisation that my dream of becoming a professional footballer had to be abandoned. The thought of not being able to pursue my passion at a professional level still weighs heavily on me. Although I continue to play football with friends and participate in local tournaments, the reminder that I can’t pursue it professionally is a constant source of heartache. Also, It was truly disheartening to realise that I couldn’t pursue my passion for learning Aluminium fabrication, especially since I had planned to start after completing Junior Secondary School. I had everything mapped out in my mind, but it seems that it wasn’t meant to be. Despite this setback, I’ve learned to adapt and focus on other skills. Although the journey might be challenging initially, I am determined to excel in whatever I set my mind to. On a positive note, I’ve discovered a talent for playing video games, and at one point, I was considered one of the best in soccer video games in my area in Ikorodu. How did your classmates react when you returned to school with one hand? My classmates were already aware of my situation, as my father had informed my class teacher and the school authorities. However, they were genuinely happy to see me return to school, as some had feared I might not come back after missing a whole term. Their warm reception and support meant a lot to me and helped ease my transition back to school life. Did you continue your education past high school? No, I was unable to due to financial limitations. Have you ever experienced ridicule or mockery due to having one hand? Yes, I faced mockery several times, but I was able to overcome it with my talents in football and video games. Despite the taunts, I found solace in my abilities and the support I received from those around me. Being constantly surrounded by people in public places, I often received praise and encouragement, which helped offset the negative comments. While some kids may have been envious of the attention I received, I learned not to let the mockery affect me. It was just part of the normal banter that occurs among children, and over time, I became accustomed to it and even found humour in it. What activities or ventures are you currently involved in? I used to run a sports betting business, managing my own shop. However, the business eventually faced challenges, primarily due to insufficient capital and a lack of funds to maintain and upgrade it to the required standard. As a result, I am currently not engaged in any specific venture. Were you ever subjected to bullying or discrimination due to your missing hand while working there? I didn’t experience any bullying; in fact, I was quite popular among the people, possibly because my shop was located in my neighbourhood where I was well-known. I believe my approachability and humility contributed to being well-liked, even beyond my immediate community. Has the amputation of your hand ever hindered your ability to secure employment? Yes, it has. One particularly painful instance was during a football screening. Despite being one of the top performers, I was dropped and replaced by someone else simply because I had only one arm. The white man acknowledged my skill and said that I was good enough to proceed to the next screening stage, but my physical condition led to my replacement. As a form of consolation, my coach was given some money to give to me. Have you attempted to join the physically challenged football league? Yes, I have. Unfortunately, the system isn’t very supportive in Nigeria. I used to make frequent trips to Surulere, seeking the right contacts to help me get involved. However, I learned that there is no permanent soccer team or organisation for the physically challenged. They only bring people together and train for a particular tournament, after which the team disbands. It’s disheartening that our country does not provide adequate support or encouragement for the physically challenged. When I see how things are organised abroad, it leaves me feeling like I would do anything to find a way out of this country to pursue my dream. If you were to offer advice to the government, what would it be? I would advise the government to invest more in sports, especially para-sports, and to establish a system where the disabled or physically challenged receive monthly support from the government. These kinds of support systems are common in other countries, and Nigeria should not be an exception. How do you envision Nigerians supporting you? Primarily, I need a comfortable artificial hand. While I have acquired one, it isn’t the best fit for me as it is quite heavy. I am aware that there are lighter and more suitable options available, but they come at a high cost. Additionally, I would greatly appreciate assistance in joining the Nigerian physically challenged soccer team and perhaps even the opportunity to travel abroad to showcase my skills on an international platform. Furthermore, I would be grateful for any help or financial support to start a new business to provide for my family. I am married with a two-year-old daughter, and life has been challenging since my betting shop business failed. The current economic situation is tough, especially for those without stable employment. Can you share the story of how you met your wife? She was a student at Lagos State Polytechnic, now LASUSTECH when our paths crossed. I met her one fateful afternoon near the school premises, we exchanged numbers, and the rest, as they say, is history. How did you approach her despite your condition? Despite having only one hand, I didn’t see it as a barrier. I believe my condition doesn’t define me or diminish my worth since I didn’t murder anyone. Confidence is key, and I’ve always been confident in myself. Additionally, I make an effort to take care of myself and present myself well, believing that looking good is important. What was your wife’s reaction when you first approached her? When I approached her, it wasn’t completely out of the blue. We were familiar with each other as we lived in the same area. This familiarity made the initial approach smoother and more comfortable for both of us. What about her parents’ reaction? Initially, winning over her parents, especially her mother, was challenging. Understandably, no parent wants their child to face unnecessary challenges by marrying a physically challenged individual. However, I had already established a strong relationship with her elder siblings, which played a significant role in convincing her mother to accept our relationship. Eventually, her mother agreed, understanding that it was her daughter’s choice and that I was a suitable partner for her. Given what you’ve been through, do you still have faith in herbal healers? Absolutely. I still have faith in them. My experience has shown me that herbal healers can be effective. I have witnessed many cases where herbal remedies have been successful, both before and after my own incident. However, I would advise caution and careful consideration when seeking herbal treatments. What advice would you give to individuals facing similar challenges like yours? My advice to those facing similar challenges is to remain active. Dressing well and socialising can help maintain a positive outlook. It’s natural to feel down or useless at times, especially when facing limitations in activities you once enjoyed. However, finding new interests and activities that bring joy and a sense of purpose is crucial. Remember, you are not disabled but a unique individual with a remarkable soul.",

        "content": "A new parliament convened in Iran’s capital Tehran for the first time on Monday, days after a deadly helicopter crash which killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Local media reported that lawmakers in the Islamic Consultative Assembly opened the first session of the legislative period with a recitation from the Koran. A new parliamentary speaker is set to be elected in the coming days. Incumbent Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, is running for re-election against religious hardliner Mojtaba Zonnour and former foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki. Elections in Iran are widely seen as neither free nor fair, as the country’s Guardian Council, a supervisory body of Islamic clerics and lawyers, must approve all candidates before they can run. Hardliners won this year’s parliamentary elections, which were held over two rounds in March and May amid a historically low turnout of around 40 per cent. Many Iranian citizens have become disillusioned in the face of political repression, an economic crisis and failed attempts to reform the country’s political system. A wave of protests in September 2022 following the death of a young Kurdish woman, Masha Amini, was violently suppressed by authorities. Political power in Iran is concentrated in the hands of the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran’s president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian died in a helicopter crash near the border to Azerbaijan more than a week ago. According to media reports, more than three million people attended Raisi’s funeral in the north-eastern city of Mashhad on Thursday after days of national mourning. (dpa/NAN)",

        "description": "Daria Saville has joined Australia's casualty list at Roland Garros, losing in the first-round after an untimely rain break.",
        "content": "Australia's tale of Roland Garros woe has continued with Daria Saville's exit ensuring an opening-round wipeout in the women's singles at the French Open for the first time this century. Saville fought valiantly against one of the rising stars of the women's game, 12th seed Jasmine Paolini, but her second-set fightback fell agonisingly short on Monday, interrupted by an hour's rain delay that quite halted her momentum. The 30-year-old Saville, who'd fought back from 5-1 down in the second to the verge of 5-4 when the rains came, returned after the break only to lose all four points on the Italian's final service game as she succumbed 6-3 6-4 in an hour-and-a-half. It means that after Ajla Tomljanovic's exit on Sunday at the hands of No.30 seed Dayana Yastremska, there will be no Australian woman in the second round at Roland Garros for the first time since 1997 when Rachel McQuillan and Annabel Ellwood were the lone entrants. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Tomljanovic's defeat had been the prelude to a miserable opening day for the Australian contingent, with Jordan Thompson and Aleksandar Vukic both getting knocked out before Chris O'Connell pulled out from the tournament with a shoulder injury. But Australia's No.1 Saville wasn't complaining about her loss, bemoaning only that she served so poorly, holding her delivery just once in eight attempts while also gifting nine double faults. \"Obviously, I'm not happy with the way I served, I gave her a lot of free points,\" said Saville. \"I felt like the whole match was actually a lot closer than maybe the scoreline suggested, with a lot of deuce games and although she was hurting me with her forehand a lot, I still felt on the baseline rallies, we were head-to-head. \"But then I struggled with the serve, and it cost me, especially in the first set.\" She felt after pulling back three games in the final set that she was really in with a chance. \"But at 5-4 on that return game, I made four unforced forehand errors, trying to dictate but missing. I'm okay with that, though, because I think I took a chance, but it just didn't work out. \"Maybe I should have played more safe, but I don't think that would have got me anywhere either.\"",

        "description": "The SNP leader was campaigning in Dumfries, part of the Dumfries and Galloway constituency won by Scottish Secretary Alister Jack in 2019.",
        "content": "Mr Swinney, who took over as SNP leader from Humza Yousaf just three weeks ago, said the party was already united behind him and was “very focused on the election campaign”. However, polls have shown the party, which for years has been the dominant force in Scottish politics, is now trailing behind Labour in the run-up to the July 4 voting day. Most recently, a poll by More In Common put support for Labour on 35%, five points ahead of the SNP. Mr Swinney insisted the SNP was “focused on the election as a united party”, adding this was a “significant achievement” which had come about in the “very short space of time” since he took charge. Speaking to journalists as he campaigned in Dumfries, Mr Swinney said: “I want to make sure we take our message to every part of the country to reclaim the ground the opinion polls indicate we have got to reclaim to be successful. “The election is the best part of six weeks away and we have got a lot of ground to cover to do that.” Asked if that meant the SNP was now fighting this election as the “underdog”, the Scottish First Minister said: “That’s an interesting way to put it. “Actually, it is quite a good way to fight an election campaign, if I think back to the contest in 2017 in my own local area, Perth and North Perthshire.” Mr Swinney said in that general election it had been thought the SNP could lose that seat, but he noted: “We fought it as the underdog and we won. So, I think there is maybe something in that.” The SNP leader was campaigning in the Dumfries and Galloway seat currently held by Scottish Secretary Alister Jack. Mr Swinney said the Tory cabinet secretary, along with other Scottish Conservative MPs, had “presided over austerity, Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis being inflicted on Scotland” – adding that voters were “angry” about this. He told people living in those seats held by the Tories in Scotland: “If you want to do something about it, then you vote SNP, because we are the challenger to the Conservatives in these constituencies, and we can remove those Conservative MPs with SNP votes. “My message to voters in this part of the country and in other areas where the Conservatives represent the area is to vote SNP to remove the Tories.”",

        "content": "The Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Ahmed Dangiwa, has reiterated his commitment to eliminate barriers hindering a large scale of homeownership in the country. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony for the Renewed Hope Housing Delivery Portal held at ministry headquarters in Abuja recently, the minister disclosed that the government was ready to institute several policy initiatives to make it easier and more convenient for Nigerians to own their homes. The Renewed Hope Housing Delivery Portal is expected to grant access to 100,000 houses across Nigeria. The Renewed Hope Cities and Estates web portal, where Nigerians, including those in the Diaspora, can apply is The minister recalled that in December 2023, the ministry signed an MoU with a consortium of developers led by Continental Civil to deliver 100,000 housing units nationwide. He noted the inaugurated platform was a key part of the partnership. According to Dangiwa, the innovative platform provides an online, transparent, easy-to-use, integrated web-based application for the sale of homes under the ministry’s Renewed Hope Housing Programme. He explained that the platform also integrated features that offered flexible payment options, including one-time payments and instalment plans, catering to different financial situations. The minister said buyers could also apply for the release of up to 25 per cent of their retirement savings account balance for additional financial support He said, “When we assumed duty, we promised to work in line with His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, to break all the barriers to homeownership for Nigerians. “We also promised to facilitate and promote the creation of technological systems and private sector-led initiatives that will make it simpler, easier, and more convenient for Nigerians to own their homes. “Today, we are gathered here to take yet another major step towards achieving that promise with the launch of the Renewed Hope Housing Platform.” The minister added that the innovative platform was groundbreaking, providing an online, transparent, easy-to-use, integrated web-based application for the sale of homes under the Renewed Hope Cities and Estates Programme of the ministry. “The platform has many benefits for homebuyers. It has a user-friendly interface to ensure that the journey to homeownership is smooth and straightforward. It ensures a seamless and secure registration process with identity verification, enabling potential homeowners to efficiently search for properties using various filters, ensuring they find homes that meet their specific needs,” he explained. Dangiwa further charged all Nigerians to take advantage of the platform to apply for the houses, adding that “with the platform, you do not need to know anybody to own a home. It is transparent, and the criteria are open to all”. Meanwhile, the government has pegged the price of a 1–3-bedroom flat located at Karsana, Abuja to cost between N22.5m and N65.5m. It also offered different prices for custom-built houses and finished option houses. For houses in Kano and Katsina States, the houses were priced between N9.1m and N12.6m.",

        "content": "Dylan Minnette, who rose to fame following his role in 13 Reasons Why, revealed the reason behind taking a break from acting. In a recent interview, he said that he left acting as he decided to focus on music with his rock band Wallows, Variety reported. The 13 Reasons Why star began his acting career as a child star at the age of 8 and touched the new heights of fame after playing Clay Jensen in the popular series. “I was fortunate to find success in [acting],” said Dylan Minnette. “I was on 13 Reasons Why and it was really popular and definitely reached a peak in what I’ve had in acting. But it also started to feel like a bit of a job. And I was in a very fortunate position, it was always fun for me, always really inspiring, but then it was just starting to feel like just a job.” According to the actor, he along with his other band members had dreamed of taking music “all the way as far as we can.” Read more: ‘I must not do any more dramas or films...’: Momina Iqbal is quitting showbiz? “The only way that’s gonna happen is if I put my 100% time and energy into it and take it very seriously and show the world that we all take this very seriously. This is a real band, we’re going to do real band things,” he said. However, the 13 Reasons Why actor said that he does thinks about returning to the screen on occasions. He planned to make a return to acting last year, however, he could not do it due to the actors strike. Minnette’s last outing was in 2022’s Scream and The Dropout and has since remained out of the spotlight.",

        "content": "The National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) has embarked on the second round of public participation on the revised National Strategy to Counter Violent Extremism (NSCVE). Last November, NCTC launched a comprehensive nationwide exercise to gather insights and feedback from a broad spectrum of stakeholders including community leaders, civil society organizations, security experts and the general public. The exercise aimed to assess the effectiveness of the current strategy that has been in place for the last seven years and to incorporate valuable perspectives. Joseph Mureithi NCTC Official said the initial phase of consultations yielded significant input, informing the development of a draft document that seeks to address emerging threats, incorporate good practices and strengthen our collective resilience against violent extremism. The second round of public participation is designed to present the draft document to the public for inputs, solicit feedback and to foster engagement. NCTC today held a public participation with security teams and stakeholders from Mombasa, Kwale, Taita-Taveta, Kilifi, Lamu and Kwale counties. “We are here to engage the public and our partners about the ongoing review process for the NSCVE. It is part of the constitutional requirement to get public views,” said Mureithi in Mombasa. “We had a strategy that has taken us through from 2016. It has come to a time to build on the lessons learnt, we need also to build on what we have achieved and improve on the ways we deal with Violent Extremism as a country,” he added. Mureithi noted that through the 2016 strategy they have been working in a collaborative and multi-agency set up and were able to reduce cases of VE in the country. The new strategy will make the country safer. The reviewed NSCVE has been established to address issues related to gender, youth, inclusion and the need for male mentorship, the strategy is now anchored in the Constitution, Law and Policy. The approach to monitoring & evaluation has been improved by providing clear outcomes that will serve as the units of measure for impact. The strategy has reorganized the pillars into working groups, transforming them from coordination mechanisms into delivery units. Each working group will mobilize local actors and have clear outputs aligned with intended outcomes. It provides further clarity on violent extremism as defined by Prevention of Terrorism Act 2012, distinguishing it from other forms of crime. The strategy also addresses the issues of resourcing and sustainability. “We have been working on building trust between the citizens and the security. We have been cooperating well. The fight against terrorism relies on the cooperation between security agencies and the public. We continue to encourage the strengthening of cooperation,” said Mureithi. The terrorism menace, he added, is not a government issue but a societal problem that needs the participation of all the people. Mombasa County Commissioner Mohamed Noor urged residents to give views to improve the draft strategy to solve CVE challenges.",

        "content": "Karnataka Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre said the state government will foot the Rs 80 lakh bill of PM Modi's stay at the Radisson Blu Plaza during his Mysuru visit in April last year. Published: May 27, 2024 7:00 PM IST By Recently, a row erupted after news broke that the hotel where PM Modi had stayed had threatened legal action to recover its dues, over a year after the bill, which runs up to Rs 80 lakh, remained unpaid. In a statement on Monday, Karnataka Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre said the state government will foot the bill of Modi’s stay and said efforts are being made to resolve the matter in an amicable manner. “The state government’s forest department had written to them (authority). They informed that the hotel bill (Rs 80 lakh) should be reimbursed by the state government and we have decided to reimburse. So, there is no issue,” he added. As per the statement, Khandre said it a state government tradition to host dignitaries like the Prime Minister and the President when they come. But due to Assembly elections in Karnataka in April last year, the state government was not involved in planning of the programme (Project Tiger) since Model Code of Conduct (MCC) was in force. Talking to reporters, the Karnataka Minister said that PM Modi had visited Myrusu-Bandipur on the eve of commemoration of 50 years of Project Tiger, but the state government was not involved in the planning of the event as MCC was in force. Hence, it was purely a Central government programme. “Initially, they had planned to spend around Rs 3 crore but the expenditure incurred was around 6.33 crore. So, balance 3.3 crore has to come from the National Tiger Conservation Authority,” he said. For breaking news and live news updates, like us on or follow us on and . Read more on Latest on .

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Beer Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. History Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. Food For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Art Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Outdoor recreation Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Sports and festivals Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Beer Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds.

Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Art Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Outdoor recreation Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Sports and festivals Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices.

Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall.

        "description": "The resolution he explained, had paved the way for the return of Emirates Airlines to Nigerian skies.The post Nigeria, Saudi Arabia To Resume Cargo Flights- Keyamo appeared first on Channels Television.",
        "content": "The Minister of Aviation, Festus Keyamo, has hinted at plans for the resumption of cargo flights between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Keyamo while reeling out the achievements of the aviation sector at the 3rd ministerial updates on Monday in Abuja, said the feat would be achieved through collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). According to Keyamo, the decision was finalised during a recent visit to Saudi Arabia, where he met with his counterpart. “I have good news for you from Saudi Arabia. I met my counterpart in Saudi Arabia and we have agreed to resume cargo flights,” Keyamo stated. He highlighted that these flights had been suspended for an extended period but with the new agreement, cargo services would be restored to boost trade and logistical connections between the two nations. Keyamo also addressed another critical issue on Monday concerning the clearance of foreign airlines’ funds trapped in Nigeria. Keyamo added that the Federal Government has also ensured the clearance of a longstanding backlog of trapped funds for foreign airlines hence the return of Emirates Airlines to Nigerian skies. This, he noted, has positively impacted the financial stability of the aviation industry. Emirates announced on May 16, 2024, its plans to recommence flights to Nigerian airports starting from October 1, 2024, after a long break from Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had in January said the Federal Government had “concluded the payment of all verified claims’’ by foreign airlines with the payment of an additional $64.44m to concerned airlines. The development had brought the total verified amount paid to the air transport sector to $136.73m, adding that “all the verified airline claims had now been cleared.”",

        "content": "Early introduction of peanuts in infants leads to a 71% reduction in adolescent peanut allergy risk, a groundbreaking study reveals. Introducing peanuts into infants’ diets from as early as four months has been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of developing a peanut allergy in adolescence, a long-term study from King’s College London reveals. The study confirms that early and regular peanut consumption lowers the risk of allergy by 71% compared to avoidance. Feeding children peanuts regularly from infancy to age five reduced the rate of peanut allergy in adolescence by 71%, even after many years when the children ate or avoided peanuts as desired. The new findings provide conclusive evidence that introducing peanuts into babies’ diets early will achieve long-term prevention of peanut allergy. Importance of Early Introduction Lead investigator Professor Gideon Lack from King’s College London said: “Decades of advice to avoid peanuts has made parents fearful of introducing peanuts at an early age. The evidence is clear that the early introduction of peanuts in infancy induces long-term tolerance and protects children from allergies well into adolescence. This simple intervention will make a remarkable difference to future generations and see peanut allergies plummet.” LEAP-Trio Trial Findings Results from the LEAP-Trio trial are published today (May 27) in the NEJM Evidence by researchers from King’s College London and sponsored and co-funded by the US National Institutes of Health ’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Peanut allergy is rising in Western countries. The prevalence of peanut allergy is about 2% in young children in North America, UK, Western Europe, and Australia. For some, even small amounts of peanuts can lead to a life-threatening allergic reaction. This, as well as conflicting advice, has made parents and caregivers fearful of introducing peanuts into diets. Building on Previous Research The new research findings come from the LEAP-Trio study, building on the results of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) clinical trial. In the first trial, half of the participants were asked to regularly consume peanuts from infancy until age 5 years, while the other half were asked to avoid peanuts during that period. Researchers found that early introduction of peanuts reduced the risk of peanut allergy at age 5 by 81%. Long-Term Follow-Up Results The investigators followed up both groups from age 6 to age 12 or older. In that period, children could choose to eat peanuts in whatever amount and frequency they wanted. They found that 15.4% of participants from the early childhood peanut-avoidance group and 4.4% from the early childhood peanut-consumption group had peanut allergy at age 12 or older. These results show that regular, early peanut consumption reduce the risk of peanut allergy in adolescence by 71% compared to early peanut avoidance. Implementation of Early Peanut Introduction Professor George Du Toit, Co-Lead Investigator from King’s College London said: “This is a safe and highly effective intervention which can be implemented as early as 4 months of age. The infant needs to be developmentally ready to start weaning and peanuts should be introduced as a soft pureed paste or as peanut puffs.” Study Methodology and Implications The researchers also found that although participants in the LEAP peanut-consumption group ate more peanuts throughout childhood than the other participants overall, the frequency and amount of peanuts consumed varied widely in both groups and included periods of not eating peanuts. This shows that the protective effect of early peanut consumption lasts without the need to consistently eat peanut products throughout childhood and early adolescence. The LEAP-Trio study team tested the adolescents for peanut allergy primarily through an oral food challenge. This involved giving participants gradually increasing amounts of peanuts in a carefully controlled setting to determine if they could safely consume at least 5 grams of peanuts, the equivalent of more than 20 peanuts. The study team also surveyed participants about their recent patterns of peanut consumption and verified the self-reports through measurements of peanuts in dust from participants’ beds, a technique previously validated by LEAP investigators. Professor Lack, who is the Head of the Children’s Allergy Service at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, added: “Early consumption of peanuts will prevent more than 100,000 new cases of peanut allergy every year worldwide.” Reference: 27 May 2024, NEJM Evidence .",

        "content": "LIMERICK recorded a ten-point victory over Waterford on a final scoreline of 2-14 to 0-30 in round five of the Munster Senior Hurling Championship on Sunday afternnon at the TUS Gaelic Grounds. Limerick now face Clare in the Munster Senior Hurling Championship final on Sunday June 9 at 4pm in Semple Stadium, Thurles. Limerick's second half performance On 55 minutes the game was in the melting pot when Waterford substitute Patrick Fitzgerald sent over a point to have Waterford trailing by two points 2-13 to 0-21. In the final quarter final Limerick outscored their opponents 0-09 to 0-01 with Aaron Gillane, Shane O'Brien, Diarmaid Byrnes, Conor Boylan, Gearoid Hegarty, Cian Lynch and Adam English all on target for John Kiely's side in a comprehensive victory in the end. The strength of Limerick's bench Seamus Flanagan was forced off on 20 minutes with a hamstring injury. Limerick U20 star Shane O'Brien replaced the full forward where he made his championship debut chipping in with three points from play. Conor Boylan and Adam English have made significant impacts throughout the Munster Championship and both players were off the mark for the Shannonsiders in the final quarter. Limerick's shooting The most remarkable statistic from Limerick's victory is that the reigning All-Ireland champions managed to get 49 shots off but the one concern for John Kiely is that his side registered 19 wides. In the opening period, Limerick were using the strong breeze to their advantage but 14 of their wides came in the first half and Limerick will be looking for an improvement on their accuracy in front of goal heading into the Munster decider. Limerick and Clare renew their rivalry Limerick and Clare will face off in the Munster Senior Hurling Championship final for the third year in a row. There has been nothing between the sides in the last two years, in 2022 Limerick came out on top by three points on a final scoreline of 1-29 to 0-29 after extra time. Last year's final in the TUS Gaelic Grounds was similar where Limerick defeated the Banner county by the minimum. The clash between the counties on June 9 will be no different.",

        "content": "Sometime this week, it appears, the infamous Abuja light rail will thunder into life. Again. Perhaps for a year or two. According to Nyesom Wike, the Federal Capital Territory(FCT) Minister, the new tape-cutting will be undertaken by President Bola Tinubu in celebration of his first anniversary in office. To that extent, I am in full approval, as his government needs to show something for its presence. It is ironic that for this, the APC government owes its gratitude to Mr. Wike, a PDP mainstreamer, but these are desperate times. APC ought simply to have announced that the train services were being restored and left it at that. In July 2018, the service was loudly inaugurated by the fake anti-corruption leader from Daura, who then sat back in the same city and watched it go out of service and into decay. When the service resumes, for the few in Abuja who can take advantage of it, the ruling party will have plenty to be grateful to the opposing PDP for, including what Minister Wike described as the building of access roads to the train stops. It would be remembered that last October, the government approved N5.9 billion for the construction of those roads, which was apparently quickly undertaken, although it is unclear where they are, how the contractors obtained and completed the jobs so quickly, or what standards they met. Wike also identified design omissions he had inherited in the rail system, such as escalators and elevators, and waiting room air-conditioning, but observed that they will not hinder the resumption of services. The Minister also announced large savings in training costs, telling journalists last week: “Before we came, the former administration approved $128 million for the training of our people by CCECC for 29 months, and we said no, that’s very exorbitant. We renegotiated with CCECC, and now it has been brought down to $75 million. We have saved no less than $53 million for the government.” These issues are critical to understanding the hollowness of governance in Nigeria, not simply our infrastructure chaos. In a previous article, I drew attention to the reckless spending in the rail sector during the Buhari years, including the Abuja light rail. As part of that story, I provided evidence that in addition to the $823m spent on the abandoned Phase I, the Buhari government in May 2017 also signed a contract worth US$1.473 billion with the Board of Directors of China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC), the parent company of CCECC, for Phase II. Indeed, two months earlier, the then-FCT Minister, Mohammed Bello, had announced that the China Exim Bank would bankroll Phase II for $1.79bn. Phase II was also to be completed in 54 months: that is, in 2021, two years before Buhari was due to be separated from the presidency. Characteristically, he neither delivered nor ever mentioned it again. As one who has kept a close eye on the rail file, I believe this to be deliberate. The Buhari government had neither the intention nor the capacity to advance the sector beyond politics. That is why projects and contracts got bandied around so much, particularly by Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi, a man who advertised how much he did not like money. Maybe he did not. The alternative is that he was incompetent and complicit. Of his tenure, in 2019 I penned Infrastructure Games I and II, which partly explored his, and his government’s, inconsistencies. In the closing years of the Buhari presidency, they also spawned such headlines as: “Lack of funds halts Eastern railway project —FG,” (The Primanews, December 2022); “Lack Of Funds Stalls N16tr Railway Projects Across Nigeria,” (Daily Trust, September 2023); and “Poor Funding Model, Paucity, Stall $3.2bn Eastern Rail Project Three Years After,” (The Guardian, April 2024). But none of this was true: it was the government, not an absence of funding or of prospective funders, that had grounded infrastructure development. Governments, government officials, their families and cronies did not lack funds to live in luxury, including through the fleecing of their offices, it was when it came to service or telling the truth that there was a problem. And there was a problem with funding infrastructure, particularly rail, as loan negotiations with China had ground to a halt in the early months of Buhari’s arrival. According to the story, the Chinese government, reportedly concerned about the fast-fingers of Nigerian officials, was insisting that for Nigeria to obtain any more loans, it must concede their supervision to Chinese officials. That story was broken by The Guardian in August 2016, and it meant that for the entirety of the Buhari Years, the speeches its officials made about loan arrangements and expectations with China were patently false. It was why the government was floundering all over, and back to Beijing. Some areas of the rail file got so messy that on many occasions, beginning as early as November 2016, National Assembly committees commenced investigation of Mr. Amaechi, but none of them yielded anything. Frustrated newspaper editors agonized about both trade and politics. How did the Buhari government respond? It maintained a straight face, told more robust lies, and issued more contracts as time ran out, including, in February 2022, a $329 million in consultancy fees “for the supervision of the various railway projects in the country.” Three hundred and twenty-nine million, not for a rail project, but for “consultancy supervision.” That was the scenario in which Buhari’s Abuja light rail of 2018 collapsed in 2020 and the country was strewn with a litany of broken infrastructure promises as he departed. When Mr. Tinubu congratulates himself on the re-completion and re-inauguration of Phase I of the Abuja rail then, he must remember to unveil Phase II. It is inconceivable that a project that was supposed to have been completed three years ago is hiding in the open. What does the future hold? If it is to endure, the government must set up appropriate structures and hand the project over to experts who know what it is to run a light rail facility. The good folks at the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) are already out of their depth using bottles to supply diesel to trains in dangerous forests and leaves to try to stop engine fires. In a riveting story last year, rail expert Rowland Ataguba, a member of the NRC, offered a penetrating analysis of ‘The Trouble With ‘Abuja Light Rail.’ If we are not to be back here within a couple of years trying to restart Phase I of this novel rail system, the government must put it in the hands of such people and step back. Already, we have become the laughing-stock of the travel world, Bloomberg last year calling the Abuja light rail a ‘ghost train’ and the ‘latest example of empty promises in Nigeria.’ The two rail-track “security contracts” the Buhari government issued in 2022 for $1.7m expire three months from now, and that government never obeyed a court order to account for its predecessors’CCTV scams between 2004 and 2013. In other words, apart from when Tinubu and Wike ride the rail, the system will be defenceless from Day One.",

        "description": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas.",
        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "description": "Emergency family shelters will cost the county $34 million this year, part of a nearly $200 million homelessness prevention and housing stability effort.",
        "content": "Imani Swinney moved to Minneapolis last year at the urging of her mother, who told her that the resources available in the city gave her a better shot at getting back on her feet. Swinney and her two young daughters were \"couch hopping,\" living with family and friends in North Carolina, when she decided to make the cross-country move to start over. At first, they lived with Swinney's mom and friends. But last summer, they ended up in an emergency shelter for homeless families funded by Hennepin County at the Holiday Inn in Bloomington. Once there, Swinney was surprised at how quickly county social workers helped her find income and food assistance. By fall, the family moved into a new apartment, and in the following months, Swinney got her driver's license back, bought a car, finished school and landed a job. \"You've got them by a landslide,\" Swinney said of the help available to families in Minnesota compared with some other states. In recent years, Hennepin County has helped hundreds of families like Swinney's escape homelessness and find stable housing. County leaders say this is one of the last places in the U.S. that promises to house all families with children — no matter the cost. David Hewitt, human services director for housing stability, said he summarizes the policy enacted in 2005 as \"no child sleeps outside.\" County leaders acknowledge that people from other parts of Minnesota, other states and outside the U.S. have come to Hennepin County because of the strong safety net. Still, county officials don't want to be the homeless shelter for other communities, so staffers work to determine which jurisdictions are financially responsible for those seeking help. That can be difficult, especially for people from other states or countries. County Commissioner Jeffrey Lunde said other communities may have \"quietly rolled up their 'All Are Welcome' flags and put them back in the garage\" but Hennepin County continues to provide shelter to everyone it can help. Keeping up with the demand has been increasingly challenging — and costly. The need for family shelter space surged after the eviction moratorium implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic ended in 2022 and filings reached record highs. A growing number of new arrivals from outside the U.S. further strained the system this winter, pushing occupancy rates of county shelters to 427% of their capacity. In February, more than half the families in the shelters were recent immigrants. To cover the growing costs, the County Board in March unanimously approved $9.6 million in additional spending, pushing the budget for family shelters to $34 million for 2024. In April, the board agreed to spend up to $9,000 a month for a \"safe space,\" which opened in December, that can serve as an overflow shelter when demand spikes. County leaders rely on a mix of local, state and federal dollars to pay their homelessness prevention efforts. They partner with cities like Minneapolis and local nonprofits like Catholic Charities or People Serving People to provide shelter and services. But funding for homeless shelters has typically fallen to local communities and charities. State support recently grew from $7 million to $22 million annually, but it still doesn't come close to meeting the demand. Hennepin County expects to spend $50 million on shelters this year; much of the money will come from local taxpayers. County officials focused a big part of federal pandemic aid on funding shelters, but that money will soon run out; officials anticipate a $13 million funding cliff in 2026. Nevertheless, commissioners have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to end chronic homelessness and improve residents' housing stability. They've successfully lobbied the state for new resources, such as more dedicated funding for shelters and rental assistance, as well as a new 0.25% sales tax for housing stability, which is expected to raise $29 million annually. \"A safe and affordable place to live is the foundation on which people build successful lives,\" County Board Chair Irene Fernando said in a statement. \"Hennepin County has a person-centered approach to providing housing, shelter and resources; our goal is to help everyone gain access to greater housing stability.\" It's not just the compassionate thing to do; it makes financial sense too, county officials said. People without shelter often end up in more costly places, like the emergency room or jail. \"All the stuff we can do to help people is much more effective if they have stable housing,\" Lunde said, noting that most people experiencing homelessness also need services for mental health, addiction and other challenges. Hennepin County's promise to shelter all families with children is just one part of Minnesota's largest homelessness prevention and housing stability program. The work has nearly $200 million in annual spending and a staff of 196 working to make homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring, while investing in more affordable housing. One of those staffers is social worker Mario A. Daniel, who works primarily with homeless young adults. On an April afternoon, Daniel checked in with clients at YouthLink in Minneapolis, which has a drop-in center with necessities like hot meals, showers and laundry as well as places to meet with counselors and other social service providers. Daniel said a big part of his job is helping clients navigate the many barriers that keep them from stable housing. A missing identification card, bad credit or a poor rental history can shut them out if they don't know how to advocate for themselves. \"Everyone needs something different,\" Daniel said, but most importantly: \"They need to realize that they deserve to have housing.\" For instance, Daniel helped Swinney sign up for income and food assistance and pay off outstanding fines so she could regain her driver's license. He also helped her and her daughters get the essentials they needed for their new apartment. \"He's always on top of stuff,\" Swinney said. \"I'm so grateful for him.\"",

        "description": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas.",
        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. Damage is seen after a storm the night before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Pryor, Okla. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas. Powerful storms left a wide trail of destruction Sunday across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "description": "Both Chelsea and Manchester United may be heading into a new season with a new manager as Newcastle United continue to back Eddie Howe",
        "content": "The Premier League campaign only concluded a few days ago but we're already seeing major managerial changes from some of the clubs set to do battle with Newcastle United next season. Brighton's Roberto De Zerbi opted to leave the south coast club after a disappointing campaign, before Chelsea and Mauricio Pochettino mutually agreed to part ways despite a strong end to the campaign. It also looks increasingly likely Erik ten Hag's position at Manchester United will soon be available despite an FA Cup win at the weekend. Meanwhile at Newcastle United , Eddie Howe will lead his side into next season despite a testing campaign and European disappointment. READ MORE: Eight Newcastle United stars at risk of summer exits as transfer plans take shape READ MORE: Yankuba Minteh quizzed over future as Newcastle ponder summer transfer decision Magpies co-owner Amanda Staveley raised eyebrows in 2021 when telling the world she believed Howe could become Newcastle's answer to Sir Alex Ferguson. In the cut-throat world of modern football, managers these days are lucky to last 26 weeks, never mind 26 years. Howe has an extremely long way to go to match the achievements of the Scot but behind the scenes there is major internal backing for the former Bournemouth boss. Despite a disappointing campaign on four fronts, Newcastle's ownership have resisted any urge to panic into a change in the dugout. Next season there is of course added pressure and Howe will be aware the support he currently enjoys both from the hierarchy and the fan base is not unconditional. A slow start could result in a decision being taken by Newcastle's Saudi majority owners in Riyadh. For now, it is refreshing to see 46-year-old given time to get things right. Many would not have expected such restraint from the Saudi Public Investment Fund given their vast resources and public desire to be 'number one'. Chelsea pipped Newcastle to sixth-place in the Premier League and will subsequently be playing Europa Conference League football instead of Howe's side - but that wasn't enough to salvage Poch's job. After a 12th-place finish the year before, and a barnstorming end to the season, the south American had started to win fans over. Owner Todd Boehly wasn't impressed, however, and with the two often at war in public over the direction of the club, the decision was taken to part ways. The likes of De Zerbi, Brentford's Thomas Frank and Leicester City's Enzo Maresca are all in the running to replace Pochettino. Newcastle were sandwiched in between the Blues and Manchester United in the league table, with the latter finishing eighth and therefore set to miss out on Europe until they won the FA Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Ten Hag now has two trophies in two seasons and after a plethora of injury concerns this term, has been applauded for ensuring the season ended on a high. The Glazer family and minority owners INEOS now have a decision to make. The Red Devils hierarchy are said to be considering a managerial change, with the new era at Old Trafford expected to be led by a new manager who fits the INEOS brand and philosophy. Fans, however, are backing Ten Hag to be given a third year in charge after another trophy win. Newcastle, heading into next season, must surely take solace from the fact clubs around them could be starting afresh. Chelsea under Pochettino were suddenly looking a threat once again, while it could take time for a new manager to get things going at Old Trafford with potentially only a month to strengthen the squad and prepare tactically before the start of a new Premier League campaign. Stability is the message from those in charge of Tyneside as others prove happy to chop and change. Staveley and co will be hoping their patience and support pays off with an improved showing next term.",

        "description": "Have you ever wondered how much to invest to generate a juicy passive-income stream? Here's a rundown of three superb picks.The post Passive Income: How Much to Invest to Get $5,000 Each Year appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered how much passive income you’ll need? Figuring out how much to invest today to get a decent return tomorrow is a question that baffles many investors. Fortunately, it’s not as hard as it sounds, but there are two more important points to answer first than how much to invest. Those questions are to invest and to start investing. Let’s try to answer them all. There’s no shortage of great long-term stocks on the market right now. Some of the best stocks on the market can provide a reliable passive income today while providing ample growth tomorrow. To meet that goal, there are three stocks for investors to consider: ( ), ( ), and ( ). Each of these three stocks caters to a specific area of the market. Additionally, they can provide both growth and defensive appeal to investors. Fortis is one of the largest utilities in North America. It generates a reliable and recurring revenue stream backed by decades-long regulated contracts. This fact alone makes it one of the most defensive offerings on the market. Fortis is also incredibly reliable as an income stock. The company has provided an insane 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, making it an ideal buy-and-forget candidate. CIBC is one of Canada’s . It too has a wide defensive moat thanks to its sprawling domestic segment. Bank stocks like CIBC also boast long-term stable growth and a very juicy yield, which is well-covered and growing. CIBC also has an international segment, which includes operations within the United States. This helps to the bank outside of its core domestic operations, making it a superb long-term pick. SmartCentres is the third option to consider. SmartCentres is a retail-anchored real estate investment trust (REIT), which boasts a massive footprint across the country. The REIT also boasts an impressive tenant list, which includes some of the largest names in retail and finance. Finally, unlike the other two stocks mentioned above, SmartCentres also boasts a predictable distribution. In short, all three stocks provide a unique perspective and opportunity. So, let’s now turn to when and then how much to invest. There is no time like the present when it comes to finding a time to start investing. And despite the market being on a tear this year, the three stocks I mentioned are trading down over longer terms. Fortis is a superb example. Despite being a great long-term defensive pick, the utility stock is down over 14% in the trailing two-year period. That drop is largely attributed to rising interest rates and not a reflection of the company’s performance. The same can be said for CIBC. The bank stock trades down nearly 5% over that same two-year period and for the same interest rate-fueled reason. We can see a steeper long-term dip with SmartCentres. And unlike Fortis and CIBC, that dip extends to this year. Over the prior two-year period, the stock has dipped a whopping 22%. As a result, the REIT’s distribution has swelled to 8.17%. The key takeaway for investors is that these individual stocks, which offer juicy yields and long-term growth, still trade at a discount over the longer term. This makes them superb options to buy right now and hold for a longer term. Finally, we come to how much to invest. If our goal is to reach the coveted $5,000 per year level, we can handily reach (if not surpass) this level by dropping $30,000 into each investment. Keep in mind that prospective investors don’t need $90,000 right now. Investing is a long-term game. Investors can and add what they can to their nest egg over a longer timeframe. Doing so allows your portfolio to grow on autopilot, thanks to dividend reinvestments. In my opinion, the three stocks mentioned above are great options for any long-term income-producing portfolio. Buy them, hold them, and watch them grow.",

        "description": "County officials focus on making homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring, while investing in affordable housing.",
        "content": "Hennepin County has the largest homelessness prevention and housing stability effort in Minnesota, working to shelter thousands of people each year and hopefully get them into permanent housing. The county has nearly 200 people working on homelessness and housing stability and will spend nearly $200 million in local, state and federal dollars in 2024. A new 0.25% sales tax approved by the Legislature will raise about $29 million annually for rental assistance and affordable housing. The county partners with cities and local nonprofits to provide shelter and other services to residents experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Hennepin County leaders say they are one of the last jurisdictions in the U.S. that promises to shelter all families with children so no child sleeps outside. \"We believe that homelessness is unacceptable and that government can do something about it,\" said David Hewitt, human services director for housing stability. \"This crisis is very visible. The successes are, almost by nature, invisible because it is people, in their homes, doing OK.\" The county's work has grown considerably since the coronavirus pandemic, when a combination of financial, health and social factors pushed many residents to the edge or over it. Last year, 9,000 people found shelter in the 13 year-round facilities the county funds. Other shelters come online in winter months when demand for space spikes. In 2023, county workers helped 2,171 people who were homeless transition into permanent housing. That was a 18% increase over 2022 and a 57% jump since 2021. County leaders focus on making homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring; a popular approach with state and local governments across the U.S. Supplementing that work are ongoing investments to create and preserve affordable housing. Here's the focus of each of those efforts: Rare: With a staff of 31 and budget of $19 million, the aim of this team is to help residents keep the housing they have already. That means providing emergency rental assistance or connecting tenants facing eviction with lawyers for housing court. Staffers also help residents with unstable housing find temporary solutions so they don't have to go to a shelter. \"We are here to advocate for you,\" said Brittani Walker, a case management assistant. \"A lot of people are scared and don't know where to go.\" Brief: This team of 120 with a budget of $46 million works to get people who are living outside, in shelters or in unstable housing into a permanent place to live. Anyone who interacts with a county social worker at a shelter or an encampment can have their name and contact information entered into a database. A case worker will reach out to get them into permanent housing as quickly as possible. \"We work with people where they're at,\" said Phyllissha Butler, a supervisor for the youth homeless to housing team. She added that unhoused clients almost always face multiple challenges that contributed to why they lost their homes including mental health problems, substance abuse and financial challenges. \"We are looking to break down any barriers they have to housing,\" she said. Nonrecurring: A team of 18 with a budget of $103 million is focused on keeping people who have struggled with homelessness in permanent housing. Clients receive housing aid, which in February helped 2,300 households pay rent, and have a case worker who helps them avoid the problems that contributed to their housing instability. Nathan Nyren, a housing support program manager, said one of the biggest challenges is finding landlords who will rent to people who were homeless or have a criminal record. The housing aid is typically considered an ongoing income supplement, but sometimes the help is time limited. Nyren says providing rental assistance is cheaper than having homeless residents in shelters or ending up in the emergency room or jail. \"This program is saving taxpayers money,\" he said. \"Our goal is always to try to get people to be as independent as they can.\" Affordable housing: Hennepin County will invest about $23 million this year in affordable housing with plans to create about 1,000 new units. The staff of 27 works to maintain existing affordable housing and bring new units online through forgivable loans and other incentives for providers. There are also grants and assistance to help lower-income residents become homeowners. Hennepin County has a shortfall of more than 34,000 deeply affordable units for low-income residents. Nearly half of the county's tenants are cost-burdened by rent, according to the Minnesota Housing Partnership.",

        "description": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas.",
        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

Dates, times, and what to expect Literally open world Are you eager to see more of Light No Fire? Gather your fellow adventurers and establish a camp in the comments section below. [source x.com ] About Robert Ramsey Robert (or Rob if you're lazy) has been a fan of PlayStation since the 90s, when Tekken 2 introduced him to the incredible world of video games. He still takes his fighting games seriously, but RPGs are his true passion. The Witcher, Dragon Quest, Mass Effect, Final Fantasy, he's played 'em all — a little too much, some might say. Comments 10 I do love how Sean being a cheeky little gobshite gives me the warm fuzzies! Cannot wait to see more of Light no Fire, hopefully they go early access soon after. I'm intrigued to see it, but it'll take something special for me to get involved day one after their last game. Can i suggest Sean, dont over promise and take half a decade to deliver this time 🙂 I will probably get this day one, surely they have learnt from past mistakes. Also this seems less ambitious than NMS was so should be easier for them to fine tune. It seems like it's just one massive planet but shared with others? If so I wonder if there's still randomly generated parts to the game or is it just one well crafted world that's the same for everyone. Still not ruling out that they got bought by Microsoft Can’t wait for Summer Games Fest, so I can find out if I buy anything in the second half of the year! Lol. Seriously, there’s basically 3 games releasing after June right now and two of them are Ubisoft. This is the main reason I haven't bought Enshrouded yet. I REALLY like what Hello Games does, their ambition, and how well they support their work. It's nearly unheard of. Can't wait to see what they're up to with this. @UltimateOtaku91 Its actually more ambitious according to Sean. The Planet is bigger then our real world Earth, has multiple biomes, has zero loading screens as in its all seamless and it has a realistic scale for things so mountains for instance are as big if not bigger then are real world mountains. There is random generation that is a more advanced version of the engine NMS uses as well. It honestly sounds incredible and the reveal trailer shown looked amazing. @Enuo Why? Hello Games have only been able to do what they want because they're Indie and right now i doubt MS wants to add any more studios. @DennisReynolds I stand corrected then, sounds pretty darn impressive and will take people years to see everything the planet has to offer. So is the entire map randomly generated? so people will get different starting biomes or resources etc. Tap here to load 10 comments Leave A Comment Hold on there, you need to login to post a comment...

Both men appeared to be enjoying each other's company as they sipped on beers ahead of a luncheon. Carl wore a beige Ralph Lauren polo shirt which he teamed with blue jeans and a black jumper tied around his shoulders. Meanwhile Kieran opted for a white shirt with a black blazer with skinny beige trousers for the day out. Katie and Carl split at the end of 2023 after two years together. Katie Price 's exes Carl Woods (L) and Kieran Hayler (R) seem to have formed a close friendship as they attended the Silver Leas Polo in Hertfordshire over the weekend Katie and Carl split at the end of 2023 after two years together. Meanwhile she married Kieran in 2013 but later split in 2018 after welcoming two children, Jett, 10, and Bunny, nine Carl made his debut at the event with new girlfriend Megan Bells who wore a white dress The former glamour model tied the knot with Kieran in 2013 but later split in 2018 after welcoming two children, Jett, 10, and Bunny, nine. Kieran later got engaged to fiancée Michelle Pentecost, with whom he shares a son, Apollo. It's not the first time the exes have enjoyed some downtime together as they celebrated Easter Sunday together earlier this year which left Katie, who is now dating MAFS star JJ Slater, fuming. At the time, a source told The Sun that Katie was seriously irritated by the pair's friendship and claimed it was just because they were trying to 'have a dig' at her. The source said: 'When Katie saw the pics of Kieran and Carl together she texted Carl that he was a \"sad c***\". She was absolutely fuming because it can't have been for any reason aside from to have a dig at her.' Katie is also mum to Junior, 18, and Princess, 16, from her marriage to Peter Andre, and Harvey, 21, whose dad is Dwight Yorke. It comes after Katie confirmed she's finally moving out of her Mucky Mansion after she was served an eviction notice to leave the property. The mother-of-five revealed she will soon be collecting the keys for a new home and denied recent reports she was looking to move her family into a caravan. Both men looked to be enjoying each other's company as they sipped on beers ahead of a luncheon Carl looked smart in a beige Ralph Lauren polo shirt which he teamed with blue jeans and a black jumper tied around his shoulders Meanwhile Kieran opted for a white shirt with a black blazer and skinny beige trousers for the day out as he cuddled his son, Apollo Carl showed off his tattooed arms as he watched the polo Carl and Kieran were seen posing for photos at the event along with impressionist Francine Lewis After nine years, Katie says she 'can't wait' to relocate and admits, 'I've had nothing but bad memories in that house', insisting moving will be the start of a new chapter in her life. Former I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! campmate Katie was declared bankrupt for a second time in March over an unpaid tax bill of £761,994.05. Speaking about the West Sussex property, branded the 'Mucky Mansion' because of its constant state of disrepair, Katie said: 'I absolutely hate the Mucky Mansion, even how it's been called the Mucky Mansion because of all the stuff that happened there before. 'I can't wait to get out of that house I've had nothing but bad memories in that house for nine years. I hate the Mucky Mansion, I never want to see it again and I can't wait to move into my new place, I am so excited. 'New beginnings, new start, reset button, I love it. 'But don't worry, I'll be featuring my new house on my YouTube channel when I get the keys and welcoming you to my new house, I can't wait, I just want to get rid of all the bad stuff in the past and have a fresh start. 'Although I would love a big caravan, it wouldn't fit us all in so it's definitely not a caravan I'm moving into.' In March, she became bankrupt for a second time after she failed to pay her taxes, saying the reason she has debts is because she went through a 'breakdown.' Speaking on the Stripping Off podcast with Matt Haycox , Katie said she wasn't even aware of the second bankruptcy, insisting, 'I will pay it, but it just has to be when I've got it.' Katie is now dating Married At First Sight star JJ Slater and the pair say they are 'in love' Kieran and Katie share two children, Jett, 10, and Bunny, nine. She is also mum to Junior, 18, and Princess, 16, from her marriage to Peter Andre, and Harvey, 21, whose dad is Dwight Yorke Kieran moved on with fiancée Michelle Pentecost - they share son Apollo It comes after Katie confirmed she's finally moving out of her Mucky Mansion after she was served an eviction notice to leave the property She said: 'Yeah, you should always pay your tax, this and that. But obviously, I went through a breakdown so then I didn't pay tax and that's sort of where the bankruptcy thing has come from.' Katie has been given until June 26 to leave the Mucky Mansion, which became the subject of a Channel 4 documentary when she attempted to install life back into the property for the last time. During an Instagram live last week, she confirmed there will be no further renovation shows based around the house, saying, 'Is there going to be anymore Mucky Mansions shows? No.' She was served an eviction notice on April 24 and told to leave by the end of May but has been given an extension by her mortgage provider. Katie was due to give evidence at the High Court over her finances last month but failed to turn up because she was on holiday in Cyprus with boyfriend JJ. The 'Mucky Mansion' earned its nickname following years of damage to the property, including flooding, burglaries, mould and even reports of it being haunted.

        "content": "The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes miss the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. say they are not represented accurately in the official numbers. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them versus how they identify themselves. The groups say money, political power and even health could be at stake. Being lumped into the wrong column can mean a gain or loss of government funds that are distributed based on data. For some, it's about their identity and feeling seen by their own country. The Office of Management and Budget said the working group that oversaw the revisions held 94 “listening sessions” with many advocacy groups, academics and the general public, and it will continue to reach out to communities. HMONG AND THE SECRET WAR During the Vietnam War and unbeknownst to the American public, the CIA recruited Lao and Hmong people to fight the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia. Tens of thousands of Hmong soldiers died while others fled to the U.S. as a result of what became known as the “secret war.\" By the 1970s, many Hmong had resettled in Minnesota, Wisconsin and central California. Today, Hmong in the U.S. number more than 300,000. Some states recognize Hmong and Lao veterans with annual ceremonies, and in April, the Wisconsin governor signed a law mandating that Hmong American history be taught in schools. Given their history fighting in that region for the U.S., many Hmong feel strongly that they should be classified as Southeast Asian. But because China is considered the Hmong ancestral homeland, the U.S. Census Bureau categorized them as East Asian after the 2020 census. “That has been very hurtful to our elders and to our veterans who sacrificed so much to get us here to this country after everything they did to help the U.S. during the Vietnam War,” said May yer Thao, president and CEO of the St. Paul, Minnesota-based Hmong American Partnership. The East Asian label also pains them because the Hmong were oppressed in China as an ethnic minority and sought refuge in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, according to Quyên Dinh, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. Those who object to the classification also have a practical concern: the East Asian grouping could hide socioeconomic disparities between Hmong and other Asian households that need to be addressed. The per capita income of Hmong was almost $26,000, while it was more than $53,000 for Asians overall, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. “We are still one of the most impoverished communities in this nation,” Thao said. The Census Bureau says it’s working with the Hmong community to improve their classification. THE EXCLUDED BACKGROUNDS When the government revised its race and ethnicity standards in March — it's first major alteration since 1997 — its seven categories included a new one, Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA. The revisions also encouraged detailed data collection about respondents' backgrounds, such as African American, Jamaican and Haitian under the Black category. Missing from the list of backgrounds under the new MENA category: Black Arabs from such countries as Somalia and Sudan, and Armenians. The groups were left out after a 2015 field test by the Census Bureau found that most Armenians still identified as white and most Somali and Sudanese respondents identified as Black even when MENA was an option. Some advocates said the decision to omit Black Arabs from being included in the MENA category was based on outdated research. For many Armenian Americans, not having their own category amounts to an existential threat as a large part of their diaspora's culture is now concentrated in the United States. Ethnic Armenians also have communities around Europe and the Middle East, in particular Lebanon. Many are descendants of those who fled the 1915 campaign by Ottoman Turks in which some 1.5 million Armenians died in massacres, deportations and forced marches. The atrocities, which emptied many ethnic areas in eastern Turkey, are widely viewed by historians as genocide . Turkey rejects the description of genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest during World War I. Without Armenian inclusion in the MENA subcategories, many will likely categorize themselves as being from a different country. That could diminish their official numbers and reduce their power when it comes to redrawing political districts in places with large Armenian communities, said Sophia Armen, chair of the Census Taskforce of the Armenian National Committee of America-Western Region. “We will now be undercounted by potentially hundreds of thousands of people,” Armen said. “It spells out a very real destruction of Armenian identity in the next two generations.” During the last redistricting round following the 2020 census, Armenians in greater Los Angeles — which has the largest concentration of Armenians outside Armenia — were almost split up into different city districts, but the redistricting plan was modified after they sounded the alarm. There are an estimated 460,000 Armenian Americans in the U.S. , with half living in California, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. Being identified in the data correctly also is important to local health departments. It can influence anything from vaccination outreach in the proper language to tailoring health campaigns for specific communities. Armenian Americans, for instance, are more likely to suffer from hypertension than the general population, but there’s not a lot of data. MANY BRAZILIANS IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC A coding error last year in an annual Census Bureau survey offered unprecedented insight into how large numbers of Brazilians in the U.S. identify as Hispanic or Latino. An analysis by Pew Research Center showed that the coding mistake revealed at least 416,000 Brazilians, or more than two-thirds of Brazilians in the U.S., also identified as Hispanic in the 2020 American Community Survey. Usually, if someone marks Hispanic and Brazilian on the survey, they are recoded as “not Hispanic” when the numbers are crunched. Not including Brazilians, or Haitians for that matter, in the definition of Hispanic or Latino, means that large numbers of Afro-Latinos aren't counted, Michelle Bueno Vásquez, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Northwestern University, wrote the Office of Management and Budget. “The OMB as it stands fails Latinos, especially Afro-Latinos who continually suffer double discrimination and marginalization, on top of statistical invisibility, in the United States,” she said. Researching the impacts of categorizing Brazilians as Hispanic was among the recommendations a Census Bureau advisory committee made last month. “Policy is driven by data, first and foremost,” Armen said of people who feel missed in the classifications. “It just seems like we are purposely being ignored.” ___ Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP .

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments , this week could easily be the most important. Here's what to expect in the days ahead: WHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS? Starting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it. The arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations. Look for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels , whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments. It's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. Expect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. The defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid. And it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand . How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case. Since the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last — the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first. ONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES A critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations. Judge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence. In an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give. The Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump’s case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called “totally inappropriate.” Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary. Trump's team also asked Merchan to consider the “extraordinarily important” nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach “very specific findings.” Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions. “When you say it’s a very important case, you’re asking me to change the law, and I’m not going to do that,” Merchan said. Prosecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone’s status as a candidate doesn’t need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn’t running, it shouldn’t be treated as a campaign contribution. ONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE The deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. It's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week. To reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. Things will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others. If, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial. ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard (180 meter) hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Winners of the three men's races included local man Josh Shepherd as well as competitors from Germany and Australia. Abby Lampe from North Carolina won the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. “You just have to roll,” said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. “There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.” Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) over a 240-yard (220-meter) course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Eyewitnesses reported that the attack was likely a response to a police raid on motorcycle riders, known locally as Okada riders, in the area. The confrontation led to an exchange of gunfire, causing panic and forcing passersby to flee for safety. The police, however, successfully repelled the attackers. Benjamin Hundeyin, the police spokesman in Lagos State, confirmed to Channels Television that the assailants were indeed Okada riders retaliating against the enforcement actions taken by the police. He praised the officers and men of the Ipaja division for their strong resistance against the attack. Hundeyin did not provide details on whether there were any casualties during the incident but assured that normalcy had been restored to the area. Additional police detachments have been deployed to maintain order and prevent further disturbances. ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "content": "The Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), FCT chapter, has urged government to address the increasing numbers of street children and ensure the protection of the rights of every Nigerian child. The Chairperson of the association in Abuja, Mrs Bassey Ita-Ikpang, made the call in a statement on Monday to commemorate the 2024 International Children’s Day celebration. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the children’s day is marked every year on May 27 as sanctioned by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to celebrate and appreciate the needs of children and address them. First established in Nigeria in 1964, the day is also to raise awareness on issues that affect children and help nations to appreciate the fact that they are the future of societies. Ita-Ikpang, who noted the increasing number of street children in Abuja, urged Mrs Adedayo Benjamins-Laniyi, the Mandate Secretary, Federal Capital Territoey Aadministration (FCTA), Women Affairs and Children, to implement policies and programmes that would address the menace. She urged the mandate secretary to do more for children, following insecurities in the FCT. She stated that “there is need to address the increasing number of school-age children hawking on the streets.” The chairperson also urged government, parents, schools and other stakeholders to ensure that child rights are not trampled upon. “It is government’s responsibility to protect every Nigerian child and formulate policies that carry them along and consider their vulnerability, by protecting their basic rights,” she added. She noted some of the rights to include Right to Freedom of Movement, Right to Dignity of the Child, Right to Survival and Development, Right to freedom from discrimination and Education. Others, she stated, are Rights to Inclusion in Decisions Making, Healthy Environment, Access to Medical Care and Safety in School. (NAN)",

Some of those killed were displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Many were women and children. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas. Even some of its closest allies like the United States are expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel says it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts. One of those courts last week demanded that Israel halt its offensive in Rafah. EU, Israel in war of words as ties nosedive ahead of Spain, Ireland recognizing Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah while Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leader of Hamas. Latest deadly weather in US kills at least 20 as storms carve path of ruin across multiple states VALLEY VIEW, Texas (AP) — Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms obliterated homes and destroyed a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park. Eight people were killed in Arkansas. Three died in Kentucky, and two were killed in Oklahoma. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. Papua New Guinea says Friday's landslide buried more than 2,000 people and formally asks for help MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by a landslide Friday. The official formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple a U.N. estimate of 670 killed in the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. In a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. China has threatened trade with some countries after feuds. They're calling 'the firm' for help WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department has set up an eight-person team known as “the firm” to provide help to countries cut off from Chinese trade. The team emerged after Washington stepped in to help Lithuania when the northern European country found its cargo shipments to and from China stranded two years ago during a feud over Taiwan. State Department officials say Washington sees ”the firm” as an emergency response when a country fears facing economic pressure from China. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. says Beijing opposes economic coercion and calls the American allegation “completely unfounded.\" Russian POWs get to make phone calls home. Ukrainians don't. A growing movement wants that to change FAR WESTERN UKRAINE (AP) — For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It's a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They're appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site. It's a full day’s journey from the front lines. The visit took place on condition its location not be revealed. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. Military labs do the detective work to identify soldiers decades after they died in World War II OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency experts strive to offer about 200 families annually the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. Advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year.",

        "description": "Anne Mulloy, 63, sat unmoved as she was sentenced to three years behind bars for the callous crime.",
        "content": "A Fraserburgh fraudster has been jailed after scamming her friend into handing over more than £110,000 by pretending to make a documentary about Hillary Clinton. Anne Mulloy sat unmoved as the sheriff handed her a three-year jail term. The trial at Peterhead Sheriff Court heard how Mulloy, 63, spun a web of lies to entice her friend, actress Helena Robinson, to hand over multiple amounts of cash between 2011 and 2017. Mulloy – who is also known as Anne Leuser – claimed she knew Hillary Clinton and would be getting behind-the-scenes access to her 2016 presidential campaign. Sheriff Craig Findlater said this had been a significant fraud carried out over five and a half years. “This was against someone who you considered to be a friend,” Sheriff Findlater said. “And for her part, she considered you to be a friend to her. “You knew she had financial means and that she was struggling with the ill health of her father. “You exploited her friendship and your friendship with her father to your financial gain. “And you exploited her when her father was in his last years.” He went on to say Mulloy still denied some of the offending, but added: “You exaggerated and embellished and continue to blame her for some of your offending. “You do, in the report, acknowledge that you have done wrong at some point. “Only a custodial sentence is appropriate because of the scale of the fraud, the monetary value, the length of time involved – and the impact upon the victim.” Mulloy was previously jailed in 2017 after admitting a similar scam involving a TV production company in London. Helena Robertson, who had been friends with Mulloy, keeping a running total of these loans on a spreadsheet. No emotion as fraudster taken to prison During her evidence, one of these totals was shown to the court and displayed a figure of £114,026.30, dated April 1, 2016. Ms Robinson continued to send Mulloy money until April 2017, so the final figure must surely be higher. The original charge claimed Mulloy had swindled her friend out of £85,710.02, but that figure was amended to simply ‘money’. . He said: “The evidence shows she is simply a cynical fraudster taking advantage of a caring friend. She told lies and fabrications.” Mr McAllister also spoke of the fake court cases involving Aberdeenshire Council that Mulloy had fabricated as a way to put off paying her friend back. He added: “It was just lies to scam more money from Helena.” Mulloy was handcuffed and led away from the dock, showing no emotion as she left. ‘I’ll never recover financially from the damage that she has caused’ Speaking after the sentencing, Ms Robinson – whose professional name is Helena Breck – praised the authorities for prosecuting her former friend. She said: “I’m extremely relieved that justice has finally been served and that the person known variously as Ann Leuser/Anne Leuser/Ann Molloy/Anne Mulloy is now regarded as a serial fraudster. “She has shown no remorse for the trust that she has abused, the pain she has caused, or the crimes that she commits. “It has taken six-and-a-half difficult years from reporting to sentencing, and I’m grateful to Action Fraud, Police Scotland and the Procurator Fiscal’s office for taking on the case, when neither the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police did so. “I’ll never recover financially from the damage that she has caused, but hope that others might be protected from this callous fraudster, at least for the time that she is in prison.”",

        "description": "Indian stock market hit record highs as the Sensex crossed 76,000 and the Nifty 50 breached 23,100. Nifty 50's current PE is 21.9, slightly below its one-year average. Experts warn of overvaluation but predict sustained growth if election results align with expectations.",
        "content": "On Monday, May 27, the Indian stock market benchmark, the Sensex, topped the 76,000 mark for the first time, while another key index, Nifty 50, breached 23,100. During the session, the Sensex and the Nifty 50 hit fresh record highs of 76,009.68 and 23,110.80, respectively. Nifty 50 has gained 24 per cent over the last year, and its current PE (price-to-earnings ratio) stands at 21.9. This is below its one-year average PE of 22.3. However, Nifty's 12-month forward PE of 20.76. Nifty's current PB (price-to-book ratio) is at 4, slightly above its one-year average PB of 4.03. Also Read: Many experts believe the Nifty 50 is currently overvalued, and a negative surprise in the Lok Sabha election results could trigger a significant market correction. However, if the election outcome aligns with expectations and India's economic growth maintains its momentum, the Nifty 50 may sustain its current valuation. Mint spoke to several experts to take their views on the current valuation of the Indian stock market. Here's what they said: Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities Jasani pointed out that the Nifty quotes at nearly 21 times FY25E EPS and, going by historical trends, is currently at the top end of the valuation. Also, according to the market-to-GDP ratio, the Indian stock market is at 1.4 times. Indian markets are, hence, not cheap and are tilting towards the expensive side, he added. However, Jasani believes the ensuing event (outcome of the Lok Sabha election 2024) and the expectations built around the post-government formation policy thrust and FPI inflows have led to these valuations. “If these come out on expected lines and the monsoon proves normal in intensity and spread, Nifty EPS may be upgraded, and the valuations may seem more reasonable,\" said Jasani. Also Read: Abhishek Jain, Head of Research, Arihant Capital Jain said the Indian stock market is currently trading at a premium, reflecting expectations of strong growth after Prime Minister Modi's potential re-election. This optimism has pushed valuations higher. However, a correction might occur after the election results, said Jain. Corporate earnings will likely drive long-term growth, particularly in manufacturing and other sectors that could benefit from increased foreign direct investment (FDI) under a stable government, he added. Also Read: Vijay Laxmi A Ambala, SEBI-registered research analyst Ambala said the current Nifty level is 23,000, and several indicators collectively suggest that the Nifty is currently overvalued. The index’s RSI is trading at 76 on the monthly and 67 on the weekly timeframe, indicating overbought conditions. Judging by the current price movement and RSI reading, Ambala believes the Nifty may move upward by another 300-500 points within the next month. “Those with a short-term view may book up to 30 per cent of their portfolio to capitalise on the all-time high rally while holding on to the remainder to capitalise on the potential upside rally. They can average their profits if there is a healthy dip between 5-8 per cent. The Indian stock market is still in its growth phase and there is ample room for growth, making it more lucrative than most global economies,\" said Ambala. The current stock market valuation also accounts for the Indian market's growth potential, suggesting a fair valuation. “While price appreciation may slow down, we expect to record double-digit growth in the next three years, supported by sectors like auto, metal, energy, infrastructure, and real estate. IT, media, and service sectors are currently undervalued, making them lucrative. I recommend investing in stocks of core sectors with strong fundamentals to make the most of the prevailing circumstances,\" said Ambala. Sandeep Raina, Executive Vice President-Research at Nuvama Professional Clients Group According to Raina, the Indian stock market is fairly valued and offers good opportunities. Many stocks and sectors look interesting. Historically, the market has peaked at around 24 times the 12-month forward earnings for the Nifty 50, Raina said. “We expect EPS (earnings per share) of approximately 1,080 for FY25E. Hence, reaching the 24,000 to 25,000 level seems quite possible, assuming the Indian elections proceed smoothly,\" said Raina.

        "content": "The Houston Astros expect to have a familiar face back in the clubhouse when they open a four-game series Monday at Seattle. First baseman Jose Abreu is scheduled to rejoin the ballclub after he was optioned to the Astros' spring training complex in West Palm Beach, Fla. He had been working on his swing with, among others, Hall of Fame member Jeff Bagwell and former teammate Michael Brantley. Abreu, the 2020 American League MVP with the Chicago White Sox, was batting .099 with one extra-base hit and three RBIs in 22 games when he was sent to the minors for the first time in his career. \"What I can tell you is my head is in a good spot right now,\" Abreu told The Athletic. \"When I was going through it, when your head is not in a good spot, you feel like everything is going down. There was a point, and I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, I couldn't even know how to hit, how to field. I was a little lost. But I'm humble enough to recognize that and I'm telling you I'm trying to be the best Jose Abreu I can be and the one you guys know.\" Abreu went 7-for-22 with a homer and three RBIs in the Florida Complex League before playing in two games for the Triple-A Sugar Land Space Cowboys, going 0-for-7 with three strikeouts. \"The plan is to bring him for the Seattle series and just come in with confidence,\" Astros manager Joe Espada said. \"He has made adjustments that we feel are going to help him and we just expect him to come back up here and just be himself and we're going to help him, get him rolling. We're all waiting for him, our players are excited, we are excited to have him back, so we're looking forward to it.\" Abreu, 37, batted .237 with 18 home runs and 90 RBIs last season, his first in Houston after signing a three-year, $58.5 million deal. \"I was wrong on my swing, and games speed up on you too much and it's tough to see where you're at,\" Abreu said through an interpreter. \"I saw videos and didn't see it, and now we found it and I hope that I can show it right away, right now, but it's baseball, it's a process.\" The Astros won 5-2 at Oakland on Sunday as Kyle Tucker belted a two-run homer and Ronel Blanco allowed the Athletics one run on four hits over seven innings. \"He didn't miss a beat,\" Espada said of Blanco, who returned from a 10-game suspension for having an illegal substance on his glove. Houston has won 10 of its past 14 games to pull within 3 1/2 games of the American League West-leading Mariners. On May 1, the Astros were in last place in the division, 6 1/2 games out. Seattle snapped a season-worst, four-game losing streak with a 9-5 victory at Washington on Sunday. Julio Rodriguez went 3-for-5 with a home run and four RBIs and Ty France went deep and drove in three. Rodriguez homered in each of the last two games in the series to double his season total to four. \"Huge game by Julio,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"Really happy for him. Everybody's happy to see it. That's the Julio Rodriguez we've grown to know over the last couple of years and hopefully he can keep that going. That's the best he's looked all year.\" Astros left-hander Framber Valdez (3-2, 4.32 ERA) is set to start the series opener Monday against Mariners right-hander Bryce Miller (3-5, 3.53). Valdez is 5-2 with a 3.41 ERA in 13 career appearances (11 starts) against Seattle; Miller is 2-1, 3.22 in four career starts versus Houston. Valdez lost 5-0 to the visiting Mariners on May 4 as he allowed five runs on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings. Miller didn't get a decision in Seattle's 5-4 victory at Houston on May 5, a game in which he gave up four runs on six hits over six innings. --Field Level Media",

        "content": "Doja Cat has again put her father on blast for allegedly being an absent father. The American singer called her father actor Dumisani Dlamini a “dead beat” in an updated X bio, writing: “My dad's a deadbeat but I did well.” On Monday, Doja Cat shot up trends lists after she took to her Instagram timeline, writing: “ Dad, let me know when/if you need me to re-up your makeup cabinet because you are a b*tch.” Despite numerous attempts by TshisaLIVE‚ Dumisani could not be reached for comment at the time of publishing this article. Doja Cat has always spoken openly about her father, saying “she has never met him” but has seen him commenting on her social media posts. Speaking to TshisaLIVE in a 2017 interview, Dumisani said after the Sarafina! tour wrapped up he decided to stay in America and had two children with a Jewish-American woman, one of them Doja Cat. After 15 years Dumisani returned to South Africa and said his plans to bring his family with him were unsuccessful, though he maintained contact with his children. “I am close to my children, all of them. I love them and they love me.” Dumisani, who has gushed over Doja Cat's global success, said his legacy is his children. “ I’m proud of her for what she has achieved. I’m not surprised because it’s in the blood. All my children are talented. South Africa should be proud of such a great talent coming from us.”",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Rajkot police commissioner Raju Bhargava was transferred on Monday after the fire incident that killed 28 people. He will be replaced by IPS officer Brijesh Kumar Jha. The government has also transferred additional commissioner of police of Rajkot (Administration, traffic and crime) Vidhi Choudhary along with Sudhirkumar J Desai, DCP-zone 2. Rajkot municipal commissioner Anand Babulal Patel was also transferred. The decision comes hours after the high court rapped Gujarat government earlier on Monday saying it does not have faith in the state machinery \"which gets into action only after innocent lives are lost\". A special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai asked whether the civic body sat over the fire safety orders passed earlier on a PIL for 18 months. The bench held that all Rajkot municipal commissioners from the time the game zone was established in 2021 until the tragedy occurred on May 25 \"should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred.\" To the RMC counsel's submission that the game zone had not applied for requisite permissions, the HC asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction. \"You were blind to that...this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation's explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of the entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?,\" the bench asked. The HC also wanted to know as to when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone. \"Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of the inauguration. We can't take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do? Sat over it?\" the bench asked. Gujarat police filed an FIR against seven partners of TRP Game Zone in Rajkot for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and arrested two of them on Sunday, following a devastating fire that spread rapidly and claimed 28 lives at the recreational facility packed with a large weekend crowd the previous evening. The fire left the bodies charred beyond recognition. According to the FIR, the 28 recovered bodies included 15 males, six females, and three children. The gender of three bodies could not be determined due to severe burns, while only partial remains of one person were recovered. Forensic experts are now tasked with the challenge of identifying the victims through DNA analysis, a process that could take up to seven days. This step is crucial for providing closure to grieving families. A forensic team has arrived in Rajkot to collect samples from the site.",

        "content": "Holidaymakers LOCKED OUT: Menorca resort shuts out sightseers with chains across its picturesque alleyways which attract 800,000 visitors a year to the village of 500 people in latest anti-tourist move By Perkin Amalaraj Published: 14:21 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 15:16 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail 92 View comments Furious Menorcan residents living in a resort town known as ' Spain 's Mykonos' have chained up their streets in their latest bid to stop holidaymakers intruding on their private properties. The nearly 200 homeowners of Binibeca Vell, which lies on the south of the island of Menorca, say they do not want any visitors before 11am and after 8pm as anti-tourist signs attached to thick rope and chains have been hung up throughout the holiday hotspot. Locals have long complained of rowdy tourists disrespecting their homes by climbing stairs, scaling private balconies and even entering doorways to locals' homes as they hunt for picture perfect spots. Binibeca, famed for its whitewashed cottages and twisting alleys, can accommodate just 500 permanent residents in the summer, but every year around 800,000 tourists pile in and cause havoc for locals. But recent images show the small town almost completely deserted as several alleyways have ropes and chains hanging between the entrances with round signs indicating no trespassers. The nearly 200 homeowners of Binibeca Vell say they do not want any visitors before 11am and after 8pm Known for its whitewashed cottages and twisting walkways, Binibeca can only accommodate 500 permanent residents in the summer Nearly 800,000 people visit the town every year The new blockades are Binibeca's first anti-tourist measure before residents take a vote on whether to ban holidaymakers altogether in August, The Telegraph reported. Read More Anti-tourism protest organisers vow 'This is just the start' after holidaymakers are booed and abused by 15,000-strong mob as they ate evening meals in Majorca Óscar Monge, president of the residents association, blamed Menorca's authorities for failing to regulate tourism in the area and leaving locals to take matters into their own hands. He said: 'Binibeca is promoted by the administration and tourism companies, but what benefit do we get out of it? 'We pay dearly for being the most potent tourist attraction in Menorca'. The residents organisation receives €25,000 annually to repair and touch up the outside painting of the town's houses but Monge believes the amount is insufficient and has demanded a plan to manage the area sustainably. He said: 'It's outrageous that the politicians who run local tourism are telling us that the only alternatives we have to keep the place clean are to close it, privatise it or start charging.' In a post on Binibeca's website, locals asked visitors to refrain from 'entering homes' and 'climbing balconies'. A popular Menorcan resort known as 'Spain's Mykonos' has chained up its streets to prevent holidaymakers from overcrowding them as they take selfies Binibeca Vell is a popular holiday hotspot because of its winding alleyways and whitewashed homes Angry locals have attached no trespassing signs to ropes and chains around the town n a bid to deter visitors Read More Britain's ambassador to Spain urges UK holidaymakers in Magaluf to 'show responsibility' in wake of Majorca's clampdown on booze-fuelled tourists The message included a series of pictures showing one tourist splayed out on a stairwell and another sitting in a chair belonging to one of the locals. There are 1.2million permanent people in the Balearic Islands, which are home to Menorca, the smaller neighbour of popular tourist destinations Majorca and Ibiza. In 2023, the islands saw about 18million tourists arrive, hitting a record for the archipelago. And 14.4million of these were foreign visitors, the majority of whom were Germans and Brits. It comes as Brits headed to Majorca this Bank Holiday weekend faced major disruption as thousands of people took to the streets in anti-tourist protests. The protests were held on Saturday evening, starting at 7pm, and were centred on the capital of Palma. Organisers said they were astounded by the number of groups and organisations which had pledged their support. 'Initially, we thought there would be about 2,000 people but now it is going to be considerably more,' said a spokesman for the organising group, Banc de Temps de Sencelles. Last week, a group under the slogan 'Més turisme, menys vida', which translates to 'More tourism, less life' said it intended to cause chaos at Palma Airport over the coming weekend. Recent images show the idyllic town almost completely deserted Óscar Monge, president of the residents association, blamed Menorca's authorities for failing to regulate tourism in the area and leaving locals to take matters into their own hands Binibeca can only accommodate 500 permanent residents in the summer, but every year some 800,000 tourists pile into its pristine alleyways Read More Majorca's war on tourism: 9.30pm alcohol curfew is needed to make Magaluf safer, says mayor, as Palma now vows to bring in tougher measures to lower tourist numbers Mes is calling for a reduction in the number of flights at Palma airport, saying: 'Majorca is no longer overcrowded, Majorca is experiencing collapse. You cannot have airports that, year after year, break records.' The Balearic government says it is willing to change the tourist model and has started a round of talks with the public. As yet, no concrete measures have been agreed. Banc de Temps de Sencelles has labelled its campaign 'Majorca is not for sale!' and is so surprised by the promised support that it has asked the government to lay on more buses and trains so people from all over the island can attend. 'The demonstration aims to highlight the problem of access to housing in Mallorca, a general problem, but not isolated, because it cannot be separated from tourist saturation, the purchase of properties by foreigners,' said Carme Reynés of Banc de Temps de Sencelles. The group says the protest will be followed by 'other actions' over the coming weeks. Your browser does not support iframes. Protesters flood the streets of Tenerife last month (pictured), calling on local authorities to temporarily limit visitor numbers to alleviate pressure on the islands' environment, infrastructure and housing stock, and put curbs on property purchases by foreigners 'Tourist Go Home' is seen scrawled in English over a wall underneath a real estate promotion billboard in Nou Llevant, Majorca, a neighbourhood that has seen a massive influx of foreign buyers over the past few years. It is one of many instances of anti-tourism graffiti Protests in Majorca come after more than 50,000 people took to the streets of Tenerife back in April to protest against tourism on the island in the Canaries. Demonstrators were seeing brandishing 'you enjoy, we suffer' placards, claiming that the huge influx of tourists to the island is causing major environmental damage, driving down wages and squeezing locals out of cheap affordable housing, forcing dozens to live in tents and cars instead. British visitors to Tenerife are also set to be hit with a controversial 'tourist tax' from next year, local authorities recently confirmed. The proposal is part of the island's new tourism strategy and is seen as an eco tax, but the level of charge and the formalities are yet to be agreed by Parliament. It will apply to all of Tenerife's most famous protected sites, including the volcano Mount Teide and several rural parks and hamlets like Masca. A spokesman for the Tenerife government said the introduction of this eco tax was necessary due to the vast increase of people visiting protected sites, visitors and locals alike. Travellers aged 16 and over already pay a daily charge of up to €4 (£3.45) when visiting the equally popular Balearic islands, such as Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza.

        "content": "Stella Salle became a TikTok star for impersonating the way drunk people speak. Because of her hilarious personality, she garnered a significant following and won the affection of many on social media. This eventually led to Colourette Cosmetics appointing her as one of their brand ambassadors, alongside Sassa Gurl and other members of the LGBTQ+ community. This local makeup brand is known to champion diversity, as their advocacy is to make its users feel empowered, confident, and beautiful in all ways, always. Just recently, however, Stella Salle reposted the artist’s photos and wrote, “ panget [ugly],” in the caption. Many A’TINs (SB19’s fandom name) were outraged and demanded an apology from the content creator. The widespread criticism, not only from fans but also from numerous social media users who found the post offensive, has caught the attention of Colourette’s founder, Nina Ellaine. In response, the company released a statement announcing the termination of their endorsement ties with Stella Salle. This decision was made because her actions contradicted the values upheld by the cosmetic brand. According to the statement from the CEO, “Having faced public scrutiny for my appearance, I have always championed self-love and empowerment. Due to recent events with one of our ambassadors, Colourette takes a firm stand against bullying and shaming, and we are disengaging from Stella.” 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼 pic.twitter.com/jqRHso2Uxl — Nina 💖 (@theninaellaine) May 25, 2024 After facing backlash for her unsolicited comments and being called out by fans and other social media users, Stella Salle released an apology letter, which she posted on her official TikTok account. However, many argue that the damage has already been done. The inappropriate post from the influencer is particularly troubling given that she claims to be a victim of cyberbullying and face-shaming herself. Others have also pointed out that Stella Salle is considered an influential figure, especially since she represents a brand and is expected to uphold its values. Therefore, she should have been more cautious about the statements she posts on social media platforms. On the other hand, one social media user criticized the brand for abruptly removing the influencer as an ambassador. In a viral tweet, he wrote, “I don’t get it. You get an ambassador or ambassadress without you guys having to background check? We all know that stella is kanal humor, straightforward and opinionated towards things.” This controversy serves as a reminder to all social media influencers (and even users) to exercise extra caution in their actions, particularly in this day and age, where words can have far-reaching consequences.

        "content": "Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who passed away at 15 from leukemia in 2006, is set to become the first “millennial” saint, the Holy See announced on May 23. Despite his parents not being traditionally fully devoted Catholics, Acutis insisted on regularly attending daily Mass. As an expression of his faith, he created a website that documents Eucharistic miracles around the world. This website is currently available in around 20 languages. “To always be close to Jesus, that’s my life plan,” he once said when he was just 7 years old. In 2020, the Vatican beatified Acutis after acknowledging a miracle attributed to his intercession: the healing of a Brazilian boy with a rare pancreatic disease in 2013. More recently, Pope Francis approved a second miracle linked to Acutis: the recovery of Valeria Valverde, a Costa Rican student who sustained a severe head injury in 2022 after accidentally falling from her bike. This latest approval clears the way for Acutis’s canonization. The 15-year-old, who loved playing online games and even watched Pokémon, is beloved for his spirituality and his innovative use of technology to spread the message of Christianity.

        "content": "A British seaside town is now booming as microbusinesses head to the location in East Devon and there has been a dramatic increase in just 12 months. Sidmouth is a small town in Devon, overlooking the English Channel with a population of just over 12,500. It is among the country’s fastest-growing areas for microbusinesses - those with fewer than 10 employees - making it a hotspot for entrepreneurs. There have been dozens of new microbusinesses opening up with GoDaddy's Venture Forward report mapping more than 600,000 businesses across Britain to find each area's 'microbusiness density' against every 100 residents. Analysis has found a 23% growth in the density of microbusinesses in East Devon over the past year. Sidmouth sits on the Jurassic Coast and is surrounded by countryside and Blue Flag award-winning beaches. Being a seaside resort, the town has lots of Regency charm and was well-liked by Queen Victoria . It has many places to shop, eat and explore - much of which is run by small business owners. Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' Sidmouth sits on the Jurassic Coast ( Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto) A trend seen in GoDaddy’s research was that constituencies along the coastline in the south of the UK were growing at an especially fast rate, whilst northern coastal constituencies were stagnating or declining. The number of small businesses reached a record high last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. A total of 859,007 companies were registered in 2023, an increase of just under 75,000 on the previous year, reported the Express . Andrew Gradon, head of GoDaddy UK & Ireland, said: “The UK's small business community is in good health and we've seen growth in microbusiness density in most parts of the country. Many iconic coastal towns have been at the heart of this boom. The trend is particularly pronounced in the south of England, as people have moved out of London post- Covid.” And the UK has seen a rise in small digital businesses earning over £100,000 last year despite ongoing economic challenges , data revealed earlier this year. About 17% of digital micro businesses, those with fewer than 10 employees, now boast a six-figure turnover, said a GoDaddy Venture Forward report. This is a 55% increase from 2022 when only 11% of online microbusinesses achieved this level of turnover.",

        "content": "THERE'S a perfect match out there for everyone — even two twins joined at the hip. And what better match for a pair of identical twin sisters than identical twin brothers? Kerissa Sealby spoke to The U.S. Sun about how she and her twin sister Vanessa dated and married another set of twins. Though they're clearly embracing their double status now, that wasn't always the case. The mother of one recalled how she and her sister fought their similarities throughout their childhood and teenage years. \"We always really wanted to be so different, even though we just are not,\" she said. \"We always thought we had different tastes in guys, I hated her boyfriends and she hated mine. \"It just never worked out, they never understood our relationship as twins either.\" While some classmates growing up thought it would be \"so cool\" is Kerissa and Vanessa ended up dating twin brothers, the sisters did not share the same enthusiasm. So it was rather reluctantly that they agreed to a blind double date with another pair of identical twins. \"We were going into it thinking, ‘Whatever, we'll be friends with them. It's cool to be connected to other sets of twins and they had just moved to the area,'\" she said. Kerissa admitted that neither sibling set ever thought they would end up dating twins. However, when her now brother-in-law Lucas got strep throat, he found himself at an urgent care clinic. He struck up a conversation with his physician, who later sent him a message suggesting that he and his twin, Jacob, take out her personal trainer and her twin. The two brothers and two sisters met up that same night with some hesitation. \"Me and Vanessa were both thinking, ‘Ew, we're not dating twins, that’s so weird,'\" Kerissa said. \"But the moment that we laid eyes on each other, I just gravitated towards Jacob and Vanessa gravitated towards Lucas and it was like ‘Yeah, this is it.’\" Both women returned home gushing over their new matches while Jacob and Lucas, both physician's assistants, called their parents to say they had both found the one. After their initial double date, they decided to go on individual dates to get to know each other better. Fast forward six months and both pairs have made it official, and soon the four adults were all living together. \"I actually made a post on my Instagram when she got married saying, ‘I’ll miss having the same last name as you for eight months. Their relationships continued on similar trajectorIES, with Kerissa and Jacob getting engaged in December 2021 and tying the knot in June 2023. Vanessa, who accepted Lucas' proposal in January 2022, officially changed her surname in October of the same year. \"I actually made a post on my Instagram when she got married saying, ‘I’ll miss having the same last name as you for eight months,'\" Kerissa joked. She and Jacob also welcomed daughter Sophie in August 2022 with her cousin Adrian joining a while after. The sisters hadn't considered their children's unique DNA situation until it became a reality. \"We didn't really think about how our kids would be genetically the same until I had Sophie,\" Kerissa recalled. \"Vanessa was trying to get pregnant and [we joked], ‘Actually, you technically could be Sophie's mom.’ My sister is like a mom to my daughter and I mean, genetically, it's that way as well. \"And technically, I could be Adrian's mom and people would never know if they looked at our DNA.\" Technically cousins but genetically siblings, the children have had some double-take moments when identifying their parents. Speaking about her daughter Sophie, Kerissa said the infant was better at telling her mother and aunt apart. \"Sophie is old enough now to distinguish but she did get confused a little bit with her dad and uncle Lucas,\" she said. My sister is like a mom to my daughter and I mean, genetically, it's that way as well. \"It's funny, she has this relationship with her uncle, she loves him but she plays more with him. \"She gives him dirty looks and runs away [but with her] dad she's completely the opposite.\" Another advantage of having your sister and brother-in-law so close by, right next door in fact, is full access babysitting, Kerissa said. She also pointed out that every holiday and vacation can be spent together as there is no need to divide time between various sets of in-laws. \"My sister is like a mom to my daughter and I mean, genetically, it's that way as well,\" she said. We know that we're always there for each other and it's been that way our whole lives. \"If I need to bring my daughter over and leave her, I can and she's the same, there's no having to plan it. \"We know that we're always there for each other and it's been that way our whole lives.\" The sisters, who both work together at a real estate firm, have a family history of twins. \"My grandma was actually a twin, as well,\" Kerissa said. \"She had just recently passed away when we met [Jaoband Lucas] and so my mom was in tears and felt like our grandma sent them for us.\" Genetically, the four kids are known as quaternary siblings, which is a rare occurrence. This is when cousins have matching DNA like siblings have. The kids share the same DNA as brothers and sisters but are still technically cousins. The kids also might even share similar looks. Quaternary twins are born less than nine months apart to two sets of identical siblings. Scientific experts do not technically refer to the kids as 'twins'. She referred to their chance set-up as \"divine intervention\" and said she couldn't imagine a life where her twin sister wasn't also her sister-in-law. And while the couples may receive some ignorant comments online implying that their situation is incestuous, they're excited to share their story further. You can follow their story on Kerissa and Vanessa's TikTok accounts.",

        "content": "A new study demonstrates an advance in treating antibiotic-resistant infections in animals through personalized phage therapy. The treatment combined a specific anti-P. aeruginosa phage applied topically with ceftazidime administered intramuscularly, resulting in the complete healing of a persistent surgical wound after fourteen weeks. This highlights the potential of phage therapy as a practical and effective solution for antibiotic-resistant infections in veterinary practice, with implications for human medicine as well. A new study led by Prof. Ronen Hazan and his team, from the Faculty of Dental Medicine at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in collaboration with the team of Vet Holim, JVMV -Veterinary medical center in Kiryat -Anavim, Israel, has shown an advance in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in animals. This research, focusing on a five-year-old Siamese cat Squeaks with a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection post-arthrodesis surgery, marks the first published documented application of personalized phage therapy in veterinary medicine. Squeaks, initially treated at the JVMV for injuries sustained from a high-rise fall, developed a severe infection in the right hind leg following multiple surgeries. This infection persisted despite various antibiotic treatments over four months. Facing a potential implant-replacement surgery, the team turned to the new treatment which involved a meticulously designed combination of a specific anti- P. aeruginosa phage, a virus that kills bacteria, applied topically to the surgical wound and ceftazidime administered intramuscularly. Moreover, the owners of the cat, after short demonstration, provides most of the treatment doses of phages and antibiotics at their home. The integration of phage therapy with antibiotics was aimed at targeting the pathogen effectively and directly at the site of infection, leveraging the phage's ability to be applied topically, which simplifies administration and maximizes its concentration at the infection site. This approach allowed the surgical wound, which had remained open for five months, to fully heal after to fourteen weeks of treatment. The successful outcome of this case underscores the critical need for novel therapeutics like phage therapy to address the growing concern of antibiotic-resistant infections, which affect up to 8.5% of surgical sites following orthopedic surgeries in companion animals. These infections not only pose significant health risks to the animals but also increase the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with these procedures. Recent studies suggest that phage therapy, already showing high success rates in human medicine for treating orthopedic infections and chronically infected wounds, can offer a promising solution for similar issues in veterinary practice. Moreover, the successful treatment of this cat by its owners at home highlights the practicality and efficacy of personalized phage therapy, which could be extended to treat other pets facing similar antimicrobial resistance challenges. Interestingly, opposite to common situations, this case was performed on an animal based on the team's insights from treating humans first. The positive reception from veterinarians and pet owners regarding phage therapy points to a growing awareness and acceptance of this treatment option. As the new treatment continues to be explored in veterinary settings, it not only improves the health and well-being of pets but also offers valuable data that contribute to the broader application of phage therapy in both animals and humans. This bridging of data can enhance treatment protocols and outcomes across a variety of bacterial infections, potentially changing the landscape of infection treatment in both veterinary and human medicine.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Indian chess Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa is set to face off against Alireza Firouzja of France in the opening round of the Norway Chess tournament , while his sister R Vaishali will take on women's world champion Wenjun Ju of China. This year, the Norway Chess tournament is split into two parts, featuring six top Grandmasters in the men's section and six top women players competing for a total prize pool of 1690000 NOK (around USD 1.6 million). The prize fund for both sections is identical, with 750000 NOK (about USD 70000) reserved for the winner. World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen will be making his return to classical chess after a considerable break. Carlsen's last classical chess appearance was at the World Cup, which he won. However, it remains to be seen if he can maintain his winning form after the hiatus. The reigning world champion, Ding Liren of China, who is set to defend his title against India's D Gukesh later this year, will also be a key player to watch. Liren will face off against Carlsen in the tournament opener. The format of the tournament is unique, with matches not allowed to end in a draw. In case of a draw, both players will receive one point each, and an Armageddon game will be played to determine the winner. In the women's section, Vaishali will be joined by Koneru Humpy , Anna Muzychuk of Ukraine, Pia Cramling of Sweden, and Chinese players Wenjun and Tingjie Lei . Wenjun Ju is considered the favorite in the women's event, but all eyes will be on Vaishali, who showed great form in the candidates tournament with five consecutive victories.",

        "content": "Brazil's Ronaldinho stars in charity match for flood victim Brazilian football great Ronaldinho came out of retirement Sunday for a charity match to raise funds for those affected by devastating flooding in the country's south. The Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona legend notched two goals and an assist in the 5-5 tie at the match in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium. Ronaldinho, whose full name is Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, is from Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul state, which has been reeling from weeks of unprecedented floods that have killed more than 160 people and left 90 percent of its towns inundated, AFP reports. A slew of Brazilian football stars got together for Sunday's charity match, including coach Dorival Junior and former right-back Cafu. \"It's moving to see all these people coming together to help my people,\" Ronaldinho said. \"After this immeasurable tragedy, we see the Brazilian people uniting again,\" Junior said. Ronaldinho, 44, put in his team's fourth and fifth goals, while Cafu also shone with a goal and an assist. He left the pitch with 15 minutes on the clock, to a standing ovation. Women's stars also took part in the match, including Formiga. Cities and rural areas alike in Rio Grande do Sul have been hit for weeks by an unprecedented climate disaster of torrential rains and deadly flooding. More than half a million people have fled their homes, and authorities have been unable to fully assess the extent of the damage. In state capital Porto Alegre, floodwaters rose again on Thursday amid new rainfall. The floods mark the region's fourth extreme weather event in less than a year, a phenomenon scientists say is driven by climate change and also deforestation. Governor Eduardo Leite told TV Globo on Saturday evening that the reconstruction could last \"several months, or even more than a year.\" SR",

Besides, 1,50,457 houses were damaged during the storm. Of these, 35,483 houses were fully damaged in 107 unions and 914 municipalities. It also claimed 10 lives so far, said the state minister while speaking at a press briefing held at the Secretariat on Monday. The deaths were reported from Khulna, Satkhira, Barishal, Patuakhali, Bhola and Chattogram districts. Among the deceased, three died in Bhola and Barishal districts each, and one each in Satkhira, Khulna, Chattogram and Patuakhali districts. Nineteen districts have been affected during the storm, he said. These are Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Jhalakathi, Barishal, Patuakhali, Pirojpur, Barguna, Bhola, Feni, Cox’s Bazar, Chattogram, Noakhali, Laxmipur, Chandpur, Narail, Gopalganj, Shariatpur and Jashore. A total of 9424 shelters have been opened in the coastal districts of the country and over 8 lakh people took shelter there, he said. Besides, 52,146 domestic animals were also housed there. He also claimed that no major damage had occurred due to massive preparation taken by the ministry following the directives of the prime minister. Meanwhile, a total of 1,471 medical teams were formed to provide treatment to the people in the cyclone-hit areas and of them, 1,400 remain active. Tk 6.85 crore has been allocated to the affected people. Tk 3.85 crore, 5,500 tonnes of rice, 5,000 dry foods, Tk 1.50 crore for baby food and Tk 1.50 crore for fodder have been distributed in 15 districts, said the minister. Talking about the Prime Minister’s visit to the cyclone affected areas, the state minister said, “We have heard that and for this, contact was made with the Prime Minister’s Office. We'll let you know when the program is finalised.” Cyclone Remal completed its landfall and weakened to a land depression over Bangladesh on Monday, according to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department.

        "content": "An Engineering team at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) has developed a novel microfluidic technique capable of greatly enhancing applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By utilizing the phenomenon of \"rope coiling\" within microfluidic channels, the innovative technique offers a promising solution for assessing the flexibility of elastic microfibers at high throughput. It can effectively measure the elastic moduli, which are determinants of mechanical performance in , DNA replication, artificial muscle designs of biomimetic robots, and more, of microfibers. These microfibers are key components in various high-tech and and biological structures, such as cytoskeleton, spider silk, and optical fibers. The new microfluidic technique was developed by Professor Anderson H. C. Shum and Dr. Yuan Liu from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at HKU, in collaboration with Professor Howard A. Stone and Dr. Janine K. Nunes, scientists from Princeton University, and Dr. Jack H. Y. Lo from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. The have been published in the , titled \"High-throughput measurement of elastic moduli of microfibers by rope coiling.\" The new approach eliminates the need for manual sample handling by utilizing a quantitative correlation between elastic moduli and coiling radius. This enables the measurement of 3,300 fibers per hour, marking a substantial improvement over existing methods and providing a thousandfold increase compared to using a typical tensile tester. The breakthrough significantly reduces the time-consuming and skill-intensive process of sample loading and unloading, which is particularly beneficial for tiny, fragile samples, such as filamentous bacteria, actin filaments, DNA, carbon nanotubes, and functional microfibers. \"Our approach not only simplifies the testing process but also integrates the manufacturing and testing phases,\" said Professor Shum. \"With the inline measurement capabilities, which couple the 'making of microfibers' and the 'measurement of elastic modulus' on the same process line, we can now measure the elastic modulus of every fiber immediately after production. This enables the immediate identification and correction of defects by adjusting process variables, such as UV intensity, in real-time. \"For instance, to maintain a constant modulus, a decrease in coiling radius downstream would trigger an increase in UV intensity upstream, serving as feedback mechanism to correct production faults. On the other hand, elastic moduli can also be controlled by the intensities of UV light, ensuring consistent product quality,\" Professor Shum added. Additionally, the method is non-destructive, eliminating the need to bond fiber ends to fixtures, as required in conventional tensile tests. This feature is especially advantageous when dealing with fibers that exhibit nonuniform elastic moduli, which traditionally require segmentation into multiple parts for individual assessment. Looking forward, the team is optimistic about adapting this method for even smaller fibers, including those with submicron diameters such as DNA and actin filaments. \"Adjusting the microfluidic setup and to accommodate smaller fibers present some technical challenges, but it is definitely feasible,\" said Dr. Liu.",

        "content": "writes that lawyers have decried the ‘illegal’ use of the Cybercrime Act by the police to harass and detain journalists, with a call on the National Assembly to promptly begin the process of amending the legislation in order to safeguard press freedom in the country Some senior lawyers have called on the National Assembly to promptly commence the process of amending the Cyber Crime Act 2015 in order to curb its ‘illegal’ use by the police to brutalize journalists. The lawyers described the legislation as tool being used by the police witch hunt journalists and gag the press . The call by the lawyers was premised on the recent arrest of an investigative journalist, Daniel Ojukwu, by the police for allegedly violating the country’s cybercrime laws..Ojukwu’s arrest was just one out of the many arrests that have been carried out by the police . Reacting to the sad development, Ojukwu’s employer, Nigeria’s Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ) said its reporter, Daniel Ojukwu, went missing on May 1, but it was only informed two days later that he had been detained by police under the cybercrime law. FIJ said Ojukwu’s arrest was related to a November story that exposed government corruption. Justifying the journalist detention, police spokesperson, Muyiwa Adejobi, told reporters that Ojukwu was arrested by the Nigeria Police National Cybercrime Centre based on a petition filed against him. Earlier in February, four journalists from an online news site, Informant247, were arrested, detained, and charged with conspiracy, cyberstalking and defamation by the police. According to the police, the charges levelled against the quartet of Adisa-Jaji Azeez, Salihu Ayatullahi, Salihu Shola Taofeek and Abdulrahman Taye Damilola, was sequel to a complaint lodged against them by the Rector of Kwara State Polytechnic, Engineer Abdul Jimoh Muhammed. The complaint was said to have stemmed from reports that were published by the news site on November 10, 2023 and February 1, 2024, alleging that the Rector had made false claims about the institution’s financial status and commissioned shoddy project work. On February 6, 2024, the Kwara State police invited Adisa-Jaji Azeez and Salihu Ayatullahi for questioning, only for them to be arrested, detained overnight, and presented before the court the following day. In view of this, a Civil Society Group, IPI Africa Advocacy and Partnerships, lead by Nompilo Simanje, had then called for the charges against the journalists to be dropped, and emphasized that journalists must be free to work without fear of intimidation and legal reprisals Simanje said: “This is the latest example of cybercrime laws in Nigeria being used to target journalists. The authorities in Nigeria should amend their legislation to align with regional and international standards. The continued use of such laws like criminal defamation and vague provisions of the cybercrimes act against journalists pose an ongoing risk to media freedom and freedom of expression. “It is appalling that the Nigerian authorities continue to enforce Section 24 of the Cybercrimes Act, which was declared by the ECOWAS Court of Justice to be inconsistent and incompatible with Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights”. Asides these four journalists, several other journalists in Nigeria have been arrested, detained, and arraigned in recent years on charges stemming from the Cybercrime Act. Notable among the lists is the 34-day detention of journalist Agba Jalingo and the jailing of Saint Mienpamo Onitsha, who was later released after four months in jail. It would be recalled that the Cybercrime (Prohibition and Prevention) Act was signed into law on the 15th of May, 2015 by the then-President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, at the twilight of his administration. The law was enacted based on the understanding that threats to information and communication technology are a danger to Nigeria’s national security, affecting the country’s “economic, political, and social fabric”. The Act also ensures the protection of critical national information infrastructure, and promotes cybersecurity, while also protecting computer systems and networks, electronic communications, data and computer programs, intellectual property and privacy rights Cybercrime is however a term for any illegal activity that uses a computer as its primary means. It also includes any illegal activity that uses a computer for the storage of evidence. Cybercrime include crimes that have been made possible by computers, such as network intrusions and the dissemination of computer viruses, as well as computer-based variations of existing crimes, such as identity theft, stalking, bullying and terrorism. Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act, 2015 had criminalised ‘cyberstalking’, ”insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’ ”insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’. Specifically, Section 24 provided as follows: “(a) Any person who, knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter by means of computer systems or network that (a) is grossly offensive, pornographic or of an indecent, obscene, or menacing character or causes any such message or matter to be so sent; or “(b) He knows to be false for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another or causes such a message to be sent: commits an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not more than N7,000, 000.00 or imprisonment for a term of not more than 3 years or to both such fine and imprisonment”. Meanwhile, in 2022, the ECOWAS Court of Justice ordered the Nigerian government to amend the controversial Section 24 of its cybercrime law which is widely viewed as authorities’ weapon for muzzling citizens’ rights to freedom of expression. The court gave the verdict on March 25, 2022 in Accra, Ghana. In the decision, the court ruled that the contested Section 24 of Nigeria’s Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, etc) Act, 2015 “is not in conformity with Articles 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)”. Keikura Bangura, the presiding judge, who read the court’s decision, asked Nigerian government to amend the legal provision “in order to ensure conformity with the country’s obligations” under the ACHPR and ICCPR. The decision was delivered in a suit filed by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), one of the frontline civil society organisations in Nigeria. SERAP, had in its suit, challenged the legality and compatibility of Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 in relation to the guaranteeing of freedom of expression and information enshrined in Article 9 of the ACHPR and Article 19 of the ICCPR, respectively. They said Section 24 of the cybercrime law criminalises sending a message via a computer system which was “grossly offensive, pornographic or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character” or to send a message or cause any such message or matter to be so sent; or to send a message, knowing it to be false for the purpose of “causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another” or to cause such a message to be sent. It particularly alleged that Section 24 violated the rights to freedom of expression, information and other rights of human rights defenders, activists, bloggers, journalists, broadcasters and social media users through the repressive use, interpretation and by agents of the respondent, the same being vaguely worded and ambiguous. The applicant further contended that since the passage of the Act, the Nigerian government and its agents had used its provisions to harass, intimidate, arbitrarily arrest and detain and unfairly prosecute users of the social media, human rights defenders, activists, journalists, broadcasters and bloggers who express their views perceived to be critical of the Government both at the Federal and State levels. The applicant listed 12 high profile cases of the alleged victims of harassment, intimidation, arrest unlawful detention, prosecution and imprisonment of journalists, bloggers, broadcasters, social media users, human rights defenders and activists, by the respondent, its agents and several states of Nigeria between August 2015 and November 2018, for alleged cyberstalking and urged the court to make several declarations and orders that will underscore the incompatibility of the Act with the provisions of the two international instruments. In its defence, the respondent (the Nigerian government) urged the court to dismiss the suit on the grounds that it was misconceived, adding that the prayers sought were not grantable in law. In particular, the respondent contended that the application was not only pending before the national court for the same reliefs but that the interpretation of Section 24 of the Act must be submitted to domestic courts and not the ECOWAS Court as this is not within its competence as it concerns the interpretation of extant laws. Moreover, the respondent contended that the Act was not only in line with Section 45 of the Nigerian Constitution, but was subjected to the requisite constitutional and legal processes before its passage. It said the applicant was aware of the processes leading up to the passage of the Act into law but did not protest it at the time. The respondent further argued that the Act was not enacted to muzzle the freedom of expression in Nigeria, but to curtail the activities criminals carried out on the internet. Lawyers speak Reacting to this, human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), disclosed that it is illegal to arrest journalists for cyberstalking, insult, causing annoyance, offensive message and criminal intimidation. Falana, in a statement, reiterated that, “the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) Court declared Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 illegal and directed the federal government to amend the section to make the law conform with the fundamental right of Nigerian citizens to freedom of expression guaranteed by Section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,1999 and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. “However, in the cases of Laws and Rights Awareness Initiative (Suit No. ECW/CCJ/APP/53/18) and Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (Suit Laws and Rights Awareness Initiative (Suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/09/19), the Ecowas Court declared Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 illegal and directed the federal government to amend the section to make the law conform with the fundamental right of Nigerian citizens to freedom of expression guaranteed by Section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,1999 and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. “From the foregoing, it is crystal clear that the police and other security agencies lack the power to arrest, detain and prosecute Nigerian citizens for the so- called offences of ‘cyberstalking’, ”insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’. “Consequently, all pending cases filed on the basis of the repealed aspects of Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 should be discontinued without any further delay”. In his comments, Onesimus Ruya, argued that the Nigerian cybercrime law seems to be designed to cripple freedom of expression and hinder journalists from performing their duties. “Whoever sponsored the law has so many things in mind at the point of conception. But definitely, it is targeted at Nigerian journalists and infringes on Section 39 of the Constitution. “Sections 24 and 25 of the Act were specifically targeted at journalists, with government, politicians and other influential members of the society using these sections to harass and arrest journalists through the police. “Part of Sections 24 of the Act says, “A person who knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter by means of computer or network that – is grossly offensive, pornographic, or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character or causes any such damage or matter to be so sent etc. “These are the most potent aspects of the law that the government and politicians use against journalists and bloggers. These sections say anyone who writes anything considered offensive or abusive by anyone. “This law has no definition, it is nebulous, barbaric and should not operate in the 21st century. That is our submission at the court of law, Our cybercrime law is still the way it is because it has not been tested in the court”, Ruya said. Speaking in the same vein, a senior lawyer, Emmanuel Ekwe, noted that, “Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act is coming under criticism for not striking the right balance between national security and press freedom. “Provisions within the Act have been exploited to stifle freedom of expression, leading to concerns about the potential suppression of dissenting voices and investigative journalism “In the suit filed by the SocioEconomic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), the ECOWAS Court ruled that Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act is arbitrary, unlawful, and requires amendment. The section contains terms like “grossly offensive,” “menacing,” and “obscene,” which are not clearly defined and can be exploited to target journalists or individuals expressing dissenting opinions. “The National Assembly, should prioritize amending the broadly and vaguely worded provisions of the Cybercrimes Act, particularly Sections 16, 24, 26, and 38. This would require collaboration between the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, as well as agencies like the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), media organizations, and media policy experts”. A law teacher, Dr. Basil Onyewe, while reacting, called for the urgent amendment of the Cybercrimes Act 2015. Onyewe said: “It is, therefore, crucial to submit and caution that the imperative of enacting the Cybercrime Act was not to regulate the activities of journalists. Journalism is a renowned and decent profession with high ethical standards. “However, no one who indulges in the activities criminalised by the Cybercrime act can be rightly referred to as a journalist. “That said, it is sad to note that Government and the political class in Nigeria have deliberately manipulated the provisions of the Cybercrime Act to police journalists and suppress freedom of expression and thoughts, while abandoning the primary objective of the law. “Authorities in government have attempted to silence opposition views in the online media through arbitrary interpretation and abuse of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition and Prevention) Act, 2015, particularly Section 24 of the Act which addresses offensive and annoying statements on the internet otherwise known as cyberstalking, and several journalists, bloggers and individuals have been arrested in this regard. “Stories, articles and expressions published online have been deemed offensive, insulting or annoying with actionable consequences under the said section even when the stories are factual. While some stories published through traditional media outlets (print and electronic) that were never sanctioned by the government have been attacked by the same government upon being rebroadcast or republished through online platforms. “The government considers these repost offensive and libelous because of the rising influence of online platforms in Nigeria as major sources of information dissemination. “Clearly, the government have used the accusation of cyberstalking to harass and press charges against online and traditional journalists for expressing views that are considered unfavourable to the government as some examples will illustrate. “In order to create a fair and egalitarian society , the law should be looked into as not to infringe on the rights to information. “It is only the synergy of such demonstrable acts in good faith by government and the media that a proper and rewarding balance can be found in the media space”",

        "content": "Home | Jagityal | Farmers In Queue Becomes Regular Scene In Telangana Farmers in queue becomes regular scene in Telangana The farmers were seen placing photocopies of the passbooks and Aadhar cards in the queue in front of the PACS in these villages to get 'jeeluga' and 'janumu' green manure seeds. By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 06:58 PM Jagtial farmers place passbooks and Aadhar Cards in queue. Jagtial: Farmers being forced to stand in queues in the scorching heat to get seeds is apparently becoming a regular occurence in Telangana. A sight that was never seen in the last nine years, several seed dispensing outlets of the government are now seeing such queues, with the farmers keeping their pattadar passbooks and Aadhar cards in the queue while they take a break after standing for long hours. If the queue was in front of the Agros Rythu Seva Kendra in Jogipet of Sangareddy last week, it was the turn of farmers in Nukapalli and Potharam of Mallial mandal in Jagtial on Monday to stand in queues in front of Primary Agriculture Cooperatives Societies (PACS) in the district. The farmers were seen placing photocopies of the passbooks and Aadhar cards in the queue in front of the PACS in these villages to get ‘jeeluga’ and ‘janumu’ green manure seeds. Since it was a conventional practice to sow such green manure seeds before the beginning of the agriculture season to reduce the usage of fertilizer, several farmers had rushed to the PACS for the seeds. However, agriculture officials gave only one bag of seeds to each farmer citing a shortage of the seeds. It is learnt that out of 600 bags required for Potharam village, only 100 bags were supplied. This was when there were over 300 farmers in the queue. In Nukapalli, 300 bags were supplied as against the 800 required. There were 450 farmers in the queue. Farmers who did not get seed bags had to return empty handed, cursing their luck. Responding to the issue, former Choppadandi MLA Sunke Ravishankar found fault with the state government for not adequate number of the seeds to farmers within the timeframe. Terming the Congress government as anti-farmer, he said the Congress mark governance had returned to the State in full force. Apart from the drought, farmers were still being made to wait for the promised bonus of Rs.500, while now even green manure seeds were not available as per the requirement, he said. Farmers, who were disheartened after being forced to return without the seeds, said they had never faced such a situation when the BRS government led by K Chandrashekhar Rao was in power. Last week, several farmers, who had stood in queues with pattadar passbooks for their turn to collect tokens for buying green manure seeds at the Agros Rythu Seva Kendra at Jogipet in Sangareddy, were told after hours of waiting that the stocks were over. The irate farmers had staged a protest. There too, the issue was the same one, that of the agriculture outlet not getting adequate stocks.

        "content": "Aston Villa's squad value has continued to soar after the club secured fourth place in the Premier League and achieved Champions League football for next season. Villa, under Unai Emery , have gone from strength to strength since the Spaniard's appointment around 18 months ago. The ambition of the coach has been matched by the ownership who have, within the well documented FFP restraints, invested in the squad with some expensive additions and have been suitably rewarded with performances and results on the field throughout a memorable campaign. Villa's squad, who have achieved plenty as a group, is deep and will be further boosted by the returns of injured trio Tyrone Mings, Emiliano Buendia and Boubacar Kamara in due course. In the meantime, Emery is keen to beef up his squad further and is prepared to make some important decisions on existing personnel. Ross Barkley (valued at £8m) is expected to be the first new(ish) face through the door this summer. Having bid farewell to Nicolo Zaniolo and Clement Lenglet, and as they prepare to welcome back Philippe Coutinho, Leander Dendoncker, Cameron Archer and Kosta Nedeljkovic, this is what Villa's players are valued at (per Transfermarkt) individually and the collective value of the squad.

        "content": "BUTTERWORTH, May 27 — The Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development (KPWKM) has urged the National Council for Persons with Disabilities (MBKOKU) to initiate discussions with industry stakeholders, particularly in the manufacturing sector, to improve infrastructure and facilities for employees with disabilities. Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri highlighted that the lack of or inadequate disabled-friendly facilities significantly limited employment opportunities for the group in the sector. She hoped that swift communication between relevant parties would enable appropriate actions to be taken, thus achieving the government’s target of having one per cent of the workforce comprising Persons with Disability (PwD). “Perhaps one of the reasons the government has not yet reached the one per cent employment policy target for PwD may be due to infrastructure constraints, as many buildings are old and lack the necessary facilities for disabled individuals to work, making it difficult for them to move from one place to another. “That’s why we are asking MBKOKU to expedite communication in this matter so that the responsible parties can make the necessary infrastructure improvements, as this issue is not confined to just one state but is prevalent throughout Malaysia,” she told reporters after a working visit to Flextronics (Penang) Sdn Bhd here today. Nancy also called for support from the private sector and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to hire disabled workers, adding that the government provided various incentives, including deductions for employing disabled persons, tax deductions for approved training, and special single deductions for building modifications or the provision of support equipment for the disabled. Meanwhile, she commended Flextronics (Penang) Sdn Bhd for responding to the government’s call to employ PwD. She noted that the number of disabled employees at Flextronics increased from 81 in 2022 to 136 this year, encompassing various categories such as hearing, learning, and multiple disabilities. As of April 30, statistics show that the total number of active PwD is 703,287, with 372,164 being eligible to work. — Bernama",

The foregoing circumstances happened within the confines of the law and in compliance with the powers conferred on the Governor as provided by Section 5(2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended; and also in consultation with the Kingmakers of Kano, reappointed Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (also known as Muhammadu Sanusi II) as the 16th Emir of Kano State and accordingly handed him a letter of appointment. “It is surprising that in the early hours of today, at or about 5:30 am, the former Emir of Kano, His Majesty Aminu Ado Bayero, backed by Federal might, made their way into the Nasarawa Palace of the Kano Emirate while the reappointed Emir, Muhammadu Sanusi II, was at the Gidan Dabo, which is the main residence of the Emir of Kano. “We need to remind the Tinubu administration that Kano State is known for peace and harmony spanning thousands of years, and any attempt to destabilise the peace of the Land of Commerce shall be resisted. “Recall that when Muhammadu Sanusi II was dethroned on 9th March 2020, Kano forged on in peace without any fracas. -AA”",

        "content": "SAGINAW -- Two teams with plenty of rest are ready to lock horns on Monday night in Saginaw, as the London Knights get set to take on the Moose Jaws on Day 4 of the Memorial Cup. Though the Warriors lost the opening game of the Memorial Cup to the host Saginaw Spirit, they showed some fight that will be necessary to get through to the semifinals. They nearly erased a four-goal deficit by the end of the second period, thanks to a pair of goals from Brandon Yager and another from Denton Mateychuk. Matthew Savoie scored one late in regulation to make it a 5-4 game, but the Warriors failed to complete the comeback. While the defensive falters are going to have to be addressed by the WHL champions, the fact that the team’s high-powered offense translated to the tournament is a positive sight. A great effort in between the pipes, paired with a couple of key goals, helped the Knights start the Memorial Cup on the right foot. Two goals in the first period against the Drummondville Voltigeurs gave London an early cushion, which was enough for goaltender Michael Simpson. The London native turned away all 31 shots he faced to help the Knights grab a 4-0 win. Ruslan Gazizov scored twice for the Knights, while Oliver Bonk had a goal and an assist.

        "content": "EXCLUSIVE Brit caught up in huge tourism protest says diners enjoying evening meal were 'forced to get off the street before trouble could start' An estimated 15,000 locals joined the protest that snaked through the capital By Gerard Couzens and Nick Fagge and David Averre and Paul Farrell For Dailymail.Com Published: 09:14 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 09:55 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 13 shares 70 View comments A British tourist told MailOnline exclusively this week that a massive anti-tourist protest in Majorca was 'intimidating' as she witnessed locals telling foreign diners outside of restaurants to 'go home'. An estimated 15,000 locals joined the protest that snaked through the capital Palma and headed for Weyler Square on Saturday, where holidaymakers were out in force for dinner and drinks. Polly Taylor, who was dining with three friends, said that she initially had no idea what the crowd were doing until they started to come closer to the restaurant as armed police began to show up on the scene. 'It was like a storm was coming but we didn’t know what the storm was about....then the noise from the protestors just got louder and louder and we were swamped with them', Taylor said. Eventually, as the small group with whistles and drums began to get louder and louder, a Majorcan who was dining nearby attempted to engage with the agitators. Protesters shout at shocked holidaymakers enjoying dinner and drinks in Palma Polly Taylor told MailOnline that she and a group of pals were unwittingly caught up in an anti-tourism protest in Majorca this weekend Taylor described the crowd as 'intimidating' as the blew whistles and banged drums, even shouting down a local who tried to reason with them The group responded by blowing whistles in his face and taunting him, Taylor said. The intimidating atmosphere continued as Taylor said the noticed signs reading: 'Go home tourists'. 'At that point, between the sea of people and..., it felt very intimidating to the point we discussed trying to leave and get out in case it turned nasty. We eventually managed to move into the restaurant to get off the street before any trouble could start'. One protestor walked through the dining area on the street while 'clapping and shouting'. The Londoner said that she asked her waiter what the protest was about but he said that he didn't know. 'Clearly he did, but he seemed embarrassed,' she added. Now, Taylor said that she won't be visiting Majorca again. 'I will take my money elsewhere until they sort this all out. I understand their cause, being priced out of their own country owing to tourism, but they were targeting the wrong people.' 'They never to target their government and the huge holiday companies. We were simply contributing to their economy by holidaying for a few days,' Taylor said. An estimated 15,000 locals joined the protest that snaked through the capital Palma and headed for Weyler Square, where holidaymakers were out in force for dinner and drinks Earlier reports said that marchers were heard chanting 'Tourists go home' as they passed through the central square on the 20-minute route from a nearby park, carrying banners emblazoned with the message: 'Salvem Mallorca, guiris arruix' which in Catalan Spanish means 'Let's save Majorca, foreigners out'. The colloquial expression 'Guiri' is used to describe the likes of British holidaymakers renowned for partying and heavy drinking, typically in a mildly offensive way . Another placard said in Catalan: 'Wherever you look, they're all guiris.' The Palma protest was organised by Banc del Temps, a group which hails from the inland Majorcan town of Sencelles and is outraged by the struggles locals face in affording homes on the island due to the higher prices owners can get for holiday rentals. Following Saturday's protest, Banc del Temps spokesman Javier Barbero issued a chilling warning. 'This is just the start of things. If measures aren't taken we will continue taking to the streets until we see action.' Another campaign group that took part in Saturday's demo, held under the slogan 'Majorca is not up for sale,' described the organisers afterwards as 'heroes', saying: 'You are heroes and you have made history. 'Now our government should open its doors wide open to you and call you to a meeting so that you can present your and our demands. 'With 25,000 people behind you, you are an organisation that should be received this week by Balearic Islands' government president Marga Prohens. 'She should take note and put urgent measures in place.' The colloquial expression 'Guiri' is used to describe the likes of British holidaymakers renowned for partying and heavy drinking, typically in a mildly offensive way Protesters carrying banners with anti-tourism slogans and banging drums gathered in the centre of the capital Palma Thousands of protesters overran the streets of Palma on Saturday evening Protesters hold a banner reading 'Mallorca is not for sale' during a demonstration to protest against the massification of tourism and housing prices The manifesto Banc del Temps made public when protestors had finished marching through Palma included a demand that only people who had been living in the Balearic Islands for five years should be able buy property, and also called for a moratorium on holiday rentals. One of its speakers said: 'This island should be a place where our children can grow up with safety and dignity, with controlled tourism that doesn't condition our lives.' Some members of the Banc del Temps group told MailOnline how tourism has transformed once idyllic Spanish sun-spot, with residents now unable to rent or buy their own homes due to the spiralling cost of property. Mother-of-three Patri Vecina told MailOnline: 'We have lived in the same rented house for ten years. But in December the owner told us that he was selling the property to foreigners and that we had to move out. 'I work in the hotel industry and my husband is a builder. We cannot afford the inflated price of property in Majorca so we were never able to buy our own home. 'Now we cannot afford to live in Majorca anymore we are moving to Asturias in the north of Spain. 'It was our dream to bring up our children in Mallorca but that cannot happen.' Patri and her husband were initially paying £500 per month for the rural three-bedroom house in the centre of the island. This increased to £690 per month before their landlord put the house up for sale. The country house on the outskirts of the town of Sencelles is now for sale for £383,000. The spike in the property prices has been fuelled foreign investors, many of whom have turned family homes in tourist rental accommodation, local campaigners claim. Laura Lau, of Banc del Temps, told MailOnline: 'Houses and apartment that were family homes have been bought by foreign investors who rent them out to tourists and leave nothing for local people. This is why property prices in Majorca have reached unaffordable levels. 'We need to make people aware of the problem of housing in Majorca which already affects us all. 'Every day there is someone looking for new housing because their rent has gone up or they are kicked out of their home because it has been put up for sale to foreigners. 'We are in a housing emergency. The government needs to regulate the price of housing - there is no future for Majorca if the island is solely for the benefit of property speculators.' Property prices in Majorca have more than doubled in the past ten years, making the Balearic islands the second most expensive region in Spain after Madrid. Waiters and diners look on as thousands of protesters march past a restaurant Thousands of people demonstrated in the Spanish city of Palma de Mallorca against excess tourism, one of the main sources of wealth in the area, under the slogan 'Mallorca is not for sale' Protesters hold signs reading 'For rent and I can't pay' Protesters hold signs reading 'Let's save Mallorca' and 'Foreigners out' Thousands of people demonstrated in the Spanish city of Palma Protesters hold a banner reading 'Mallorca is not for sale' during a demonstration to protest against the massification of tourism and housing prices This weekend's protest, the largest of its kind since last month's Canary Islands' demos against mass tourism, was the second in 24 hours in the Balearic Islands. On Friday night around 1,000 protestors took part in a demo in Ibiza to vent their anger over the effects of mass tourism. Campaigners held up banners saying 'We don't want an island of cement' and 'Tourism, yes but not like this' as they massed outside Ibiza Council's HQ. The organisers of the Ibiza demo, a group called Prou Eivissa, met with Ibiza's president Vicent Mari before taking to the streets as British tourists across the other side of the island in San Antonio drank themselves silly and dismissed a street drinking ban which could see them hit with fines of up to £1,300 if caught. The protesters' demands included a limit on the number of vehicles that can enter the island in summer and a ban on using taxpayers' cash to promote Ibiza as a tourist destination. A letter was read out at the end of the protest from an Ibiza-born woman who linked her decision to leave the island with her family and move to the Spanish mainland to a 'destructive' tourist model that had led to 'more cars, more tourists and more incivility.' Another Majorcan-based association, called Menys Turisme, whose slogan is 'Less Tourism, More Life', is currently taking proposals for another more radical protest which could involve mass gathering outside hotels or on an iconic island beach. The idea of an airport protest in the peak tourist season which involves collapsing Palma Airport with cars has also been discussed. Anti-tourist graffiti has appeared in both Majorca and Tenerife in recent months. Some foreign holidaymakers have shown their support for the issues raised by campaigners, while others have accused them of biting the hand that feeds them. But the spiralling cost of property in Majorca is unquestionable. People take part in a protest against mass tourism and gentrification in the island ahead of summer season in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, May 25, 2024 People take part in a protest against mass tourism and gentrification in the island ahead of summer season in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, May 25, 2024 Protesters hold a banner reading 'Mallorca is not for sale' during a demonstration Protesters hold a sign reading 'No to massification, less tourism, more life' Thousands of people demonstrated in the Spanish city of Palma de Mallorca against excess tourism, one of the main sources of wealth in the area In 2014 a typical 80 square-metre home cost an average of £126,000 but this has gone up 208 per cent to an average £263,000, according to Spanish property website Fotocasa. The national increase across the whole of Spain was just 29 per cent during the same period. The average salary in Majorca is about is about £1,277 per month or £15,324 per year, although the island's minimum wage is just £965 per month or £11,580 per year. Teacher Marga Gari told how her children will never be able to afford to buy their own homes because of the spiralling cost of living. Marga, 50, told MailOnline: 'Quite simply there are too many tourists. My children will never be able to buy their own homes because foreigners have pushed to price of property up. 'Everything is more expensive than it should be because of tourists – food in the market, clothes in stores, everything. 'You can hardly walk down the streets here in Palma because of the number of visitors. We do not blame the foreigners; we blame the government for letting things get this bad. 'There needs to be limits; limits on the number of planes, a limit of one cruise ship per day and a limit on the number of rental cars.' Ms Gari claims many items in Palma's historic Mercat de l'Olivar central food market are now beyond the reach of local people.

        "content": "Nicki Minaj's concert in Manchester scheduled for Saturday night was postponed after police in the Netherlands discovered marijuana in her bags as she was preparing to leave the country. Promoter Live Nation said the performance will be rescheduled and tickets will be honored. \"Despite Nicki's best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight's show happen, the events of today have made it impossible,\" the promoter said in a statement. \"We are deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused.\" Minaj tweeted earlier Saturday that she was stopped at the Amsterdam airport as she was about to board a plane for the concert in Manchester. Police told her they found marijuana in her bags, and it would have to be weighed, she tweeted. Cannabis is illegal in the Netherlands, but it is tolerated for recreational use. Robert Van Kapel, a spokesperson for the Netherlands military police, said a 41-year-old American woman had been arrested for exporting \"soft drugs.\" He did not identify the woman or elaborate on the type of drugs in question. Police later tweeted that they fined the woman and released her. Minaj, who is 41 years old, tweeted that she believes police just wanted to make her late for her concert in Manchester. \"Told you, it's to try to make me late so that they can write negative stories. Jealousy is a disease. You know the rest,\" Minaj tweeted. Her representatives didn't immediately respond to messages Saturday. The Trinidadian-born rapper is best known for her hits \"Super Freaky Girl,\" \"Anaconda\" and \"Starships.\" She has been nominated for 12 Grammy awards over the course of her career. The Manchester concert is part of her \"Pink Friday 2\" tour, which includes stops in Paris, Poland, Germany, Romania and Switzerland.",

        "content": "Iga Swiatek kicked off her bid for a fourth French Open title by dropping just three games in a trademark demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean in the first round on Monday. The world number one raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier to set up a second-round meeting with fellow four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka. “I’m really happy to be back. Feel like I’m playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,” said Swiatek. The 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year. “These last tournaments give me a lot (of confidence)... But every tournament is a different story, a different chapter, so I’m just trying to focus on the next match,” added Swiatek. Comments Related stories Related Topics",

        "description": "IPL 2024: Here is the list of top five Indian youngsters who impressed the most in the 17th season of the Indian Premier League.",
        "content": "Kolkata Knight Riders has been crowned champions of the 17th season of the Indian Premier League after the Shreyas Iyer side marauded Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Sunday. The IPL 2024 has witnessed many great performances but the outlier of this season was the Indian youngsters who have taken on the big stage to showcase their latent. Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag plays.| Photo Credit:B. Jothi Ramalingam/The Hindu The 2024 season was the year of redemption for Riyan Parag who had a coming-of-age campaign for Rajasthan Royals. Parag held the key in the middle order for RR and went on to amass 573 runs in 14 innings, the highest for his team this season. The 22-year-old was third in the Orange Cap list overall, just behind Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s Virat Kohli and Chennai Super Kings skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad. Riyan, averaging over 50 this year smoked 33 sixes, the joint fifth most by any batters this year. He registered four half-centuries with the highest being 84* against Delhi Capials. Gujarat Titans Sai Sudharsan.| Photo Credit:Vijay Soneji/The Hindu B. Sai Sudharsan was among the few highs for Gujarat Titans in a season of lows. After making it into the finals for the first two seasons since its inception in 2022, GT, this time, was the second team after Mumbai Indians to get eliminated from the playoffs race. Sudharsan was sixth in the list of highest run-getters in IPL 2024. In just 12 innings, the 22-year-old Tamil Nadu batter had 527 under his belt with an average of 47.90. After playing the majority season at no. three, Sudharsan, was promoted to open in place of regular opener Wriddhiman Saha. His 210-run partnership with skipper Shubman Gill against Chennai Super Kings was the joint-highest opening wicket partnership in IPL history. He scored two fifties and a century. Sunrisers Hyderabad’s Nitish Kumar Reddy.| Photo Credit:Deepak KR/The Hindu In a team full of star performers like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen, Nitish Kumar Reddy carved his own niche for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024. In 11 innings with the bat, Nitsh averaged a little less than two sixes per innings to hit a total of 21 maximums. Striking at over 140, he scored 303 runs while averaging 33.66. He did not have the best of the season with the ball, managing only three scalps in seven innings. Nonetheless, the youngster showed glimpses of a genuine fast-bowling all-round, a rare craft in India. His exploits with both bat and ball and his presence in the field led him to become the Emerging Player of the Season. Sunrisers Hyderabad’s Abhishek Sharma.| Photo Credit:Deepak KR/The Hindu Among many left-handers who had an impressive IPL 2024 campaign, Abhishek Sharma tops them all by a fair margin. The 23-year from Punjab recorded the fastest half-century for SRH in just 16 deliveries, equalling the record of his opening partner Travis Head against Mumbai Indians. He also had the most sixes (42) this season, while his 204.21 strike was the third-best after Jake Fraser-McGurk and M.S. Dhoni among players who have faced over 100 deliveries. The flamboyant Abhishek scored 484 runs in 16 innings with three half-centuries, with the highest score being 75 not out against Lucknow Super Giants. Kolkata Knight Riders’ Harshit Rana.| Photo Credit:Deepak KR/The Hindu Harshit Rana has had a roller-coaster season. After initially receiving criticism for his ‘flying kiss’ celebration, Rana was given a one-match ban and fined 100 per cent of his match fee for repeatedly violating the IPL Code of Conduct. However, the KKR pacer shut everyone down with his performance with the ball. In just 11 innings, Harshit picked 19 scalps and was the joint-fourth highest wicket-taker alongside his teammate Andre Russell. His fiery spell of 4-1-24-2 helped KKR bundle out SRH for a paltry score of 113 in the final in Chennai. Comments Related Topics",

        "content": "• Bayero is our emir, protesters insist, Arewa group urges dethroned leader to vacate Kano Supporters of the deposed Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, Sunday, took to the streets of the city, calling for his reinstatement and demanding that Governor Abba Yusuf comply with a recent court order. As the situation in Kano remained fluid, the reinstated Emir, Muhammadu Sanusi II, stepped out of the main palace in the city to a warm reception from the people. Sanusi rode on a royal horse and gesticulated at the crowd who responded with: “You’re the only Emir we know.” He also met with some district heads, council members, vigilantes, women groups and well-wishers who were at the palace to pay homage. The development happened as a large group of young protesters marched through the streets of Kano and Gaya, expressing their discontent with the deposition of Bayero. The demonstrators, carrying placards with messages such as “Abba Kabir Yusuf, Obey Court Order” and “Aminu is still our Emir,” lit bonfires and sang anti-government slogans. However, the protest remained peaceful, with police officers refraining from dispersing the crowd. The protesters had gathered after a special prayer session and continued their demonstration along major roads, including the road near the government house. The protests were sparked by the repeal of the Kano Emirates Council Law by the Kano State House of Assembly last Thursday. The law, initially enacted in 2019, divided the Kano Emirate into five jurisdictions and led to the dethronement of Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II. Governor Yusuf signed the new law on Thursday, dissolving the additional emirates of Rano, Gaya, Karaye, and Bichi, and restoring the traditional Kano Emirate. Following the repeal, the governor directed the monarchs of the dissolved emirates to hand over to the Deputy Governor, Aminu Abdulsalam Gwarzo, who oversees the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. It was reported that other dethroned Emirs – Alhaji Nasir Ado Bayero (Bichi), Alhaji Kabiru Muhammad Inuwa (Rano), Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar II (Karaye), and Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim Abdulkadir (Gaya), complied with the directive. They were also said to have vacated their palaces at midnight on Thursday. However, Bayero who was not around during the incident, returned to the city on Saturday and moved into a palace in the Nassarawa area of the state. A retinue of soldiers rode with him from the airport to the palace. On Friday, it was reported that Justice Mohammed Liman of the Federal High Court granted an order filed by the Sarkin Dawaki Babba of the Kano Emirate, Aminu Agundi, stopping the Kano State Government from enforcing the Kano State Emirate Council Repeal Law which dethroned the five emirs in the state. But the state government ignored the order and went ahead with Sanusi’s reinstatement even as the governor threatened to report the judge to the Nigeria Governors’ Forum for granting the order. He claimed that the judge granted the order while he was in the United States. Miffed by Bayero’s return to the mini-palace in Nassarawa, the governor ordered the arrest of the deposed monarch but the police authorities said they would enforce the court order. One of the protesters around Gidan Nassarawa in Kano, Mohammed Idiris, told journalists that all they demanded was the immediate return of Bayero to his throne. “We are in support of the return of Aminu Ado Bayero back to his seat. We don’t know any other person. He is the man of the people. And that is why we are calling for him to be returned to his seat with immediate effect,’’ he stated. Also, residents of Gaya on Sunday protested the decision of the state government to dissolve the Gaya Emirate. The protesters condemned the action of the government and the state House of Assembly. The protesters carried placards with various inscriptions, chanting anti-government songs, and alleged injustice, saying the dissolution of the emirate had political undertones. However, a non-governmental organisation, Arewa Social Contract Initiatives, advised the Bayero to vacate the ancient city in the spirit of peace and stability. The group, which summoned an emergency meeting of its members in the 19 northern states, said the sudden return of the dethroned emir ‘’was cooked to ignite serious civil unrest in the city.’’ Group faults Bayero The National Chairman of the group, Sani Darma, in a communiqué after the meeting on Sunday in Kano, noted that “Aminu Ado Bayero’s actions have negated the tradition of the Emirate Council which he belongs to.” He reminded Bayero that history would never be kind to him if he acted as the source of uncertainty and chaos which might consume many lives in the state. He said, “Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, the dethroned Emir of Kano, should remember that the same person he is challenging today vacated the same seat for him and even disappeared far away from Kano, but he accepted what happened in good faith without causing any uproar. Why are you not replicating his actions?” Darma further advised Bayero to borrow a leaf from his siblings and even his very close brother, the Emir of Bichi, Nasiru Ado Bayero, who quietly left Kano without doing anything that could jeopardise public peace. “Look at the Emir of Bichi and other emirs; nobody heard anything from them. They respectfully left and vacated their thrones without causing any havoc. That is a clear love for Kano,” he said. “We are totally against the ill-advised actions of the dethroned Emir Aminu Ado Bayero. We strongly advise him to, as a matter of urgency, relocate and if he has any reservations of what had happened, he should channel it appropriately from wherever he is, but not Kano,” the group counselled the aggrieved former monarch. It reminded the deposed emir that when Yusuf was campaigning he had promised the people that if elected, he would change the Kano emirates to its former status as a single emirate. “And here is the governor fulfilling his campaign promises; No wonder Kano people are so calm and happy with the development. As you move around, one will see nothing has changed. People are happily going about their normal businesses. “Somebody cannot sit in Abuja or wherever and decide the fate of Kano. The fact that Kano, with its attendant volatility, remained peaceful and calm, clearly shows that Emir Sanusi is being accepted wholly. “For this, we are advising Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero not to buy the idea of plunging Kano into chaos. His actions right now show that he is harbouring a personal desire at the detriment of Kano peace and stability,” Darma alleged. In the meantime, the Northern Youth Assembly has written an open letter to President Bola Tinubu, urging him to be wary of some people in his government planning anarchy in Kano State. The letter was also copied to the United Nations Office, Abuja, the European Union Mission, ECOWAS, the United States Embassy, the British High Commission, the US Congress and the European Union. The letter, signed by Dr Ali Idris, President and Dr Garba Abdulhafiz, Secretary General, dated May 25, 2024, said the change in the emirate law in Kano State was a product of the law passed by the state house of assembly, noting that any attempt to subvert it by Abuja would result in chaos. Youths write Tinubu It read, “The leadership of the Northern Youth Assembly (Majalisar Matasan Arewa), on behalf of its chapters in the 19 northern states and Abuja, has, at the moment found it compelling to draw your attention, as a democratically elected President, in the country, through a constitutionally prescribed process, with defined powers and privileges, regarding the recent development on Kano Emirate. “It is common knowledge that Nigeria as a country that practises federalism has a constitution which prescribes the powers for the central government as well as the sub-national government which equally represents the lawfully recognized federating units. “Sir, as part of the powers provided by the Nigerian constitution of exercising legislative authority by the state assemblies at the sub-national level, is to make laws for the betterment and welfare of their states as well as their citizens. “The process to exercise this constitutional right may include: making new laws, amending the existing laws and repealing the existing laws. “The Kano State House of Assembly, in 2019, exercised such powers by amending the Kano State Emirate Councils Laws and created four additional emirates, and the law was subsequently assented by the then Governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. “The current Kano State House of Assembly equally exercised such legislative powers by repealing the same law and dissolved the newly created four additional emirates in the state, and the executive Governor of Kano State, Engineer Abba Kabir Yusuf, equally assented to the new repealed law.” The youth stated that each of the two assemblies performed their constitutional and legislative functions, as they deemed fit. They alleged that there was an evil plot allegedly designed by some officials of the Tinubu government to violently and forcefully impose Bayero on the people of Kano using the Federal Government security apparatus, under the pretext of complying with a court order granted by a federal judge “at a time when he was far away in the United States on a holiday.’’ The letter added, “This is nothing but a broad daylight encroachment on the constitutional democratic practices, undermining the authorities of the sub-national and federating units, and a clear interference in the exercise of their constitutional powers. “This ugly development is not only an embarrassment to your Government, but your personality as someone who has always portrayed himself as a democrat. “Our fear is your government and its appointees may be seen as people who do not have respect for democratic governance, practices and constitutional authority. “We wish to draw your attention at this juncture that Kano has been peaceful, and any attempt to disrupt the peace in the state by heeding to the interest of some few selfish and greedy people against the wishes of over 20 million people of Kano may lead to chaos and anarchy and is likely to portray your government in the bad light,” the youth added. Displeased by the crisis, the Northern Traditional Ruling Council, chaired by the Sultan of Sokoto, has expressed concern about the ongoing emirship tussle in Kano State. In a statement on Sunday by the Emir of Gummi, Justice Lawal Gummi, who is the Chairman of the Coordinating Committee Northern Traditional Rulers Council, the monarchs called for restraint on the part of the disputants in the interest of peace and stability. In another development, the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, has threatened to file a defamation suit against Kano State deputy governor, Aminu Gwarzo. Gwarzo had alleged that Ribadu facilitated the return of Bayero to Kano, by providing him with a private jet. Ribadu writes Gwarzo But in a letter to Gwarzo, Ribadu’s solicitors, Aliyu & Musa Chambers, demanded an apology from the deputy governor. The letter read in part, “The attention of our client was drawn to a video clip being shared on different social media platforms wherein you granted an interview at Emir’s Palace in Kano on Saturday, the 25th day of May 2024, in a very calm atmosphere, and without any provocation whatsoever, falsely accusing our client of using his office to kill the people of Kano State and maim their properties. “In the clip, you were shown to be speaking in Hausa. Your false accusations against our client portraying his office as an appendage of a political party and a willing tool to cause chaos in Kano is false and done with the intention of damaging the hard-earned reputation of our client in the eyes of the right-thinking members of the society and indeed it has succeeded in doing so. “In all the places he has served, our client has never been accused of any wrongdoing. Given this illustrious background, it is inconceivable that someone would harbour the thought that our client would descend his exalted office so low as to interfere in the local tussle of the Kano Emirate. “The wide coverage you gave your interview has caused serious embarrassment to our client and his family. “Since the publication, our client has been receiving a barrage of telephone calls both within and outside Nigeria from friends and associates who felt disappointed in him because of the false allegation owing to the fact that it came from a person occupying the office of Deputy Governor of Kano State. “Our client and his office take your allegations seriously and by this letter, our client is demanding that you provide irrefutable evidence to substantiate your claims. If you have no proof, our client demands you to within 24 hours retract the libellous allegation in a similar manner you made it as well as give it wide media circulation and issue a public apology in five national dailies with wide national coverage and on popular online platforms. Note that if you fail to do so, our client will be compelled to seek redress in a court of law.”",

        "content": "The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Monday, affirmed the election victory of Gov. Usman Ododo of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Nov. 11, 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel of justices, headed by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, held that the petition was bereft of substance and accordingly dismissed. The tribunal held that the petitioners; the social Democratic Party (SDap) and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka, failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Kogi had, on Nov. 11, 2023, held its off-cycle election in which Ododo of the APC emerged winner beating his closest rival, Ajaka of the SDP with a wide margin. Ajaka, dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, had filed a petition before the tribunal, challenging Ododo’s victory. The case, which commenced in December 2023, came to its highest point on May 13 when SDP, Ajaka, APC, Ododo and INEC adopted their final written addresses, after which the tribunal reserved judgement in the petition. It would be recalled that INEC, Ododo and his party, APC, had prayed the tribunal to dismiss Ajaka and SDP’s petition in its entirety for being incompetent and lacking in merit. The trio had, through their lawyers; Chief Kanu Agabi, SAN; Joseph Daudu, SAN and Emmanuel Ukala, SAN, respectively, had told the tribunal so while adopting their final written addresses and presenting their arguments against the petition. However, Ajaka’s lawyer, Pius Akubo, SAN, had urged the tribunal to discountenance the respondents’ submissions and uphold their petition. (NAN)",

        "content": "Steven Burridge is a mild-mannered trainer, but he can be quite the tough taskmaster to his jockeys, even after a win. As a former jockey, the veteran trainer is entitled to putting himself in his riders’ boots at times. The 69-year-old Australian would not only know the difference between winning and losing, but also winning better. Krisna Thangamani was at the receiving end of such a spray two weeks earlier. He did steer Galaxy Bar to a 11⁄4-length win in a Class 5 1,600m race on May 12, but the ride did not look the prettiest. After hunting up the Thronum four-year-old to fight for the lead with A Better Tomorrow, they still kicked clear in the straight. “The horse had no luck the other day. He was doing all the work,” said Burridge. “I told Krisna to lead if he could, but to take a seat if someone was quicker, but not to dig him up.” Nine times out of 10, when horses are forced to travel one-off throughout, they would fizzle out in the home straight, especially for a Class 5 performer, but Galaxy Bar kept building towards an impressive win. At the dismount, Burridge thanked the Malaysian lightweight jockey, but also let him know he got away with murder. But the fair man, who also races Galaxy Bar, is not ungrateful either. He still put Krisna back on when Galaxy Bar stepped up in grade to the $50,000 Class 4 1,800m event on May 25. It is just that the pre-race instructions took a little longer in the parade ring this time. “I told him not to do what he did at the last win. He rode him perfectly today,” said Burridge. “For sure, the good barrier (three) helped, but he did the right thing to sit outside the leader (Nature Chief) without doing much work.” Odds-on favourite Smart Star had every chance when he was set alight at the 500m, but the three-wide trip probably told on him late. He kept finding for Bernardo Pinheiro, but Galaxy Bar never faltered, to hold half-a-length on Smart Star at the wire. Nature Chief (Koh Teck Huat) kept plugging away for third place, another 11⁄4 lengths away. The winning time was 1min 48.85sec on the long course. Instead of being smug about the two wins in a row, Krisna humbly accepted his mistake at the first win. “Last time, he was pulling a bit with horses close to him. He still won, but Mr Burridge told me what I did wrong,” said Krisna. “Today he had a good barrier, and there were no horses to challenge him. “Before the race, Mr Burridge just told me to go forward, but to keep him beside a horse if he can’t. “He had a light weight (51kg), which also helped, but he has also improved. He can go over even longer.” Burridge has not plotted any long-term path for the four-time winner, but was just glad to savour his lone winner of the day. From his team of 11 runners, Flying Fighter was regarded as his best chance to salute (he lost) but, statistically, many thought Galaxy Bar’s race was his next best. After David Kok’s Vittoria Perfetta was scratched, Burridge saddled half the race with four runners in a field of eight. He also had Jungle Cruise (fifth), Screen Shot (sixth) and Split Second (last). He laughed off any notion he was even-money for a win. “The other three were also in good shape, but Galaxy Bar was one of my better chances. It’s worked out well,” he said. “I thought he did a good job to win again. He’s an up-and-coming horse and was up in Class 4 but he can stay.” manyan@sph.com.sg",

        "content": "Ratna Pathak Shah and Naseeruddin Shah recently graced the grand stage of the 77th Cannes Film Festival for the screening of Naseeruddin’s film ' Manthan '. During the appearance, Ratna was asked about what she loves, hates, and tolerates about her husband. Her response was remarkably candid. While talking to Brut India about these three aspects, she said that she loves his deep involvement with acting. She can love, hate, and tolerate all three of them. Largely, love because it’s a very special feature. She further added that Naseeruddin never gets bothered by anything other than his performance and working towards it. She found it to be a unique attitude that she had not seen in others. However, she admits that it is also hard to live with. The couple has been married for 42 years, and they first met in 1975 during the rehearsal of Satyadev Dubey’s play 'Sambhog se Sanyas Tak'. Earlier in an interview with NDTV, Naseeruddin Shah said that great romances of theater begin at a rehearsal. Ratna Pathak Shah and Naseeruddin Shah first met at a juice stall outside Mumbai’s National College. While Naseer felt an immediate connection, Ratna was initially indifferent. However, during the rehearsals for the play, Ratna eventually fell for him. Reflecting on their relationship , Ratna humorously told the Indian Express that the play's title, 'Sambhog se Sanyas Tak', aptly represents their life together, noting that only the final stage of renunciation remains. They dated each other for six years and exchanged vows in 1982. It is Naseeruddin Shah’s second marriage , as he was earlier married to Manara Sikri, aka Parveen Murad. They had a daughter, Heeba Shah. Shah and Ratna have two children, Vivaan and Imaad Shah.",

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off! Podcast By Will Pickworth Published: 09:26 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 09:26 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Paddy Power has challenged England fans to a penalty shootout to win a 'trip of a lifetime' to Euro 2024 this summer. The Three Lions are preparing for another shot at glory in Germany after losing the Euro 2020 final on penalties to Italy three years ago, with Gareth Southgate naming his provisional 33-man squad for the tournament last week. Southgate's side have been drawn in a group with Serbia, Slovenia and Denmark and they are one of the favourites to go all the way. England will be backed by thousands of travelling fans in Germany and Paddy Power are offering the chance for more to join them. On Monday, they unveiled a first look at Paddy Fairlines, which promises to put 'the fair into air travel for England football fans'. Paddy Power has challenged England fans to a penalty shootout to win a 'trip of a lifetime' to Euro 2024 in Germany this summer on board their new airline, 'Paddy Fairlines' They are offering five fans the chance to watch Gareth Southgate's side against Serbia It's offering five lucky fans the chance to win a spot on a private jet which will fly to Dusseldorf for England's opening group stage clash against Serbia on June 16, with each individual allowed to bring three friends along. However, to win a spot on the plane, potential travellers must banish English ghosts of penalty shootouts and score a spot kick to earn their place. Fans who want to push their case have been invited to Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road on June 8, where they can shoot their shot. Some well-known England players of the past are also expected to be in attendance in the hope of redeeming their reputation at the second occasion. Paddy Power will then whittle down all the entrants to the five best penalty takers who will be chosen for the trip, with £5,000 worth of prize money up for grabs too. 'As we hurtle towards the Euros, England remain firm favourites to win the 2024 tournament outright,' Rachael Kane, spokesperson for Paddy Power said. 'If they succeed it will be their first major tournament win since the 1966 World Cup. 'But they’ve lost seven out of nine penalty shootouts in major tournament finals. So, it feels only fitting that we put our potential passengers through their paces if they want to land a spot on Paddy’s exclusive jet. It doesn’t get fairer than that.' To win a spot on the plane, potential travellers must banish English ghosts of penalty shootouts England have a historically bad record in tournaments when it comes to spot kicks 'We’re kicking off the Euros party a couple of weeks early to find England’s greatest penalty takers,' Paddy Power added. 'Once we’ve found them and sent footage of their technique straight to St. George’s Park so Southgate and Co. can take notes, we’ll bring our lucky winners on a trip of a lifetime to Gelsenkirchen which we’re reliably informed is somewhere near Dusseldorf.' Entrants must be over 18 and can register in advance for the challenge via www.paddypowershootout.com .

        "description": "Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reveiled that has turned quite a few heads across South Asia by her stunning revelations at an all party meeting at her official residence in Dhaka on Sunday.",
        "content": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stated that an ongoing conspiracy to \"carve out a Christian country\" from parts of Bangladesh and Myanmar is allegedly underway, the Daily Star reported on Sunday. Hasina went on to claim that, according to a \"white man\" who met with her before the January 7 election, she would face \"no problem\" if she allowed an unnamed country to build an airbase on Bangladeshi territory. \"It may appear that it [the plot] is aimed at only one country, but it is not. I know where else they intend to go,\" Bangladesh's prime minister stated, without specifying the name of the country. Commenting on her remarks, Hasina's former advisor Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury told Sputnik India that the politician's statements were well thought out. Hasina won her fourth consecutive term this January. The vote was boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which demanded that the election be held under a caretaker set-up, a demand not in line with the nation's constitution. Significantly, the US was widely perceived to be batting for the BNP in the lead-up to the vote , though the two governments have since attempted to move on from the tensions created by the elections. While Hasina didn't name which nation was purportedly trying to create a Christian state from parts of Bangladesh and Myanmar, officials from her Awami League party have left little doubt as to who the premier is hinting at. Squadron Leader (retired) Sadrul Ahmed Khan , a member of the Awami League's finance and planning affairs sub-committee , shared with Sputnik India that it was clear that the US has been trying to make inroads in the South Asian region through its support for anti-government forces , which include the National Unity Government (NUG) and People's Defence Forces (PDF). The Awami League official pointed out that since last year, the Biden administration has made no secret of its support to the opposition forces in Myanmar after the US president signed the BURMA Act into law, which calls to provide \"non-lethal assistance\" for Myanmar's \"Ethnic Armed Organizations\". The first tranche of aid under the act reached anti-government forces this year. It has been objected to vociferously by the ruling State Administration Council (SAC), which stated, according to Voice of America (VOA), that \"the US is manipulating Myanmar to counter China's influence in the region.\" In fact, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh claimed in February that the \"unnatural growth\" of Chin-Kuki-Zo tribes has implications for national security. The north-eastern Indian state has been experiencing ethnic clashes between the majority Meiteis and Kuki-Zo groups since last May, leading to over 200 deaths and tens of thousands of people being internally displaced. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament in January that New Delhi would fence the entire stretch of the 1,643-kilometre-long Indo-Myanmar border in response. Chowdhury, meanwhile, highlighted that improved India-Bangladesh relations under Hasina, including on security matters, have benefitted India's northeast. Furthermore, Khan stated that the US has sought to set up a base on St. Martin Island, strategically located at the Bangladesh-Myanmar maritime border in the Bay of Bengal, for a long time. He asserted that neither Bangladesh supports any arms race between the US and China nor would it act as a \"proxy\" for US interests aimed at containing China, because the independent state has its own outlook for the Indo-Pacific. He echoed Hasina and underlined that the country will not compromise in the face of external pressure. Chowdhury, in turn, warned that another US base in South Asia would have security implications not only for Dhaka but also for New Delhi.",

        "content": "The special judge for CBI Coal Cases II, Rouse Avenue Courts, New Delhi on Monday convicted a Nagpur-based private company B. S. Ispat Limited and its two directors - Mohan Agrawal and Rakesh Agrawal in a case related to allocation of Marki Mangli Coal Block situated in Maharashtra, to the company. The Central Bureau of Investigation had registered a case on March 31, 2015 on allegations that the accused submitted false information regarding existence of the company while submitting an application for the coal block and also during processing of the application for allocation of the coal block. The coal block was allocated for captive use in the proposed sponge iron plant of three lakh tonnes per annum capacity. It was also alleged that the company had misappropriated the use of coal for other purposes than for which it was allocated. After completion of investigation, a charge sheet was filed against the accused on July 24, 2018. The court held the accused guilty after trial and the arguments on sentence will be heard tomorrow on May 28, 2024.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI, May 27: Northwestern and central parts of the country are likely to get some relief from scorching heat after three days due to a fresh western disturbance, the Meteorological Department said on Monday. According to IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, Rajasthan and Gujarat saw nine to 12 heat wave days, with temperatures reaching 45-50 degrees Celsius. “Expect relief from the heat wave in northwest and central parts of the country after three days due to a western disturbance and moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea. There could be some thunderstorm activity in northwest India and rain in the western Himalayan region,” Mohapatra said in a virtual press conference. Delhi, south , southwest UP and recorded five to seven heat wave days, with maximum temperatures ranging from 44 degrees Celsius to 48 degrees Celsius, he said. Assam also experienced a heat wave with record-breaking temperatures on May 25-26. The IMD attributed the heat wave in northwest India and some parts of the central region in the second half of May to the lack of rainfall, stronger dry and warm winds and an anti-cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Gujarat. Mohapatra said only two of the five western disturbances that affected north India were active.",

        "content": "CHELSEA have requested official permission from Leicester to speak to Enzo Maresca. The Italian, 44, has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Mauricio Pochettino after guiding the Foxes to promotion . Meanwhile, Manchester United have completed their first bit of transfer business this summer, with Alvaro Fernandez moving to Benfica for £5million. BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKER S Follow all the latest news, moves and completed deals below ... Afam Lallana is holding talks with Southampton over a stunning return to St Mary's after his former club's Premier League promotion. The 36-year-old was spotted in the Royal Box at Wembley cheering his old team on as he prepares to become a free agent with his contract at Brighton running out on June 30. According to The Telegraph , the playmaker is already in the frame to come back to the Hampshire outfit a decade after his departure. That would make the former England international Russell Martin's first Premier League signing ahead of next season. Chelsea have requested official permission to speak to Enzo Maresca. The Blues have asked the Championship title winners to speak to their boss about becoming their new manager. Sun Sport understands that Maresca is close to leaving Leicester with talks between him and Chelsea at an advanced stage. Todd Boehly and Clearlake will have to pay £10m compensation to get their man. Manchester United and Arsenal are targeting Rennes wonderkid Desire Doue ahead of the summer transfer window. According to The Mail , United and the Gunners have both asked about the playmaker and that could spark an intense bidding war. Rennes will demand over £35million with substantial add-ons from his suitors this summer. As the Ligue 1 side have attracted interest from also Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund. Spain have announced their provisional squad for this summer’s Euro 2024. Premier League stars Rodri, David Raya and Marc Cucurella were selected but there was no place for Tottenham Hotspur defender Pedro Porro and Aston Villa's Pau Torres. Barcelona stars Pau Cubarsi, Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez were all included But Pablo Gavi missed out as he continues to recover from his anterior cruciate ligament injury. Ex-Newcaslte and Stoke ace Joselu who was in Real Madrid's Champions League semi-final was also picked for the squad. Arsenal captain Leah Williamson has signed a new deal with his childhood side. The defender, 27, has made 232 appearances since making her debut on her 17th birthday in March 2014. After being part of Arsenal's youth programme from the age of nine, Williamson debuted for the senior team as a teenager at the end of their 2014 Champions League campaign. With Arsenal, Williamson has won the League once and the FA Cup and League Cup twice each. Chelsea are set to announce their successor to Mauricio Pochettino this week, according to The Athletic . Kieran McKenna is out the race the report understands. Meaning Leicester City’s Enzo Maresca, Brentford’s Thomas Frank and former Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi are now in a three-horse Chelsea race. The search is being led by co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart alongside owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali. Luton have put together a brutal clearout following their Premier League relegation that has seen a total of 14 players leaving Kenilworth Road. The Hatters finished 18th in the Prem table with six points separating them from safety and will be returning to the Championship just a year after their stunning promotion. The released Luton stars are: Man City's summer transfer kitty will receive a £20million boost thanks to Southampton’s promotion to the Prem. Saints had an agreement that they will be obligated to buy centre back Taylor Harwood-Bellis if they went straight back up. And a £20million fee was agreed between the two clubs when he moved to the South Coast back in September. With Harwood Bellis coming through the ranks at the Etihad, it means it will be classed as pure profit for City and will help them to meet Profit and Sustainability Rules. The 22-year-old has previously had loan spells with Blackburn, Burnley and Stoke as well as Belgian club Anderlecht but will now become a Southampton player. The funds should help Pep Guardiola as he looks to strengthen his squad for their title defence next season. Crysencio Summerville could be set to leave Leeds this summer. The Whites suffered heartbreak in the play-off final at Wembley, where they were beaten by Southampton 1-0. Liverpool and Newcastle have both been linked with the forward in recent times. The Dutchman was named the EFL Player of the Season this year. According to TuttoJuve, Tottenham want to buy Ederson. Not City's Ederson... this Atalanta's Ederson, a Brazilian midfielder who starred against Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League final. A fee of £35million has been touted for the 24-year-old. Previously, the Mirror claimed Newcastle were also interested. NORWICH are set to appoint Nordsjaelland boss Johannes Hoff Thorup as their new manager. The 35-year-old is in line to replace David Wagner, who was sacked after the Canaries’ 4-0 play-off defeat at Leeds this month. Thorup took charge of what may turn out to be his final Danish Superliga game yesterday, a 1-1 draw at Copenhagen. And the Dane was quizzed about the Carrow Road job but kept tight-lipped. He said: “Have I heard anything from Norwich? “As I’ve said several times, when I’m employed somewhere I have so much respect for them. “Just look at this scenery behind me right now. It would be disrespectful to talk about other clubs or other situations. “No matter if it was close or completely miles away — I’m never ever going to go into that. “This club means so much that we shouldn’t be standing here on the last day of the season talking about everything else.” Four clubs are trailing Arsenal's out of favour youngster Emile Smith Rowe. Wolves, Aston Villa, Everton and Crystal Palace are all credited with an interest in the midfielder. Reports in Spain add that Newcastle are no longer the frontrunners for Smith Rowe. Discussions about his future are said to be had soon. Mason Greenwood released a 52-word statement on his future as Getafe fans begged him to stay with a new chant. Greenwood’s future remains unclear as he enters the final year of his United contract. But the forward sent a message to fans as he posted a statement on social media. It read: “Incredibly grateful to the Getafe family and fans for an amazing season. “Thank you for making me feel welcomed and one of your own. I enjoyed every second, alongside my teammates and club. “A bitter sweet ending, but it was a pleasure to play for you, I wish you all the best.” Monumental news from Manchester City where it appears that Pep Guardiola is heading for his final 12 months at the Etihad. The City boss' deal is up in 2025 and it appears as if he will NOT sign a new deal. After the most successful period in the club's history - and one of the most dominant periods in English football - City are now heading into an extremely uncertain future. Man Utd confirmed they have completed their first bit of transfer business of the summer. Alvaro Fernandez, 21, has joined Benfica for £5million after spending the second half of the season on loan in the Portuguese capital. The Spain U21 left-back joined United aged 17 having spent time in the academies of Real Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna. He never made a senior appearance for the Red Devils. Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Frank have reportedly held talks with Manchester United over the manager's job. However, the Telegraph does not make it clear if these discussions were had before or after Erik ten Hag won a second trophy in two seasons. Sir Jim Ratcliffe was expected to sack the Dutchman after the FA Cup final - but the brilliant performance in the 2-1 win may force him into a U-turn. United fans appear keen for Ten Hag to stay and may force the billionaire's hand. Man City earned £20million from the Championship play-off final. That's because Southampton's promotion meant the Saints triggered an obligation-to-buy clause for Taylor Harwood-Bellis. The fee for the defender was agreed when he switched to the South Coast on loan last September. Harwood-Bellis, 22, played in 45 games in all competitions this season and played the full 90 minutes as Southampton beat Leeds to win promotion back to the Premier League. Chelsea have reportedly added Roberto De Zerbi to the list of managers they are chasing. The Italian is now without a club after quitting Brighton at the end of the season. Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna, Leicester’s Enzo Maresca and Brentford’s Thomas Frank are all on the shortlist. Now, De Zerbi has reportedly been added say the Standard. The Blues are set to launch a £20million bid for Burnley goalie James Trafford. Chelsea signed Robert Sanchez and Djordje Petrovic last summer, but both have failed to establish themselves at Stamford Bridge. Now, the former Man City youth star could be set to challenge for the No1 spot. Trafford was selected by Gareth Southgate in the provisional Euro 2024 squad. A new Premier League club have entered the race to sign Michael Olise. The Crystal Palace winger is in demand - with the likes of Arsenal, Man Utd and Chelsea all in the hunt for the French wideman. Now, Newcastle are said to have declared their interest too. The Daily Mail claim the Toon have made Olise a priority this summer. Kylian Mbappe still hasn't announced his new club yet. The PSG star is leaving the club in the summer, and is expected to join Real Madrid. Asked why, he said: \"Because I think that the best thing to do is to finish these goodbyes. \"I think all I wanted was to finish well with my club. There's a trophy. I think there's a time for everything. \"I'll announce my new club in due course. I think we're just a few days away, so there's no problem.\" Ivan Toney is set to move this summer. But where is his likely destination? Betfair have provided the latest odds. Arsenal - 13/8 Tottenham - 7/2 Chelsea - 5/1 Man United - 13/2 West Ham - 13/2 Newcastle - 17/2 Nottingham Forest are braced for a bidding war for Callum Hudson-Odoi when the transfer window opens next month. Tottenham Hotspur lead a three-way chase for the 23-year-old who signed off for the season with three goals in Forest's final three games. Ange Postecoglou sees the pacy frontman as a perfect fit for his attack-minded Spurs side but faces competition from at least two other Premier rivals. Forest want to keep Hudson-Odoi but must complete at least one major sale by the end of June to avoid breaching Profit and Sustainability rules again. Philippe Coutinho is closing in on an Aston Villa exit. The Brazilian playmaker, 31, has failed to establish himself after arriving at Villa Park from Barcelona . And according to Fabrizio Romano , former club Vasco da Gama are confident of bringing him home after \"advanced talks\". Coutinho has flown out to his homeland and told local media \"everyone already knows\" where his future lies. He was snapped up by Steven Gerrard in 2022 in what was hailed as a potential game-changing signing. But the former Liverpool sensation has managed just six goals and three assists in 43 outings for the Villans. Arsenal prospect Albert Sambi Lokonga is keen to leave the club. The midfielder, 24, was once touted as the next Yaya Youre by compatriot Vincent Kompany. But he struggled for game time with the Gunners since arriving from Anderlecht in 2021 and spent last season on loan with relegated Luton . Now, he has set his sights on a fresh start after holding talks with the Arsenal hierarchy. Her told BBC Three Counties Radio: \"I had a discussion with Arsenal and the conclusion was the best thing for me was to leave the club, so now it’s up to my agent and the club to find something. \"I still have a contract there, one year plus a one-year option so let’s see what happens.\"",

        "content": "Recent technological advances are enabling the development of computational tools that could significantly improve the quality of life of individuals with disabilities or sensory impairments. These include so-called electromyography-to-speech (ETS) conversion models, designed to convert electrical signals produced by skeletal muscles into speech. Researchers at University of Bremen and SUPSI recently introduced Diff-ETS, a model for ETS conversion that could produce more natural synthesized . This model, introduced in a posted to the preprint server , could be used to develop new systems that allow people who are unable to speak, such as patients who underwent a laryngectomy (a surgery to remove part of the human voice box), to communicate with others. Most previously introduced techniques for ETS conversion have two key components: an EMG encoder and a vocoder. The electromyography (EMG) encoder can convert EMG signals into acoustic speech features, while the vocoder uses these speech features to synthesize speech signals. \"Due to an inadequate amount of available data and noisy signals, the synthesized speech often exhibits a low level of naturalness,\" Zhao Ren, Kevin Scheck and their colleagues wrote in their paper. \"In this work, we propose Diff-ETS, an ETS model which uses a score-based diffusion probabilistic model to enhance the naturalness of synthesized speech. The is applied to improve the quality of the acoustic features predicted by an EMG encoder.\" In contrast with many other ETS conversion models developed in the past, consisting of an encoder and vocoder, the researchers' model has three components, namely an EMG encoder, a diffusion probabilistic model and a vocoder. The diffusion probabilistic model, the second of these components, is thus a new addition, which could result in more natural synthesized speech. Ren, Scheck and their colleagues trained the EMG encoder to predict a so-called log Mel spectrogram (i.e., a visual representation of audio signals) and phoneme targets from EMG signals. The diffusion probabilistic model, on the other hand, was trained to enhance log Mel spectrograms, while the pre-trained vocoder can translate this spectrogram into synthesized speech. The researchers evaluated the Diff-ETS model in a series of tests, comparing it with a baseline ETS technique. Their findings were highly promising, as the speech it synthesized was more natural and human-like than that produced by the baseline method. \"In our experiments, we evaluated fine-tuning the diffusion model on predictions of a pre-trained EMG encoder, and training both models in an end-to-end fashion,\" Ren, Scheck and their colleagues wrote in their paper. \"We compared Diff-ETS with a baseline ETS model without diffusion using objective metrics and a listening test. The results indicated the proposed Diff-ETS significantly improved speech naturalness over the baseline.\" In the future, the ETS conversion model developed by this team of researchers could be used to develop better technologies for the artificial generation of audible speech. These systems could allow people who are unable to speak to express their thoughts out loud, facilitating their interaction with others. \"In future efforts, one can reduce the number of model parameters using various methods, e. g., model compression and knowledge distillation, thereby generating speech samples in ,\" the researchers wrote. \"Moreover, a diffusion model can be trained together with the encoder and vocoder for further enhancing the speech quality.\" © 2024 Science X Network",

        "content": "By Amiti Sen Comments READ LATER India’s farm input subsidies, including sops for fertilizers, electricity and irrigation, have increased a sharp 50 per cent to $48.13 billion in 2022-23 from $32.07 billion in the previous fiscal, per notifications made by the country at the WTO. This prompted several countries such as the EU, the UK and the US, to raise concerns and call for greater transparency at a recent peer group review meeting of the WTO, according to officials. “New Delhi explained that the input subsidies are mainly for power, irrigation and fertilizers, and that the increase was due to inflation and rising costs of fertilizers. It further said that the country had duly notified the information to the WTO,” a Geneva-based official told businessline . Agricultural input subsidies, targetted towards low income and resource poor farmers, are exempt from limits on domestic subsidies under the carve-out of special & differential treatment measures offered to developing nations under WTO rules. India opposes US, Australia allegations on its sugar subsidies breaching WTO limits EU’s deforestation law that could hit Indian exports opposed by many WTO members “The US pointed out that India’s input subsidies were more than twice the value of all trade-distorting support notified by the US in 2021-22. It raised concern on both the scale of India’s input subsidies and the rapid increase in expenditures,” the official said. New Zealand, Canada and the US expressed dissatisfaction with the explanation provided by India and said that it was not sufficient. “The countries said that India should be more transparent about the increase in expenditure,” the official added. Brazil and Japan, too, raised concerns on the matter. As India has declared that 99.43 per cent of farm holdings in the country are of low-income or resource poor farmers (per the Agricultural Census for 2015-16), its input subsidies are excluded from capping. “There is more peer group scrutiny on input subsidies also because it is not capped and can be increased without limits,” the official said. While several WTO members are trying to initiate negotiations on reforming all pillars of the Agreement on Agriculture, India has so far stoutly ruled out discussions around capping input subsidies on the ground that it was vital to ensure food and livelihood security of marginal farmers and for rural development. Instead, India, together with several developing nations, has been pushing developed nations to cut down on their special subsidy entitlements (extra Additional Measurement of Support) that allows them to give extra subsidies over the limits set in the AoA.

        "description": "Around 7 000 TVET college students have yet to verify their personal banking details with four days left before payment in June.The post Latest NSFAS payment method hits snag amid student verification issues appeared first on Hypertext.",
        "content": "NSFAS has already run into an issue ahead of the beginning of its latest payment method attempt in June. From next month, TVET college students will be paid their allowances directly to their personal bank accounts. Around 7 000 students are yet to verify their bank accounts with four days left until payments begin. Administrator Freeman Nomvalo, appointed by the Department of Higher Education to essentially fix NSFAS by the middle of 2025, has said today that the new payment disbursal method for beneficiaries at TVET colleges across South Africa is in effect. This means that NSFAS will disburse the monthly allowances of students directly into their personal bank accounts. This only applies to TVET students for now, as university students are ostensibly being paid directly by universities, while the status of the four payment partners is in the air – but the last we heard is that they are also distributing funds. Now NSFAS is urgently calling for TVET beneficiaries to verify their bank accounts ahead of the end of May payment run. June will be the first month that beneficiaries will be paid directly to their accounts . In a statement, NSFAS says that there is still a significant number of students who are yet to have their accounts verified. “In terms of data checks received thus far, a total of 211 591 have been verified and a total of 7 160 failed the verification checks, due to updated bank accounts that don’t belong to students,” the statement reads. “All students whose bank accounts were successfully verified will henceforth receive their allowances directly via their bank accounts.” The scheme is sending notifications to warn students who have uploaded incorrect banking details to reupload their details for verification via the myNSFAS online portal. It reiterates that the bank details must belong to the student that is uploading and you cannot use, for example, a bank account in the name of a parent, guardian or friend. It adds that the verification process may take time depending on specific banking institutions, however with four days left before NSFAS begins distributing payments, it is likely that there will still be some students who are unable to receive their allowances for June. According to Nomvalo, NSFAS has started work on a similar solution for university students, likely one that sees direct payments to their bank accounts, cutting out the university middle-man and direct payment partners altogether. “We also understand the challenges faced by University students regarding allowances,” he told the media. On the topic of student accommodation, NSFAS says that it will hold a workshop with private student accommodation associations across South Africa to “hear first-hand the challenges experienced by their members” during the NSFAS student accommodation pilot project started last year. This workshop will likely happen in September, ahead of the full rollout of the project in 2025. [Image – @myNSFAS on X ]",

        "content": "Delhi Fire Department Director Garg suspects a \"electric fault\" to be a possible reason behind the fire that killed six babies at New Born Baby Care Hospital in Delhi's Vivek Vihar. Speaking with news agency ANI on Monday, Garg said, \"...it seems that there is no reason behind the fire other than an electric fault. This could only be seen as a possible reason as of now.\" He said more details will come out after analysing videos and statements by eyewitnesses as the investigation has been started. At least in Delhi's Vivek Vihar on Saturday night. According to a report, seven dead children, of which four male and three female newborn babies, were moved to the GTB Hospital for postmortem. What could have saved more children Garg told ANI that \"No one was there to guide us and no one could give us information regarding stairs and the number of cylinders...,\" the Delhi Fire Department Director said. Lapses The Delhi Police also pointed towards major lapses that led to the in the Vivek Vihar fire incident on Saturday. The Delhi Police's probe revealed that the license on which the hospital was operating was no longer valid. \"We came to know that the NOC [No Objection Certificate] of the hospital had expired on March 31,\" police told news agency ANI. Delhi police also said there was no emergency or fire exit system in the hospital premises. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Shahdara, Surendra Chaudhary said that the hospital had permission for up to five beds but they installed more than 10 beds. Police investigation further revealed that some of the doctors in the hospital were not qualified to treat a newborn child in need of Neo-Natal Incentive care, as they are BAMS degree holders only. Two accused, identified as Dr Naveen Khichi (45), who is the owner of the hospital, and Dr Akash (26), were arrested in connection with the fire incident. Police said they added Sections 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code in the FIR . \"One of the doctors who was on duty, Dr Akash, has also been arrested. The accused have 3 such clinics in Delhi,\" police told ANI. 'Fire safety equipment now compulsory in every hospital' In view of the incident, Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj said on Monday that fire safety equipment will be made compulsory in every hospital irrespective of its size. He said that earlier the NOC related to fire safety was not required for all those nursing homes which were restricted to the ground or first floors. \"That's why this hospital did not have NOC,\" he said. \"But now we have decided every hospital be it ground or the first floor or even above it, fire safety equipment will be necessary. There should be a water sprinkling system and automatic smoke detection,\" Saurabh Bhardwaj said at a press conference.

        "content": "WEST HAM are ready to fight Leicester and Atalanta for Birmingham City’s young Welsh wizard Jordan James. Hammers’ new boss Julen Lopetegui had James, 19, on his radar when he was at Wolves and has contacted the Blues. The Foxes also have the midfielder shortlisted while the Italians made a bid during the last window. The Wales international stood out this season in the Championship with Birmingham . The teenage sensation amassed eight goals in 47 appearances across all competitions. James has already registered a staggering total of 105 appearances during his three-year stint with the St Andrew's outfit despite his young age. This comes with 10 caps for the Welsh national team as he made his debut last year. James has also proven to be very versatile as he can cover all sorts of different positions in the centre of the pitch. The Welshman can operate at No8, No6 and No10, while he can also cover the right and left side in midfield. Meanwhile, West Ham are struggling to agree a deal with keeper Wes Foderingham after he left Sheffield United. BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKER S Foderingham , 33, has endured a turbulent campaign with the Blades who finished bottom of the league and conceded a record 104 goals.

        "content": "WEST HAM are ready to fight Leicester and Atalanta for Birmingham City’s young Welsh wizard Jordan James. Hammers’ new boss Julen Lopetegui had James, 19, on his radar when he was at Wolves and has contacted the Blues. The Foxes also have the midfielder shortlisted while the Italians made a bid during the last window. The Wales international stood out this season in the Championship with Birmingham . The teenage sensation amassed eight goals in 47 appearances across all competitions. James has already registered a staggering total of 105 appearances during his three-year stint with the St Andrew's outfit despite his young age. This comes with 10 caps for the Welsh national team as he made his debut last year. James has also proven to be very versatile as he can cover all sorts of different positions in the centre of the pitch. The Welshman can operate at No8, No6 and No10, while he can also cover the right and left side in midfield. Meanwhile, West Ham are struggling to agree a deal with keeper Wes Foderingham after he left Sheffield United.

        "description": "Wendy's food is impressively inexpensive, and we're here to break down why, from high sales volume to a committment to avoiding food wastage.",
        "content": "Wendy's is known for its fresh food. Its burgers are never frozen, and its salads are made in-house everyday. Despite this approach, the food at Wendy's remains inexpensive; in fact, the fast food chain offers one of the cheapest menus out there. How can this be? There are several reasons why the food at Wendy's is so inexpensive — and in this article, we reveal them all. Wendy's boasts more than 6,500 restaurants, each of which marries fresh food with low prices. Maintaining and improving the profitability of these restaurants is the key to Wendy's success. Having low prices both helps and hinders this goal; low prices improve sales while simultaneously reducing profit margins. The chain has several ways of ensuring it continues to make money; these include maximizing sales volume, embracing new technology, and limiting food waste. These tactics — and many more — all contribute to the low price of your beloved Biggie Bag. Let's take a closer look at them. Wendy's pays low wages Labor is always one of a business' largest expenses. This is just as true for Wendy's as it is for every other fast food restaurant. That being said, Wendy's does limit its expenditure on labor by paying its staff low wages. Back in 2022, several Wendy's workers shared their salaries on a Reddit thread. Nearly all of those who commented, including managers, were paid no more than $15.50 per hour. Many crew members reported starting the job on as little as $11 per hour. A survey conducted by backs up this information. After receiving reports of 6,463 salaries, Indeed estimated the average crew member's wage to be $12.56 per hour. For comparison, estimated that the crew member wage at McDonald's is just over $13 per hour. Even saving $0.50 per crew member adds up to a huge amount over the course of an entire year. These savings are directly reflected in the restaurant's low prices. To put it simply, Wendy's can afford to price its food so inexpensively because it is paying its workers less than some competing companies. Wendy's has embraced automation Wendy's has always embraced automation and is often among the first fast food brands to introduce new technology into its stores. In the past, this has included being one of the first brands to introduce drive-thrus to its restaurants – — as well as self-order kiosks and its own app. All three have increased sales while driving down Wendy's operating costs, ensuring that food prices remain low. In 2023, Wendy's announced it was experimenting with that takes customers' orders. The chatbot was designed to streamline the ordering process, thus maximizing an already incredibly profitable aspect of Wendy's business model. Not only is the chatbot supposed to make ordering quicker, it also leaves staff members free to perform other tasks. This further drives Wendy's sales and profitability, thus enabling it to maintain the characteristically low prices of its food. Finally, the chatbot has been programmed to maximize sales via upselling. If successful, this could increase the profit margin associated with each order. These comfortable profit margins further ensure that Wendy's can afford to keep the prices of certain foods incredibly low. Wendy's relies on large sales volume All companies that serve or sell a product have to decide whether to prioritize sales volume or profit margin. Wendy's, like nearly all fast food chains, leans more towards large sales volume. Essentially, this means that Wendy's business model is designed to sell very large quantities of food at low prices. The idea behind this is that even small profit margins yield a lot of money when hundreds or thousands of items are sold each and every day. Drive-thrus have become an essential means of boosting sales volume at Wendy's. In 2023, it was estimated that a staggering 80% of food orders came from the drive-thru. Drive-thrus also serve more customers; some fast food brands experience 10-15% higher volume at drive-thrus than at the counter. Thanks to the sales volume both within the restaurant and at the drive-thru, Wendy's can maintain its inexpensive pricing. Wendy's underwent corporate reorganization Restructuring a company as large as Wendy's is no mean feat: It requires a lot of planning and money to be performed correctly. This did not stop Wendy's from embarking on a large-scale restructuring mission during 2023 that saw the size of the company's executive team reduced. Several senior positions were eliminated, including the role of the company's United States president. Estimates price the cost of the reorganization between $11 million to $13 million. Wendy's believes this is money well spent, and many agree. The company's operations are thought to be more efficient and its business model streamlined. Indeed, Wendy's has performed well since the reorganization, including a healthy start to 2024: The company's first quarter report revealed that sales had grown both internationally and in the United States. These strong sales reaffirm the company's decision to focus on large sales volume and subsequent growth. The new leadership team's success makes it very unlikely that this tactic will be changed. As a result, Wendy's prices are all but guaranteed to stay low. Wendy's balances out cheap food with premium options Wendy's is known for inexpensive food, but that doesn't mean it serves these foods. In fact, Wendy's menu also contains several premium options such as the Breakfast Baconator, a burger that's priced at $5.99 and . These premium foods play a very important role at Wendy's, subsidizing the inexpensive items and ensuring the brand remains profitable. An overreliance on the sale of inexpensive foods has seen Wendy's become unprofitable in the past. During the latter part of 2018, an overdependence on cheap foods saw some store sales decline. As reported in at the time, Wendy's ex-CEO Todd Penegor said, \"The opportunity we have is how not only to drive [customers] into the restaurants, but how to get them to mix in more core and premium items. We need to have that right balance between driving them in and trading them up.\" It might be perplexing to some, but the success of Wendy's premium foods is directly linked to the availability of Wendy's inexpensive foods. In recent years, Wendy's has done a better job of achieving this balance, and the brand is performing well. In other words, there's no danger of the restaurant brand prioritizing a high profit margin any time soon. Wendy's sells some products with high profit margins Interestingly, the best profit margins are not to be found in either Wendy's premium or value foods. Instead, the highest profit margins are associated with two specific products: drinks and French fries. It's thought that the profit margin for French fries served at Wendy's and other quick service restaurants lands anywhere between 75 and 90%. The margin on drinks, especially soda, is similarly impressive. Sales of these items are through the roof. In fact, were Wendy's most sold item during 2023, and Wendy's lemonade was the second most purchased beverage during the same year. The huge profits made on these two products allow Wendy's to sell other foods at very low prices. In essence, these two products subsidize Wendy's inexpensive foods. They even make up for the losses incurred by so-called loss leaders, foods that are kept on the menu even though the company loses money on them because they get customers in the restaurant. Wendy's leans into promotions and bundles Wendy's was the first fast food brand to offer a $0.99 value menu back in 1989. The company has continued to lean into promotions and bundles ever since. While a good deal for the customer, promotions such as the now-discontinued 4 for $4 and ever popular Biggie Bags remain profitable for Wendy's. In fact, senior members of the executive team have claimed these bundles and promotions actually boast better than average profitability. The reason why many of Wendy's promotions and bundles are so profitable is that they're made up of small portions. For example, the $5 Biggie Bag Meal Deal is comprised of junior fries, a four piece set of , a small drink, and a sandwich. These small portions minimize the cost of making the meal, thus allowing it to be profitable. Wendy's promotions and bundles are also known to boost sales. When the four for $4 promotion was introduced, the company saw sales increase by a significant margin in North America. As we've seen, Wendy's favors a high sales volume approach, which bundles and promotions actively support. Wendy's focuses on breakfast Breakfast is an especially lucrative part of the day for fast food chains such as Wendy's. This is partially thanks to the popularity of high profit margin foods at this time of day, most notably and coffee. Kirk Tanner, Wendy's CEO, highlighted another reason in an earnings call reported by . During it, Tanner said, \"We can grow our breakfast business significantly without adding incremental labor, which drives meaningful improvement of our restaurant economic model.\" The extra revenue brought in by breakfast is hugely important to how Wendy's operates throughout the rest of the day. As we've seen, products with a high profit margin subsidize the low costs of other foods sold by the brand. What's more, the company's breakfast is also another opportunity to push promotions and bundles that result in high sales volume. This is exemplified by the brand's recently launched $3 breakfast deal. Wendy's wastes very little food Every piece of food that Wendy's orders in has to be paid for. Unsurprisingly, this means that Wendy's is loath to waste food, especially high cost items such as meat. What makes this challenging is Wendy's commitment to only serving fresh, never frozen beef. The main way Wendy's minimizes beef wastage is using unserved patties to make the brand's chili. This ensures that even leftover food is monetized, giving the company the breathing room needed to price its food competitively. Another way Wendy's reduces food waste is reusing excess Frosty mixture the next day. Again, this cuts down on unnecessary waste, reduces the company's losses, and protects its profit margin. Of course, reducing food waste is not only an economic choice, but an environmental one too. Wendy's has committed to reducing food loss and waste by 50% by 2030. Not all of these practices have been adopted with maintaining the company's low prices in mind. Some, including donating excess food and repurposing cooking oil, are being performed to boost the company's sustainability credentials.",

        "content": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has stated that \" cost of living must once again be a focus for Budget 2025\". However, these expectations were quickly quelled by Finance Minister Michael McGrath who stated that the focus should be on \"permanent changes\" rather than a \"large series of one-off measures\". The comments were made at the National Economic Dialogue at Dublin Castle. This is the starting point of the budgetary process each year. It brings politicians and interest groups together to discuss the Budget. The Summer Economic Statement will be published following \"four to six weeks\" of \"extensive engagement with the party leaders\". This outlines how much money will be spent as part of the Budget. Read more: Over €500,000 worth of contraband seized from parcels at Dublin premises Read more: Dublin weather: Met Eireann forecast dry and bright conditions leading up to bank holiday weekend Despite speculation at the weekend that there may be an early Budget to allow for an early election, Minister McGrath stated that Budget 2025 will take place at the normal time, which is in the first two weeks of October. In his opening remarks, Mr Harris said that \"cost-of-living increases have left them feeling their personal finances are insecure and might not withstand any further shocks\". \"Therefore I believe the cost of living must once again be a focus for Budget 2025, building on the cost-of-living measures in the previous two years,\" the Taoiseach said. \"Therefore I believe the cost of living must once again be a focus for Budget 2025, building on the cost-of-living measures in the previous two years. \"In the coming Budget, we must ensure we provide the extra funding required to keep pace with the expanding population and a cost-of-living and welfare package that protects the most vulnerable. Income tax bands and credits must again be properly indexed so that people do not drift into the higher rate band of income tax.\" Minister McGrath said that \"of course, there will be measures in the Budget to support households with the cost of living\" but stated that we \"are in a different place when it comes to inflation\" and \"the emphasis should be on further measures and permanent changes to our expenditure and taxation framework rather than a large series of one-off measures.\" He told the Irish Mirror, however, that the looming general election will not have any influence on him or Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe when it comes to making decisions. He said: \"Overall, the economy is in good health. If you look back to where we were at this point last year, when we stood here, inflation was much higher. There was a lot of uncertainty as to whether or not it was going to be possible to get inflation down without doing considerable damage to the economy and to the labour markets. \"Thankfully, by working together, by careful management, we have avoided that. We are likely to be at a turning point in the interest rate cycle. We expect further energy price reductions to be passed through the wholesale level to the retail level.\" Mr Harris also said during his speech that spending extra money on services does not necessarily lead to better outcomes. \"If it was just about writing another cheque, many of the challenges society faces would no longer exist,\" he continued. \"So often, our political discourse defending itself descends into some sort of transactional bidding war, who is going to give another fiver here or another fiver there.\" For all the latest news from Dublin and surrounding areas visit our homepage .

        "content": "KETIKA melihat langit malam dan menyaksikan cahaya terang yang melesat cepat, sering kali kita menyebutnya sebagai \"bintang jatuh.\" Namun, sebenarnya yang kita lihat adalah fenomena . Di dunia , selain meteor terdapat juga dan . Lalu, apa perbedaan antara meteoroid, meteor, dan meteorit? Berikut penjelasannya. Meteoroid adalah benda kecil di luar angkasa yang beragam ukurannya. Mereka bisa sekecil butiran debu atau sebesar batu besar. Meteoroid umumnya terbuat dari batuan, logam, atau campuran keduanya. Benda-benda ini mengorbit matahari dan sering kali berasal dari pecahan komet atau asteroid. Tidak seperti planet atau bulan, meteoroid tidak memiliki orbit tetap dan bisa bergerak dengan kecepatan tinggi. Perjalanan meteoroid ini tidak selalu berakhir dengan mencapai permukaan bumi. Sebagian besar meteoroid yang memasuki atmosfer bumi akan terbakar akibat gesekan dengan udara, menciptakan fenomena yang kita kenal sebagai meteor. Meteor adalah cahaya terang yang muncul di langit saat meteoroid memasuki atmosfer bumi. Saat meteoroid melintasi atmosfer, gesekan dengan udara menyebabkan pemanasan yang sangat tinggi, mengubah materi meteoroid menjadi plasma yang terlihat sebagai kilatan cahaya. Peristiwa ini biasanya berlangsung hanya beberapa detik, dan meteoroid yang terbakar habis dalam proses ini tidak mencapai permukaan bumi. Fenomena \"bintang jatuh\" yang sering kita saksikan sebenarnya adalah meteor yang berkilauan di langit malam. Meskipun terlihat indah, meteor sebenarnya hanya jejak efemeral dari perjalanan meteoroid yang singkat melintasi atmosfer bumi. Namun, tidak semua bagian dari meteoroid terbakar habis saat memasuki atmosfer bumi. Beberapa fragmen dapat bertahan dan mencapai permukaan bumi. Benda-benda inilah yang disebut meteorit. Mereka dapat ditemukan di berbagai tempat di bumi, seringkali menyimpan informasi penting tentang asal usul tata surya dan evolusi planet. Meteorit adalah objek yang sangat berharga bagi ilmu pengetahuan karena mereka bisa memberikan wawasan tentang komposisi kimia, struktur internal planet, dan bahkan asal usul kehidupan di Bumi. Penelitian terhadap meteorit juga dapat memberikan informasi penting tentang bagaimana tata surya terbentuk dan berevolusi. Memahami perbedaan antara meteoroid, meteor, dan meteorit penting karena masing-masing memiliki karakteristik dan implikasi yang berbeda. Meteoroid, sebagai objek yang masih berada di luar angkasa, bisa menjadi ancaman potensial jika orbitnya mendekati bumi. Meteor, dengan keindahannya saat terbakar di atmosfer, menambah pengetahuan kita tentang fenomena atmosferik. Sedangkan meteorit, dengan komposisinya yang dapat dipelajari, memberikan wawasan tentang sejarah dan pembentukan tata surya. Dengan penjelasan ini, diharapkan kita dapat lebih memahami dan menghargai fenomena alam yang terjadi di langit malam. Fenomena yang sering kita sebut sebagai \"bintang jatuh\" ternyata menyimpan banyak cerita dan ilmu pengetahuan yang menarik di baliknya. (Z-9)",

        "description": "International critics praise Kapadia's film for its emotional depth and storytelling.",
        "content": "All We Imagine As Light by Payal Kapadia won the Palm d'Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival 2024. This award-winning film is set in Mumbai and tells the story of two nurses from Kerela who came to Mumbai to work in a hospital. The film scripted history as it received an eight-minute-long standing ovation after it was screened at the festival. The film is the first in 30 years to be nominated in the main category and to win the award. Kapadia was also the first Indian female filmmaker to win this award. Let's take a look at what International critics have to say about the film. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD \"There is a freshness and emotional clarity in Payal Kapadia’s Cannes competition selection, an enriching humanity and gentleness which coexist with fervent, languorous eroticism and finally something epiphanic in the later scenes and mysterious final moments. Kapadia’s storytelling has something of Satyajit Ray’s The Big City and Days and Nights of the Forest; it is so fluent and absorbing.\" Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian 0 \"All We Imagine as Light gradually transcends the limits of reality to question the nature of life itself. By taking Prabha and Anu out of Mumbai, even temporarily, Kapadia takes away the overwhelming sensory assault of urban life that stifles contemplation. (“Do you ever think about the future?” asks Prabha. “I feel like the future is here and I’m not prepared for it,” Anu replies.) The oblique title, mysterious but somehow magical, captures what Kapadia is getting at without being too on the nose. And at a time when so much attention is being paid to the lives of the haves and the have-nots at a time of such financial imbalance worldwide, it’s refreshing to see the spotlight on ordinary women caught somewhere in the middle, living just enough for the city.\" Damon Wise, Deadline ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD \"Kapadia doesn't resort to polemic, nor does she try to force the narrative into tragedy or farce. In her clear, lyrical way, she simply tells the bittersweet stories of three friends who want nothing more than to be allowed to carry on as they are. All We Imagine as Light is specific in its detailing of life as a woman in today's Mumbai, but this Indian-French co-production also has the feel of an American or European indie comedy drama. It is universal and emotional enough to hypnotise anyone who has been alone in a city, or been spellbound by a film on the subject.\" Nicholas Barber, BBC ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD \"That Kapadia is able to render such a richly varied emotional texture from an aesthetic palette this constrained and contemplative isn’t merely a testament to her skill as a filmmaker; it’s an emblem of the process that powers the core of All We Imagine as Light. This is fundamentally a film about Mumbai. Kapadia evokes her adopted home with as much vivid clarity and bracing honesty as Jia Zhang-ke does Shanxi, or Elena Ferrante does Naples, because she has taken its animating principle—the reconciliation of opposites—as her own. Ryan Coleman, Slant Magazine ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD \"This casual everyday vignette is brimming with a sensuality (the rain, the clothes, the food, the women) that people don’t tend to notice when caught up in the rhythm of life. It takes a snapshot from a photographer removed from the situation to make you realize how full these moments are. Each shot by Ranabir Das in this gorgeous and absorbing film has been composed to have the skin-prickling effect of a photograph taken by someone with a deep and attentive care for their subject — a photographer sufficiently removed to see clearly while still close enough to feel the thrum of a lifeforce.\" Sophie Monks Kaufman, IndieWire ( At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience.

        "description": "The storms threaten to bring more violent weather to other areas.",
        "content": "Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the north-west corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other areas. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swathe of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky governor Andy Beshear has declared a state of emergency in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes”. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado ploughed through a rural area near a mobile home park on Saturday night, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference. The dead included two children, aged two and five. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, eight people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. In Texas, around 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Mr Abbott said, speaking from near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Mr Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the car park. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Mr Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.” Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, Mr Abbott said, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference on Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. In Kentucky, a man was killed on Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death.",

        "content": "Israel faces new condemnation over Rafah strikes, which local health officials say killed 45 TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faces new condemnation over strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials say killed at least 45 Palestinians. Some of those killed were displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Many were women and children. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas. Even some of its closest allies like the United States are expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel says it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts. One of those courts last week demanded that Israel halt its offensive in Rafah. EU-Israel relations take a nosedive as Spain, Ireland set to formally recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah while Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leader of Hamas. Latest deadly weather in US kills at least 20 as storms carve path of ruin across multiple states VALLEY VIEW, Texas (AP) — Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms obliterated homes and destroyed a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park. Eight people were killed in Arkansas. Three died in Kentucky, and two were killed in Oklahoma. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. Papua New Guinea says Friday's landslide buried more than 2,000 people and formally asks for help MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by a landslide Friday. The official formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple a U.N. estimate of 670 killed in the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. In a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. China has threatened trade with some countries after feuds. They're calling 'the firm' for help WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department has set up an eight-person team known as “the firm” to provide help to countries cut off from Chinese trade. The team emerged after Washington stepped in to help Lithuania when the northern European country found its cargo shipments to and from China stranded two years ago during a feud over Taiwan. State Department officials say Washington sees ”the firm” as an emergency response when a country fears facing economic pressure from China. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. says Beijing opposes economic coercion and calls the American allegation “completely unfounded.\" Russian POWs get to make phone calls home. Ukrainians don't. A growing movement wants that to change FAR WESTERN UKRAINE (AP) — For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It's a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They're appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site. It's a full day’s journey from the front lines. The visit took place on condition its location not be revealed. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. Military labs do the detective work to identify soldiers decades after they died in World War II OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency experts strive to offer about 200 families annually the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. Advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year.",

        "content": "As President Bola Tinubu turns one year in office, his Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, shares his thoughts with STEPHEN ANGBULU on the journey so far and what Nigerians should expect in the next one year What type of economy did the President meet when he assumed office on May 29, 2023? When the President took over, that year’s budget allocated 97 per cent of our revenue to service debt. So if you’re spending 97 per cent on debt servicing, how much is left? So the government before President Tinubu was borrowing money for recurrent expenditure. Less than N1tn was devoted to capital projects. Nigeria was haemorrhaging heavily. We also owed the NNPC close to N4tn on subsidy financing. NNPC was the only importer. Other companies were not ready to import because the price was not right. Then, if you look at the exchange, we have multiple windows of exchange, which international agencies such as the World Bank have advised us to address. So, you will find a situation whereby some people close to the former CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, were collecting money at the official rate and then offloading it in the parallel market and making a humongous profit for doing nothing. Before Tinubu took over, the government had sold our future by mortgaging our oil to take loans. And oil is our major revenue earner. If you are selling about 40 to 45 per cent of whatever you produce, then you wonder why the inflow from NNPC was drying up. So for years, NNPC was not paying money into the government coffers because we were spending money to take care of the subsidies and so on. It is still affecting us because we’ve already pledged our oil to collect loans all over the place. So this is the situation that President Bola Tinubu met. Things were bad. Nigeria was bleeding. And it was his duty to stop that bleeding. From day one, he announced at Eagle Square that “subsidy is gone”. He was not the originator of the abrogation of subsidy. The Buhari government had already put the machinery in place to end fuel subsidy by the end of June. Of course, the nation was already reeling from petrol scarcity and so on. It was thus necessary that the President fast forward the end of subsidy to May instead of June. Four weeks or more would have been very calamitous for this nation’s economy. There would have been no fuel to run the economy. You must understand that when he came in, he needed to find out where the money was and whether we had money. We had already over-borrowed. Our international rating was bad. So he needed to do certain reforms very quickly so that Nigeria could get its international ratings back, build confidence and be able to secure essential investments from Fitch, Moody’s, and the like. Nigerians were shocked that he announced the removal of subsidy on fuel when he had not seen any book on the handover, no aides appointed, and no consultation. Why would he do that? Don’t forget that when the President campaigned, he had a programme of action. So he already had sort of a mini-cabinet before he took the mantle of leadership on May 29. He did not go there alone. He already had a group he was working with. Some Nigerians think that some ministers are not expected to be members of the cabinet going by their records, especially the former governors who did not perform in their respective states. Do you think they have a point? First, the President is a politician. So, number one, he needed to bring on board some of his allies who helped him to win the election. It was compensation time, he had to compensate some of them. He needed to also bring in people of talent who are not necessarily politicians who can contribute value to his mandate. I think these are the considerations believing that these people can add value to whatever he’s doing. People who can bring something to the table and contribute to the success of Nigeria. Even those who had been named for cases of corruption? These things are speculations. Who did not perform in his state? Is it Governor Badaru who did very well in his State? Was it the Kebbi Governor who also did well and made his state the number one rice grower in this country? Was the minister in question ever indicted? He has not been convicted in any court of law. The fact that somebody is making accusations against you doesn’t make you a criminal. It is an allegation which needs to be proven. Anybody can say anything. It is the duty of those who are accusing to prove. Everybody being accused is innocent until proven guilty. I think the finger-pointing is misplaced because you need a proper trial before condemning them and saying, yes, they committed an offense. If there’s nothing like that, then there is no point wasting your time. One year later, has the President done well? The President would be the first person to say that the last one year has been bumpy. Don’t forget that I said he took very bold measures from Day 1. He ended subsidy. He said we must harmonise our exchange rates and of course, this has affected the economy. This economy has been on crutches for ages and we needed someone to say, ‘Enough of all this feeding-bottle economy that we are running. Let us face the harsh truth’. What the President has done is a wake-up call saying, ‘look, things are bad and if we continue on this path, we’re going to hell.’ So, he brought the country back from the brink instead of us continuing to slide down into serious problems. When he found that some of his policies had unintended consequences, you can see the inventions he brought into play to bring succor to the vulnerable people in our country. He announced various measures for the poor. He distributed free food to vulnerable people and gave wage awards to federal civil servants and the states followed. Even individuals followed in distributing palliatives, not just food but also cash to vulnerable members of society. He didn’t go out there to say ‘I want to inflict pain on Nigerians. But he did what was necessary. The people watching us from outside have said these are things that are necessary to drive Nigeria’s economy on the right path. The Minister of Petroleum (Oil) told us that for 12 years, there was no single investment in the oil sector. Nobody wanted to invest in Nigeria because of our policies. At a point, China which was ready to give us money for our rail began to hesitate about funding our rail because our financial outlook was very bad. It was getting clearer that the way we were borrowing money, we would not be able to pay. But today, because of the measures President Tinubu has taken, our credit rating has gone up. Foreign money is now coming into the country as of now and it is reflected in our stock market. A lot of companies even into a sector. The minister at the ministerial briefing said Nigerians should expect about $15bn investment in oil alone, not gas. We’ve not had it for many years. But because of what President Tinubu has done trying to reinvent the business of oil and gas, to quicken the ease of business, it is now attracting new investments into the oil sector, especially the offshore oil sector. And also, the gas industry. Nigeria is less of a crude producer than gas. So the President softened the policies to attract investment. You can see that three gas plants were launched in Delta and Imo states. So many things are being unlocked by the policies of the present administration. Are you saying if the President had not won in 2023, things would have been worse than what we have now? If we had not had Tinubu in 2023, honestly, Nigeria would have been speeding down the path of destruction. Things were going bad before he came in. If we didn’t have somebody who had his experience, who managed a micro-Nigeria, in Lagos before, things would have gone bad. We were on the path of economic doom before he came in. He just came in and applied the brakes to ensure we didn’t fall over the edge. Nigerians should be grateful that we have somebody with his experience who came in at the right time to apply the brakes to save us from a possible economic doom. What would you say about the inflation, killings in some states, and high unemployment rate? Well, I don’t know which figure you are quoting, but according to the National Bureau of Statistics, our unemployment rate is less than 5 per cent going by the new rules that they have applied. In the past, people would say that the unemployment rate was 30 per cent. That is not the truth. The NBS has recalibrated, the way it measures unemployment, and at the last time I checked, the unemployment rate was below 5 per cent. But truth be told, there are people suffering underemployment. For instance, a well-trained graduate living off being a POS operator. Such a graduate may feel that they’ve not really gotten what they are looking for and may still be looking for a job much better than a POS operator. For inflation, so many things caused inflation. Of course, we are still import-dependent. As the naira depreciated, the cost of importation increased and that was passed on to our people. The insecurity was also inherited. In 2023, Emefiele made Nigerians suffer with his new currency policy. Many farmers especially from the north lost a lot of money. They started even giving out their products for free. I learned that a lot of them refused to go back to the farm because people didn’t have money to buy their products and it became a disincentive to farm. So, it reduced the available food, and because we also import food a lot, those things became expensive. Besides all that, we are paying more for petrol and diesel, logistical costs also increased and that also affected and cost of food in the market. Don’t also forget those who were profiteering. Recently, I was in Ogbomosho, and I saw a basket full of mangoes for N800. I had to gift the seller N200 to make it N1000. But when I got to Abuja and Lagos, they were selling one mango for N300. So don’t forget the role of profiteers. I call them wicked Nigerians who get excited at punishing their fellow citizens. They were hoarding food so the prices could go up so they could sell it costlier. These are some of the causes. The government is concerned and is doing all things possible to ease these challenges. The government is making efforts to get more food, giving our farmers more incentives to produce more food at a lower price. Even in the health sector, the government is engaging with pharmaceutical companies to assist them in reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals for our people. How come Nigerians are not feeling the impact of the money from the removal of the fuel subsidy? The federal state councils have been receiving more money since the subsidy was removed. Almost every month, over N1tn is being shared to all the tiers of government. That’s one of the benefits of subsidy. This government has really gone to work trying to see how we can improve our revenue collection and a lot of successes have been recorded in that regard. More money is now being generated by the government. And this has helped in financing a lot of projects and the palliatives. So people who say we have not benefited from the subsidy removal don’t know what they are talking about. And are you also surprised that some governors are not even paying the N30,000 minimum wage? Let’s talk about the governors doing their duty. Nigerians have been misfocusing on the federal government as though it is the only government that exists. There are three tiers of government in our country and each has a responsibility to its constituency. The Federal Governement has no land. But the states, starting from the Federal Capital Territory and its local councils to the states and the governors, all have a duty. People should be asking questions; ‘Mr. Governor, how are you spending the allocation sent to you every month?’ If they (Governors) perform their role, if the local councils perform their role, people would even forget about whether the federal government exists or not. We are not running a unitary government. We are running a federation. And each component of that federation has a duty to its immediate constituents. So the governors need to be more responsible. They have a duty to take care of their people first. That is their obligation? Take care of your people. Invest in roads, education and health. They should stop blaming the federal government all the time. For every money this government generates, even if they said the FG collects 52 per cent, the bulk of this money goes to the states and local councils. Don’t forget the extra percentage for oil-producing states. So, at the end of the day, the FG does not collect up to 52 per cent. Even if we collect 52 per cent what are they doing with their 48 per cent? We need to really begin to ask them questions. The governors need to make some structural adjustments. Not in the way Babangida did. They need to look at the structure of their states and find out find where are they wasting money. For instance, the government has surplus workers, whether at the local council, state, or federal level. Visit federal secretariats in Abuja, you’ll find people idling around. They are selling groundnuts, clothes, and shoes in the government office. So we need to address these things because they are pulling us back from developing when we have surplus labour and we keep plowing resources into servicing them and they don’t produce. Let us send some of these people to farms so they can earn some income for the state. Is there hope that such governors will even pay the new minimum wage when approved? First, I must say that the Labour Unions are asking for something very unrealistic. Initially, they wanted over N600,000. Who will pay that amount? How much does Joe Ajaero (NLC President) pay his staff? Which state or company in Nigeria can pay that amount? They brought it down, but they are not facing the reality. There’s a limit to what the government can pay. The government has duties not just to workers. So, Labour needs to be reasonable. And try to understand what the government can pay. If the Federal Government says it would pay N100,000. I’m sure only very few states will be able to pay. They should be looking at wages that are reasonable and sustainable so that they won’t pay for one month and say, ‘Sorry, we can’t continue. We need to retrench.’ That will be another problem for this country. What will the President tell Nigerians on May 29? Is there any assurance that things won’t be harder for Nigerians by this time next year? Let me, on his behalf, assure Nigerians that things are going to be much better in the next 12 months. In the past year, this President has been busy laying the foundation for growth. In power, more plants are being built. The government is investing in solar energy, taking universities and hospitals out of the grid. We are working to increase the strength of our transmission. Kano just flagged off a mass housing plan in Kano. By next week, the President will flag off 12 centers for the treatment of cancer. These are just a few examples. By next week, we are going to see some CNG buses, and tricycles being made available. People are going to receive dividends of the government’s efforts in the last 12 months. Are we expecting a cabinet reshuffle as Nigerians are yearning for the injection of fresh minds into the federal cabinet? I’m not going to speculate on that. The president has not said he is going to reshuffle. Let me explain something. None of those ministers have spent one year in office. They came in last August. The president wants them to be accountable. That’s why he told them to come out and give their scorecards, to talk about what they have done in the last eight months. When you see what they have done, you cannot but give this Tinubu government, in its first year, a 7/10 for the various achievements that his ministers and, by extension, his government have achieved. I’m sure the president is giving them some time to either perform or ship out. Does the president interact with his ministers and if he does, through what means? Of course. This is a president whose ministers have access to him. They request to see him and they see him. That is why they do the Federal Executive Council meeting and bring their projects there. He listens to them and knows what everyone is doing through some other informal means. He has various sources. He keeps tabs on them. He knows what everybody is doing. Even Nigerians are monitoring the ministers. Hadiza Bala-Usman, who handles Policy and Coordination has launched an app where Nigerians can monitor their ministers. What will happen to those considered not doing well in the cabinet? Will they be kept, repeat the class, or be asked to leave? President Tinubu has already told them they will go if they can’t perform. He told them at the retreat last year that the government has an eight-point agenda and expects the minister to deliver on it. So those who are found wanting would have to go. But as of today, the President has not made any decision on that.",

        "description": "The storms threaten to bring more violent weather to other areas.",
        "content": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the north-west corner of Arkansas, and the system threatened to bring more violent weather to other areas. By Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swathe of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky governor Andy Beshear has declared a state of emergency in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes”. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado ploughed through a rural area near a mobile home park on Saturday night, Texas governor Greg Abbott said at a news conference. The dead included two children, aged two and five. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Storms also killed two people and destroyed houses in Oklahoma, where the injured included guests at an outdoor wedding, eight people in Arkansas and one person in Kentucky. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. In Texas, around 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Mr Abbott said, speaking from near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest-hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Mr Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the car park. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Mr Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.” Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. No more deaths are expected and nobody was reported missing in Texas, Mr Abbott said, though responders were doing one more round of searches just in case. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference on Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. In Kentucky, a man was killed on Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death.",

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in Madrid where he is expected to sign a bilateral security agreement with Spain. The deal will help his country fight its more than two-year war with Russia amid a recent offensive by the Kremlin’s forces. Spain’s King Felipe VI met Mr Zelensky at the capital’s Barajas airport. The Ukrainian leader is holding talks with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez about what local media reported is a planned 1.1 billion euro (£940 million) agreement for Spain to supply Ukraine with more weapons. Mr Zelensky had been due to visit Spain earlier this month but he postponed all his foreign trips after the Kremlin’s forces launched a cross-border offensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and left Ukrainian troops reeling. A Western intelligence assessment suggested that Russia’s Kharkiv offensive has subsided. “The northern Kharkiv front has likely stabilised with Russian territorial control fragmented and not joined up,” the UK’s Ministry of Defence said. “Russia’s gains in this axis will be limited in the coming week, as Russia’s initial momentum has been contained by Ukrainian resistance.” That is in line with Mr Zelensky’s claim last Friday that Ukrainian forces have secured “combat control” of areas where Russian troops entered the Kharkiv region. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force. Spanish newspaper El Pais, citing unidentified sources familiar with the bilateral deal, said it would include another batch of US-made Patriot air defence systems that Ukraine has long pleaded for to help it fend off Russian missile attacks. Other items include more Leopard tanks for Ukraine and 155mm artillery shells that are the most used by Ukraine on the battlefield, El Pais said. Spain will also continue training Ukrainian troops and treating its wounded soldiers.",

        "content": "MADRID, May 27 — Spain coach Luis de la Fuente named Barcelona’s teenage stars Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsi in a 29-man Euro 2024 squad list on Monday. De la Fuente must cut three players before June 7 for the tournament that kicks off in Germany on June 14. Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez and Real Betis’ Ayoze Perez also get their first ever international call-ups. De la Fuente left out various players who have been involved in the last few years, including Marco Asensio, Gerard Moreno and Pablo Sarabia. Yamal, 16, has burst into the limelight this season with Barcelona, along with 17-year-old centre-back Cubarsi. The coach said he had included three extra players to account for potential injuries before then, with Real Madrid competing in the Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund on June 1. “It’s a guarantee against any set-back that could happen in the Champions League final, or in training, that would generate a problem,” said the coach. “They all have the same chance (of going), we will minimise risks, we have very versatile players.” Spain, who won the European Championship in 1964, 2008 and 2012, reached the semi-finals of the last edition. They are in a “group of death”, facing Italy, Croatia and Albania in Group B. Before the tournament Spain face Andorra on June 5 and Northern Ireland on June 8 in friendlies.

        "content": "Divya Agarwal is currently married to Apurva Padgaonkar, however Diva has not taken down her wedding ceremony photos from Instagram. Netizens are concerned if the couple are planning to part their ways. Read on. Updated: May 27, 2024 6:55 PM IST By Edited by raised eyebrows when she wiped out all the photos of her wedding ceremony with her spouse from her Instagram. This unexpected move is spurring rumours of a potential marriage crisis just three months into their wedded bliss. Fans and followers are abuzz, pondering over their relationship’s standing as Divya deleted all wedding-related posts from her Instagram handle. Meanwhile, Apurva’s decision to retain some pictures but exclude prominent wedding snapshots further adds fuel to the speculations of parting ways. Scroll down to find more details. Netizens React To Divya’s Divorce Rumours A hawk-eyed Reddit user recently drew public attention to a post on speculating that Divya Agarwal might be undergoing a marital split. This is due to the abrupt disappearance of all her wedding photos, as well as a lack of recent ones with her spouse. Fired by this post, netizens switched to Divya’s Instagram handle for verification and, indeed, validated the absence of any pictures with Apurva. In a similar vein, Apurva too seems to have removed the cherished snaps of their wedding ceremony. In reaction to the strange social media behaviour of the pair, a member of Reddit commented, “The drama level is high with her. Searching for attention, she’s wiped her social media clean of wedding photos and most of her posts, leaving her feed noticeably bare.” Yet another participant viewed it as a marketing gimmick, pointing out, “It seems they mishandled their PR. Only yesterday, they were sharing videos overflowing with joy and love from their wedding.” Posts from the community on Reddit About Divya and Apura’s Gran Wedding Ceremony Divya and Apura officially became man and wife in a heartwarming traditional home ceremony on February 20, 2024. Both of them looked stunning on the sunny day of their wedding and warmly engaged with the paparazzi. But recently, the cheer seems to have faded out a bit. Puzzled fans are waiting impatiently for the couple to share the reasons that led to the sudden downturn in their seemingly perfect relationship.
