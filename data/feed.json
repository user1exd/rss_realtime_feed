        "content": "The Nigerian Senate, on Monday cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. The Senate Committee on Capital Market, chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of all three Executive Commissioners namely: Frana Chukwuogor, Legal and Enforcement; Bola Ajomale, Operations; and Mrs. Samiya Usman, Corporate Services. Agama’s appointment has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1 trillion economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, he was appointed to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth, stressing that “we are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointment by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market,” he added The new DG noted that the commission would implement innovative policies and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Continuing, Agama said: “you must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that,” he stressed.",

In a statement to mark the 2024 children’s day celebration made available to newsmen by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Nsa Gill, he quoted the Governor saying, “You are the future of our state and the pillars of our society. Your innocence, creativity, and boundless energy bring joy and hope to our lives. Our responsibility is to nurture and guide you so you can reach your full potential and contribute positively to our state’s growth and development.” Governor Otu maintained that he wants the Children to know that as the Governor, he is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for all to thrive. “My administration’s continuous investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure is to ensure children can access the best opportunities and resources. “Our State is richly endowed in agriculture, and this administration has already taken steps to make agriculture the mainstay of our economy.” The Governor, in his statement, urged the children to continue to dream big and work hard towards achieving their goals. In his words, he said, “Remember that there is no limit to what you can achieve with determination, resilience, and a positive attitude. “I also want to express my gratitude to all parents, teachers, and caregivers who play crucial roles in shaping the lives of our children. Your dedication and love are instrumental in their growth and success. “As we celebrate this year’s Children’s Day, I charge you to remember the less fortunate children in our society and strive to impact their lives positively. “Once again, I wish you all a happy Children’s Day. May you continue to be a source of joy and inspiration to us all. Keep shining bright and making us proud,” Governor Otu concluded.",

        "content": "Some concerned natives of Amichi in Nnewi South Local Government Area (LGA), Anambra State have sought intervention of governor Chukwuma Soludo to end an alleged intimidation and harassment of the community’s traditional ruler, Igwe Dr. Ofobuike Ezeoke by land grabbers. According to them, a certain land the monarch inherited from his father, Igwe Alphonsus, is being dragged by some prominent indigenes of the town who were allegedly bent on using the law enforcement agents and thugs to intimidate him and his supporters, especially his Personal Assistant, Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke. They spoke in a statement signed by their leader, Chief Ogbonna Ogbonna, adding that a High Court in Nnewi had on 14th of May 2024 issued an order restraining some persons from entering the land which the Igwe claims to had inherited from his late father through a Supreme Court judgment believed to have been delivered in November 1961 under Suit No. FSC 27/61. “Unfortunately, the prominent persons had even gone ahead to start selling parts of the land for building an estate. A transporter from the community in connivance with political appointee and others had also contracted a Catholic Bishop to build on the disputed land despite court orders. On Saturday, 18th May 2024, they arrested Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke on trumped up charges and had been dragging him around. “They tried installing another Igwe just to humiliate and oust Igwe Ofobuike but Anambra State government turned them down. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi. “Our Igwe is a peaceful man. He told us that he does not want to waste the blood of any individual in Amichi because of the land regardless of the temptation to do so. He had called on the court to ward off trespass from the land since the Supreme Court adjudged and decreed that it rightly belonged to his father,” the statement alleged. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down because of land. The town has been torn apart because the rich men feel that Igwe Ofobuike should not inherit such massive 6,000 plots of land. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi.",

In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "Exhibitors from five continents will be taking part in this year’s Food & Beverage West Africa trade exhibition, the largest edition yet. More than 300 exhibitors representing brands and businesses from more than 50 countries will be on show from June 11 to 13 at the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Nine countries will have exhibitor pavilions and they include Turkey, Dubai, China, India, USA, Indonesia, Italy, Egypt and Tunisia. In addition, sizeable delegations from UAE, UK, Thailand, Ukraine, Ghana, Algeria, Malaysia, Netherlands and many more will use the show to launch new products into Nigeria and West Africa as well as to meet new business partners. Now in its fifth edition, Food & Beverage West Africa is the continent’s largest food and beverage trade show. More than 6,000 visitors are expected to attend over the three days. The exhibition is organised by BtoB Events. Brad Smith, Exhibition Manager, said: “This year’s exhibition is featuring more exhibitors, more countries and more products than ever. If you are seeking new and exciting products that have yet to be seen in the West African market, then FAB is simply unmissable. “FAB 2024 is bringing even more countries and exhibitors than ever before. Our brand-new USA, China and Italy pavilions are joining our regular pavilions from Turkey, Dubai, India, Indonesia and Egypt. “We are also welcoming exhibitors for the first time from countries such as Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Turkmenistan and Nepal.” The event is recognised for the number and range of overseas exhibitors which attract visitors from the West African region and beyond. “We pride ourselves on the international standard quality that our exhibition represents. It is a unique exhibition where we are bringing the global food and beverage industry to Nigeria, with both exhibitors and visitors attending and all looking to do business within the West African region,” said Smith. One of the international exhibitors, Xena’s Food Group, is a Platinum Sponsor of FAB West Africa. Based in London, Xena’s is a wholesale food distributor specialising in premium-grade fresh condiments, oils and ingredients. The company sees huge potential with the Nigerian market, noting the growing demand here for high-quality ingredients. “FAB West Africa offers a unique opportunity to connect with key players in the food industry specifically within the West African region,” says Mr Kochhar, Head of International Trade. “We believe that this targeted approach aligns perfectly with our goal of expanding our presence in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. We see this event as a strategic platform to showcase our offerings. “Our primary objective is to establish Xena’s Food Group as a trusted supplier of premium food products in the African market. We aim to forge partnerships with distributors, wholesalers, hotels, and restaurants, showcasing our extensive range of high-quality mayonnaises, ketchups, flours, cooking oils, poultry, eggs, and grains.” Another of the international exhibitors is Linc Drinks, also from London, and a manufacturer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Zoryana Slater, Linc Drinks’ Export Manager, is delighted to be coming to Food & Beverage West Africa. “We recognize the immense potential of the African market, particularly Nigeria, and view FAB West Africa as a strategic platform to showcase our premium beverages. We aim to establish strong connections with industry stakeholders, distributors, and consumers, fostering brand recognition and market penetration,” says Zoryana Slater. “We aim to forge strategic partnerships, secure distribution channels, and generate substantial interest in our products, including our private label options. Participation in FAB West Africa presents a prime opportunity to elevate the visibility and reputation of Linc Drinks in the African market.”",

        "content": "Henkel Nigeria, a leading German multinational renowned for its WAW and Nittol detergents in the country, has reaffirmed its dedicated commitment to supporting Nigeria’s industrial development. This commitment comes amidst growing awareness of the potential of Nigeria’s non-oil industry to diversify the economy. This was the focus of discussion during the courtesy visit on Honourable Minister, Dr. Doris Nkiruka Uzoka-Anite, Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment in Abuja, by the Henkel Nigeria management team, led by Rajat Kapur, Managing Director, Henkel Nigeria, along with Kadir Demirtas, Head of Finance, and other key members of the management team. They met with the minister with the aim of strengthening collaboration and identifying strategies to overcome challenges hindering mutual growth and development within Nigeria’s industrial sector. During the visit, Rajat Kapur informed the Minister of the company’s efforts in driving safety and innovation, promoting Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG), and contributing to the nation’s industrial advancement. Acknowledging the ministry’s crucial role in Nigeria’s industrial promotion, Rajat Kapur highlighted Henkel Nigeria’s eagerness to work closely with the government in overcoming challenges to industrial advancement. He also emphasized the critical need to cultivate an enabling business environment in the country, with a particular focus on facilitating access to forex and ensuring stable energy supply. Kapur highlighted the necessity for policy regulations that would provide relief to manufacturers in the nation, emphasizing this as a prerequisite for bolstering economic growth and sustainability. Rajat expressed gratitude, stating, “We commend your unwavering commitment to upholding standards in manufacturing processes that meet global benchmarks. We are working closely with the government to maintain compliance with regulations and align with government initiatives to propel the economy forward.” He added: “We recognize the private sector’s vital role in national development, aligning perfectly with the Federal Government’s vision for economic prosperity. We are also mindful of the fact that fostering innovation, securing jobs, and engaging in sustainable business practices are significant steps in contributing to Nigeria’s growth.” In her response, the Minister commended Henkel Nigeria for its contributions to the country’s economy and welcomed the opportunity to strengthen ties with the company. Acknowledging Henkel’s reputation for excellence and its track record of innovation and empowerment, the Minister expressed optimism about the potential for fruitful collaboration between the Ministry and Henkel Nigeria in overcoming current economic challenges. “We are fully prepared to ensure that your company, along with others operating in the country, receives the appropriate position within the economy, ” she said.",

        "content": "Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner start French Open with straight-set victories PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek has started her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean. Monday's win stretched Swiatek's winning streak to 13 matches. She put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Jannik Sinner also won in straight sets Monday. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Acuña is placed on IL after suffering a 2nd season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn ACL in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña’s second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris was scheduled to play Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09. Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months.",

        "content": "CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s quest was to complete — if not win — the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson's team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane , and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That's when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. “So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,” Larson said. “I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.” Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson's focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can't participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn't been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting “The Double” was one of the best experiences of his life — right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. “I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream,” Larson said. “I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try ‘The Double’ but if it is I guess it was memorable.” AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

        "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were...",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Colleen Barry in Rome contributed to this report.

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to get economic sanctions imposed over it's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing it down. This is all under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader and likely won’t change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further to weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Grossi has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The latest IAEA report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. Iran and the IAEA are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The latest report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. The report said that the IAEA’s request needed to be resolved otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.

Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Former soccer player Christian Karembeu, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, says two of his relatives have been killed during the unrest in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia that has left seven people dead. Speaking during an interview with Europe 1 radio on Monday, the former Real Madrid midfielder said his two relatives were shot in the head by snipers. “I’ve lost family members, that’s why I’ve kept quiet,\" Karembeu said. “Because I’m in mourning.” Asked if these were assassinations, Karembeu replied: “I didn’t want to, because the word is strong, but ... it’s true that, yes, it’s an assassination and we hope that there will be inquiries and investigations into these murders.” French President Emmanuel Macron decided on Monday to lift the state of emergency that was imposed earlier this month. Deadly violence erupted in the French Pacific territory after protests kicked off against the French government’s attempts to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia, where pro-independence Indigenous Kanaks have long pushed to be free of France, amid sharp economic disparities. Karembeu, who is Kanak, grew up on the island of Lifou in New Caledonia. After moving to France as a teenager, he went on to win two Champions League titles with Madrid as a midfielder. He started for France in the 1998 World Cup final and was also part of the team that won the 2000 European Championship. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon’s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Karembeu's great-grandparents were shipped to Paris in 1931 from the French Pacific territory and exhibited as “cannibals.” AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "content": "Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "content": "Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A North Korean rocket carrying its second spy satellite exploded midair on Monday, state media reported, after its neighbors strongly rebuked its planned launch. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket,” with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff later said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office earlier issued a missile alert for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch. The alert was lifted soon after. Japan’s NHK public television earlier reported that an image captured by a camera in northeastern China showed an orange light in the sky and then an apparent explosion a moment later. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. Monday's launch came hours after the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative military action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",

        "description": "More than 30 members of the British parliament want the UK to recognize Morocco’s sovereignty claim over Western Sahara Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "A group of lawmakers from the UK Parliament, including the House of Lords, has written to British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, demanding immediate recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over North Africa’s coastal Western Sahara region. In a letter dated May 23, more than 30 MPs declared that a plan put forward by Rabat deserves Britain’s “unequivocal” support because it is the “only solution” to the ongoing conflict over the sparsely populated former Spanish colony, which Morocco annexed nearly five decades ago. “Such support aligns with our principles and international commitments. It would not compromise our position in the British Overseas Territories, and it can contribute ultimately to peace in this vital region,” the group of parliamentarians stated. The North African country has been locked in a decades-long conflict with the Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front movement, which fought a 15-year war for independence before agreeing to a fragile, UN-brokered ceasefire in 1991. The annexation of Western Sahara also strained relations between Morocco and its neighbor Algeria, which has for long backed the autonomy of Western Sahara. Rabat has, however, insisted that limited autonomy is the best political solution it can offer the territory, where just over 550,000 people live. In April 2007, Morocco submitted its Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara to the UN Security Council. According to the proposal, Rabat intends to delegate administrative, legislative, and judicial powers to local residents while retaining the Moroccan flag and currency. Morocco would also be in charge of the phosphate-rich region’s foreign policy, security, and defense. Rabat has been engaging many countries, including African neighbors, to gain support for the plan, which US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hailed at the time as “serious, credible, and realistic,” despite the Polisario Front rejecting it. To date, only Israel and its ally the US officially recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. Last month, Western Sahara’s Information Ministry accused France of being in “flagrant violation” of international law over an alleged plan by Paris to finance projects in the disputed Sahrawi regions through the French Development Agency (AFD). The ministry denounced the move as a provocative step. On Thursday, the group of British lawmakers described Rabat’s proposal as a “realistic and pragmatic approach,” asking the UK’s leadership to recognize that following “the example set by our main allies,” including the US and France, in backing Morocco is “indeed the right course of action.” “This would also be consistent with our trade agreement with Morocco, which covers the Western Sahara,” according to the group’s letter. “Remaining neutral or attempting alternative resolutions can only perpetuate a harmful status quo that jeopardizes the security of the region,” it added.",

        "description": "Attorney Trudy-Ann Russell has won her appeal against a ruling by the General Legal Council that she was guilty of professional misconduct over retainer fees charged to process the sale of a property in Kingston.",
        "content": "Attorney Trudy-Ann Russell has won her appeal against a ruling by the General Legal Council that she was guilty of professional misconduct over retainer fees charged to process the sale of a property in Kingston. The Court of Appeal ruled that the disciplinary committee of the GLC erred in its April 2022 conclusion that Russell violated the canons of professional ethics by charging fees that were not fair and reasonable and departed from the retainer agreement with the complainant. \"On the termination of the agreement by the complainant, the appellant was entitled as a matter of contract law and under the termination clause, to depart from the fixed fee provision and to charge fees on hourly basis,\" noted the unanimous judgment handed down on May 17. \"...It is difficult to see on what basis her conduct in this regard could be reasonably deemed, beyond a reasonable doubt, to rise to the level of conduct which would bring dishonour to the dignity of the profession,” it added. The court, comprising Justices Frank Williams, David Fraser and Kissock Laing, who wrote the judgment, set aside the fines that were imposed by the committee and ordered the GLC, which was the respondent, to pay Russell's legal costs. The disciplinary committee had fined Russell $200,000 and ordered her to pay costs of $50,000 to the GLC and costs of $50,000 to the complainant. She was represented by attorney Hadrian Christie, instructed by HRC Law. King's Counsel Sandra Minott-Phillips and attorney-at-law Jamaiq Charles, instructed by Myers Fletcher & Gordon, represented the GLC. The GLC is the regulatory body for the legal profession in Jamaica. A complaint was made to it by Sheldon Richards who owned a property with his sister as tenants in common. He wanted the property sold and the proceeds shared equally with his sibling. Richards reported that on September 22, 2020, Richards and Russell signed a retainer agreement for her to pursue the sale. On his instructions, she filed a claim in the Supreme Court on October 27, 2022, to get an order for the sale of the Kingston property. But Richards became dissatisfied with Russell's service and sent a letter in November 6, 2020, indicating that he was terminating her legal services. He requested a detailed invoice of the work done and a refund of unused monies. Russell responded with a letter dated November 9, 2020, attaching an invoice in the amount of $935,000, of which $600,000 was stated to be due and owing. The services were calculated at the billable rate of $25,000 per hour based on the termination clause of the contract. Richards reported the matter to the GLC. The disciplinary committee had a hearing and later found that the arrangement between the attorney and the complainant was that she should charge a flat or fixed fee of $300,000, plus disbursements. If the effort to get an order for sale of the property went to trial, there would be an additional fee of $250,000. The committee ruled that Russell was not entitled to use the termination clause to charge for time spent from the inception of the retainer agreement, even though the complainant had terminated the retainer suddenly. Russell filed several grounds of appeal, one of which was that the committee erred in finding that the termination clause of the retainer agreement for charging an hourly rate was inapplicable. The GLC's attorney conceded that there is no clear legal authority that there is anything in principle prohibiting the inclusion of a provision in the terms of the termination clause allowing for an hourly rate to be charged. But she argued that the inclusion of the clause created an inconsistency with the fixed-term provision of the agreement and that where there is a conflict, the court should prefer the word of the complainant over that of the lawyer's. But Court of Appeal said that \"with the greatest of respect\", the disciplinary committee erred in finding that because the fixed fee was earned by the time of the termination, the termination clause which allowed for a reassessment of the fees on a hourly basis could not be triggered. \"In effect, the committee has implied a term, in the form of a proviso, that the termination clause shall not take effect and the appellant shall not be at liberty to charge on a time spent basis if the appellant has already earned the fixed fee at the time of the termination of the retainer agreement,\" Justice Laing wrote. Laing further noted that with the retainer agreement terminated before the order for the property sale was obtained, the full amount of the fixed fees had not yet been earned and the lawyer was entitled to use the termination clause to calculate her billable hours. Justice Laing said the conduct of the lawyer should be assessed in the context of the purpose of the termination clause, from the perspective of the appellant. “Even if, for the sake of argument, the committee was correct that the termination clause did not permit the appellant to charge on an hourly basis, such a construction would not necessarily have been patently obvious to the appellant. Therefore, if she arrived at an alternative conclusion, she would have acted based on her flawed interpretation of the termination clause, in respect of which there is room for reasonable disagreement between legal minds, as the result of this appeal has patently demonstrated,\" the appeal court said. “In such circumstances, her (Russell) departure from the terms of the agreement would not be egregious or negligent...” the court ruled. The court said it was of the view that Russell acted based on the termination clause of the retainer agreement and concluded that \"there is no basis to find that she engaged in conduct unbecoming of the profession\". The appeal was heard on November 14, 2023. - Barbara Gayle Follow The Gleaner on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

        "content": "Iga Swiatek began her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean on Monday, stretching her winning streak to 13 matches. Swiatek, who has been ranked No. 1 for nearly every week since April 2022, put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier in the 1-hour, 1-minute match: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Three of her four Grand Slam trophies came in Paris — in 2020, 2022 and 2023. The last woman to win the championship at the clay-court major three straight times was Justine Henin in 2005-07. “It feels like home here,” said Swiatek, who will meet four-time major champ and former No. 1 Naomi Osaka next. “I'm really happy to be back. Just feel like I can play really good tennis, so hopefully I'm going to be here as long as possible.” Her match was going to be followed by one involving someone even more comfortable on the red clay: Rafael Nadal, the 14-time champion at Roland Garros. He was scheduled to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round — in what might end up being Nadal's last French Open match. “For sure, I'll be watching Rafa’s match,” Swiatek said. “Comparing me to him? I don't think I'm at that level yet. He's a great person and a great athlete ... I will try to take lessons from him.” In other early action Monday, reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner improved to 8-0 in Grand Slam play in 2024 by defeating Chris Eubanks 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova eliminated Rebeka Masarova 6-1, 6-3 and two-time major finalist Ons Jabeur beat Sachia Vickery of the US 6-3, 6-2. Sinner, who missed the Italian Open this month with an injured hip, moved well and his strokes seemed just fine. He limited the big-serving Eubanks to four aces, converted 5 of 10 break points and was broken only once himself. Not surprisingly, the clean-striking Sinner won 10 of the 14 points that lasted nine strokes or more. “The hip is good. I'm very happy. I'm glad that my team and myself worked very hard to be back on court as soon as possible,” Sinner said. “For sure, (my) general shape is not at 100% yet, so we try to build every day.” The encounter lasted only a little more than two hours and, truth be told, Sinner was not really tested all that much. “I'm obviously happy by what I have achieved in the last months. But our goal is to improve every day. That for me is more important. I know I have to improve some things,” said Sinner, who now faces French veteran Richard Gasquet. “Let's see what I can achieve in the future.” Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti knows he will have a tough decision to make in goal for the Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Will he pick Andriy Lunin, who has played in goal nearly the entire season, or Thibaut Courtois, the veteran who has won the Champions League before but has just returned from injury? “It’s really difficult,” Ancelotti said Monday. “Of course it’s really difficult, because both of them deserve to play this final. Lunin because he did a fantastic season, and Courtois because he is back from his injury and everyone knows the quality of Courtois. It’s a difficult decision but I think I’m going to take into the game this decision, no doubt.\" Lunin was nursing a fever and was the only Madrid player who didn’t train on Monday as Madrid began its final week of preparations. But Ancelotti said the 25-year-old Ukrainian was expected to be available for Saturday’s final in London. The illness surely doesn't help Lunin's chances, though, and many had already expected Ancelotti to go with the more experienced Courtois despite his lack of minutes this season. Courtois ruptured a left-knee ligament in August, just two days before the start of the season. The 32-year-old Belgian then also ruptured the meniscus in his right knee in March, when he was close to making a comeback. He was sidelined until the beginning of this month, when he started in a 3-0 win over Cadiz, a victory that secured Madrid’s 36th Spanish league title. Lunin was back in goal as Madrid beat Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals. He had saved two penalties in the decisive shootout win over Manchester City in the quarterfinals. Lunin had earned the starting position over Kepa Arrizabalaga, the former Chelsea player who is Madrid’s other reserve goalkeeper. Ancelotti said Lunin was the best goalkeeper in the world right now. Courtois has proven experience in finals, though, having won the 2022 Champions League with Madrid, the FA Cup with Chelsea, the Europa League with Atletico Madrid, and two Copa del Rey titles (one for Madrid, one for Atletico), among several other titles. “Both deserve to play for various reasons,” Ancelotti said. Ancelotti joked that he will wait as long as possible to announce the starting goalkeeper because otherwise the debate would be over, and “I like the debate.” The two-day WWE SmackDown and King & Queen of the Ring events, organized by Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority as part of Jeddah Season, culminated in thrilling matches at the Jeddah Superdome on Saturday. In a captivating main event, Austrian Gunther emerged victorious over American Randy Orton, to claim the coveted King of the Ring title, igniting electrifying cheers from the packed audience. Meanwhile, in the women's division, Australian Nia Jax emerged triumphant, defeating Irish Lyra Valkyria to capture the Queen of the Ring title. The tag team action was equally intense, with Americans Bianca Belair and Gigi Dolin securing the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship belts after a hard-fought battle against fellow Americans Tamina and Candice LeRae. American Liv Morgan successfully defended her WWE Women's World Championship title against Irish Becky Lynch, while American Cody Rhodes emerged victorious in the Undisputed WWE Championship, defeating fellow American Logan Paul. The evening concluded with Canadian Sami Zayn retaining his Intercontinental Championship title, overcoming American Chad Gable and Australian Bronson Reed. Olivier Giroud scored in his final match for AC Milan as the Rossoneri drew with bottom club Salernitana 3-3 on a Saturday night of farewells at San Siro. The 37-year-old Giroud, who helped Milan to the Serie A title in 2022, is leaving after three years and will join Los Angeles FC. Giroud was given a standing ovation when he was substituted off six minutes from time, hugging all of his teammates and coach Stefano Pioli as the crowd sang his name. Milan’s last match of the season was also Pioli’s final match in charge, bringing to an end a five-year stint that included the Champions League semifinal last year as well as the Serie A title. There were emotional scenes before the match as Pioli was encircled by his players. He had tears in his eyes as he embraced each of them individually as they applauded, while the whole stadium gave him a standing ovation. Rafael Leão immediately went over to celebrate with Pioli after scoring the opening goal in the 22nd minute following a howler by Salernitana goalkeeper Vincenzo Fiorillo, who dropped the ball at his feet. They were joined by the rest of the Milan team. Five minutes later it was Giroud’s turn as he acrobatically struck home a corner for his 15th league goal of the season. The France forward has 49 goals for Milan in his three seasons. Simy pulled one back for Salernitana in the 64th but Davide Calabria restored Milan’s two-goal advantage 13 minutes later. However, goals from Junior Sambia and Simy in the last three minutes rescued a draw for already-relegated Salernitana in its last top-flight match. It was also Milan defender Simon Kjær's last match for the club. Pioli, Giroud and Kjær were all celebrated in a special ceremony after the match, and all three struggled to hold back tears. RECORD-EQUALLING Alex Sandro made his 327th and final appearance for Juventus as the Brazilian equaled Pavel Nedved’s record for the most matches by a foreign player for the Bianconeri. Alex Sandro headed in Juve’s second in a 2-0 win over Monza. Federico Chiesa claimed the opener two minutes earlier. Nicolò Fagioli hit the crossbar in the 16th minute on his first start for Juventus since returning from a seven-month ban for betting violations. Monza forward Alessio Zerbin was sent off in the final minute following a second yellow card. Real Madrid drew with Real Betis 0-0 on Saturday in its last warmup game before facing Borussia Dortmund in the Champions league final. Madrid wrapped up the Spanish league title three weeks ago, and since then coach Carlo Ancelotti has rotated his lineups to rest his starters. But the Italian likely had his top-choice players back in his starting 11 against Betis at the Santiago Bernabeu. There were only two changes from the Champions League semifinals victory over Bayern Munich. The versatile Eduardo Camavinga was in the spot of injured holding midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, who will miss the final due to a foot injury. The other tweak was goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois starting over Andriy Lunin, the backup who played most of the season before the Belgian recovered recently from an ACL injury. Ancelotti, however, would not confirm that this will be his starting team for the final in London on June 1. “I have a week to think about it, we may still have some doubts,” Ancelotti said. “We will enjoy preparing for the final and arrive at our best form on Saturday and try to win it.” KROOS HONORED Toni Kroos played his last home game for Madrid. The 34-year-old midfielder announced this week he will retire after playing for Germany at this summer’s European Championship. Kroos' teammates donned his No. 8 shirt to hold an honor guard for him before kickoff. When he was substituted late, his teammates and coach took turns hugging him. Kroos then embraced his three young children. He can add to his 22 titles, including four Champions League crowns, with Madrid next weekend. “I couldn’t have asked for more,” Kroos said. “These have been 10 unforgettable years. Now the best way for me to finish would be winning another title.” DOVBYK EYES TOP SCORER Ukraine striker Artem Dovbyk is set to finish the Spanish league as its top scorer after his main challenger fell one goal short of his mark. Dovbyk, who is expected to play in Euro 2024, leads the league in the final round with 24 goals. Villarreal striker Alexander Sorloth has 23 and had a chance to equal Dovbyk when it visited Osasuna. But the Norway striker appeared to suffer a leg injury early and had to be substituted without scoring. Dovbyk was two goals behind Sorloth in the goals race until he bagged a hat trick to fuel a 7-0 rout of Granada on Friday. Dovbyk's last outside threat is Robert Lewandowski, who has 18 before Barcelona visits Sevilla on Sunday in Xavi Hernández's last game in charge. Dovbyk joined Girona last summer from Ukrainian club SC Dnipro-1 and helped transform the small club into a European sensation. The Catalan club partly owned by Manchester City's Adu Dhabi ownership qualified for the Champions League for the first time with a third-place finish. Villarreal drew at Osasuna 1-1 after Sorloth's replacement, José Luis Morales, scored a second-half equalizer. Osasuna striker Ante Budimir, who is on Croatia's Euro 2024 squad, netted his first goal since recovering from fractured ribs to give the hosts a first-half lead. He finished the league with 17 goals. Villarreal will likely conclude the campaign with the league’s top assist-maker. Midfielder Álex Baena, who could be on Spain’s Euros 2024 squad, made it 14 assists by setting up Morales. Villarreal said that tied a club record set by Juan Riquelme. The game also featured the farewell of coach Jagoba Arrasate after his six years at Osasuna. Arrasate announced in March that he turned down the offer of a contract extension, saying he needed a fresh start. NICO SHINES Nico Williams capped his superb season by scoring to give fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao a 1-0 win at Rayo Vallecano. Williams helped Athletic win the Copa del Rey and is a sure bet to play for Spain at Euro 2024. Fourth-placed Atletico Madrid got goals from Samuel Lino and Reinildo Mandava to defeat sixth-placed Real Sociedad 2-0. The final round had no drama with the title, European berths and relegation spots all decided beforehand. Madrid, Barcelona, Girona and Atletico will play in the Champions League next season, while Athletic and Sociedad are Europa League bound. Betis will play the Conference League. FINALLY A REASON TO CHEER Almeria, which was relegated a month before the season ended, was at least able to escape last place and give its fans something to cheer about after crushing Cadiz 6-1. Luis Suárez and Sergio Arribas both notched braces in the rout. Almeria pushed Granada to the bottom. Cadiz will join them in the second division next season. Manchester United stunned Manchester City 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday, ending City's dreams of a second straight league and cup double. Alejandro Garnacho put United ahead in the 30th minute and Kobbie Mainoo doubled their lead nine minutes later after a well-worked team move, with Jeremy Doku pulling one back late on. While Ten Hag was receiving his medal from the future king of England, Prince William, the Dutchman then got his hands on his second trophy in as many seasons to end a troubled campaign on a high. “I’m not satisfied with it, we have to do better, and if they don’t want me anymore then I go somewhere else to win trophies because that is what I did my whole career,” a defiant Ten Hag said. “We are constructing a team and when I took over it was a mess at Manchester United.” First-half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo set up the win. City piled the pressure on after the break and eventually pulled a late goal back through substitute Jeremy Doku. United’s owners were watching on from the executive seats at Wembley and have a decision to make. “We are all very proud of the players and the staff who work tirelessly to support them,” new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said. It would have been different if Mauricio Pochettino had been willing to trust Chelsea’s great restructuring is going to work. In the end, the problem for the Argentinian was that he joined a club who do not want a manager who has all the power. It is clear by now that anyone who hopes to last under Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital has to collaborate with the board on everything, be open-minded about constructive criticism and remember not to rock the boat too much when it comes to recruitment. Unfortunately that was never going to be Pochettino – just as it was never going to be Thomas Tuchel, who lasted seven games before being fired. Pochettino is 52. He is a big, magnetic character and an experienced coach who believes his way is best. He was never going to listen to suggestions that he could ease Chelsea’s injury problems by reviewing and altering his training methods. Inevitably there will be talk of an amicable split. Tuchel left under a cloud after the collapse of his relationship with Boehly and Clearlake, a private equity fund managed by Behdad Eghbali and José E. Feliciano. Pochettino was better at managing upwards. He is a more amiable figure than Tuchel. That, though, does not mean he did not have strong views about the way to run the club. Pochettino was not afraid of flexing his muscles when he spoke to the media during the second half of the season. He was not shy of making it clear that he wanted more control over signings. Yet Chelsea, who have spent over £1bn on players since Boehly and Clearlake bought the club from Roman Abramovich two years ago, were not willing to alter their approach to suit the man who carried them to sixth place. Eghbali, whose voice carries most weight, was unsure about Pochettino from the start. Would anything change his mind? Losing the Carabao Cup final to Liverpool’s kids did not help, nor did the failure to challenge for Champions League qualification. Ultimately, Pochettino could never quite solidify his position. It is hard not to conclude that his great mistake was failing to realise that this was not a club conditioned to serve a manager; if power is being doled out, then it is heading only in the direction of the co-sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, who is said to be close to Eghbali. It is Stewart and Winstanley who have implemented Chelsea’s youth-first policy. That Pochettino, who was popular with the players, made it work by making sense of an immature squad has not really registered. It is instructive that the team’s late surge to sixth place was merely seen as evidence that criticism of Stewart and Winstanley was misguided. Chelsea are determined to modernise. Joe Shields is a popular figure in the recruitment team and Sam Jewell is the latest addition from Brighton. They are scouring the globe and are close to completing a deal for the Palmeiras sensation, Estêvão Willian, for just over €60m. Estêvão, 17, is seen as a future Ballon d’Or winner by good judges. Chelsea’s plan is ambitious. It can look crazy. If it works, though, they could end up with one of the best teams in the world. So the head coach has to swear allegiance to the recruitment team. Do not rock the boat. Do not make the mistake of thinking that Pochettino going for a “very nice dinner” with Boehly last Friday meant anything. Pochettino wanted experienced signings last year and this summer. He disagrees with plans to sell two of his most important players, Trevoh Chalobah and Conor Gallagher, because of profit and sustainability concerns. He was not really into Chelsea bringing in Brentford’s set-piece coach, Bernardo Cueva. Admittedly it can be argued that Pochettino is behind the times given how much having a set-piece coach has helped Arsenal. Chelsea want a young, progressive manager who will be comfortable with their structure. They do not want fireworks. Expect them to steer clear of a combustible character such as Roberto De Zerbi. There is strong interest in Ipswich’s impressive 38-year-old manager, Kieran McKenna. But Chelsea want to be consistent challengers for the title. Young coaches are in vogue, but history suggests that the successful clubs build around the person on the touchline. Arsenal, for instance, cater to Mikel Arteta’s needs. Bayer Leverkusen’s unbeaten season is not down to their structure; it is because of Xabi Alonso. Sometimes an inspiring, demanding, obsessive, slightly unhinged character is required. Liverpool had that in Jürgen Klopp. Players need to believe. They need a talismanic figure to carry them over the line – particularly when Pep Guardiola is in charge of the team at the top. Chelsea have a way to go to reach those heights. The worry is that they have created more instability for themselves; perhaps even that they are becoming unmanageable. Graham Potter was gone after less than seven months, Pochettino after less than a year. At this rate, potential hires will wonder if this is the impossible job. McKenna, and others, will need to consider if this is worth the hassle. The rewards are potentially magnificent. There is a chance to take this talented young side and create something special. Alternatively, the payoff could be huge if you aren’t willing to say yes to football’s great disruptors. - The Guardian Sport Adam Wharton could hardly have picked a more difficult Premier League debut at the start of February. With Crystal Palace trailing 1-0 against their arch-rivals Brighton, a knee injury to the captain, Marc Guéhi, forced Roy Hodgson to throw in the 19‐year‐old, who had signed 48 hours earlier from Blackburn. Brighton doubled their lead within five minutes and seven seconds after Palace kicked off again a moment arrived that must have been replayed in Wharton’s mind countless times. Receiving the ball midway in his own half, he turned and attempted to pass to Tyrick Mitchell but was surprised by Pascal Gross and ended up losing possession. What a difference a few months make. Wharton is one of four Palace players in Gareth Southgate’s 33- man provisional England squad for Euro 2024, and the midfielder – who turned 20 four days after the 4-1 defeat by Brighton – has become the heartbeat of a team transformed by the new manager, Oliver Glasner. Palace won five of their final six matches, scoring 20 goals, and Southgate’s assistant, Steve Holland, was at Selhurst Park last Sunday to witness the 5-0 rout of Aston Villa in their final game. Whereas the England call-ups for Henderson, Eberechi Eze and Guéhi caused few ripples, the selection of Wharton is something of a surprise. He made his debut for England Under-21s as a substitute against Luxembourg in March and this tournament had been regarded as coming slightly too early despite his impressive form. A dearth of experience in central midfield caused by the problems with Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips this season mean England have been forced to search for alternatives. Kobbie Mainoo – who Southgate watched being outplayed by Wharton in Palace’s 4-0 thrashing of Manchester United this month – is expected to be part of the final squad after featuring in friendlies against Brazil and Belgium in March. It could come down to a straight fight between Wharton and Liverpool’s Curtis Jones, who has yet to win a senior cap but was in the team of the tournament when England Under-21s were crowned European champions last year. “We need to see some of the younger guys. They’ve had good seasons and we can learn more about them,” said Southgate, a former Palace captain, when asked on Tuesday about his midfield options. “They are the best players at this moment to fulfil the roles that we are talking about.” Much of the credit for Wharton’s rapid progression must go to Glasner, the Austrian who has implemented an exciting system that relies heavily on Wharton’s metronomic passing ability from deep positions. Not since 1991 when Graham Taylor selected Nigel Martyn, Geoff Thomas, John Salako and Ian Wright for an end‐of‐season tour to Australia and New Zealand have four Palace players been in the same England squad. Mitchell can consider himself unfortunate not to have made it five this time after being capped twice in 2022 and excelling as a left wing‐back since Glasner’s arrival. Steve Coppell’s Palace had finished third in the old First Division in 1991 but sold Wright to the champions, Arsenal, a few months later and slipped to 10th, before relegation the following season. This time around the chairman, Steve Parish, will be delighted to see the praise being lavished on the club’s excellent recruitment record, all four players having been signed for relatively modest fees. Henderson, who cost an initial £15m from Manchester United in August, has a strong case to be included in the final 26-man squad by the deadline on 7 June after playing well since being handed his opportunity at Palace because of an injury to another England goalkeeper, Sam Johnstone. Guéhi, the defender who has returned from three months out just in time and proved his versatility by playing in midfield against Villa, will fancy his chances of forcing his way into England’s starting lineup having won nine caps under Southgate and been part of the Under-17 World Cup-winning side along with Phil Foden in 2017. As for Eze, who ended the season in sparkling form and won his first senior caps last year, making the cut would be particularly poignant. Three years ago, the attacking midfielder discovered he was part of Southgate’s provisional squad for the postponed Euro 2020 immediately after injuring an achilles during a Palace training session and being ruled out for several months. Now he and England’s other Eagles have their opportunity to take flight. - The Guardian Charles Leclerc took pole position for Ferrari at the Monaco Grand Prix and ended Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen's bid for a record-extending ninth straight pole on Saturday, The Associated Press reported. Verstappen, who shares the F1 record with the late Ayrton Senna, starts Sunday's race from sixth place for Red Bull on arguably the most difficult track for overtaking in the series. Leclerc secured his third pole in four years at Monaco, where he grew up overlooking the start-finish line, and took his career total to 24 poles. He finished .154 seconds ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri and .248 clear of Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. McLaren's Lando Norris qualified fourth ahead of Mercedes driver George Russell. “Really, really happy about the lap,” Leclerc said. “I know more often than not that qualifying is not everything in the race.” Leclerc took pole in 2021, but could not start due to a gearbox problem. He led from pole in 2022 until Ferrari made an incorrect call to change his tires. Verstappen won the race from pole last year but will be hard pushed to win his sixth race of the season. But Leclerc is well set to end his run of nearly two years without a win, dating to July 2022 at the Austrian GP. “I just need a good launch (from the start),” said Leclerc, who has won five F1 races in his career. Traffic forced a couple of drivers to swerve around other cars struggling for space on Monaco's tight and sinewy 3.3-kilometer (two-mile) street circuit. Spanish veteran Fernando Alonso narrowly avoided a piece of debris just before heading into the tunnel section during Q1, the first part of qualifying. Alonso failed to make it into Q2 and so did Red Bull's Sergio Perez, who muttered an expletive on race radio. He is out of contract at the end of the season and Red Bull has yet to confirm he will get a seat for 2025. Norris only just squeezed into Q2, but then found his rhythm. Women's basketball sensation Caitlin Clark drilled a dagger three-pointer to help the Indiana Fever notch their first win of her debut WNBA season Friday, 78-73 over the Los Angeles Sparks. Clark, whose record-setting exploits in collegiate basketball brought unprecedented attention to the women's game, has struggled since Indiana made her the number one pick in the NBA draft. She endured another tough shooting night on Friday, but finished with her first WNBA double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds -- and provided the kind of fireworks her fans have come to expect. After Rickea Jackson had cut the Sparks' deficit to three with a big three-pointer with 2:27 to play, Clark answered with her first three-pointer of the night, AFP reported. Los Angeles had pulled within two when Clark hit another three-pointer with 40.5 seconds remaining that put Indiana up 76-71 and effectively snuffed out the Sparks' challenge. She had eight assists and four steals to help Indiana erase an 11-point halftime deficit. Clark and the Fever had opened the season with five straight defeats. Even so, her drawing power remained undeniable and the crowd of 19,103 at Crypto.com Arena was a record for the Sparks. Kelsey Mitchell scored 18 points to lead Indiana with Aliyah Boston and Temi Fagbenle adding 17 points apiece. The Sparks lineup also boasted some of the WNBA's newest stars in second draft pick Cameron Brink and fourth-pick Jackson. Center Dearica Hamby led the Sparks with 18 points and 12 rebounds while Brink added 15 points and nine rebounds and Jackson scored 16 points off the bench. Last in the majors in home runs last season, the Cleveland Guardians are showing their power resurgence. José Ramírez started a run of three straight homers in the fourth inning of Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Angels as the Guardians became the first team in the majors this season to go back-to-back-to-back. On the next pitch, Josh Naylor chased Patrick Sandoval with a drive into the bleachers in right-center for his 13th of the season, which is tied for seventh. Jose Suarez came in for Sandoval. But two pitches in, David Fry drove a fastball into the Guardians’ bullpen in left field. The homer onslaught came with two outs and extended the Guardians' lead to 9-2. “It's a unique emotion. It's very fun for the team and I'm glad we got to share in that,” Ramírez said through an interpreter after Cleveland won 10-4 to extend its winning streak to seven. The three homers came in the span of four pitches, The AP reported. With four homers on the night, Cleveland has 58 on the season, tied for ninth in MLB. They had 124 all of last season. “Val (hitting coach Chris Valaika) and the hitting group challenged our guys starting over the winter on impacting the ball more, taking your shots and knowing what pitches you can drive,” manager Stephen Vogt said. “It's OK to swing and miss early in the count. Our guys have responded and taken pride in that. And fortunately we're hitting some homers.” After Andrés Giménez got aboard with a base hit, Ramírez followed with a two-run shot to center for his second homer of the game. It was the 24th multihomer game of Ramírez's career and first since last July. The homer was Ramírez's 14th of the season, tied for fifth in the majors. With four RBIs in the first four innings, he moved past Atlanta's Marcell Ozuna for the MLB lead with 49. “It's a combination of having a good plan, being able to execute and getting the results. That's what's working for me right now,” Ramírez said. It's the first time Cleveland has had three straight homers since June 18, 2019, at Texas. “It's pretty cool. Everyone in the dugout was fired up,” Fry said. “Let's have another good at-bat and luckily I snuck it inside the bullpen.” Coincidentally, the Angels were also the last team to allow a team to go deep three straight times. The Texas Rangers had three straight solo shots against the Halos on Sept. 25, 2023.",

He details the secret sauce behind the homegrown brand which burst onto the scene in 1972 when India’s consumer sector was dominated by Western multinationals during the pre-economic liberalization era. Piramal is an ardent advocate of the free market and hails Bharat’s robust growth in the past decade, buoyed by widespread reforms of the tax code. He singles out the government’s “Make in India” scheme, which was launched in 2014 to take on Asia’s economic powerhouse: China. Piramal is optimistic about India’s emergence on the world stage in 2047 – known as “Amrit Kaal,” or “The Era of Elixir” – in the centenary year of Bharat gaining freedom from colonial British rule.",

        "description": "Autism is often a huge challenge for a family. About 85% of children diagnosed before age 5 will never be able to live independently as adults.",
        "content": "Autism is often a huge challenge for a family. About 85% of children diagnosed before age 5 will never be able to live independently as adults. This increasingly common developmental disorder is expressed by problems socializing and communicating, and repetitive and restrictive behaviors. A recent study reported by UC San Diego Today shows how digestion affects brain development. “Behavior and metabolism are linked – you cannot separate them,” says Robert Naviaux, professor in the Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics and Pathology at UCSD School of Medicine. There are large differences in the metabolic profiles of kids who are neurotypical and those who develop autism. UCSD researchers investigated 50 separate biochemiocal pathways. They found that “14 were responsible for 80 percent of the metabolic impact of autism,” according to UC San Diego Today. “The pathways that were most changed are related to the cell danger response, a natural and universal cellular reaction to injury or metabolic stress. “The body has biochemical safeguards in place that can shut down the cell danger response once the threat has passed, and Naviaux hypothesizes that autism occurs when these safeguards fail to develop normally. The result is heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and this effect contributes to sensory sensitivities and other symptoms associated with autism.” There’s been a dramatic increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism — now clinically referred to as ASD, autism spectrum disorder — since the 1960s. In the 1980s, quacks and personal injury attorneys attributed the growing number of autism diagnoses to childhood vaccinations. Bogus lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers were so costly that some lifesaving vaccines became unavailable. Congressional action in 1986 ended that emerging public health crisis. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program shielded pharmaceutical companies from these lawsuits. The public has since paid the bill — about $5 billion! — any time a jury awards compensation to a “victim” of vaccinations. So, if not vaccines, what accounts for the large rise in ASD? Most of the change is due to greater awareness of the diseases that are now grouped together as autism spectrum disorder. It was not until 1994 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) categorized autism as a spectrum; and not until 2013 that the term autism spectrum disorder was coined, combining what had been a variety of diagnoses. According to autism researcher Christina Corsello of the University of North Carolina, “Those revisions have allowed us to capture and include children who might have more mild difficulties, more subtle difficulties and less comorbid cognitive delays or intellectual disability.” In the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the percentage of Black children diagnosed with ASD. Almost all of that can be attributed to better awareness among physicians and more widespread access to autism specialists. “As recently as 2010, white kids were deemed 30% more likely to be diagnosed with autism than Black children and 50% more likely than Hispanic children,” according to a 2023 Associated Press article. These numbers have largely reversed. “The new estimates suggest that about 3% of Black, Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander children have an autism diagnosis, compared with about 2% of white kids,” according to the AP story. Genetics plays a large role in autism . But another important factor in whether a child will be diagnosed with ASD is maternal obesity. “Compared with children whose mothers were at normal weight, children born to overweight and obese mothers have a 28% and 36% higher risk of developing ASD, respectively,” according to a 2016 study published in Nature . Americans are much more likely to be overweight or obese now than they were in the 1960s. According to a 2011 CDC study, in 1960-62, 24% of white women had a body mass index greater than or equal to 27.3, putting them in the overweight category. That rose to 46% during 2005-08. For Black women, the numbers rose from 42% overweight or obese (1960-62) to 66% (2005-08). “Based on data collected between 2017 and 2020, 41.9% of adults in the U.S. have obesity,” Forbes Health reported earlier this year. Children born to mothers who are obese and diabetic are “more than four times as likely to develop autism compared to children born to normal weight mothers without diabetes,” according to research published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Even though autism does not present itself when a baby is born, there is increasing science that the disorder starts in utero. During the second trimester of a pregnancy, organization of the cortex begins. Autopsies of autistic children who have died reveal patches of disorganization in the cortex, harming cells that are needed for learning and memory. “So something must have gone wrong at or before that time,” Eric Courchesne, director of the Autism Center of Excellence at UCSD, told NPR. In a neurotypical child, the cortex will have six distinct layers, each composed of a specific cell type. However, in kids with ASD, Courchesne says, “there are patches in which specific cells in specific layers seem to be missing.” Rather than distinct layers, the brain cells appear as disorganized collections. Going forward, researchers hope to find effective treatments that, if given before symptoms appear, will perhaps fix the cortex, prevent autism or reduce its severity. That gets back to the research done by Dr. Naviaux and his colleagues, including Chelsea A. Kelland and Judy Van de Water at UC Davis. They are studying the use of a drug called suramin. When a child’s cell danger response malfunctions, they hope suramin can repair the body’s adenosine triphosphate (ATP) signals, eliminating an autistic child’s heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli. At the same time, if we can tackle the obesity epidemic, we’d make a lot of progress in reducing ASD. — Rich Rifkin is a Davis resident; his column is published every other week.

        "content": "Temperatures rose above 52 degrees Celsius (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh, the highest reading of the summer and close to the country’s record high amid an ongoing heatwave, the met office said on Monday. Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters. The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers. But with the current heatwave, shops are seeing almost no footfall. \"The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,\" Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town. \"I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.\" Close to Ali's shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop's shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water. “Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,” Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, said at a news conference on Friday adding that the government is running awareness campaigns due to the heatwaves. The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54 C (129.2 F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said Sardar Sarfaraz, Chief Meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological Department The heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in Sindh, including the capital, Karachi - Pakistan's largest city. Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard (180 meter) hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Tom Kopke from Munich, Germany won one of the three men's races. He said attitude was more important than technique. \"You start and then the adrenaline takes over and you just go, go go,\" Kopke said. \"Look at this event, look at this hill,\" added the muddy, breathless winner. \"England is mad. I love it.\" Local competitor Josh Shepherd and Dylan Twiss from Perth, Australia won the other two men's downhill races. Abby Lampe from North Carolina triumphed in the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. \"You just have to roll,\" said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. \"There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.\" Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) over a 240-yard (220-meter) course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. A volcano on the remote Indonesian island of Halmahera erupted on Monday spewing a grey ash cloud six kms (four miles) into the sky, the country's volcanology agency said, adding it had issued a warning for aviation authorities managing local flights. This follows a series of eruptions this month after authorities noticed an uptick of volcanic activity since April, leading to evacuations of people from seven nearby villages. \"The ash column is seen to be thick and grey and moving westward,\" the agency said, adding the eruption occurred at 3 a.m. local time (7 p.m. GMT) and recommending that a seven-km (4.35-mile) radius be cleared. Footage shared by the agency on Monday showed the volcano spewing ash that grew thicker and eventually obscured it. The agency also issued a \"red\" color code warning to local aviation authorities on Monday, the highest of its kind due to ash exceeding six kms in height, its website stated. It previously raised the alert level of the volcano to the highest on its scale on May 16. Ibu's activities follow a series of eruptions of different volcanoes in Indonesia, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" and has 127 active volcanoes. Flash floods and cold lava flow from Mount Marapi, one of the most active in West Sumatra province, covered several nearby districts following torrential rain on May 11, killing at least 62 people with 10 people still missing. In recent weeks North Sulawesi's Ruang volcano has erupted, spewing incandescent lava. The eruption prompted authorities to evacuate more than 12,000 people on a nearby island. Pilgrims arriving in Saudi Arabia for this year’s Hajj season will benefit from a well-organized transportation system. The system ensures pilgrims safe and comfortable travel between Makkah and Medina, enhancing their spiritual journey. In the past, pilgrims traveled between Makkah and Madinah on camelback, a journey that took almost 10 days. Now, with cars and buses, it’s down to about 6 hours. But with the “Haramain High Speed Railway,” pilgrims can make the trip in just 135 minutes. Once on board, pilgrims have everything they need for a comfortable journey, allowing them to focus on their worship and prayers. The railway project, one of the largest in the Middle East, is providing around 1.6 million seats on 3,800 trips for pilgrims and visitors this Hajj season. The train stations in Makkah and Madinah are conveniently located near the holy sites. With a capacity for 60 million passengers a year and speeds of up to 300 kilometers per hour, the railway meets the increasing demand for transportation services. At the train stations in the al-Sulaymaniyah district and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Asharq Al-Awsat observed smooth passenger traffic. Local staff warmly welcomed the pilgrims, assisting them with inquiries and guiding them to departure lounges while informing them of train schedules. Passenger journeys start with quick procedures, checking reservations and luggage allowances. Passengers then move to the departure lounge and to their seats, which are comfortable with individual screens. The train provides services for business class and support for passengers with special needs. Operations run with 35 electric trains, each carrying up to 417 passengers. These trains have 13 carriages, five for business class and eight for economy, all equipped with food vending carts. Many travelers praised the top-notch care they received upon arriving in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the Haramain High Speed Railway. The pilgrims appreciated the “excellent and outstanding” services that made traveling between the two holy cities easier. E-services let travelers book early, check schedules, and choose departure stations. The smooth running of train journeys and punctual schedules across different stations show how well the teams manage the numerous daily trips along the electric railway track. Stations are located in Makkah, Madinah, al-Sulaymaniyah district, King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, and King Abdullah Economic City station in the Rabigh governorate. The stations’ architectural design is inspired by the landmarks of Makkah and Madinah, reflecting their Islamic and unique architectural styles. The stations offer various traveler services like parking, e-booking, ticket counters, and assistance desks. The station at King Abdulaziz International Airport is the world’s largest airport-connected train station, covering over 105,000 square meters with multiple floors and six platforms, making it easy for travelers heading to Makkah or Madinah. Since its launch in 2018, the Haramain High Speed Railway’s success has made booking, scheduling, and travel between the holy sites easier for a growing number of passengers. Built with high-quality standards and safety features, the train plays a crucial role in Saudi Arabia’s railway network development and expansion plan. In a cowshed in Gaza's Khan Yunis, zookeeper Fathi Ahmed Gomaa has created a temporary home for dozens of animals including lions and baboons, having fled with them from Israel's offensive in Rafah. \"We've moved all the animals we had, except for three big lions that remain (in Rafah)\", he told Agence France Presse. \"I ran out of time and couldn't move them.\" Ahmed abandoned his zoo in Rafah when Israel ordered the evacuation of parts of the southern Gazan city. Before the offensive, the city on the border with Egypt had been spared a ground invasion and more than half of the Gaza Strip's population was sheltering there. \"I am appealing to the Israeli authorities: these animals have no connection to terrorism\", Gomaa told AFP, saying he wanted their help in coordinating with aid agencies to rescue the lions left behind in Rafah. He fears they won't survive long on their own. \"Of course, within a week or 10 days, if we don't get them out they will die because they'll be left with no food or water.\" Gomaa said he had already lost several of his animals to the war. \"Three lion cubs, five monkeys, a newborn monkey and nine squirrels,\" he said. And while the squawking of parrots fills the air, many of Gomaa's other birds are no longer with him. \"I released some of the dogs, some of the hawks and eagles, some of the pigeons and some of the ornamental birds. I released a lot of them because we didn't have cages to transport them.\" In the cowshed, Gomaa is making do with what he has, using improvised fencing to raise the heights of the pens so that their new inhabitants, spotted deer, can't leap out. The Soudah Development Company, a subsidiary of the Public Investment Fund, announced the birth of three ibexes in the \"Red Rock\" area within King Abdullah National Park in Soudah. These new arrivals follow the release of 23 ibexes into the natural areas last year in collaboration with the National Center for Wildlife (NCW) as part of the company's initiative to release endangered animals and the center's program to breed and re-localize wildlife species, reported the Saudi Press Agency on Sunday. Previously, the NCW released two mothers who recently gave birth to the ibexes in the \"Red Rock\" area. The third mother, approximately two years old, was born in an enclosed area before being released into the project area in February 2023 and recently gave birth in the park, contributing to the increase in ibex numbers within the protected area. Currently, Soudah Development Company is monitoring nine ibexes and providing a suitable environment for them to live in the park's \"Red Rock\" area. CEO of Soudah Development Company, Eng. Saleh Al-Oraini, stressed that these births represent a significant step towards re-localizing endangered species and enhancing ecosystems in the region. He also highlighted the company's steadfast commitment to the goals of the Saudi Green Initiative and its contribution to the sustainability of the local environment and biodiversity in the Soudah Peaks. In a Beirut car park, migrant workers cheer as their teams face off in a cricket tournament, a moment of respite in crisis-hit Lebanon, where working conditions are often tough. \"Sunday we are so happy... We eat together, we laugh together,\" said cricketer Pradeepa Silva, a 42-year-old Sri Lankan, as she and her teammates prepared coconut rice and other traditional food nearby to share. \"Work is very tiring\" and workers are stressed and worried, said Silva, who is employed as a housemaid six days a week and pays for her daughter's university studies back home. Every Sunday, players mainly from Sri Lanka but also from the Philippines, India and Pakistan gather in Beirut's Ashrafieh neighborhood to play cricket -- a little-known sport in Lebanon. Migrant workers are employed under Lebanon's controversial \"kafala\" sponsorship system, which rights groups have repeatedly denounced saying that it enables a wide range of abuses. On May 19, several hundred people gathered for a tournament that also brought together traditional food stalls, a DJ playing Bollywood hits and other music, teams from the British and Sri Lankan embassies and young Syrian refugee players. Iris Sagario from the Philippines ran onto the field for the Roaring Lions women's team, wearing an orange and blue shirt with her name printed on the back. \"I love cricket,\" said the 43-year-old, who works as a housekeeper. \"I'm very excited to play every Sunday\" -- her only day off. After winning their match, Sagario's team broke out into cheers, hugging and high-fiving each other. They went on to take the women's trophy. - 'Lord's of Lebanon' - More than 160,000 migrants from 84 nationalities were in Lebanon last year, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration. With daily bombardment in south Lebanon as Hezbollah and the Israeli army clash amid tensions over the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, some foreign embassies have advised their nationals to leave the country. \"At first I was worried\" but \"my sir (employer) assured me that all is good,\" said Sagario, who was also in Lebanon in 2006, when Israel and Hezbollah last went to war. \"I'm choosing to stay because... I don't know what I'll do if I go back to the Philippines. I want to give financial (help) to my family,\" she said. Curious passersby sometimes peered over a tumbledown stone wall to watch the matches. Organizer Fernando Sugath, 52, from Sri Lanka said some players nicknamed the car park they have been using for around two decades \"Lord's of Lebanon\", a reference to the famous Lord's cricket ground in London, which is known as the \"home of cricket\". Matches in the car park were halted for five years when the players lost access to the site but resumed in 2022, Sugath said. His team changed its name to the Saint Joseph Cricket Club in honor of the neighboring church that helped them return to the site. - 'Let them have some freedom' - Migrant workers at the cricket match \"are very lucky that they've got some good employers who give them the Sunday off\", said Sugath, who first came to Lebanon in 1996 as a cleaner and is now an administrative assistant. Rights groups have long criticized Lebanon's restrictive sponsorship system, saying it facilitates exploitation and leaves migrant workers at the mercy of their employers, amid persistent reports of physical and sexual abuse, unpaid wages and long work hours. Sugath appealed to all employers to give workers \"at least one hour, two hours off on Sunday... Let them have some freedom, let them use the phone, call their families\". As the men's competition kicked off, big hitters began smashing the ball into the trees lining the car park as fielders scrambled for a catch. Majid Satti, 39, from Pakistan, captains the Eleven Brothers team -- with five players from Pakistan and six from India -- which came runner-up in the men's tournament. Their two countries have long had a strained relationship, but \"we have no issue... we are all like brothers here,\" said Satti, a concierge who has been in Lebanon for 15 years. Vice-captain Raju Singh, 41, from India, said the players \"never think about\" politics. An electrician by trade, Singh wore his team's traditional cricket whites, with long white trousers and shoes, and was among those in charge of the coin toss to decide which teams would field or bat first. The Lebanese 500 lira coin he used, valued until 2019 at around 35 US cents, is now worth less than a single cent following Lebanon's economic collapse, during which some migrant workers were abandoned by their employers and others pushed to leave the country. Singh said he loved cricket and travelled almost 30 kilometers (20 miles) each week for the Sunday games. \"When we finish (and) we go home, we are waiting for next Sunday,\" he said. The \"abab\" plant, also known as \"Saudi ginseng\" or \"ashwagandha\", has returned after a 20-year absence in the deserts of the Northern Borders Region, the Saudi Press Agency said on Sunday. This evergreen shrub with yellow flowers has reemerged, alongside other wild plants. In an interview with SPA, Director of the Amana Environmental Association in the region Nasser Rashid Al-Majlad, said that the area's rich green wealth presents economic opportunities. By utilizing natural plant resources, the region can enhance biodiversity, combat desertification, expand green spaces, promote tourism, and foster human development. Al-Majlad said that these efforts align with the principles of the green economy, which aims to strike a balance between economic and environmental needs for the benefit of both humanity and the planet. Khonaysser Al-Anazi, a plant enthusiast, said the abab plants on the outskirts of Arar city reappeared due to increased rainfall and the expansion of green areas. He highlighted the potential for cultivation and utilization of these plants for various purposes. The estimated number of wolves in France last year was 1,003, down nine percent from the year before, environmental associations said earlier this week, urging the French government to lower its quota for the number of the animals which can be killed each year. The drop in the predator's population is the first in almost ten years, according to loupfrance.fr, a site managed by France’s biodiversity authority. \"This new estimate reinforces the finding that the species' conservation status is not good,\" the six conservation groups wrote. The current quota allows for 19 percent of the French wolf population to be legally killed. But an administrative source close to the matter —- who confirmed the 1,003 figure —- told AFP that current hunting limits would be maintained, allowing for \"209 wolves\" to be culled, AFP reported. The percentage is \"based on the estimated population at the end of the winter, which was 1,104,\" said the source, asking not to be named. The number of wolf attacks is also on the rise, added the source. For their part, agricultural groups argue culling nearly one-fifth of the predator's population is still too low to prevent what they say is a growing number of attacks on livestock. Wolves had vanished from France but began returning in the 1990s, with farmers saying they suffered 12,000 attacks on their animals in 2022. \"For 2024, we're expecting to see an increase in the number of reports and victims,\" said a representative for France's sheep farmers group, Claude Font. \"If we hold at 19 percent of the estimated wolf population, we're not going to stop the number of sheep being killed,\" he said, calling for political action at the highest level to increase the percentage. But for League of the Protection of Birds (LPO) president Allain Bougrain-Dubourg, \"wolves are being sacrificed on the altar of agricultural demagoguery\". In addition to authorised hunting, \"we're seeing an upsurge in poaching and poisoning\", he told AFP. The National Wolf Group (GNL) meeting, scheduled for Friday, will bring together environmentalists, elected officials, civil servants, the agricultural industry, and hunters. But several environmental groups pulled out of the organisation in September 2023, deeming the government's 2024-2029 wolf plan \"unacceptable\". The proposition calls for increased support for farmers dealing with livestock loss from wolf attacks, simplified population culling, and an overhaul of the current counting system, which is an estimate drawn up by France's biodiversity authority. The wolf is categorised as \"strictly protected\" in the European Union, but France's new plan raises the possibility of reviewing the animal's status. In September 2023, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned that \"the concentration of wolf packs in some European regions has become a real danger for livestock and potentially also for humans\". For conservation groups, however, the dip in the wolf population is a clear sign that efforts to protect the predator are falling short. The government must \"stop advocating downgrading the species’ level of protection\". Germany's health minister, Karl Lauterbach, plans to introduce stricter rules to curb the sale of nitrous oxide, sometimes known as laughing gas, especially to young people. The drug, which is used in medicine as an anaesthetic and for pain reduction, has become a particularly popular party drug among young people in Germany. The sale and consumption of nitrous oxide is not restricted under current law, dpa reported. \"We will come up with a regulation quickly,\" Lauterbach told public broadcaster ARD on Friday. Among the possibilities is including nitrous oxide in the list of psychoactive substances, which come with very strict rules for sale and possession. He said that a complete ban would not be possible because nitrous oxide is used for industrial purposes as well. \"We are now tackling this very quickly,\" assured the minister. Until the government takes action, Lauterbach recommended that parents educate their children: \"It may sound fun and harmless, but it's not,\" the minister warned. Regular consumption could lead to accidents or even neurological damage, and permanent damage cannot be ruled out either, he said. \"It's very dangerous for children and young people,\" said Lauterbach. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Britain in small boats so far this year, updated government data showed on Saturday, underlining a key challenge facing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ahead of a July 4 national election. The number of people landing on England's southern beaches after making the dangerous Channel crossing fell by a third in 2023, but the latest numbers on a government website showed 10,170 arrived between January and May 25, up from 7,395 over the same period last year. Sunak, who announced the election date on Wednesday, said later this week that asylum seekers who come to Britain illegally would not be deported to Rwanda before the vote - casting doubt on one of his Conservative Party's flagship policies, Reuters reported. The plan has been bogged down by legal obstacles for more than two years, and the opposition Labor Party, which is about 20 points ahead in opinion polls and seen on track to end 14 years of Conservative rule, has promised to scrap the policy if it wins the election. Labor's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said Sunak's government had not done enough to tackle the issue. \"Because all the government's efforts are now focused on getting a few hundred people flown to Rwanda, they have lost sight of the thousands more who are crossing the Channel every month,\" Kinnock said in a statement. Labor has said if elected it would create a Border Security Command that would bring together staff from the police, the domestic intelligence agency and prosecutors to work with international agencies to stop people smuggling.",

        "description": "With June right around the corner, Quebec residents should prepare to receive a set of new benefits and credit payments from both the Government of Canada and Retraite Québec.Inflation is high and the cost of living in Quebec is soaring, so it's no surprise that many residents are looking for ways to earn extra money, whether through work or financial assistance programs from the Canadian and Quebec governments. A few of the benefits being paid out in June include the Canada Child Benefit, Quebec Pension Plan and Quebec public-sector pensions.It's important to verify your eligibility for many of the benefits and credits being sent out this month, as you could be entitled to thousands of dollars. Here are six government benefits and credits to look out for: Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)The Québec Pension Plan (QPP) is a mandatory public insurance plan for workers aged 18 and over with annual employment income exceeding $3500, providing basic financial protection in retirement, death, or disability, according to Retraite Québec. The QPP, similar to the Canada Pension Plan, consists of a base and an additional plan since 2019. The additional plan raises the income replacement rate from 25% to 33.33% and increases the maximum pensionable salary to 114% of the maximum pensionable earnings by 2025. In 2024, contributions to the QPP are 10.8% for the base plan and 8% for the additional plan, both split equally between employers and employees, while self-employed workers cover both portions. All contributions are collected by Revenu Québec.Payment Date: June 28More about the Quebec Pension PlanCanada Pension Plan (CPP)The CPP retirement pension is a monthly, taxable benefit that partially replaces your income upon retirement and is payable for life if you qualify, the Canada Revenue Agency indicates. To be eligible, you must be at least 60 years old and have made at least one valid contribution to the CPP, either through work in Canada or via credits from a former spouse or common-law partner. In 2024, the maximum monthly amount at age 65 is $1,364.60, while the average monthly amount for new retirees at that age in January 2024 was $831.92. The exact amount you can receive depends on your individual circumstances.Payment Date: June 26More about the Canada Pension PlanOld Age Security (OAS)The Old Age Security pension is a monthly payment available to Canadians aged 65 and older. Service Canada may automatically enroll you if sufficient information is available, notifying you of your enrollment status. If not automatically enrolled, you may need to apply after turning 64. Employment history does not affect eligibility, so you can receive OAS even if you have never worked or are still working. To qualify, you must be a Canadian citizen or legal resident, have resided in Canada for at least 10 years since turning 18 if living in Canada, or for at least 20 years if living outside Canada.Canadians aged 65 to 74 years can receive up to $713.34 per month, while those aged 75 and up can receive $784.67. Payment Date: June 26More about Old Age SecurityCanada Child Benefit (CCB)The Canada Child Benefit, administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, is a tax-free monthly payment to help eligible families with the cost of raising children under 18. It may include the child disability benefit and related provincial and territorial programs. To qualify, you must live with a child under 18, be primarily responsible for their care, be a Canadian resident for tax purposes, and you or your spouse must meet specific residency or citizenship criteria. If your adjusted family net income (AFNI) is under $34,863, you receive the maximum amount: $7,437 annually ($619.75 monthly) per child under six years of age, and $6,275 annually ($522.91 monthly) per child aged six to 17.Payment Date: June 20More about the Canada Child BenefitVeteran Disability PensionThe Veteran Disability benefit is a tax-free financial payment supporting the well-being of those with service-related conditions. The amount depends on the severity of a condition and its impact on quality of life, per the CRA. Eligibility includes Canadian Armed Forces members or veterans, RCMP members, WWII or Korean War veterans, and certain WWII civilians. Applicants must have a diagnosed condition linked to their service. Benefits include the Pain and Suffering Compensation, available as a lifetime monthly benefit or lump sum, and the Disability Pension, which provides a lifetime monthly benefit with increased amounts for dependents.Payment Date: June 27More about the Veteran Disability PensionPublic-sector Pension Plan (RREGOP, RRPE)The Government and Public Employees Retirement Plan (RREGOP), mandates contributions from regular and casual, full-time and part-time employees in the education, public service, and health and social services sectors until they accrue a maximum of 40 years of credited service or until December 30 of the year they turn 69. The plan uses years of service for both pension calculation and eligibility, with full-time work throughout the year equating to a full year of credited service, and part-time work calculated proportionally. In 2024, the contribution rate is 9.39%, with contributions required on pensionable salaries exceeding certain thresholds based on the maximum pensionable earnings (MPE) and adjusted for credited or harmonized service.For those who collect a pension and opt for direct deposit, the public-sector retirement pension will be paid on the 15th of each month for the rest of your life, per Retraite Quebec. If the 15th falls on a weekend or statutory holiday, your pension will be paid on the preceding business day. If you opted for payment by cheque, then.the payment will be issued no later than 48 hours before that date.Payment Date: June 14More about the public-sector pension in QuebecThe full list of Revenu Quebec benefits and credits can be found here, as well as details about eligibility, payment dates and amounts.

        "content": "Home | Bhadradri Kothagudem | Issue Of Violation Of Traditions In Bhadradri Lord Rama Kalyanotsavam To The Fore Again Issue of violation of traditions in Bhadradri Lord Rama Kalyanotsavam to the fore again Hearing the petitions Justice NV Shravan Kumar in an order dated April 15, 2024 directed the principal secretary of the Endowment Department to constitute a five-member committee to verify the spiritual customs, traditions and sthalapuranam. By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 09:26 PM Bhadrachalam (Kothagudem): The issue of improper addressing of Lord Rama as Ramanarayana during religious rituals at Bhadradri Temple has come to the fore again. Three writ petitions were filed by Kancherla Venkata Ramana, GTV Manindhar and Jamalapurapu Srinivas Rao as Endowments Department, Commissioner of Endowments, Kothagudem district Collector, Sri Seetha Ramachandra Swamy Devasthanam Executive Officer and the chief priest of the temple the parties regarding the issue. Hearing the petitions Justice NV Shravan Kumar in an order dated April 15, 2024 directed the principal secretary of the Endowment Department to constitute a five-member committee to verify the spiritual customs, traditions and sthalapuranam. The committee was also directed to verify what was the Gothram and Pravara revered during Kalyanotsavam before 2012 and after. In view of the above development the temple Executive Officer L Rama Devi issued a circular on May 25 asking the templesthanacharya, 21 priests including, the chief priest, deputy chief priests,priests and nine vedic pundits to submit a report regarding the matter by May 26 to submit the same before the Endowment Commissioner by May 28. The contention of the petitioners was inappropriate recital of the Pravara (Invocation of the illustrious ancestors) and Gothram (Clan/original ancestor) of the principal deities of the temple during the performance of the annual celestial wedding (Kalyanam) of Lord Sri Rama and Seetha on Sri Rama Navami. The priests were now reciting/chanting the nameof Lord Ramaas “Rama Narayana” instead of “Ramchandra Swamy” during the Sankalpam. Further the traditional practice of reciting “Ramachandra swamine Varaya” has been replaced with “Ramanarayana Swamine Varaya”, the petitioners said. It might be recalled that on 17 April, 2019 the members of Bhadradri Parirakshana Samithi launched a signature campaign against alleged violation of religious traditions by the priests at the historic Sri Seetha Ramachandra Swamy Devasthanam.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by Jennifer Sunday, David Castle, George Poulakidas and Mary I. O'Connor, The Conversation From massive kelp forests to monumental old-growth on land, British Columbia's biodiversity—which is unrivaled in Canada—provides an array of cultural, economic, social and other benefits . B.C.'s wide-ranging ecological zones are home to over 70 percent of Canada's mammal, bird and non-vascular plant species. The province is ostensibly proud of having a healthy environment, with its mottos \"Splendor without Diminishment\" and \"Beautiful British Columbia\" promoting its natural beauty. Yet despite this awareness, the province is hindered by a fragmented approach to biodiversity management. B.C. possesses considerable knowledge resources with a wealth of top biodiversity scientists, biodiversity-based industries and leading conservation organizations. It is also home to more than 200 First Nations with traditional knowledge systems closely tied with nature. However, current conservation initiatives lack coordination and there is no independent organization or provincial governing body overseeing the many actions underway. This must change. The lack of coordination in B.C. makes it difficult to obtain a clear picture of ecosystem health across the province. This murky picture has negative implications for efforts to quantify, forecast and adjust to biodiversity changes—with further knock-on repercussions for efforts to hold people and organizations accountable for infractions. For example, when a species is listed on Canada's Species at Risk Act , the first step for legislated action by the province is to map locations of habitats that are necessary for the species' recovery. But, in part due to poor biodiversity inventories and low engagement across sectors , this information has been regularly delayed, by an average of 9.8 years . This is a costly time frame for an endangered species. We cannot manage what we do not monitor and this challenge will only get worse as climate change shifts the range of many species . Biodiversity work in B.C. is currently being performed by a passionate and engaged group of stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations, academics, First Nations, local interest groups, federal and provincial agents as well as private consultancies. The breadth of work is vast and, despite having so many different groups involved, the goals are often aligned. Yet despite having similar goals, shared methods and the potential for combining knowledge across projects, fragmentation across individuals and groups persists. The fragmented nature of B.C. biodiversity work is a missed opportunity that can lead to gaps and blind spots that ultimately undermine action. Potential interconnected threats like diseases, invasive species, ecological impacts of new developments and a range of other issues may be missed. Biodiversity loss is too important to be detected by chance; it should be monitored in a systematic, open and inclusive way. New technologies are vastly increasing our capacity to monitor biodiversity. Advances in environmental genomics and the discovery that organisms leave traces of their DNA in the environment means biodiversity now can be assessed from samples of water , soil and even the air . NGOs, Indigenous stewards and conservation groups in B.C. are already using environmental DNA (fragments of DNA floating freely in the environment) to track biodiversity change . Remote automatic cameras deployed in a network can quickly and continuously record the distribution of certain species . What's more, the data from these cameras can be processed quickly using community science web-based platforms quickly using crowd-sourced knowledge and artificial intelligence . Satellite data can reveal the status of forests across the province . We are on the cusp of a deluge in biodiversity data, but data on its own is not knowledge. To translate this data into actionable insights, collaboration and coordination is key. We need to work together to share knowledge and capacity for understanding change. User-friendly platforms are needed to make the data accessible, but it is equally important to integrate it with existing knowledge held by local communities and Indigenous groups. Establishing a system of natural capital accounts would provide a clear picture of the value our ecosystems provide empowering decision-makers to understand the economic and social consequences of their choices. In December 2022, Canada hosted the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Montréal. In response to the Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework, Canada committed to protecting 30 percent of biodiversity by 2030. Canada also committed to developing a plan in response to the framework's four goals and 23 targets . Yet coordinated action is needed at the provincial level to achieve this. B.C.'s draft framework for biodiversity and ecosystem health is a positive step with its emphasis on \"connecting initiatives,\" \"providing accessible and credible data\" and \"fostering innovation, skills, and training\"—but much more work is still needed. We need a body that draws together independent expertise in biodiversity and social sciences with policymakers and interest groups. Importantly, this body would need to be transparent, track progress and provide research and synthesized information to support informed decisions. Crucially, any effort to coordinate biodiversity work in B.C. must inclusively engage with the many ongoing initiatives in the province to ensure it is adding value. We may not have to look far for an effective model. Québec recently launched Biodiversité Québec —a partnership across government, scientific and Indigenous partners—to create an integrated monitoring system for nature. Drawing inspiration from such initiatives and its own capacity, B.C. can rise to the challenge of biodiversity loss. With coordination and sustained support of expertise, B.C. can set clear goals, leverage existing initiatives, ensure efforts are aligned and results are communicated and ultimately, ensure that B.C.'s natural splendor remains undiminished.

However, there is a need to distinguish between consensual sexting and forms of sexual harassment like cyberflashing.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by Dianne Lalonde, The Conversation Sexting—sending sexually suggestive or explicit messages and images—is now a widespread practice, and can be a healthy way to express and explore sexuality. However, there is a need to distinguish between consensual sexting and forms of sexual harassment like cyberflashing. Cyberflashing refers to the act of non-consensually sending sexual imagery (like nudes or \"dick pics\") to another person. It is facilitated through communications technologies including text, AirDrop and social media applications like Snapchat and Tinder. Similar to flashing—when a person unexpectedly and deliberately \"flashes\" their genitals to others—that occurs in person, cyberflashing involves an intrusive denial of autonomy and control. It can lead to people feeling distressed, objectified and unsafe. And like flashing, which involves physical proximity to the person, cyberflashing can occur through location-specific technology like Apple's AirDrop . A cyberflasher may also access further information about the recipient online, including their name and location. Cyberflashing is often normalized and perceived as something to laugh off , but it is a form of gender-based sexual violence that must be taken seriously. My research on technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including non-consensual sexual deepfakes , highlights the need for legal and societal responses to these emerging challenges. In 2018, Statistics Canada found that 11 percent of women and six percent of men aged 15 or older were sent unwanted sexually suggestive or explicit images or messages. For young people aged 15 to 24 , that increased to 25 percent of women and 10 percent of men. Cyberflashing studies from the United States and the United Kingdom suggest higher rates of cyberflashing, with women still being the most targeted. While further intersectional data is not available for explicit images, generally women with disabilities, Indigenous women and bisexual women face a high prevalence of online harassment overall. Cyberflashing can also occur alongside further forms of violence including stalking, sexual harassment and physical threats. Violating impacts The impacts of cyberflashing are compounded by contextual factors. In one case, a fire inspector in London, Ont., sent explicit photos to women he worked with . Another factor involves location: for instance, women in Montréal received sexually explicit images while riding the Metro , while British students were cyberflashed during university lectures . A study of 2,045 women and 298 gay or bisexual men in the United States found that women reported cyberflashing as a predominantly negative experience that left them feeling grossed out, disrespected and violated. The same study found that, although gay and bisexual men received high rates of cyberflashing, they reported more positive reactions, showing how gender and sexual orientation may impact experiences of violence. It is important to situate this finding in terms of unequal gender dynamics, social expectations that men should appreciate sexual advances and a broader culture wherein incidents of sexual violence against men who have sex with men are minimized . The result of cyberflashing is women engaging in \" safety work ,\" including restricting or changing their movements and communication. Such emotional and physical labor is time-consuming and can limit women's participation in everyday life . Cyberflashing reflects and reinforces rape culture wherein sexual violence is normalized and consent is viewed as unnecessary. There is an assumption in cyberflashing that the unsolicited sexual content will be positively received despite the lack of consent. When heterosexual men were asked what reaction they hoped for from the recipient when cyberflashing , the majority of them said that they were after a positive reactions like sexual excitement and attraction. A significant minority of men, however, sought negative reactions like shock, disgust and fear. This frequent, mistaken belief from heterosexual men that there will be a positive reaction to cyberflashing may be because they are socialized to be sexually aggressive . Beyond individual cyberflashing , rape culture in society more broadly results in belittling sexual violence and victim-blaming. This is reflected in advising women to simply ignore unwanted images and in the wrongful assumption that the person must have \"asked\" to be flashed . Canada can address cyberflashing by exploring criminalization, a method already present in England, Wales, Scotland and Singapore . Criminalization of cyberflashing serves as a deterrent by making it an illegal act with potential consequences. Currently in Canada, only individuals sending sexual content to youth under 18 may face criminal charges under child luring laws if done with the intent to commit an offense such as sexual exploitation, trafficking and indecent exposure. However, criminalization is limited, given the lack of cyberflashing reporting. Survivors of sexual violence may also distrust the criminal justice system due to its harmful treatment of survivors, especially survivors who face structural oppressions including anti-Black racism and ableism. A promising alternative to criminalization is transformative justice , an approach to addressing harm that focuses on healing, community accountability and societal change. Another aspect of ending cyberflashing requires the participation of social media platforms, which can use technology, including artificial intelligence, to detect sexual content and block it unless the user decides to accept. This approach is used by Bumble's Private Detector and Instagram's Nudity Protection . Finally, there is a need for sex-positive sex and tech safety education that differentiates sexting from sexual harassment like cyberflashing. Rather than stigmatizing sexting overall, age-appropriate practices should be promoted on how to meaningfully and consensually communicate about sex.

        "content": "The European Union pledged more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Monday to support displaced Syrians, but it dismissed any notion of them being able to return home because of instability under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Before an EU-led donor conference on the 13-year-old war, Jordan's foreign minister said that the international community was abandoning Syrian refugees as funding to support them in host countries dwindles, suggesting that ways had to be found to ease voluntary returns to Syria. The EU conference aims to keep the war on the agenda, as well as support for the millions of refugees it has created. But as the economic and social burden on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions, diplomats say. Refugees returning home is not yet one of them however, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made clear at the start of the conference. \"While the European Union would wish that returning home could be a realistic option for all refugees, everywhere and always, we concur with the United Nations system that currently the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns to Syria are not in place,\" Borrell said. \"We insist that it is the Assad regime that bears the primary responsibility for putting in place these conditions.\" Borrell said the bloc was pledging 560 million euros in 2024 and 2025 to support refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and a further 1 billion euros for Türkiye. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir, amid the Israeli war in Gaza and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. Although Assad has long since reasserted control over most of Syria in a war that began with a 2011 uprising against him, more than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon, Türkiye and Jordan and millions more displaced internally still have little prospect of returning home. \"We're going to be sending a very clear message from Jordan as a host country that we feel that refugees are being abandoned,\" Ayman Safadi told reporters on arrival in Brussels. \"Host countries are being abandoned.\" Jordan is hosting around 1.3 million Syrians. Safadi said the issue \"can only be solved by them going back to their country. So, we need to focus more on creating conditions conducive for them to return voluntarily.\" Funding to support refugees is dropping with the likes of the World Food Program reducing its aid. Countries say hosting refugees is an increasing burden, notably in economic crisis-hit Lebanon, where the discontent has seen forced deportations. \"We expect our partners to uphold international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, and reject and condemn any forced deportations,\" Borrell said. The 8th Syria conference brings together European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges there are few signs that Europe can take the lead, diplomats said. The bloc has no ties with the Assad government and Monday's talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the EU's 27 member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. An upswing in migrant boat arrivals from Lebanon to Europe, with Cyprus and Italy major destinations, has prompted some EU countries to warn of a big new influx into the bloc. \"We'll continue to do everything we can. But unless we're helped, unless the international community shoulders its responsibility, there will be a decrease in services and there will be more suffering for refugees,\" Safadi said. Arab countries and organizations slammed on Monday Israel for its strikes on a center for displaced Palestinians that killed dozens near the southern city of Rafah on Sunday. The health ministry in Gaza said in a statement that the strikes \"claimed the lives of 35 martyrs and left dozens injured, most of them children and women\". The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza earlier said the attack hit a center run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees near Rafah, branding it a \"horrific massacre\". The Palestinian Authority presidency in the West Bank called it a \"heinous massacre\", accusing Israeli forces of \"deliberately targeting\" the tents of displaced people. The massacre is an act of \"defiance to all international resolutions,\" it added in a statement. Gaza's civil defense agency said Israeli strikes killed and wounded at least 50 people in the area, where it said 100,000 displaced people live. Hamas said Palestinians must \"rise up and march\" against the attack. The Israeli army said it had targeted Hamas fighters. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound in Rafah\", killing Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both senior officials for the Palestinian armed group in the occupied West Bank. It added that it was \"aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.\" Palestinians carry a body after an Israeli army raid on a camp at an area designated for displaced people in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, 27 May 2024. (EPA) Qatar said on Monday the latest Israeli attack on Rafah could hinder mediation efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal, a foreign ministry statement said. Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack, saying the Israeli forces’ actions against Palestinians \"exposes their blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world.\" \"This calls for immediate and firm intervention by the international community to compel these forces into adhering to international legitimacy resolutions, including the International Justice Court resolution on immediately ceasing the aggression against Rafah, and protecting the Palestinian people,\" it demanded in a statement. Egypt strongly condemned the attack, saying Israeli forces \"deliberately\" targeted the displaced. The Foreign Ministry said Cairo had called on Israel \"to meet its legal commitments as an occupying power\" and respect the International Court of Justice’s call on it to immediately cease its military operations. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry condemned the \"ongoing heinous war crimes committed by the Israeli forces in Gaza,\" saying the latest attack in Rafah was a \"flagrant challenge to the ICJ and grave violation of international law and international humanitarian law.\" The Arab Parliament echoed the condemnation, warning in a statement that \"failure to hold Israel to account for its crimes and massacres against the Palestinians and failure to take any deterrent measures against it will only make it commit more killings and cause more destruction.\" The Organization of Islamic Cooperation slammed the \"heinous Israeli massacre against Palestinian civilians,\" describing it as a \"war crime, crime against humanity and state organized terrorism\" and demanding that Israel be held to account before international justice. An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the militant group in Rafah had caused the fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there had been a \"tragic mistake\" and that Israel was investigating. In a speech before Israel’s parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that \"despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake. We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.\" Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood where thousands were sheltering there after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. \"We were praying...and we were getting our children's beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,\" said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. \"All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.\" Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on \"precise intelligence\", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip. The incident was being investigated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff investigation mechanism, the Israeli military said on Monday. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\" over Israel's latest attacks. \"These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,\" he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. \"International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,\" Baerbock said. NO SAFE ZONE More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah's western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. \"The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,\" he said. \"What have they done to deserve this? Their children have been orphaned.\" The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned \"the heinous massacre.\" Egypt also condemned Israel's \"deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people\", state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt's military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. \"On top of the hunger, on top of the starvation, the refusal to allow aid in sufficient volumes, what we witnessed last night is barbaric,\" Ireland's Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Israeli tanks have probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, since May 6 and have entered some of its eastern districts. The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, said on Monday that reports of attacks on families seeking shelter in Rafah in the southern tip of the Gaza Strip were \"horrifying.” \"Information coming out of Rafah about further attacks on families seeking shelter is horrifying,\" UNRWA wrote on X. \"There are reports of mass casualties including children and women among those killed. Gaza is hell on earth. Images from last night are yet another testament to that.\" Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials said on Sunday Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens in an area in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah designated for the displaced. The Israeli military said its air force struck a Hamas compound in Rafah, and that the incident was under review. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on Monday it had filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court over Palestinian journalists killed or injured in Gaza. RSF said it was asking the ICC's prosecutor to investigate alleged war crimes committed by the Israeli army against at least nine Palestinian reporters since December 15, Agence France Presse reported. The ICC said in January it was probing potential crimes against journalists since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza, which has cost the lives of more than 100 reporters. RSF said it had \"reasonable grounds for thinking that some of these journalists were deliberately killed and that the others were the victims of deliberate IDF (Israel Defense Force) attacks against civilians.\" This specific complaint -- the third the RSF has made -- concerns eight Palestinian journalists killed between December 20 and May 20, and one other who sustained injuries. \"All concerned journalists were killed (or injured) in the course of their work,\" RSF said in a statement. Antoine Bernard, RSF advocacy and assistance director, said: \"Those who kill journalists are attacking the public's right to information, which is even more essential in times of conflict.\" ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week asked the court to issue arrest warrants for top Israeli and Hamas leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes and crimes and humanity. Israel has strongly denied the allegation and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that to draw a parallel between Hamas and Israeli leaders was \"despicable\". The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 107 journalists and media workers have been killed during the Gaza war, the \"deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992\". The RSF complaint includes the case of two Palestinian journalists killed in January while working for Al Jazeera. Hamza Wael Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuria, who also worked as a video stringer for AFP and other news organizations, were killed while they were \"on their way to carry out their duty\" for the channel in the Gaza Strip, the network said. Egypt on Sunday emphasized the importance of achieving security, stability, and peace in Somalia as a fundamental pillar for security and stability in the entire region. Cairo also affirmed its full support for Mogadishu. Last January, Egypt emphasized the necessity of full respect for the unity and sovereignty of Somalia over its lands, expressing its full rejection to any measures that would undermine Somalia's sovereignty. This came after Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding with Somaliland that would give Addis Ababa access to the Red Sea, a key waterway for global trade. In return, Ethiopia would consider recognizing Somaliland's independence. Mogadishu had rejected the MoU, saying it violates its sovereignty. On Sunday, Egypt reiterated its support for Somalia’s stability during a meeting held between its Prime Minister, Moustafa Madbouly, and Ambassador Ilyas Sheikh Omar Abu Bakr, the outgoing Ambassador of Somalia to Egypt. The PM affirmed Egypt’s full support for Somalia in light of close historical relations between the two sides. Madbouly asked the ambassador to convey his greetings to the Somali Prime Minister and expressed his desire to strengthen joint cooperation between the two nations. For his part, Abu Bakr praised the cooperation he received from Egyptian state institutions and emphasized Somalia’s aspiration for continued Egyptian support, particularly in light of the political and security challenges the country faces. The Arab League had also rejected the MoU between Ethiopia and Somaliland and affirmed its support for Somalia’s sovereignty. Somaliland is a former British colony that declared its independence from Somalia in 1991 but was not recognized by the international community. Last January, the MoU faced international opposition. The US, the EU and the UK urged parties to respect Somali sovereignty. The Somali Ambassador on Sunday expressed his appreciation for the Egyptian political leadership’s support in achieving stability in Somalia. Egypt on Sunday reiterated its concerns about the devastating humanitarian impact of the Israeli military operations in Rafah on over 1.4 million Palestinians and the broader implications for regional peace and stability. Cairo, therefore, called on Israel to fulfil its responsibilities as the occupying power by removing barriers to aid entry by opening all land crossings between Israel and Gaza and ensuring secure conditions for international relief efforts in Gaza. The Egyptian warnings came during a meeting held Sunday between Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell in the Belgian capital, Brussels, to discuss the escalating crisis in Gaza. On Sunday, the Israeli army continued its bombardment of Gaza and Rafah despite an order from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last Friday to immediately halt Israel’s operations in this southern Gaza Strip town. The UN's top court based in the Dutch city of The Hague also ordered Israel to “maintain the Rafah crossing open for humanitarian assistance.” The crossing has been closed since the Israeli army launched its ground assault on the city early this month. During their meeting in Brussels, Shoukry and Borrell stressed the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza as well as a cessation of the Israeli military operations in the Palestinian city of Rafah, according to Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ahmed Abu Zeid. They also emphasized the importance of ensuring unhindered and safe access to humanitarian aid and relief supplies throughout Gaza to address the urgent needs of its residents. Egypt's top diplomat and the EU official then asserted the necessity for Israel to protect and respect humanitarian workers and refrain from targeting the facilities of international relief agencies. Both sides further stressed that Israel should facilitate the movement of relief teams in the Gaza Strip per international humanitarian law. Shoukry and Borrell discussed the dire humanitarian, security, and political aspects of the crisis in the Gaza Strip, Abu Zeid said. Furthermore, they explored ways to mitigate the consequences of the crisis in Gaza and advance a political path to implement the two-state solution, thus resolving the crisis comprehensively, according to the FM’s spokesperson. Shoukry then highlighted the crucial role sought from influential international parties, including the European Union, in supporting the ongoing efforts to halt the Israeli war on Gaza and prevent further loss of Palestinian lives. The Minister expressed his appreciation for the significant efforts of the EU top official in alleviating the humanitarian crisis and its repercussions. He also reiterated concerns about the devastating humanitarian impact of the Israeli military operations in Rafah and called on Israel to fulfil its responsibilities as the occupying power by removing barriers to aid entry by opening all land crossings between Israel and Gaza and ensuring secure conditions for international relief efforts in Gaza. Last week, Egypt's state-run Al-Qahera News channel quoted a high-level Egyptian source as denying Israeli media reports saying Cairo and Tel Aviv are coordinating on Israel’s military operation in the Palestinian Rafah city. The source stressed that “Egypt had warned Israel of the repercussions of escalation in the Gaza Strip, and refused any coordination with Tel Aviv on the Rafah crossing.” In this regard, Shoukry on Sunday said: “Egypt rejects Israel's insistence on controlling all of Gaza's crossings as a tool to tighten the siege and starve the Palestinian people in Gaza, creating an uninhabitable reality in the strip.” He also affirmed Egypt's categorical rejection of any attempts to displace Palestinians from their lands or liquidate the Palestinian cause. Hamas fired a barrage of rockets from Gaza that set off air raid sirens as far away as Tel Aviv for the first time in months on Sunday in a show of resilience more than seven months into Israel's massive air, sea and ground offensive. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage in what appeared to be the first long-range rocket attack from Gaza since January. Hamas’ military wing claimed the attack. Palestinian fighters have sporadically fired rockets and mortar rounds at communities along the Gaza border, and the military arm of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group later Sunday said it fired rockets at nearby communities. The Israeli military said eight projectiles crossed into Israel after being launched from the area of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where Israeli forces recently launched an incursion. It said “a number” of the projectiles were intercepted. Earlier Sunday, aid trucks entered Gaza from southern Israel under a new agreement to bypass the Rafah crossing with Egypt after Israeli forces seized the Palestinian side of it earlier this month. But it was not immediately clear if humanitarian groups could access the aid because of fighting. The war between Israel and Hamas has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its count. The Health Ministry said the bodies of 81 people killed by Israeli strikes had been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Around 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds some 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a ceasefire last year. The prime minister of the Palestinian Authority expressed hope on Sunday that Spain, Ireland and Norway's recognition of a Palestinian state would encourage other European countries to do the same. Mohammad Mustafa, in Brussels to attend a meeting with international donors, said he was grateful that the three had effectively joined 143 other countries that backed a Palestinian bid to become a full United Nations members in a resolution earlier in May. \"We obviously want to have every country in Europe do the same,\" he told a news conference in Brussels with Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares. \"So this is again hopefully a source of encouragement for these countries to take the necessary courageous step.\" The Middle East conflict has exposed diverging views in the European Union. Some EU diplomats have said it is not the right time to recognize Palestinian statehood. Mustafa said recognition now was vital to keep the peace process alive. Spain's Albares said other European countries were thinking about it, including Slovenia that had started the process. Spain, Ireland and Norway said they will formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday to help secure a halt to Israel's Gaza offensive after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 and revive peace talks that stalled a decade ago. Israel has called plans for recognition of a Palestinian state a \"prize for terrorism\". Mustafa said he would spell out to international partners three priorities for his authority - supporting the people of Gaza, including by restoring basic services, building the institutions of a state and stabilizing the financial situation. Yemen's Houthi group freed more than 113 detainees in Sanaa on Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported. The Houthi group claimed the detainees had been government soldiers captured at the battlefront. But Yemen's internationally recognized government said the detainees were not soldiers, but civilians the Houthis had kidnapped from homes, mosques and workplaces. \"Releasing these victims under any name does not absolve (the Houthis) of this crime,\" Majed Fadail, deputy minister for human rights in Yemen's internationally recognized government wrote in a post on social media platform X. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed on Sunday the unilateral release of 113 \"conflict-related\" detainees and said in a statement that it assisted the detainees to ensure their release was humane and dignified. \"I feel completely at ease, as if I was born again today. Because we were desperate and thought we would never get out,\" said Murshed Al Jamaai, a detainee released on Sunday. Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthis ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in late 2014. The outlines of a proposed Yemen UN roadmap for peace were agreed last December, but progress towards peace stalled as the Houthis ramped up attacks on ships in and around the Red Sea, alleging they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war. The campaign has disrupted global commerce, stoked fears of inflation and deepened concern that fallout from the Israel-Hamas war could destabilize parts of the Middle East. Israel's armed forces bombarded Gaza on Sunday, but officials also said diplomatic efforts were expected to resume in coming days towards a truce and hostage release deal. Air strikes and artillery shelling rained down again overnight on northern, central and southern area of Gaza in the more than seven-months-old war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack. Fighting has centered on the far-southern city of Rafah, where Israel has vowed to destroy the last remaining Hamas battalions despite a chorus of international opposition to a ground invasion of the city. Israel's assault there from early May led Egypt to shut its side of the Rafah border crossing -- but on Sunday, aid trucks from Egypt again rolled into Gaza, this time via the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing. US President Joe Biden said Saturday his administration was engaged in \"urgent diplomacy to secure an immediate ceasefire that brings hostages home\". Mediator Egypt was also continuing \"its efforts to reactivate ceasefire negotiations\", said Al Qahera News. Israeli media has said intelligence chief David Barnea had agreed a new framework for talks on a ceasefire in a meeting with America's CIA chief and Qatari mediators in Paris. An Israeli official, requesting anonymity, told AFP on Saturday that \"there is an intention to renew these talks this week\". However, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Qatar's Al Jazeera network that so far \"there is nothing practical on this issue. It is just talk coming from the Israeli side.\" - Bodies pulled from rubble - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under increasing domestic pressure over the fate of the hostages, with demonstrators rallying again in Tel Aviv on Saturday. In recent days, the bodies of seven dead hostages have been retrieved from Gaza, heightening the fear and pain of relatives of the remaining captives. In Tel Aviv, a crowd of several thousands observed a minute of silence Saturday for dead captives. \"I feared this moment,\" Avivit Yablonka, whose brother Chanan was brought back dead from Gaza, told the rally. \"I will continue to shout, support, fight and do everything so that all the hostages return home.\" Hamas meanwhile said Saturday it had taken \"prisoner\" at least one Israeli soldier in an ambush in Jabalia camp. The claim was denied by the army, which said there was \"no incident in which a soldier was abducted\". The war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Gunmen also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,903 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has warned of looming famine in the besieged territory, where most hospitals are no longer functioning. In the latest fighting, Gaza's civil defense agency said Sunday it had retrieved six bodies after a house was targeted in a strike on Rafah's eastern Khirbet al-Adas neighborhood. Witnesses said Israeli artillery had also targeted central Rafah's Yibna camp, and that heavy artillery shelling hit the city's Sooq al-Halal and Qishta neighborhoods. Elsewhere in Gaza, Israeli air strikes targeted the Nuseirat camp, and witnesses said heavy artillery shelling hit northern Gaza. Israeli tanks in Gaza City rained heavy gunfire on targets in the Zeitun and Netzarim area, an AFP reporter said. Israel's military meanwhile said Sunday the arrival of aid had been stepped up, both via a new US-built pier and through its own land crossings, Kerem Shalom and Erez West. \"This week, after the pier began operating for the first time, a total of 1,806 pallets of food were transferred in 127 trucks to logistics centers of international aid agencies in the Gaza Strip,\" it said. \"In total, this week, 2,065 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred through the Kerem Shalom and Erez West crossings, which is almost twice the number in the previous week.\" US Central Command said Saturday that four US Army vessels supporting the pier broke free of their moorings, and had run aground in heavy seas, with Israel aiding the recovery effort. - Global pushback - As the bloodiest ever Gaza war grinds on, Israel has faced heavy global pushback over the surging civilian death toll and the destruction of vast swathes of Gaza. In the past week it faced landmark moves from two international courts based in The Hague and from three European governments. Last Monday, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants on war crimes charges against Netanyahu and his defense minister as well as against three top Hamas figures. On Wednesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain said they would recognize Palestinian statehood by May 28, a move Israel angrily rejected as a \"reward for terrorism\". And on Friday, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, demanded the release of hostages and urged the \"unhindered provision\" of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The ICJ ruling came in a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel's military operation amounts to \"genocide\". It ruled that Israel must \"immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\". Israel has denied any military operations in the Rafah area that \"could cause the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population, in whole or in part\".",

        "description": "A speedrunner of Xenoblade Chronicles X managed to squeeze in one last world record before Nintendo shut down the Wii U's online servers, making it the last record ever.Last month, Nintendo did the at best quite annoying, at worst outright destructive thing of shutting down its online servers for both the Wii U and 3DS. That left numerous titles outright unplayable, and others with online modes that are no longer accessible. Xenoblade Chronicles X was one such game with an online mode, but now you can't play it anymore because of the servers being shut down. It's a lesser known entry in the beloved RPG series, but one that many hope will get a Switch port somewhere down the line (or maybe at this point a Switch 2 port). As it turns out, speedrunner YMG-C actually performed one last run of the game's online mode right before the servers shut down, and in the process beat the world record, as shared by a fan on Twitter (thanks, GamesRadar).With the Wii U's servers now offline, this also makes it impossible for anyone else to speedrun the online mode at all, meaning YMG-C will forever be the world record holder. Though, if no one else had decided to do a run before the servers shut down, it wouldn't matter much, as they were the previous world record holder anyway. Their previous record was two hours and 57 minutes long, whereas this new record is a minute shorter at two hours and 56 minutes, and that will be the record forever more. Even if the game does get a Switch port, speedrun categories will also be placed across various platforms, and with the Wii U being a generation behind, that would obviously cause discrepancies in things like load times.

        "content": "David Harbour and Lily Allen have come up with a unique strategy to control screen time. In an interview with The Sunday Times , the singer shared that she and her Stranger Things star husband have a hold on each others’ phones. “I now have a kids' phone called Pinwheel. It has no browsing capability and no social media, but you can still have Uber and Spotify. My husband is the caregiver on it, so he controls what I'm allowed to have as an app on my phone. I'm the controller of his as well,” she shared. Insisting how smartphones have “destroyed” humanity, Lily added that she has also confiscated her daughters' smartphones after reading a study which claimed that children shouldn’t use them until they are 14. “The creative side of my brain has been ruined by smartphones. I feel like everyone feels the same. I don't know anyone who can possibly say that the quality of their life is improved by the presence of a smartphone,” she explained. Lily also shared her frustration with digital footprints and how someone’s past self can be used against them. “I don't think, as human beings, that you're meant to share ideas and for them to be set in stone. We are meant to evolve as people. How are you meant to do that if you're always held to account by things that you've said in the past? I said that 20 years ago, when I was a completely different person. Don't hold me to that,” she said.",

        "content": "Addressing an election rally in Kolkata, Banerjee mentioned her inability to attend the INDIA bloc meeting due to the scheduled elections in the state on June 1. New Delhi/ Kolkata: West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Monday said she will not attend the meeting of the INDIA bloc on June 1 due to the last phase of Lok Sabha polls and ongoing relief work after cyclone 'Remal' hit the state's coastal regions. According to sources, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has convened a meeting of the INDIA bloc leaders in the afternoon of June 1, coinciding with the last round of polling. Addressing an election rally in Kolkata, Banerjee mentioned her inability to attend the INDIA bloc meeting due to the scheduled elections in the state on that day. \"The INDIA bloc meeting has been fixed on June 1. But I have already said I can’t go on June 1 as there is an election in our state on that day. So far I know there are elections in Punjab, UP and Bihar. Voting will continue till 6 pm, and at times it extends beyond that (6 pm),” she said. Banerjee highlighted the dual challenges of post-cyclone relief work and ongoing elections, emphasising her priority towards relief efforts. “How can I leave everything behind and go? My priority is relief work. Even if I am holding a meeting here, my heart goes out to those people (affected by the cyclone),” she said at the Kolkata rally. Cyclone Remal, with wind speed reaching 135 kmph, claimed four lives in West Bengal and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and property in the state's coastal areas as it tore through West Bengal and Bangladesh, officials reported on Monday. The TMC had withdrawn from the INDIA bloc in West Bengal in January but affirmed its commitment to remain part of the opposition alliance at the national level. During the election campaigns in the last two months, Banerjee had expressed confidence that the INDIA bloc would win the Lok Sabha elections and affirmed her involvement in the anti-BJP alliance at the national level. Sources in the TMC revealed that voting will be conducted on nine seats, including two seats in Kolkata, in West Bengal on June 1, which are crucial for the party. Apart from the Kolkata Dakshin and Kolkata Uttar, other constituencies in the state that will go to polls on that day include Jadavpur, Dum Dum, Barasat, Basirhat, Jayanagar, Mathurapur and Diamond Harbour. TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, its national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and other top leaders will exercise their franchise on the day, and, therefore, they will be unable to attend the meeting, a source said, adding that the party has attended all meetings of the opposition bloc so far. The source added that the TMC has conveyed this to the organisers. The first meeting of the opposition bloc Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) was held in Patna on June 23 last year, followed by meetings in Bengaluru on July 17-18, 2023, and in Mumbai between August 31 and September 1, where the opposition parties adopted resolutions to contest the Lok Sabha elections unitedly. The fourth meeting of the opposition bloc was held in Delhi on December 19. The next gathering of opposition leaders took place in Delhi on March 31, where top leaders shared the stage at the \"Save Democracy\" rally held against the arrests of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren. A similar 'Ulgulan' rally was held in Ranchi on April 21. The TMC has been part of all these meetings and rallies. At the March 31 rally in Delhi, TMC's parliamentary party leader in Rajya Sabha, Derek O'Brien, announced that the party would remain part of the INDIA bloc. The TMC, which is in power in West Bengal, does not have any seat-sharing deal with the Congress or any other INDIA bloc partner in its home state. But its candidate Laliteshpati Tripathi in Uttar Pradesh's Bhadohi has been supported by ally Samajwadi Party. Twenty-eight opposition parties came together to form the INDIA bloc. However, some parties such as Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) later switched over to the NDA.",

        "content": "After nine long years of waiting – an inquest into the death of a teen who was found unresponsive in a Regina creek is getting underway. Haven Dubois was just 14-years-old when he was found unresponsive in Pilot Butte Creek on May 20, 2015. Haven’s mother, Richelle Dubois, was the one who discovered her son in the creek, located in east Regina. The teen was transported to Regina General Hospital. However, resuscitation efforts failed and he was declared dead. A coroner’s report released within 24 hours of the incident deemed Haven’s death “accidental.” Download the CTV News app to get breaking news alerts sent to your device These findings have been disputed by Richelle, who has called for a public inquest to be held – insisting that there are more facts and information in her son’s case. “This was not an accident. This was a murder,” she said in 2023. Since 2015, Richelle has led efforts to gain information from the investigation of Haven’s death. Additionally, she’s organized awareness campaigns. In 2023, Richelle marked the eighth anniversary of Haden’s passing with a march from Regina to Saskatoon. “Walk for Haven: A March for Justice” was organized in the hopes that a commission of inquiry would be created to look into the incident as well as a special investigation into school negligence contributing to Haven’s death. The walk also called for a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Men and Boys be established. The inquest is set to run from Monday to Friday at the Royal Hotel in Regina. --With files from Drew Postey and Hallee Mandryk.",

        "content": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has signed a new five-year contract, the Premier League club have announced. The Spaniard has been rewarded after guiding Villa to a fourth-placed finish and Champions League qualification last season. Emery has transformed Villa’s fortunes since taking charge in October 2022 with the club just three points above the relegation zone. Aston Villa are thrilled to announce Manager Unai Emery has agreed a new five-year contract! ✍️ — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) May 27, 2024 Villa chairman Nassef Sawiris said: “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Emery, 52, arrived at Villa with a strong reputation as a four-time Europa League winner following impressive spells with Sevilla and Villarreal. He had also won Ligue 1 with Paris St Germain and had Premier League experience after a year in charge of Arsenal from 2018-19. After making an immediate impact by steering the club to a seventh-placed finish in 2023, he has now guided Villa back into Europe’s elite competition for the first time since 1983. With a number of high-profile managerial vacancies opening up this summer, the club have acted decisively to secure his services for the long term. Emery told the club’s website, www.avfc.co.uk: “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club. “Since I came to Villa with (co-owner) Wes (Edens) and Nassef we found always the best environment and structure to develop a project with the highest ambition. “There’s a great chemistry in Aston Villa and the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams.”",

        "content": "The head of the World Health Organization on Monday voiced confidence that countries would one day reach a deal on a pandemic accord. The World Health Organization (WHO) opened its annual meeting on Monday with government ministers and other top envoys hoping to reinforce global preparedness for the next pandemic. But the most ambitious project, to adopt a pandemic “treaty,” has been shelved for now after more than two years of work failed to produce a draft that countries could unite around by last week. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted it was not a failure, saying the task was \"immense\" with member states operating on a “very ambitious timeline\". He said negotiators underwent sleepless nights, adding that a \"torrent of mis- and disinformation\" undermined efforts. \"Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and crossed the finish line, but I remain confident that you still will because where there is a will, there is a way,\" Tedros said. WHO officials and others have been eager to build on the momentum of concern from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the risk that the more it fades into history, the less the public and governments will be interested in preparing for future pandemics. Decision-makers have struggled to balance national interest with the call from WHO officials to think more broadly in the interest of humanity and equity as pathogens impact the globe. Increasing criticism from right-wing activists had claimed the treaty would undermine sovereignty, an assertion that the WHO strongly refutes. Health ministers will now have to take up the work and try to overcome deep-set differences, including how the world can share information on emerging pathogens and scarce resources like vaccines and masks when demand skyrockets. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking by video, called the pandemic accord a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to make sure the global health systems respond faster and more equitably in the next outbreak and urged delegates to back amendments to the international health as a way to boost the response to emergencies. “Amidst the legal arguments and endless negotiation for the pandemic treaty, let us remember that the heart of the health care is not just policies and programs, it is about our shared humanity,” Thailand’s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said via a video feed. Instead of a pandemic treaty, the best shot now for bulking up the international health architecture to fight such cross-border outbreaks is through amendments to the nearly two-decades-old International Health Regulations, which countries have “in principle” agreed to, Tedros said last week. Those regulations focus on helping countries detect and respond to health emergencies. For example, envoys to the assembly could establish the concept of a “pandemic emergency” to build on and refine the cumbersome category of Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which is currently WHO’s highest level of alert for dangerous epidemics. Such a term could help inform the public at a time when, as with COVID-19, confusion and uncertainty are widespread.",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by Philip A Loring and Ryan M. Katz-Rosene, The Conversation Rising food costs are squeezing Canadians around the country . Nearly everyone is feeling the pinch, and it's not just an inconvenience—high food prices are a major threat to food security for many Canadians . Understanding why food prices are so high and why they are changing is critical to the well-being of our society. Unfortunately, consensus on why food price are so high is in short supply. Explanations given in reports like Canada's Food Price Report and the news media range widely, from the war in Ukraine to supply chain issues to the carbon tax. Each year it seems the key drivers change, and if the growing consumer boycott of Loblaw's is any indication, consumers want better answers. So, we completed a rigorous analysis of the most prominent reports that shape the narratives around food prices in Canada, including twelve years of Canada's Food Price Reports and 39 reports from Statistics Canada . Our findings, which are peer reviewed and soon to be published in Canadian Food Studies , were both insightful and concerning. Our analysis found that most claims about food prices in these reports lack scientific rigor. Nearly two-thirds of the explanations for price changes given are not backed by evidence. Arguments about the causes of food inflation are frequently incomplete, neglecting to connect the dots between cause and effect. For instance, reports may identify the influence of unfavorable weather, climate change or changing retail demand, but fail to elaborate how these translate into actual price increases at the till. British philosopher Stephen E. Toulmin published a simple approach for evaluating the quality of scientific arguments in 1958. In a nutshell, for a scientific argument to be complete, it needs to have three components: a claim, verifiable observations or data that provide grounds for that claim, and an explicit theory or assumption that links the data logically to the claim. For scientific arguments to be rigorous, they should also back up the strength of their assumptions and qualify their claims by exploring reasonable counterarguments. However, most of the arguments in these reports fall short of this, failing even to provide basic evidence in support of their claims. These reports are not scientific publications, but rather qualify as \" gray literature \"—information produced outside traditional academic publishing channels. Nevertheless, they are published under the logos of academic institutions and government agencies . Given their prominence in Canadian media and policy, we believe it is important for the public to know that the arguments presented in these reports do not live up to scientific standards. While the reports do identify potential drivers of food prices, they have some noteworthy gaps. While extreme weather events and climate change are sometimes offered as abstract reasons for food price increases, some major environmental issues, like biodiversity loss and collapsing fish stocks , do not appear in reports, despite a widespread understanding that they will impact food price and availability. These reports also rarely consider the decisions that grocers and other private sector entities have on food prices. Increased consolidation and concentration in the grocery sector is a structural issue that deserves scrutiny. The bread price-fixing scandal a few years ago showed how a lack of competition enables price manipulation and hurts consumers. Canada's Competition Bureau recently announced they are launching an investigation into the owners of Loblaws and Sobeys for alleged anti-competitive conduct. In the United States, there is also strong evidence that the private sector has been profiteering on supply chain issues and inflation . The U.S. Federal Trade Commission likewise recently found that big grocers used the pandemic as a smokescreen to pad their profits at the public's expense. With grocer profits expanding in Canada, too , it is fair to ask tough questions about how much grocers' decisions are contributing to the pain at the till. In our analysis, only three percent of the over 200 explanations for food price changes point to grocer actions or other agency in the private sector as driving price increases. This reflects a tendency to portray food prices as erratic and overwhelmingly opaque. Other issues—such as the over-reliance on fossil fuels across the supply chain—also go unmentioned. Without rigorous and transparent analysis, we're left with an incomplete picture of why food is so expensive and what we can do about it. What we need is a new approach. Food is a human right , but a unique one in that we rely on the private sector to provision it. We should expect a higher standard than with other consumer goods, and the private sector has arguably not earned the benefit of the doubt given their history of price fixing. One positive step towards generating trustworthy evidence about food prices would be to incorporate transparency measures into the code of conduct the Canadian government is developing with grocers . This could include third-party audits, open data-sharing and a clear breakdown of what's driving price changes—from the farm to the shelf. Peer review of research is a critical aspect of responsible science. In our paper, we highlight the process that the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat provides for federal fisheries science, as one possible model for government-based food price reports. For something as essential as food, Canadians deserve the full story. For decades, policy and markets have been designed to keep food cheap , but at the expense of workers and the environment. If food prices are rising because they are starting to reflect the true social and ecological costs of production, we will need to enter a broader conversation about economic and livelihood reform to ensure that everyone can afford food. But without a clear picture of the actual drivers, we lack the necessary information for developing policies that protect the rights and well-being of Canadians.

By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 09:21 PM Ramagundam Police Commissior M Srinivasulu Peddapalli: Commissioner of Police, M Srinivasulu warned that besides registering criminal cases, PD Act would be invoked against those who were involved in the circulation of fake and spurious seeds. Informing that check posts have been established at the border of district to check illegal transportation of seed, CP said that police taskforce teams were coordinating with other government departments to check the sale of fake and spurious seeds. Also Read Ramagundam CP convenes meeting over SOP to detect spurious seeds Participating in an awareness programme to police officers from Ramagundam commissionerate limits held in Godavarikhani on Monday, CP explained about the standard operation processor (SOP) to be followed to identify fake, spurious and banned HT cotton seeds. Srinivasulu advised dealers to sell seeds by following the rules and regulations of the state government. He warned to take serious action if any dealer was engaged in seed business without license. Action would also be taken if anybody stored seeds in kiranstores and sold fake seeds in the name of agents and middlemen. Informing that it was also a crime either to sell or store or transport fake seeds in the name of a branded company, CP asked the police officers to take legal action against those people. Instructing the police officers to carry out raids in seed and fertilizer shops, godowns and manufacturing units, he advised the cops to verify whether the shops have licenses. If they have licenses, officers should check form-B or form-C (renewal), authorization license issued by Seed Certificate Authority and its validity. Besides seed license, price list, bills, retail and wholesale seed stock in stock register, invoice, delivery challans and other details should also be verified. It was also necessary to check whether stock details have been tallied with book balance. He emphasized the need to check packing, tags, labels, manufacturing company details, and expiry dates. If they find seeds under suspicious conditions, they should be sent to labs for testing through concern mandal agriculture officers (MAOs). Officers should also verify whether the seed dealers were giving receipts to farmers. CP directed officers to carry out surprise checking by utilizing modern technology in the areas where illegal transportation of seed was being done. Instructing the cops to pay watch on the movements of the people involved in fake seeds sales in the past, he advised to invoke PD Act if frequent cases were registered on them.

        "content": "A Bayern Munich superstar, who is rumoured to be keen on a move to Barcelona, is said to have rejected the Spanish club's latest offer, and the reason why has reportedly been revealed. It is believed Joshua Kimmich was a top target in Barca's transfer window plans under Xavi Hernandez, but with the likely appointment of Hansi Flick, expectations over a mooted move have seemingly grown given their connections. According to , the 29-year-old is currently in talks with the five-time European champions to discuss personal terms, but while they are believed to be advanced, the midfielder's representatives and the club have now seen negotiations stall. The Germany international is said to be earning €19.5 million (R390 million) a year before tax in Germany, and with the Blaugrana still in an unstable financial situation, the Catalans will not be able to match his current annual salary. The Spanish giants will be looking to seek approval from the league to be able to implement the 1:1 rule. It means they will get to spend every euro they bring in, while up until this point they have been forced to implement the 1:4 rule, which meant they had to save four euros for every euro they spent. Signing Kimmich to such a contract is also not feasible because Robert Lewandowski's current deal will escalate to a €30 million annual salary next season. Flick has worked with the Rottweil native before at Die Roten and Die Mannschaft, and would seemingly utilise him as a lone holding midfielder as a replacement for Sergio Busquets. However, for the time being, Barca will need to come up with a new offer if they are keen on negotiations to advance to completion. You must be to read and post comments.",

        "content": "Travelers walk through Salt Lake City International Airport on May 24. via Associated Press Air travel is consistently exceeding pre-pandemic levels, as record numbers of people using U.S. airports during Memorial Day weekend signaled a busy summer travel season ahead. The Transportation Security Administration said it screened more than 2.9 million travelers at airports across the country on May 24, breaking the previous record set in November during the Thanksgiving holiday rush. May 23 was the third busiest day on record, per the TSA, with just under 2.9 million travelers. Advertisement “TSA Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the agency said on X, formerly Twitter. Five of the TSA’s 10 busiest-ever travel days have been recorded since the start of this month, according to a graphic tweeted by the agency, emphasizing how stubborn inflation and extreme weather have not kept people from their vacation plans. While inflation has fallen to 3.4%, the cost of living remains high after the measure took months to tick down from a post-pandemic high of 9.1%. The Federal Reserve is also holding off cutting interest rates amid fears that inflation has not cooled sufficiently, keeping the cost of borrowing high for most Americans. The 10 busiest travel days on record, according to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. TSA Advertisement The numbers appear to track with a forecast by the American Automobile Association, which said earlier this month it was expecting to see Memorial Day weekend travel numbers hit highs not seen in almost 20 years. The group estimated that 43.8 million people would travel 50 miles or more over the holiday travel period ― a 4% surge over last year, and close to 2005’s record of 44 million. Of those, more than 38 million people are driving, the highest figure for this holiday since AAA began tracking in 2000. Using data from analysts INRIX, the AAA has highlighted the best and worst times to drive to avoid traffic. For May 27, it says the best time to travel by car is after 7 p.m. “Travel times are expected to be up to 90% longer than normal,” said Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX. “Travelers should stay up to date on traffic apps, 511 services, and local news stations to avoid sitting in traffic longer than necessary.” Advertisement Related travel TSA Memorial Day weekend We Track Sales For A Living.

        "description": "Sir Keir Starmer ventured into opposition territory—a constituency where a Tory MP has a majority of 7,474—to make his first keynote speech of the campaign.",
        "content": "Labour Party Leader Sir Keir Starmer used the first keynote speech of his general election campaign to rebut accusations by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that he could not be trusted with the country’s national security at a time of growing threats from Russia, China and Iran. Speaking at an event in Lancing, West Sussex, on Monday, Sir Keir said, “The very foundation of any good government is economic security, border security, national security.” “Make no mistake, if the British people give us the opportunity to serve, then this is their core test. It is always their core test. The definition of service. Can you protect this country? added Sir Keir, who was a lawyer and director of public prosecutions before he turned to politics. He added, “They’re fed-up with the failure, chaos and division of the Tories, but they still have questions about us: ‘has Labour changed enough?’ ‘Do I trust them with my money, our borders, our security?’” “My answer is yes, you can, because I have changed this party, permanently,” added Sir Keir. Mr. Sunak has made a great deal in recent weeks of tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East and Taiwan and the apparent increase in cyber threat from China and Russia, and has suggested he was the best person to entrust the country’s security to at this time. But Sir Keir said he could be trusted on security and claimed 14 years of Conservative “chaos” had led to a “crisis” in the national culture. He said: “Elections are about more than individual changes and policies, but about values, temperament, character and a bigger question: whose side are you on? Who do you hold in your mind’s eye when you are making decisions?” If Labour wins in seats like East Worthing and Shoreham it will be on course for a big majority in Parliament. Mr. Sunak immediately hit back at Sir Keir’s speech and said, “Our country needs bold action, not waffle.” Conservative Party Chairman Richard Holden said Sir Keir’s speech was “wearisome and rambling” with “no policy, no substance, and no plan.” The unveiling of the national service policy seems to have taken many Tory candidates by surprise. Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker, writing on social media, said the national service plan had been “sprung” on Tory candidates. He said: “Government policy would have been developed by ministers on the advice of officials and collectively agreed. I would have had a say on behalf of N.I. (Northern Ireland).” “But this proposal was developed by a political adviser or advisers and sprung on candidates, some of whom are relevant ministers,” added Mr. Baker. But Mr. Sunak defended the policy. During a campaign stop in Buckinghamshire, the prime minister said, “This modern form of national service will mean that young people get the skills and the opportunities that they need which is going to serve them very well in life.” Sir Ed said the Lib Dems would be targeting SNP marginals like Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire, and Mid Dunbartonshire, on July 4. Mid Dunbartonshire has been created from the redrawing of boundaries and largely comprises of East Dunbartonshire, a seat the Lib Dems lost to the SNP in 2015, won back again in 2017 and lost again in 2019, that time with a majority of just 149 votes. Speaking at the party’s launch in North Queensferry in Fife, Sir Ed said, “I believe we can make gains here in Scotland just as we’re going to make gains against the Conservatives in England.” “I think we can have more liberals in Parliament after this election,” he added.",

        "description": "The Texas Rangers continued to suffer similar defeats in series against the Minnesota Twins until they finally broke out in the finale to end their long losing skid.",
        "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas — Wins, at this point, seem like a foreign concept for the Texas Rangers . Coming into the final leg of a road trip against the Minnesota Twins, Texas had won just two games in their previous 12 contests. Things didn’t get much better from there, as the reigning World Series champions dropped the first two in the set against the Twins to find themselves in danger of slipping further down the AL West standings. But at last, something of a breakthrough occurred on Sunday, and the Rangers ended up pulling out a win, salvaging one game of this six-game road trip. Game 52: Texas 2, Minnesota 3 (W: Ober, 5-2, L: Urena, 1-4, Sv: Duran, 5) Game 53: Texas 3, Minnesota 5 (W: Sands, 2-0, L: Robertson, 2-2, Sv: Duran, 6) Game 54: Texas 6, Minnesota 2 (W: Latz, 1-1, L: Lopez, 4-5) If it’s not one thing... One of the things that Texas could hang their hats on is how good the winning pieces of the bullpen had been late in games. The opportunity came for that to continue to be true for the Rangers on Saturday, as David Robertson came in to help preserve a 3-1 Texas lead. After a blown foul tip call helped Minnesota score a run, Robertson started the next inning clean but the frame would quickly become untidy. After a single and a walk, Robertson coughed up an Alex Kirilloff three-run homer to give the Twins an eighth inning lead that they would not relinquish. It was a rare bad outing for the former Yankees’ closer who had been a lockdown setup man for Texas so far this season. At the same time, it’s important to acknowledge that Robertson hadn’t pitched in seven days because the Rangers simply haven’t been in position to need their winning pieces late in games. Without a lead to protect, there’s not much point in using a lead protector. The Corey Seager Show It’s hard to celebrate a single player’s accomplishments when the rest of the team isn’t getting the job done, but Corey Seager has been attempting to lead the charge for the offense all on his own. After the Minnesota series, Seager is now enjoying a 10-game hitting streak, an 11-game on-base streak and a six-game run-scoring streak. Two homers today Six in his last six games Corey Seager is HOT. pic.twitter.com/ZXRDARdVw2 The World Series MVP went yard in two of the three games against the Twins, including twice in the finale, both crushed to right field. While it did take him a while to get going this year, if last year is any indication, once Seager gets hot, he can be a dominant force as he finished second in the American League MVP voting. If that holds true this year, then Seager will just have to wait for the rest of the lineup to fall in line around him. From out of nowhere As Jon Gray became the latest Rangers’ starter to hit the injured list, Texas needed an option to start the final game against Minnesota. Cole Winn had been optioned back down to Triple-A, and Jack Leiter had proven that he’s not ready for the big leagues. Outside of that, with Jose Urena and Michael Lorenzen each leaving their starts in this series with ailments, a bullpen game was out of the question. So, with no other choice, Texas designated Shaun Anderson for assignment and selected the contract of 28-year old Dominican Gerson Garabito from Round Rock to make the start. After being out of affiliate ball for the last five years, Garabito had pitched in various latin Winter Leagues and had signed with the Rangers on a straight up minor-league contract in December. Thanks to some word-of-mouth scouting, and posting a 2.05 ERA over seven outings between Double-A Frisco and Round Rock, Garabito found himself a Major Leaguer on Sunday in one of the more improbable outings in a while born out of desperation. Gerson Garabito made his MLB debut today, allowing 1 ER in 3.2 IP Garabito's arsenal graded out about average. His command was wild, issuing 4 BB on the day. He remained effective thanks to limiting hard contact Welcome to the Show! pic.twitter.com/DEc687frt7 He responded to the surprising task by no-hitting the Twins through his first three innings of action, and giving up just two hits and one run in 3.2 innings of work. For what Texas needed at that point, it was enough. Jonathan Hernandez, Jake Latz and Jose Leclerc held the Twins in check, limiting them to just two runs overall as the bats scored the most runs in a game (six) since scoring 12 back on May 8 to help Texas pick up their lone win on the road trip. With every starter except Andrew Heaney having hit the IL at some point this season, and with every starter in the current rotation dealing with bumps and bruises, Garabito’s tenure as a big leaguer might be extended. After being something of an unheard of savior on Sunday, that could be a welcome sight for now. Fresh off the losing streak-snapping win on Sunday, the Rangers head back home with an off day on Monday. Until Sunday, Texas hadn’t scored more than four runs in a game in two and half weeks. Scoring six runs against Minnesota was a relief; but holding onto that momentum will be a tough task as they face a World Series rematch against the Arizona Diamondbacks starting Tuesday evening.

        "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger and Marvel honcho Kevin Feige have been spending the last few months admitting Marvel Studios' recent output largely hasn't been up to snuff and teasing we'll be getting less TV shows (which are also more concise) in the future. However, a (white) Vision series is happening and coming to Disney Plus.Variety broke the shocking news, which confirms the long-gestating idea, born from WandaVision's season finale, has not been dropped nor moved to a larger big-screen project. Despite the slowdown on TV productions teased time and again, a Vision-centric series is moving forward, probably tying into a movie they really want to make.Marvel has tapped Star Trek: Picard executive producer Terry Matalas to cook up a project for Vision, the android still played by Paul Bettany. The new series is supposedly aiming to release in 2026, but a smooth creative process and genuinely good scripts should be required to deliver something that's worth our time. Matalas will serve as the sole showrunner unless there's one of those creative shakeups that we 'love' so much. Read more",

        "description": "King Frederik has given his wife, Queen Mary, an incredible Danish honour - the Grand Commander's Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog - to celebrate his 56th birthday",
        "content": "It may have been his birthday, but presented his wife, , with a priceless gift on his special day. The Danish royal palace announced that in celebration of Frederik's 56 birthday, which fell on Sunday, he has awarded Mary the Grand Commander's Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog. The Grand Commander order is reserved for persons of royal origin and it is awarded only to those with close family ties to the Danish Royal House. Its glittering insignia, which Mary is likely to wear for any forthcoming white-tie events, features Frederik's cypher at the top of a red and gold cross, interspersed with crown emblems and surrounded by diamonds. Mary's award was previously worn by the late Prince Henrik – consort to – but it has been restored with Frederik's emblem. There are currently seven Grand Commanders of the Order of Dannebrog. In addition to the King and Queen, other recipients of the Grand Commander's Cross include Queen Margrethe, Frederik's brother Prince Joachim, Margrethe's sister Princess Benedikte, Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Norway's King Harald V. Frederik and Joachim were the last Danish royals to be awarded the honour – both in 2004. Women were only allowed to be awarded the Order from 1951, however Christian VIII broke tradition for this when he gifted it to Frederik VI's widow, Queen Marie Sophie Frederikke, in 1840. King Frederik and Queen Mary delighted royal fans as they made an appearance on the balcony at Frederik VIII's Palace, Amalienborg alongside their four children and Queen Margrethe on the monarch's birthday on Sunday. Mary stunned in a hot pink midi dress from No. 21's spring/summer 2018 collection, while her daughters, , 17, and , 13, borrowed pieces from their mother's wardrobe. Isabella looked beautiful in a navy blue and floral wrap dress by Zimmermann, while Josephine donned a pretty blue and white frock from Paul & Joe. Frederik and his sons, Crown Prince Christian, 18, and , 13, matched in navy suits. Frederik and Mary's four children also took part in the annual Royal Run last week, which saw over 95,000 runners take to the streets to complete races in Brønderslev, Aarhus, Fredericia, Kalundborg and Copenhagen / Frederiksberg. Frederik, who is an avid sportsman and has ran marathons in Copenhagen, New York and Paris, set up Royal Run to mark his 50 birthday in 2018 and it has become an annual event ever since.

The video shows at least 20 climbers queuing up with little gap between them. The video is said to be from near the summit of Mt Everest and it has been claimed in posts sharing the video that these climbers are ‘stuck’ as they await their turn to climb to the summit. “There’s something about this that sums up so much of what’s wrong with the world,” said a user who shared the video on X (formerly Twitter).

        "content": "FREDERICTON — Crown prosecutors in New Brunswick have voted 99 per cent in favour of strike action if their current round of contract talks break down. The New Brunswick Crown Prosecutors Association issued a statement today saying the province's criminal justice system is in a state of crisis because of recruitment and retention problems. Association president Shara Munn says Crown lawyers have been negotiating with the province for more than a year. Meanwhile, she says a shortage of prosecutors is putting the justice system at risk because prosecutors are struggling with heavy workloads. She says the recent strike vote involved 100 per cent of the province's Crown prosecutors and family Crown counsel. The association says a conciliation meeting has been scheduled for June 14-15. \"We're committed to making sure New Brunswickers have the justice system they deserve,\" Munn said in a statement. \"But if the government doesn’t work with us to fix this crisis, more experienced prosecutors will leave and the crisis will get even worse. Community public safety could be put at risk.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Italy's Benetton family is readying plans to address mounting losses at its eponymous clothing retailer, including parting ways with CEO Massimo Renon after four years, two people close to the group said on Monday. The board of the clothing group is expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss a net loss of around 230 million euros ($250 million) for 2023 which includes impairments, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. That compares with a net loss of 81 million euros in 2022, when revenues totaled 1 billion euros. Benetton shareholders are then scheduled to meet on June 18, at which time Renon's CEO mandate will not be renewed, the two sources said. Renon, who built his career in the eyewear industry working at Luxottica, Safilo and Marcolin, declined to comment. The Benettons own the clothing group made famous by its colorful jumpers and provocative advertising campaigns through their Edizione holding company. Edizione is preparing to back a restructuring of the clothing retailer and to inject 260 million euros, one of the sources said, adding that Edizione would exert closer control over the group. Benetton has struggled to withstand growing competition from fast-fashion giants such as Zara owner Inditex which have developed a nimbler production and distribution model, able to more quickly respond to consumers' changing tastes. In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Saturday, Chairman Luciano Benetton, one of its founders, said the group had been expected to break even in 2023 under a three-year strategic plan, but a worse than expected financial situation had emerged in recent months. Luciano Benetton told Corriere that current management, led by Renon, had surprised the board by unveiling a \"dramatic\" shortfall. Founded in 1965 by Italy's Benetton family as a clothing manufacturer, Benetton expanded to trade through around 4,000 shops globally, according to its website. After listing the group in Milan in 1986, the Benettons took it private in 2012, the last year in which it made a profit. The total value of the fashion industry in Saudi Arabia reached SAR 92.3 billion ($24.6 billion) during the first quarter of 2024, with local fashion accounting for SAR 46.9 billion ($12.5 billion), according to a report by the General Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises (Monsha’at). The value of spending on imported brands amounted to SAR 27.4 billion ($7.3 billion), increasing the expected cumulative growth of the fashion sector by 48 percent between 2021 and 2025. In its report for the first quarter of 2024, Monsha’at highlighted the importance of the fashion sector in the Kingdom and the great investment opportunities available to entrepreneurs. In his opening letter of the report, CEO of the Fashion Commission Burak Cakmak said the future of fashion in Saudi Arabia will witness further progress and prosperity thanks to the Kingdom’s designers and the visions of its entrepreneurs that will leave an impact on the global fashion scene. The report featured an interview with Saud Al-Sabhan, Deputy Governor for Entrepreneurship at Monsha’at, who emphasized the Authority’s role in supporting entrepreneurs and owners of SMEs through various programs and initiatives. CEO and Founder of MAGNiTT Philip Bahoshy said the Kingdom continued to excel in the volume of venture capital investments at the beginning of 2024, with investments worth a total of SAR 900 million ($240 million). He added that Saudi Arabia has the largest share of the volume of venture capital investments in the Middle East and North Africa region, at 65 percent. The report reviewed success stories of male and female entrepreneurs in the field, including Princess Deemah bint Mansour bin Saud al-Saud, the founder of Personage, designer Mohammed Khoja, co-founder of Hindamme, and others. Louis Vuitton unveiled its latest fashion designs at Barcelona’s Park Güell on Thursday, providing the clothes with drama to finally match Antoni Gaudí’s architectural masterpiece. Nicolas Ghesquiere’s ambitions for the Parisian house’s 2025 Cruise collection were unveiled before an A-list crowd, including actresses Ana de Armas, Jennifer Connelly and Saoirse Ronan. Louis Vuitton usually unveils its ready-to-wear collections in the French capital, while choosing exotic and attention-grabbing locations for its destination cruise collections. Where tourists tread daily in tank tops, shorts and flip flops, this UNESCO World Heritage Site for one night was home to cutting-edge garments that blended with its earthly tones that are at once organic and yet seemingly ethereal. The models weaved their way through the 86 Doric columns that hold up a vaulted square in the center of the park that overlooks Barcelona and the Mediterranean Sea in the distance. The show notes said Ghesquiere had been inspired by Gaudí’s “legacy in constant mutation” and Spain’s rich artistic heritage. “As if in homage to such opulent purity, the Maison’s rigorous spirit embraces the country’s passionate character,” the notes read. “The fervor of its colors, its loyalty to tradition elevated into artistic expression, dark and light that never appear contradictory.” Dramatic silhouettes contrasted with the soft curves of Gaudí’s organic structures, which were then reflected in the dresses that draped and folded into volumes that defied gravity. And then there were flashes that delighted: a pair of equestrian boots that finished in a bunch of tassels. The fashion show, however, was not celebrated by all. A group of a few hundred residents protested the event for what they said were the inconveniences it had caused, including reduced parking in the area. The protest also included animal right activists. The group of protesters located a few streets down the hill from the park’s outer wall could be heard beating drums, blowing air horns and setting off firecrackers before the show kicked off. Catalan police said they arrested one person for resisting violently to their decision to remove the protesters from a street to let traffic through. Park Güell, pronounced “gu-ay” was started in 1900 as a planned upscale residential development designed by Gaudí, whose other works include the still-in-progress La Sagrada Familia Basilica. But a lack of buyers led to it being ditched in favor of a park that eventually passed into the hands of the Barcelona townhall. It now receives 4.4 million visitors a year, mostly from the US, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, with Barcelona residents only representing 0.3% of the visitors, according to the park. Textile recycling firm Syre said on Thursday it had raised $100 million to fund the building of its first plant in the United States and preparations for two more, the construction of which will start in 2025. The funding round was led by founding investor TPG Rise Climate, with investments also from fashion retailer H&M , IMAS Foundation, Volvo Cars and others, Syre said, not specifying how much each had invested, Reuters said. The Swedish venture said in a statement its US polyester recycling plant would be up and running this year and it had short-listed Vietnam and either Spain or Portugal as sites for two further plants. \"Both regions are strategically positioned within the textile supply chain and have a long history of a vibrant textile industry, with access to know-how, feedstock and logistics, as well as green energy,\" the company said. Syre plans to produce more than 3 million metric tons of polyester - enough for two tee-shirts for every person on Earth - in 2032 by recycling used garments. Around 5.8 million tonnes of textile products are discarded every year in the European Union, equivalent to 11 kg (24 lb) per person. A truckload of textile products is land-filled or incinerated somewhere in the world every second, according to EU figures. Chanel plans to invest in opening more stores in mainland China despite a shift of spending by Chinese shoppers to other markets as they resume travelling, the French label said on Tuesday. \"The ability to scale is really important,\" said Leena Nair, chief executive of the privately-owned label, known for its tweed suits, quilted handbags and No. 5 perfume. On a recent trip to China, she said she noticed young shoppers were interested in luxury purchases as longer term financial investments. First quarter sales updates from luxury brands showed contrasting results in mainland China, offering little reassurance that Chinese demand for high end fashion is bouncing back quickly. This has cast a cloud over the outlook for the industry, which had high hopes that the key market would provide a boost as the post-pandemic splurge in the United States and Europe abated. \"China is still a place where we are, I would say, under distributed,\" said Chanel chief financial officer Philippe Blondiaux, citing the label's 18 fashion boutiques compared to competing brands that have around 40 to 50 stores. Luxury retailers in European cities outside France are jockeying for business from deep pocketed tourists this summer, betting on a surge in visitors avoiding crowds and street closures in Paris during the Olympic Games. \"Paris will probably be slow,\" with cities like London, Milan or Barcelona likely seeing a lift in traffic during the event, Cartier CEO Cyril Vigneron said on Friday. The Summer Games, which run from July 26 to Aug. 11, are probably \"not the right time to organize a very important high jewelry celebration in Paris\", said Van Cleef & Arpels CEO Nicolas Bos. \"But we will keep the stores open and be very happy to welcome sports amateurs,\" he added. The executives of the Richemont-owned jewelry brands speak from experience. The 2012 Olympics, held in London, drove some serious shoppers to their boutiques in Paris, they said, although it was \"neutral\" overall for their businesses. Expecting a similar trend this year, they will focus on meeting their wealthy customers where they turn up. LVMH, the world's largest luxury group and an Olympic sponsor, is also basing its expectations on its experience during previous events in London and Beijing. \"It's usually quite neutral - although it makes our life a little bit more complicated when it comes to supplying products into our stores,\" said LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean Jacques Guiony. According to Reuters, a report commissioned by Paris 2024 last week flagged a possible \"crowding out\" effect whereby tourists that had planned to come to Paris go elsewhere, but said that it is hard to measure and to predict. France's governing fashion body, The Federation de la Haute Couture et la Mode, has moved the autumn 2024 haute couture fashion shows forward a week to June 24, straight after the menswear spring 2025 ready-to-wear events. Organizers are also doubling shuttle services between shows as final Olympic preparations are expected to snarl city traffic. Still, some fashion labels will only hold showroom presentations in Milan this season, due to \"logistical difficulties because of the Olympics\", Carlo Capasa, chairman of Italy's National Fashion Chamber, said. London retailers, which have suffered from a drop in tourist traffic with the end of UK tax-free shopping, are hoping to capture business from Paris, with preparations well underway at iconic stores Harrods and Selfridges. \"Paris has already been taken off the Chinese tour guide lists for this summer,\" said Harrods' managing director Michael Ward, who is expecting a significant boost. \"We've got to curate the product, we've got to be absolutely on our game to handle it,\" said Ward. The department store hopes to draw in shoppers with celebrations of its new Tiffany & Co. high jewelry boutique, designer pop-ups and exclusive products including two new 175th anniversary teddy bears designed by Italian jewelry label Bulgari and makeup label Charlotte Tilbury. Selfridges plans to attract locals as well as international visitors with sporting events such as a running club and is beefing up its offer of sportswear products. \"We are getting ready for a huge celebration of sport,\" said CEO Andrew Keith. Barcelona, meanwhile, is pitching itself as a laid-back alternative to the frenzied Olympic atmosphere in Paris. \"Spain can offer a more relaxed leisure and consumer experience than that which, for weeks, the host city and country of the Games will have,\" Spanish retail and food industry association AECOC told Reuters. Some tourists, including from the United States, who do visit the Games, which will mostly be held in venues throughout the French capital, are planning to extend their trips to visit other European countries. \"US travel data appears to imply a halo effect, as in addition to an increase in bookings in France for the Olympics, our data reflects an amplification of intra-European travel by Americans in Europe to certain destinations, such as Spain, Germany and Italy,\" travel agency eDreams told Reuters. Italian luxury group Prada is not looking at big acquisitions as it is focused on the brands it already owns, its Chief Executive Andrea Guerra said on Monday. Speaking at the FT Luxury Summit in Venice, Guerra added that he expected a positive surprise this year from the US market for the luxury sector, Reuters reported. \"I'm cautiously positive about the US. I think that Prada has a relationship with the American consumer, but maybe we have been a little bit under represented as a business there. So we've got homework to do,\" he added. The CEO - appointed in January 2023 to lead the company as the next generation of its founding family gets ready to pick up the reins - said he did not know when the change at the helm would take place. Lorenzo Bertelli, one of the two sons of Prada's founders Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, is expected to be appointed CEO after Guerra. In first quarter results published last month, Prada defied a slowdown across the luxury sector, reporting booming demand for its high fashion brand Miu Miu and continued growth in Asia. Luxury group Cartier-owner Richemont announced a rejig of its top management on Friday, promoting the head of its Van Cleef & Arpels jewellery brand to group chief executive, saying it was returning to a more traditional management set-up. Nicolas Bos, who has led a sales surge at Van Cleef, will take over from Jerome Lambert, who will stay on at Richemont as Chief Operating Officer. The Swiss-listed company made the announcement as it reported a smaller than expected fall in fourth quarter sales. It shares rose 6% on the Zurich exchange. Chairman Johann Rupert said that the company was reinstating the traditional CEO role, folding the jewellery brands into the rest of the role's responsibilities, which also covers high-end Swiss watches, fashion and accessories, Reuters reported. He noted it was important to be led by an executive from the \"client-facing side”. \"If you’re going to run Richemont you’d better understand the consumer\" Rupert told analysts, who were enthusiastic about the promotion. \"Nicolas has developed Van Cleef & Arpels into a power house, and, in our view, is entirely credible as the future leader of the Group,\" said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. The announcement came as Richemont, whose Swiss watch brands include Piaget and Jaeger-LeCoultre, said sales fell 1% to 4.80 billion euros ($5.21 billion) in the three months to the end of March. In constant currencies, sales rose 2%,which was a slowdown from the 8% rate in the previous quarter but was slightly ahead of a consensus forecast for 4.78 billion euros cited by RBC. The performance confirmed a downward trend in the luxury sector which has been buffeted by tepid Chinese demand and comparisons with last year, when the lifting of COVID-19 curbs in China supercharged sales. Globally, customers have also become more selective about expensive purchases as the costs of living rises. \"Overall a decent set of numbers and final quarter constant currency growth is reassuring given the souring sentiment among luxury goods buyers and a difficult comparable,\" said Jon Cox at Kepler Cheuvreux. However, weakness in the Asia Pacific in the final quarter, down 12%, is worrying, he added noting that unless the China consumer comes back, demand for luxury goods is going to be more muted for the industry than otherwise expected. Adidas is launching cheaper versions of its three-striped shoes like the white and black suede Samba as it aims to spread the trend, CEO Bjorn Gulden said on Thursday at the company's annual shareholders' meeting in Germany. \"It's important to understand that not everyone can afford to buy a shoe for 120 or 150, but everyone wants to take part in the same trends,\" Gulden told investors in a presentation in Furth, near Adidas' headquarters in Herzogenaurach. Adidas will offer similar versions of the Samba and other shoes for $60 to $80, more affordable entry points than the $100 to $150 price tag for the main shoe lines, according to a presentation slide shown by Gulden. \"What we do at the top, 100 and higher, we're bringing that down. So, for Foot Locker, for Intersport, and for Deichmann, we've also got something to offer,\" Reuters quoted Gulden as saying. Britain's Burberry reported a 34% drop in annual operating profit on Wednesday after it faced the challenge of repositioning its brand to take it more upmarket against a backdrop of slowing luxury demand. It said its like-for-like sales fell 12% in the final quarter, wiping out gains made earlier in the year, Reuters said. Chief Executive Jonathan Akeroyd said that while the financial results underperformed the company's original expectations, it had made good progress refocusing its brand. \"We are using what we have learned over the past year to fine tune our approach, while adapting to the external environment,\" he said, adding that he remained confident Burberry could be the \"Modern British Luxury\" brand. He said Burberry expected the first half of its current financial year to remain challenging, but it expected to see the benefit of the actions it was taking from the second half. For one night only, the utilitarian, concrete basement of London's Tate Modern museum was transformed into a lush green jungle Monday — and it was the hottest fashion ticket in town. Luxury Italian fashion house Gucci hosted its star-studded cruise collection catwalk at the Thames-side modern art museum, showing a series of delicate sheer outfits, relaxed denim and daywear, all adorned with the brand's coveted leather bags and other accessories with the double-G logo. Actors Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott and singers Dua Lipa and Solange Knowles were among celebrities perched on the front row. Also in attendance were Salma Hayek and her husband, Francois-Henri Pinault, who is chair and CEO of Kering, Gucci’s parent company. The big-budget event displayed the first cruise collection by Sabato De Sarno, who was named Gucci's creative director last year and debuted his womenswear designs in September. Gucci normally stages its shows in Milan, but like other fashion powerhouses it chooses locations around the world to show off its cruise collections — the shows in between the main spring and autumn displays. On Monday, models meandered down a runway that wound its way around hundreds of ferns, overhanging plants and mossy paths, the mass of green a contrast to the grey, industrial show space. De Sarno said that contrast extends to his latest designs, which paired luxurious evening looks and floral embroidery with casual jackets and slouchy denim. And what of the footwear? Comfort comes first, with all outfits, even the most glamorous evening gowns, paired with Mary Jane shoes, ballet flats or platform loafers worn with little white socks. “Rigor and extravagance, strength in delicacy, Englishness with an Italian accent,” the show notes read. De Sarno featured a few checked jackets in a nod to British style, though some other designs were a much more subtle tribute. Dresses and coats covered with squares made of a shimmering bead fringe were a reference to Scottish plaids. The fashion house has a little-known historical link to the UK. Its founder, Guccio Gucci, had a stint working as a bellhop in the Savoy, the luxury London hotel, more than a century ago. The brand says Guccio took inspiration from that experience when he opened his first store in Florence in 1921 to sell luggage. The rest, as they say, is history.",

        "content": "ZEBULON, N.C. ( WNCN ) — After losing their newborn son, a North Carolina couple is working to save premature babies from a deadly condition that many people have never even heard of, necrotizing enterocolitis. Meghan and Cameron Parker said the first warning signs came at their 20-week ultrasound appointment. “We were just having an easy, smooth sailing, exciting pregnancy that just turned really quickly,” Meghan recalled. The ultrasound showed some concerns with their son’s brain, spine and bowels. While a blood test eased their worst fears, their relief was short-lived. Meghan developed severe pre-eclampsia. Her blood pressure spiked to dangerous levels forcing doctors to deliver the baby, whom the Parkers named Titus, three months early. “They’re like, ‘He’s super, super small. We have no idea what’s gonna happen when he comes out of the womb,'” Cameron remembered doctors telling them. They feared he might not survive the delivery. “Titus really defied the odds,” Cameron said. The baby entered the world tiny, but full of life. “They cut the cord and then Titus just starts blaring out crying, which is huge because you know, he was only at 1 pound and 6 ounces,” noted his dad. For a baby as small as Titus, every day was a battle. He went through surgeries and procedures, and even dealt with a perforated bowel, but he seemed to be doing as well as he could be. Then things took another turn. He was diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis, also known as NEC. The disease affects a baby’s intestines. Most cases occur in preemies and the death rate can be as high as 50%. “He was definitely fighting and had a lot of energy for a baby who’s super, super tiny and super sick,” noted Meghan. Despite his toughest fight and doctors’ best efforts, Titus kept getting sicker. “What NEC does is it attacks the abdomen, but then once it progresses, it begins to move to the lungs and, and so he actually developed a collapsed lung,” Cameron explained. “It can spread into the bloodstream, cause the heart, cause the lungs, cause other organs to stop working.” “It’s your worst fear coming true right in front of your eyes,” Meghan said. Twenty-eight days after he was born, Cameron held his son for the first time. Titus was surrounded by love as he took his last breaths. “You just feel so helpless as a parent,” recalled Meghan. “There is nothing you can do to help them and protect them, but also having him in our arms was exactly where we wanted him to be.” The grief felt unbearable, but the strength Titus showed in his short life inspired the Parkers to fight for other babies. They created the Titus Strong Foundation to raise awareness about NEC and to raise funds for research. The foundation is partnering with researchers at UNC Children’s, including Dr. Misty Good, the Division Chief of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, who is working to find new ways to diagnose and treat the condition before it becomes deadly. “Titus’s impact is far beyond anything we could have ever imagined,” Cameron said. “And to know that lives and families are going to be saved and cared for by what we’re going to be doing, you can’t really put words to it.”",

        "content": "...Says Provision Of Rural Infrastructure Generated Nearly 60,000 Jobs Chibuzor ABUJA – Senator Abubakar Kyari, Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, has said that agricultural sector injected an estimated value of N309billion into the Nigerian economy in the last one year. Kyari, who stated this on Monday in Abuja at the ministerial media briefing on the sectoral update of one year anniversary of President Bola Tinubu’s administration, said the money was injected into the country’s economy through the harvest of agricultural produce. He noted that the provision of rural infrastructure, such as the construction of 77.8km of asphalt roads; construction of 130.9 km of earthen roads; provision of 102 motorised and solar-powered boreholes and installation of 6,504 solar street lights, generated nearly 60,000 jobs in various rural economies. Enumerating some of the major achievements of the present administration in the last one year, kyari said his ministry had launched dry season farming with cultivation of 118,657 hectares of wheat in 15 states in acceleration of all- year- round farming in a bid to ensure food and nutrition security. He noted that at the end of dry season farming, that one of the participating States, Jigawa, had produced 55,000 metric tonnes of wheat. He disclosed that the Federal Government has also supported 107,429 wheat farmers with inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, resulting in output of 474,628 metric tonnes. In response to Presidential directive, the minister said 42,000metric tonnes of assorted food commodities made up of maize, millet, sorghum and garri, from the National Strategic Food Reserve were released to National Emergency Management Agency(NEMA) for onward distribution to vulnerable Nigerians. As part of measures to reduce escalating prices of food items in the markets, Kyari said the Federal Government procured and distributed 58,500 metric tonnes of milled rice to all states of the Federation and Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. To reduce malnutrition and stunted growth among children, he stated that the Federal Government had embarked on fortification of crops with Vitamin A micro-nutrient to enrich nutrition content and health value of food commodities. In response to persistent food inflation, the minister said the Federal Government distributed 60,432mt of improved seeds, 887,255mt seedlings, 138numbers of value kits, 501,726 litres of agrochemicals, 62,328.5 metric tonnes of inorganic fertilizers, 1,000kg fungicide, and 33,200 equipment to farmers across different value chains to enhance production. He revealed that the ministry also received 2.15 million bags of fertilizer from the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) for distribution to farmers free of charge, adding that the distribution of the farm input has begun across the States. As part of measures to guarantee the protection and safety of farmers in their farm lands, he stated that there has been an improvement of farmland security with provision of additional resources to Agro Rangers and other security agencies. On livestock production and animal health, the minister stated the Federal Government had in the last one year procured and distributed 14,056,467 doses of anthrax spore, foot and mouth diseases vaccines for risk-based vaccination exercise in 22 high-risk states across Nigeria. According to him, there have been establishment of animal health centres and veterinary hospital, six micro earth dams and eight boreholes, 164 milk collection centres, eight cottage feed mills and seven livestock centres. The minister further revealed that President Bola Tinubu was in the process of launching Renewed Hope Livestock Programme that would address the nagging issue of farmer-herder clashes. On Mechanisation, Kyari explained that the ministry had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with John Deere and Tata Africa to assemble in-country and supply 10,000 tractors with implements and accessories at 2,000 units yearly, as well as 100 units of combine harvesters to support production. He pointed out that the Federal Government had partnered with Brazilian government with the sum 995,000 Euros to provide mechanisation hubs across the federation. Against the backdrop of these achievements in the first year of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Kyari underscored the the need for consolidation and scaling up of the achievements as well as development of the agro-industrial and agro-tourism sector. He emphasised the need for repositioning and recapitalisation of Bank of Agriculture and Nigerian Agricultural Insurance Corporation for access to credit and de-risking agricultural production as well as the strengthening of some institutions and agencies including National Agricultyral Development Fund, Universities, Research Institutions and Colleges of Agriculture to improve agricultural production, food security and boost export potentials.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel’s close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire.

Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Despite states and federal governments’ assurances to the people to go about their normal daily activities especially on Mondays in the five states of the South East geopolitical region, business activities have continued to be in their lowest ebbs, no thanks to the unending “ ” called by the proscribed Indigenous Peoples Of Biafra (IPOB) since 2017. Prompt News can confirm that except in the capital cities of Umuahia in Abia; Awka in Anambra; Abakiliki on Ebonyi, Enugu City in Enugu and Owerri in Imo states where the sit-at-home order is not being made manifest, the people in the towns and villages are not so lucky as activities are grounded to a halt on Mondays. For example, Chief Igwe Amajuoyi, a building materials shop owner at Orie-agu in Ehime Mbano local government area of Imo state did not open his shop today (Monday) as has been the case in the past weeks for the fear of the unknown. According to him it is a risky affair to open for business on Mondays because of incessant attacks by the Unknown Gun Men (UGM) who he said strike without notice since the sit-at-home started, pointing out that they are opposed to seeing any shop in the South East geopolitical region opened on Mondays. “My brother, we are used to closing our shops on Mondays because of the bad boys. For many years now, we have been observing every Monday as public holiday. In fact economic activities including business, social, religious and political activities are grounded on Mondays despite the assurances by states and federal governments”, Amajuoyi said. Also, a federal government worker who lives in Owerri, Imo state capital who does not want his name in the media confirmed that both Federal and Imo State Government Secretariats located along Port Harcourt-Elele road operated at half capacity on Mondays because staff who leave outskirts of the city do not make it to office on Mondays because of none availability of commercial transport to convey them to work. The situation is the same in Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Abia states where inter-state transportation are almost grounded today as most commercial drivers stayed off the road especially those driving states-owned transport vehicles like Abia Transport Corporation (Abia Lines), Imo Transport Company (ITC), Ebonyi Transport Ltd (Ebotrans) Enugu State Transport Company (ENTRACO) and Transport Company Of Anambra State (TRACAS). They claim that they are the targets of the agitators who see them as “working against the interests of their people” and will attack them and sometimes burn their vehicles in the process of enforcing the sit-at-home order. Meanwhile, fear and confusion have enveloped the South-East zone as two separatist groups, IPOB, headed by their detained leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (MNK) and Simon Ekpa’s Biafra Republic In Exile (BRGIE) issued conflicting directives on the sit-at-home to celebrate this year’s ‘Biafra Heroes Day’, plunging the region into a state of uncertainty. This is even as the relevant federal government security agencies have issued stern warnings to the secessionists, daring them to carry out their threats. Recall IPOB has been celebrating ‘Biafra Heroes Day’ on May 30 since 2017 to honor those who died during the Civil War. The day is usually marked by a stay-at-home order across the South-East. According to multiple media reports this year is no exception as IPOB has asked everyone in Igboland to observe the day by staying at home and celebrating the men and women who died for them in the Civil War which started in 1967 and ended 1970. Announcing the one day stay-at-home order, IPOB, in a statement signed by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful, the group said: “Annually, we celebrate 30th of May as our heroes and heroines’ day when we remember the men and women who died that we may live, before, during, and after the Nigeria genocidal war against Biafrans between 1967 and 1970 and beyond and even until now. “Biafrans are asked to observe this one (1) day sit-at-home in reverence to the spirits of our departed heroes who fought for us to be alive today...To that effect, IPOB directs all schools, government offices, private offices, banks, transport unions, market unions and private individuals to shut down all operations in honor of our heroes and heroines on Thursday, May 30, 2024.” But BRGIE disagreed with IPOB on a date for sit-at-home. In a statement, the self-acclaimed Prime Minister of BRGIE, Simon Ekpa, stated that sit-at-home in the region would commence from May 29 to 31, 2024. He said, “There will be sit-at-home in Biafraland on the following dates to enable Biafrans vote in the last phase of stage one self-referendum voting. “29th May, 2024, sit at home and vote; 30th May, 2024 Biafra Day, sit at home and vote; 31st May, 2024, sit at home and vote.” As the two groups give confliction orders, citizens are left bewildered, unsure of who to obey, and fearful of the repercussions of making the wrong choice, setting the stage for a potentially explosive showdown. Not even the assurances by the relevant federal government security agencies that they are on top of the situation and that people should go about their lawful businesses could allay the fears of the masses. Rather, warnings by the security authorities to the Biafran groups are putting the already frightened people on the edge.",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Tribunal affirms Ododo as Kogi governor, dismisses forgery allegations Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Tribunal affirms Ododo as Kogi governor, dismisses forgery allegations Published on May 27, 2024 By Fadehan Oyeyemi The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Monday affirmed Usman Ahmed Ododo as the lawfully elected governor of Kogi State. The tribunal dismissed the petition filed by the Social Democratic Party, SDP and its governorship candidate, Murtala Ajaka. The judgment was passed by the three-member panel of the tribunal, led by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had declared the candidate of the All Progressive Congress, APC, Usman Ododo, as the winner of the election conducted on November 11, 2023. The State Returning Officer, Prof Johnson Urama, who is the Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Academics, of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka announced Ododo as the winner on Sunday, November 12, 2023. He announced that Ododo polled 446,237 votes, to beat his closest rival, Murtala Ajaka of the SDP who scored 259,052, while Dino Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) polled 46,362 votes. However, the petitioners approached the tribunal and sought to overturn the election results on various grounds ranging from alleged over-voting and forgery of personal documents submitted to INEC to secure clearance to participate in the election. They applied for an order directing INEC to conduct a fresh election in five local government areas. Ajaka’s legal team led by Jibrin Okutepa, SAN had predicted the petition on the grounds of alleged forgery, overvoting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act. The petitioners alleged that over-voting occurred in 5 local government areas of Kogi State including Adavi, Okene and Okehi among others. But the APC legal team led by Emmanuel Ukala challenged the competence of the witnesses presented by the petitioners. Counsel for INEC, Kanu Agabi (SAN) on his own maintained that the witnesses presented by the petitioner were incompetent because “they are not the makers” of the electoral documents they submitted as exhibits. The respondents maintained that the exhibits touching on forgery and overvoting are “mere photocopies” that cannot be relied upon by any court. However, in the judgment, Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu held that from the decisions of the Supreme Court on the 2023 presidential and governorship elections, statements of witnesses must be filed along with a petition and not during the hearing of a petition. “The petitioners have failed to file their witness statements (PW1) on oath along with the petition, within the given time,” the Chairman said while expunging the exhibits tendered by the petitioners. He added that “the piece of oral evidence made by the petitioner’s witnesses are hearsay evidence” as they are not the makers of the exhibits tendered before the tribunal. The tribunal, while dismissing the petition, affirmed the election of Ododo. Ododo took over from former Governor Yahaya Bello after serving as Auditor-General for Local Governments in Kogi State.

Acuna Jr. left the game. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list on Monday after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury in the Braves' 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña's second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL on July 20, 2021 . Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases, becoming the first player to have at least 40 homers and 70 steals in a season. The 26-year-old from Venezuela was hitting .250 with four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 steals this season. The Braves recalled outfielder J.P. Martinez from Triple-A Gwinnett and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Catcher Sean Murphy, who suffered a strained left oblique muscle on March 30, was activated from the injured list. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list on Monday after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury in the Braves' 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña's second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL on July 20, 2021 . Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases, becoming the first player to have at least 40 homers and 70 steals in a season. The 26-year-old from Venezuela was hitting .250 with four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 steals this season. The Braves recalled outfielder J.P. Martinez from Triple-A Gwinnett and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Catcher Sean Murphy, who suffered a strained left oblique muscle on March 30, was activated from the injured list. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb The Associated Press",

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Utility Stores Corporation (USC) has proposed the largest Prime Minister package in the Pakistan’s history for the upcoming financial year, seeking Rs 85 billion in the budget, ARY News reported on Monday, citing well informed sources. Sources close to the development disclosed that the USC has proposed Rs 12 billion for the Prime Minister’s Ramadan package next year. Additionally, Rs 73 billion have been requested to cover the remaining 11 months of the next financial year with an average of Rs 6.64 billion per month. However, sources close to the government officials indicated that it is unlikely the utility stores will receive the full amount they have sought in the financial proposal, while, the Finance Ministry is set to finalize the proposals related to funding for the Prime Minister’s relief package. The proposal includes continuing subsidies on five basic commodities including sugar, flour, ghee, pulses, and rice for Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) consumers under the new financial year’s Prime Minister’s package. The current Prime Minister’s relief package at utility stores is scheduled to end on June 30, and the new proposals aim to ensure continued support for essential commodities to aid low-income households.",

        "content": "The Executive Director of the National Films and Video Censors Board, Shaibu Husseini, has said that contrary to widespread reports, the Board did not ban money rituals and smoking scenes in movies and other videos. Husseini, a seasoned journalist and film critic, noted that the Board had no intention to stifle creativity but to classify movies properly. Media reports had stated that Husseini made the pronouncement at a stakeholder engagement event on ‘smoke-free Nollywood’ in Enugu State. However, in a statement released during the week, he said, “What I mentioned in a speech that I have shared here is the existence of a regulation (NFVCB Regulations 2024) that, in line with global best practices, prohibits the Promotion and glamourisation of Money Ritual, Ritual Killing, Tobacco, Tobacco product, Nicotine products in movies, musical videos and skits. “The regulation aims at discouraging the ‘unnecessary’ depiction, promotion, advertisement, or glamourisation of tobacco or nicotine products in movies, musical videos, and skits. The regulation demands the display of a health warning for necessary smoking scenes that are required for historical accuracy or educational purposes and to depict a negative lifestyle in movies, musical videos, and skits. The required health warning shall be displayed at the commencement of the work and the end.” He added, “Any movie, skit, or musical video that displays or depicts tobacco or nicotine products, brands, or use that is necessary to the realisation of a narrative shall be given the appropriate classification (rating) and shall not be shown to persons below the age of 18. So there is no truth in the ‘headlines’ (that went viral).” Meanwhile, at a media parley held recently in Lagos, Husseini outlined some of his plans for the organisation. Clarifying his mission at the Board, he said, “Ultimately, I have come with my management staff to make sure that we run a very responsive censorship organisation. One that is responsive to stakeholders, society, and the government that set it up.” He added that in celebration of the NFVCB’s 30th anniversary, three publications will be released; each one to mark 10 years of the censors board. He added, “This is also because of the cry for data. We have received information from universities, both local and foreign, asking us for films that have been classified and other information. These publications will contain information on all the films that have been classified from 1994 till date.” Reiterating a shift in focus from ‘censorship’ to ‘classification’, Husseini said, “When I checked all around the world, I discovered that they have moved from censorship to classification. Even in Britain, it is British Board of Classification. In Kenya, it is classification board, the same thing with South Africa. This is why I believe that there is a need for us to move from the regime of censorship to classification. So, I sat with my management and we agreed that it was time for us to move from censorship to classification.”",

        "content": "A pilot and passenger emerged unscathed from a light plane that made a dramatic crash landing in Australia after flying perilously close to houses in suburban Sydney. The Cessna plane lost power during the flight on Sunday, forcing the pilot to make a mayday call to report an engine problem and glide its way back home, CNN affiliate Nine News reported. Footage above from Nine News showed the plane coming dangerously close to trees and buildings as the pilot steered the stricken aircraft towards Bankstown Airport in Sydney’s southwest. “It was gliding, there was no power,” pilot Jake Swanepoel told Nine News. “We clipped the trees, and we just made it over the hanger.” Swanepoel managed to land the plane on an airport taxiway, where it skidded to a stop on its belly. Swanepoel told Nine News that he retracted the landing gear because the plane was so low he thought it might hit the roofs of houses as the aircraft made its nerve-wracking approach. Ground staff dashed to assist them, but Swanepoel and his partner Karin climbed out of the aircraft unscathed. “We didn’t think we were going to make this landing strip here,” Karin told Nine News. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau told CNN that it is gathering further information about the landing before deciding whether to launch an investigation. That would include seeking a report from the pilot, who’s been flying for 29 years, according to Nine News. “It was scary and nerve-wracking because you were thinking about all these homes... if you don’t make the runway,” Karin said. When asked how they would celebrate reaching the runway, Swanepoel joked saying “nothing, just be alive.”",

The investigation is on and the culprits will be brought to book at any cost. The Congress treats people of all sects equally, but no one can take the law into their hands. The government is committed to punish the culprits.\" Asked about the progress of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) inPrajwal Revanna’s case, he said: \"I would not like to comment on this. The state government can take any action within the country but the Centre has to be more proactive in cases where the accused is abroad. The Home Minister is overseeing the case.\" He sidestepped a question if he was visiting New Delhi to finalise the Legislative Council candidates, but just confirmed his trip to the national capital. To a query on unpaid bills for the Prime Minister’s stay at a Mysuru hotel, Shivakumar said he did not have any information on it. On JD-S state chief H.D. Kumaraswamy’s statement that some Congress leaders are pimps, he said: “I don’t know what Kumaraswamy has said. Let me understand what he has said and then reply.\"",

        "content": "Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner start French Open with straight-set victories PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek has started her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean. Monday's win stretched Swiatek's winning streak to 13 matches. She put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Jannik Sinner also won in straight sets Monday. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris was scheduled to play Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Braves' Acuña is placed on IL after suffering a 2nd season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn ACL in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña’s second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09. Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Davis Riley gets 1st individual PGA Tour win by 5 at Colonial in final group with Scheffler FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Davis Riley shot even-par 70 while playing in the final group with Scottie Scheffler, and still won Colonial by five strokes over the world’s No. 1 player and Keegan Bradley. It is Riley's first individual victory on the PGA Tour. Riley finished at 14-under 266. Bradley had a closing 67 Sunday, and Scheffler shot 71. Riley began the day with a four-stroke lead, and gave up one stroke with a bogey on the second hole. But that was the closest Scheffler or anybody else would get all day. The 27-year-old Riley’s only other PGA Tour win came with Nick Hardy to win the Zurich Classic team event in New Orleans last year. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "description": "EU officials fear that the continent can no longer rely on the US defense umbrella Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to unveil a plan this week for closer cooperation on strengthening Europe’s air defense systems, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing sources. The German and French leaders are set to discuss the initiative on Tuesday, people familiar with the matter told the outlet. Macron arrived in Germany on Saturday on a three-day state visit. Sources told Bloomberg that the leaders will also address plans to add a new European air defense system to complement the German-led European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI). The idea of creating a pan-EU air defense shield was originally proposed by Scholz in 2022, amid concerns over European nations’ limited ability to counter the Russian 9K720 Iskander ballistic missile system. The ESSI incorporates Israeli Arrow 3 and US Patriot missiles, as well as the German-made IRIS-T, and has the backing of 21 countries. France has argued, however, that the program relies too much on non-European equipment and technology. Paris is also reportedly unhappy that the French-Italian SAMP-T system was excluded from the ESSI. According to Bloomberg, another option would be to join a similar project proposed by Greece and Poland this month, which has been backed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. While the exact details of are still under discussion, Bloomberg’s sources “emphasized the importance of Europe showcasing its strength and commitment to defense before NATO allies meet in Washington DC in July.” France has been calling for an EU-made solution, with Macron reportedly saying last month that Europe can no longer rely on the American security umbrella, and that it needs its own credible defense strategy. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European nations – particularly Poland and the Baltic states – have talked up the need to bolster defences against the perceived Russian threat. Moscow has denied that any such threat exists. In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Western politicians’ “claims that we are going to attack Europe after Ukraine” as “utter nonsense and intimidation of their own population just to squeeze money out of them.” Russia has repeatedly warned that Western arms deliveries will only prolong the Ukraine conflict, and maintains that the crisis was sparked by the expansion of NATO along Russia’s borders, which it views as an existential threat.",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Europe (France) Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference, spearheaded by Guangdong, Hong Kong SAR, and Macao SAR, convened in Paris on May 24th (local time). Over 400 delegates from various sectors of the French business community participated in the event. Currently, approximately one-third of French enterprises operating in China have opted to establish their presence in Guangdong, including notable names like EDF Energy, Danone, and Sanofi. Garault expressed his view that the GBA stands as the premier destination for foreign firms entering the Chinese market. According to data released by the Guangdong Sub-Administration of the General Administration of Customs of China, trade between France and Guangdong Province amounted to 24.86 billion RMB in the first quarter of this year, marking an 11.1% increase year-on-year. In early May, both China and France issued a joint declaration pledging to enhance cooperation in global governance concerning artificial intelligence. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster has consistently ranked second in a list published by the World Intellectual Property Organization for the past four years, showcasing its robust innovation ecosystem. Ducrot highlighted the Greater Bay Area as an optimal locale for collaborative projects between France and China, particularly in software and hardware development, electronics, and artificial intelligence, owing to its flourishing tech industry and abundant talent pool. He emphasized the mutually beneficial nature of Franco-Chinese cooperation, foreseeing its positive impact on other nations’ development. Preliminary figures indicate the conclusion of 36 bilateral investment and trade projects valued at $3.22 billion USD between France (and Europe) and the Greater Bay Area during the conference. Of this sum, France (and Europe) will invest $1.59 billion USD in the GBA, while the GBA will reciprocate with $1.47 billion USD in investments in France (and Europe).",

        "description": "Woodside High School senior Aaron Lin was recently named a Gates Scholar. He was one of 750 recipients of the award this year — out of more than 50,000 applications.",
        "content": "NEWPORT NEWS — Aaron Lin has already prepared his valedictorian speech. The 18-year-old Woodside High School student has one big piece of advice for fellow students: Structure your time. He wants them to envision their life in five or 10 years and then create a path to get there. Even if their goals change, he says, the structure will take them where they need to go. Lin knows what he’s talking about. He’s been managing his time since he was a child, at first with the help of his parents, then later on his own. It has allowed him to be involved in a variety of extracurricular activities at school, help out at his family’s restaurant, serve as the student liaison to the school board, volunteer within the community, keep up with his studies — and still find time to enjoy archery and watching classic movies. And it has all paid off. Lin was recently named a Gates Scholar. The award means he has a full ride to Yale University, where he plans to study economics and statistics. “The experience was a little bit surreal,” Lin said about finding out he won the award. He was one of 750 recipients this year, out of more than 53,000 applicants. “I was so proud of him,” said his mom, Jing Xiao. She said it’s a recognition of his hard work through high school. The Gates Scholarship, awarded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is given to “exceptional student leaders,” according to its website. Lin said being recognized for his leadership potential means the most to him. He will be the first in his family to attend college. He is interested in a career as a financial analyst. Xiao said it means a lot to her that her son will get this opportunity — she believes he will be a changemaker of this generation. The scholarship removes an enormous financial weight. Lin said he now won’t have to worry about getting a part-time job and he’ll have time to take extra classes or explore other interests at college. The experiences he’s had at Woodside — and the teachers and counselors who supported him — are a big part of his story, Lin said. Serving on the school board and watching as statewide issues were debated has been eye-opening. “The board exposed me to a lot of different problems, or conflicts, in the school system that we wouldn’t really notice in an everyday setting, and exposed me to more problems that we have to work towards solving in the future,” he said. “There’s a lot of groups of people who don’t have the voice or the platform to speak about what they feel. So it’s just a takeaway of trying to listen to more people and try to help as many as we can.” Lin has also prioritized supporting his family. He’s spent evenings and weekends at the family’s Jing Jing Asian Restaurant — running the cashier, cooking with the deep fryer, restocking produce, cleaning and sweeping. He’s also kept in touch with his Chinese roots, learning Mandarin and volunteering with the Peninsula Chinese American Association. Xiao, who came to America from China more than 20 years ago, said it was important that her children hold on to their culture. She said the connection to their heritage helps them define who they are. After graduation, Lin will go to Yale for a six-week summer session to participate in the First-Year Scholars program. The program allows new students to get a head start on coursework and meet other incoming freshmen. He’s looking forward to graduation next month and shared some more of his planned speech: “Every one of us has a different path. So some of us might become future engineers, doctors, maybe artists, musicians, any of those. But we all came from the same roots.” Nour Habib, nour.habib@virginiamedia.com",

Acuña suffered the injury in the Braves' 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.

Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases, becoming the first player to have at least 40 homers and 70 steals in a season. The 26-year-old from Venezuela was hitting .250 with four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 steals this season. The Braves recalled outfielder J.P.

MTN Uganda launched an initial public offering in October 2021, which concluded in November 2021. MTN Group that its Ugandan unit's initial public offering was undersubscribed, raising less than two-thirds of its target. In 2018, Uganda requested that MTN Uganda list some of its shares on the local stock exchange to renew its operating licence, stating that Ugandans should be able to own a stake in the company. Meanwhile, two months before MTN Uganda officially announced the start of the public sale, a March 2024 report that the telco is confident in its operations in Uganda and may sell an additional 7% of the company to the public. Following the official announcement, the offer would allow Ugandan retail and professional investors and MTN Uganda customers to own shares in the company. The telco stated that the minimum number of shares to be applied for is 1,400, but there is no maximum. Applications exceeding the minimum must be in multiples of 420 shares. Qualifying investors can buy shares online through the USE Easy Portal or in person with licenced stockbrokers and trading members. Furthermore, the shares cannot be sold to investors in countries where the transfer would be illegal or unenforceable and to investors in sanctioned countries. The telco also stated that at MTN Uganda's annual general meeting in May 2024, shareholders approved a final dividend payment of UGX 6.4 per ordinary share, totalling UGX 143.3 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. MTN's efforts to strengthen regulatory compliance in Uganda came two months after MTN Group as its new group executive for regulatory matters, effective April 1, 2024.

        "description": "Baytex Energy (TSX:BTE) stock fell 12% last month.The post How Baytex Energy Lost 12% Last Month appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "( ) stock declined from $5.36 to $4.72 over the last 30 days, for a roughly 12% decline in the span of a month. The decline was fairly unusual because BTE stock has been in an up-trend for the better part of five years. In 2020, the stock bottomed at $0.40. Since then, it has gained an impressive 1,080%, a market-beating return by any stretch of the imagination. It’s therefore worth exploring why the stock performed less well in May. Oil prices The biggest reason for Baytex Energy’s price decline over the last 30 days was a corresponding decline in the price of oil. 30 days ago, oil went for $84. At the time of this writing (Sunday evening), it was quoted at $77.89. That’s a 7.4% decline. Now, Baytex’s stock price declined more in this period than the price of oil did. You might think that irrational or a sign of BTE being oversold, but it might be an appropriate market response. A company’s profit is the amount of revenue left after all expenses are “cleared.” Because profit has to clear this “expense hurdle,” it swings more than revenue does, whether revenue moves up or down. If you have $6 in revenue and $1 in profit, then a 16.7% decline in revenue produces a 100% decline in profit — indeed, a swing from positive profits to mere breakeven status! If investors think that BTE’s profits are worth 12% less than they were a month ago with oil at $84, they may well be right. A 7% decline in a commodity price can cause a far greater than 7% impact on a commodity producer’s profits. So, BTE’s price decline in the last month was arguably the expected result of oil price fluctuations in the same period. Where are oil prices headed? A very worthwhile piece of information for BTE investors to have is the future price of oil. By “future price,” I mean the price in the future, not the price implied by the futures market — the two aren’t always the same. Such information would probably allow you to predict BTE’s price trajectory. However, predicting commodity prices isn’t easy, as they produce no cash flows, and their supply is heavily influenced by international politics, which is inherently unpredictable. However, it is known that top investors like Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn are currently betting on high oil prices. You could argue that the “smart money” factor points to higher oil prices in the future. Baytex’s earnings One factor that may also explain BTE’s performance over the last month is its earnings. The company put out a release that beat on revenue but missed on earnings per share (EPS). Although the company’s revenue growth was high at 67% year over year, it had negative earnings. The downward price momentum could have been a reaction to the negative earnings. However, operating cash flows doubled, and the company started paying its first in eight years just over a year ago. On the whole, it’s hardly game over for Baytex Energy.",

        "description": "Host Terry Crews and judges Simon Cowell and Howie Mandel all gave their thoughts on how Season 19 will be different.",
        "content": "The new season of NBC's America’s Got Talent is shaking things up in a major way. According to the new Season 19 rules, judges will now get two chances to use their golden buzzer. The golden buzzer is an award given to especially strong acts , guaranteeing a placement in the live shows. Previously, judges were only allowed to use their golden buzzer once during the audition rounds. Sofia Vergara, 51, teases Walmart swimwear collection with steamy shoot for 'spring break' Heidi Klum's daughter Leni found her 'sex closet' and didn't keep it to herself Host Terry Crews is in favor of the new rule, as he believes it gives judges and contestants more opportunities. “There’s so many times we needed to give a Golden Buzzer and you ran out,” he told Us Weekly in a recent interview. Crews elaborated that beforehand, judges were often hesitant to give their golden buzzer to deserving acts early in the audition process, as they wanted to hang on to their chance for later. “It’s kind of like running out of Halloween candy. You know what I mean? And people [are] still coming to the house. And you keep having to apologize. Not the season, not the season,” Crews said. “Everyone that needs and deserves [a Golden Buzzer] will be able to get one this year,” he added. The golden buzzer was introduced in season 9, and judge Howie Mandel thinks it enhanced the experience of the show. “When we first got note of the Golden Buzzer, originally, I thought, ‘Wow,’” Mandel said. “There are moments where you just go, ‘Wow,’ and your jaw just drops on that desk and you don’t know how to express it and the power of being able to say, ‘Wow,’ with your hand on a Golden Buzzer and push somebody right to the live shows was amazing,” he added. Mandel also said that the new double golden buzzer rule will make “this season epic.” Don't miss...

Judge Simon Cowell disclosed that his 10-year-old son, Eric, is “always curious” about the prestigious button, and even sometimes thinks his father uses it on the wrong act. “[He asks], ‘Did you press the Golden Buzzer? What was it? Why’d you do it? And sometimes he disagrees or, ‘Why did you give that the Golden Buzzer?’” Cowell said. Cowell also gave a preview of how the new rule is making the new AGT season even more exciting. \"In the first two days we’ve used more Golden Buzzers than we’ve ever used. That’s got to be a good sign!” he told People . Season 19 of America’s Got Talent premieres Tuesday, May 28 on NBC",

        "content": "The first winners of the Urdd Eisteddfod have been announced. The Maldwyn 2024 Urdd Eisteddfod got underway today with tens of thousands of people expected across Wales to celebrate Welsh language, culture and the talent of the nation's young people. And on the opening day Wanesa Kazmierowska from Swansea has been announced as Main Artist and Saffron Lewis from Pembrokeshire as the winner of the Art, Design and Technology Medal. The ceremony this year is sponsored by The James Pantyfedwen Foundation. The Main Artist receives the Young Artist Scholarship of £2,000 thanks to the generosity of the late Dr Dewi Davies and his family for the most promising work from an individual aged between 18-25 years old. READ MORE: Urdd Eisteddfod 2024 gets underway - pictures from the first day READ MORE: Wales has Europe's longest private beach but not many people go there The Art, Design and Technology Medal is awarded for the most promising work from amongst the national winners of all the year 10 to 19-year-old categories. Wanesa is 19 years old and studying for an Art and Design Foundation Diploma at Gower College in Swansea. Originally from Poland, she has been living in Swansea for more than 14 years. She has a confirmed place to study Illustration and Visual Media at UAL (University of the Arts London) next year and aspires to become a graphic artist/illustrator. Wanesa said: “I enjoy experimenting with various mediums and artistic styles to broaden my skills, specifically printmaking, digital art, and gouache painting.” She has had her art displayed in three galleries in Swansea, including the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery. She was awarded a bursary from the Swansea Print Workshop and participated in a project celebrating the 50th anniversary of the South Wales Miners' Library. Her print, titled \"The Descent/Descent,\" was one of the 20 selected prints and is currently exhibited at the Taliesin Arts Centre. The adjudicators for the competition were Jo Munton and Kate Morgan-Claire. In their adjudication they said: “The field of entries was broad, and standards were high, everyone clearly has a love for their chosen creative field and the things that inspire them. Wanesa has great focus about her work and how she would like to develop it. She articulated her ideas with such clarity that it was easy to see that she has lots of potential as an artist. Her ability to rouse emotions and tell a story though her image of the miner and the canary made this work stand out.” Saffron Lewis, winner of the Art, Design and Technology Medal, is an art and design student at Pembrokeshire College who will go on to study Fine Art at Cardiff Metropolitan University in September. She said: “My love for the arts started at a very young age and throughout the years it has grown. Experimenting with various different media and artistic processes keeps my passion alive. “The subject of my work is mainly organic and sustainable. I like to absorb the atmosphere of my surroundings to create energetic marks within my artwork. My practice includes a variety of media and I like to create interesting and unique pieces that have not been seen before; where the person who’s looking at the piece can create their own story.” The Art Medal is given in memory of Elain Heledd who inspired pupils at Llanegryn and Llanbrynmair and the Main Artist trophy for the scholarship prize was given by Rogers Jones Fine Art Auctioneers.

        "content": "A former St. Catherine Court House employee, arrested and charged for setting fire to the Parish Court Administrative building, was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison when he appeared before the Parish Court on Friday. The accused man, identified as Romario Gopaul, alias ‘Keith’, pleaded guilty to Arson, Larceny, and Office Breaking. Reports indicate that on July 24, 2022, fire was discovered emanating from the upper section of the Court office at Emancipation Square in Spanish Town. An alarm was raised, and the Fire Department was called. Upon their arrival, firemen discovered that the fire originated from the Civil Litigation Office. After extinguishing the fire, it was found that a safe inside the office was opened, and cash was stolen. Following an investigation, it was revealed that Gopaul, employed to the Court Administration Office, was behind the entire incident of fire and theft. He was subsequently arrested and charged. In his defense, his attorney, Esther Reid, informed the presiding judge that the accused man and the lives of his immediate family members were threatened by two armed men who ordered him to commit the act. However, the judge, noting that Gopaul should have known better because of his employment in the Court system, handed down a sentence of 10 and a half years for Arson and 4 and a half years for the Break-in and Larceny. The sentences will be served concurrently.",

The State Police Commissioner, Mr Usaini Gumel, gave the assurance on Monday during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, in Kano. “We are battle-ready to deal with any person or group of people tampering with the peaceful atmosphere our state is known for. “We have the ability and capacity to provide required security measures in our areas of supervision’’. He warned individuals who intended to bring in thugs into Kano from other parts of the country to have a rethink, saying the command would deal decisively with the situation. He reminded the public that the Constitution of Nigeria was clear about the responsibility of the police in providing internal security for Nigerians. “The police will not condone any act that can lead to chaos or violence in Kano State. “Adequate security personnel have been deployed to arrest anyone who attempts to disrupt the peace or break the law in the state’’, Gumel said. He reminded the residents of the state that no one was permitted to carry dangerous weapons around the Emir’s palace and Nasarawa, the Emir’s residence. “Rigorous stop-and-search and patrols are being conducted across all parts of the dissolved five Emirates’’, he said.

        "content": "HARARE – President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s unexpected announcement approving Starlink’s licensing to provide internet services in Zimbabwe has taken the Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services (ICT) ministry and the telecoms regulator by surprise. Both entities were unaware of the deal’s approval prior to the president’s statement. Mnangagwa revealed last Saturday that he had granted SpaceX permission to launch its Starlink internet services in Zimbabwe, in partnership with Wicknell Chivayo’s IMC Communications. This partnership underscores the president’s close relationship with the controversial dealer, evidenced by their recent shared presidential chopper ride to Bikita for the ZCC Easter service and Chivayo’s visit to Mnangagwa’s Precabe Farm in Kwekwe. Officials from the ICT ministry and the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) informed NewsDay that they were still reviewing Starlink’s application when the president made the announcement. ICT, Postal and Courier Services Minister Tatenda Mavetera told The Sunday Mail that Potraz had not yet finalized the operational modalities for the internet company. “We are soon going to announce the technical modalities together with Potraz. Already, there has been a pronouncement by the President, which will ensure that no one and no place is left behind,” she said. Potraz Director-General Gift Machengete also commented in the same publication, stating that the regulator was still consulting on Starlink’s licensing. His remarks highlighted a communication breakdown between his office and the presidency regarding the approval process.",

        "content": "YOUTH Ambassador Jervon Sands writes the first in a series of articles speaking to young Bahamians, talking about issues that affect the country. He starts by looking at the idea of cultural maintenance - and what that means for Bahamians. First, what is meant by cultural maintenance? This phrase has been rattling around in my head for some time now - allowing the following definition to develop. Cultural maintenance is the practice of a people, to nourish and make flourish that which has been established by nation building thereby supporting cultural evolution and innovations that benefit future generations. I fear that the stance of the Bahamian people post independence has mostly been one of premature satisfaction. It is only now, with the advent of adverse national and international conditions amplified by a rapidly warming climate, that many of us are awakening to the troubling realities threatening our nation. The creation story cautions against doing great work without any rest yet further engaging with the Bible text eventually reveals its antithesis: “Faith without works is dead.” In other words, resting always on faith without doing any work. Evidence of how Bahamian society subscribes to this way of being lies in the strong sense of faith and security afforded us by nation builders. This was on full display during last year’s Independence celebrations. And, yes, our nation builders are owed much praise, but simply celebrating their legacies without working to carry them on is not only a poor way to honour them, but also a sure way to squander their foundational efforts to build a better Bahamas. In Bahamian society today there has been a notable shift towards a culture of death. The climbing crime rate, growing economic disparity, mounting reports of gruesome fatalities, and alarming climate change catastrophes, collectively corroborate that unfortunate truth. These realities confirm that our culture, our heritage, our nation are crumbling. They have become dilapidated and are riddled with hazards stemming from structural irregularities in key pillars such as youth, education, and innovation. Nevertheless, hope remains a catalyst for change. Local and global youth movements have the potential to retrofit and revive our nation by engaging young people in the practice of cultural maintenance. Already, there are young Bahamian professionals eager to flood our society with fresh ideas and positive impacts that will help us overcome the present and coming challenges with our culture not only intact but stronger and better than ever before. I will be sharing perspectives from the following young Bahamian professionals in subsequent articles as I further explore the theme of cultural maintenance and its potential for positive impact on Bahamian society. Liam Miller: A young Bahamian economist who aims to innovate at the nexus of economic development and climate justice. Ashawnte Russell: A youth climate activist currently engaged in climate advocacy who works to integrate the Bahamas and the wider Caribbean into global climate response. Taylor Cargill: A 22-year-old conservation scientist whose passions lie in coastal and marine conservation, and in addressing intersectional climate justice issues. Erinique Johnson: A budding HR professional who is also an active youth leader within several Bahamian organisations that address issues of social and political significance. Please connect with these young Bahamian professionals via Linkedin if you have an interest in their work or would like to provide opportunities for them to continue strengthening The Bahamas within their respective fields. • Jervon Sands is one of the current Bahamian youth climate ambassadors. He aims to connect and engage Bahamian youth innovating in the climate space.",

Banton’s Long Walk to Freedom concert will be held on Saturday, July 13, 2024 at the UBS Arena in New York. Tickets will go on sale on Friday, March 31. Pre-sale tickets will be made available on Wednesday. Earlier this month, Banton reentered the United States of America for the first time since his arrest in the state almost 15 years ago. READ: Buju Banton back on US soil Buju Banton, whose real name is Mark Myrie, was arrested in Florida in 2009 on charges of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was released in December 2018 from the McRae Correctional Facility in Georgia. He was deported back to Jamaica where he received a warm welcome from thousands of fans at the National Stadium during his Long Walk to Freedom concert held in March 2019. Legal experts had posited that since Myrie was deported from the United States he would only be welcomed back on a temporary work visa, but not a visitor’s or non-immigrant one.",

        "description": "ON May 21, 2024, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) delivered its Advisory Opinion on climate change and international law, in a case led by two courageous leaders of Small Island States, Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda and former Prime Minister Kausea Natano of Tuvalu.",
        "content": "By Sir Ronald Sanders ON May 21, 2024, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) delivered its Advisory Opinion on climate change and international law, in a case led by two courageous leaders of Small Island States, Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda and former Prime Minister Kausea Natano of Tuvalu. ITLOS is an international court established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). It adjudicates disputes arising out of the interpretation and application of UNCLOS. The tribunal has jurisdiction over a wide range of maritime issues, including the protection and preservation of the marine environment, and it has the discretionary authority to issue advisory opinions. In 2021, at the COP Meeting in Glasgow, Browne and Natano, frustrated by the grindingly slow pace of countries to make substantial progress to curb Climate Change or to address its impacts on small islands, which are the greatest victims while being the least perpetrators, decided to move outside the COP to seek justice in international law. The two leaders co-founded the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (COSIS) as a vehicle for safeguarding the legal rights of their countries and their survival. COSIS assembled a group of international and experienced lawyers, headed by Professor Payam Akhavan to plead the case before ITLOS. Regrettably, despite approaches to all small island states, only seven others joined COSIS. The seven that joined were Palau, Naru, The Bahamas, Vanuatu, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Lucia. Nonetheless, Browne and Natano persisted. They established COSIS as an international organization with the UN and established Antigua and Barbuda as the depository for the treaty. By December 2022, COSIS submitted its request to ITLOS, essentially seeking an advisory opinion on the specific obligations of States, regarding the prevention, reduction, and control of marine environmental pollution stemming from climate change, as well as the protection and preservation of the marine environment in the context of climate change impacts. These matters have significantly impacted small island states. Scientific evidence shows that climate change — caused by CO2 emissions from the world’s largest industrial nations — has repeatedly and severely damaged them. There is little doubt that the stalled negotiations at COP concerning compensation for ‘loss and damage’ garnered a new momentum at the meeting in 2022, precisely because of the COSIS case before ITLOS which attracted the defensive participation of many of the big polluting nations. The sudden, but severely limited decision at COP in 2022 to establish a Committee to examine the modalities for a Fund, was an effort to stave off further legal action by SIDS. As it turned out, the COP meeting in 2023, received insufficient pledges to ensure the fund’s success. The cost of loss and damage for developing countries is projected to reach $400 billion per year by 2030 and the initial pledges made at COP28 are considered paltry in comparison to the scale of the challenge. Furthermore, the definition of “vulnerability” and the eligibility criteria for accessing the fund are still being negotiated. In any case, the ITLOS unanimous Advisory Opinion is a game changer. It is a significant event in the legal landscape related to climate change precisely because it will shape actions around climate change at both the international legal level and within the corporate sector. It will immediately affect the 168 States that are Parties to UNCLOS, but even states that are not party to UNCLOS, such as the US, recognise many of its provisions as forming part of customary international law. The Advisory Opinion delivered by ITLOS includes several critical points. It concluded that States Parties to the UNCLOS Convention have specific obligations under article 194 “to take all necessary measures to prevent, reduce, and control marine pollution from anthropogenic GHG emissions and to endeavour to harmonise their policies in this connection”; provides guidance as to states’ obligations in relation to climate change under UNCLOS; found that states have a due diligence obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment from the deleterious effects of climate change; the obligations of states to assist developing states; and affirms that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation. Importantly, oil companies and others have been brought into the legal ambit. The opinion underscores the evolving regulatory landscape concerning climate responsibility, and points to heightened scrutiny and regulatory enforcement concerning greenhouse gas emissions and environmental preservation. The further significance of the ITLOS Advisory Opinion is that it will be cited in national, regional and international courts on all matters related to climate change. Immediately, it will be taken into account by the Inter-American Court on Human rights, which is currently considering a case, ​brought in January 2023 by Chile and Colombia, for an Advisory Opinion to address the climate emergency within the framework of international human rights law. Similarly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is now considering a request from the UN General Assembly, prompted by Vanuatu, to provide an Opinion on the obligations of states regarding Climate Change. The ICJ will undoubtedly consider the ITLOS Opinion before rendering its own Opinion by January 2025. So, the ITLOS opinion has put a juggernaut in motion. The matter of the impact of Climate Change is no longer a matter for negotiation between powerful nations and weak states at COP – the stage is enlarged from a gladiatorial arena to include the precincts of law. The playing field is less uneven, and small island states are now imbued with a sense of hope and optimism. But both industrial nations and their companies, which profit worldwide, will fight back to preserve their advantages. Having seen that the law is on their side, all of the small states, including those that did not join the COSIS effort, should bind together to secure their own advantage, which the ITLOS Opinion has provided. • The writer is Antigua and Barbuda’s Ambassador to the US and the OAS.

        "content": "Nandurbar (Maharashtra): The electric lights that illuminate the Sardar Sarovar Dam are faintly visible from Maniveli, a village with denuded hills on one side and deep waters of Narmada on the other. In Maharashtra’s Nandurbar district, life has never been easy in the villages affected by the hydroelectric project built in Gujarat. “Due to dam-induced flooding, we were moved to different places four times. We were settled in our present village 32 years ago, but electricity did not reach us. We could not go out at night, children could not even study,” said 70-year-old Natwar Bhai Tadvi, a tribal resident of Maniveli. “If not for the solar lights installed eight years ago, we would have remained in the dark. Solar gave us hope in this atmosphere of despair,” added Natwar as he got his two acres crop-ready for the upcoming rainy season. The single solar panel installed in Natwar’s house powers two LED bulbs, thus reducing dependence on kerosene lamps. It was installed under a special action plan launched by Tribal Development Department and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited in 2012 to power unelectrified villages. Even access to potable water is difficult at Maniveli, with most of its area (padas) located far away on the mountains. For Romila Tadvi of Chapadipada, fetching water from Sardar Sarovar Reservoir is a tedious morning task. Like her, all residents of Chapadipada have to climb up and down a steep hill every day to bring water. According to the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16), 52.12% of tribal population in Nandurbar was multidimensionally poor. In the 2023 NITI Aayog report, 33.17% of the 65% tribal population in the district was multidimensionally poor. Both Natwar and Romila want a solar pump for irrigation and potable water, but they don’t know how to access it. They are unaware of the Mukhyamantri Saur Krushi Pump Yojana, which provides 95% subsidised solar pumps for irrigation. Agriculture sector takes up 32% of total electricity consumption in Maharashtra. According to the Economic Survey of Maharashtra, 2022-23, one lakh solar agricultural pumps have been commissioned under Saur Krushi Pump Yojana from 2018-19 to June 2022. It said that 45.86 lakh agricultural pumps were energised in the state till March 31, 2022. According to the report, under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM), 2 lakh solar pumps have been sanctioned for the state, of which 36,381 (23,396 of 3HP, 10,188 of 5HP and 2,797 of 7.5HP) have been installed by December 2022. Projects with 548 MW capacity have been commissioned under the Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana until 2022-23. In the second week of April, temperature in the bare Satpura hills of Nandurbar touched 42 degrees Celsius. At Genda, in the foothills of Satpura, Leela Pawara and her sister-in-law Urmila Pawar are picking mahua. In this season, mahua and mangoes are their main sources of income. Asked why she was not doing this work in the morning, Leela replied that the entire morning was spent fetching water from the river. A hand pump with a solar submersible motor is installed in front of Leela’s house, but it does not fetch water. During a field trip to Genda last year, 101Reporters saw people using solar pumps for irrigation. However, that has changed now. “We got solar pumps around five years ago. When grid electricity came here two years ago, people stopped using solar,” said Romal Pawara of Genda. According to Romal, the solar pumps had five years of warranty from the vendor company. Despite this, when farmers faced technical issues, it was not rectified. As repairs have to be done by users once the warranty expires, people gradually stopped using solar pumps. Digging of private borewells is not allowed in this forest area, so people have to depend on borewells provided by the government with solar pump schemes. However, most of them are dry due to groundwater depletion. In a study titled Socio-economic vulnerability to climate change — Index development and mapping for districts in Maharashtra, Nandurbar has been identified as vulnerable to drought and changing rainfall patterns, and most sensitive to extreme temperatures affecting crop production. Mangesh Pawara runs a small grocery shop at Adikodi Pada in Bilgaon of Dhadgaon block. The area has a solar dual pump for potable water and another solar pump for irrigation. “The panchayat installed them, but within a few days, both stopped working. The panchayat did not consider the need to repair them, while the residents could not afford the cost of repair,” Mangesh told 101Reporters. The residents once again had to fetch drinking water from the river, while they cultivated only rain-fed crops. “Till the time the pump was running, we used to grow two crops. Now we even have to pay for animal fodder. There is a crisis... Two of my cows died due to lack of fodder,” he added. In her local Pawari language, Sunita Ramesh Pawara of Swarya Digar summed up the issue typical of all the households here. “The only problem is that of water. If the family is big, more water is required. Our domestic animals and fields also need water, but there is no water.” Sunita had tried to extract water from the government hand pump by using three solar panels installed for lighting purposes. She bought a submersible pump at her own expense to connect it to the hand pump. But the three panels were not enough to run the pump, at least seven were needed. At Chikhali and Moongbari villages, where migration for work is high, only Sanjay Pawara had a solar pump initially. Within two to three years, others got their solar pumps and the water level plummeted. Now Sanjay has got an electric motor installed. “Every day, there is a glitch in the solar system. Moreover, a solar pump cannot draw water from a depth of more than 200 ft, so I had to switch to grid power,” claimed Dinesh Pawara of Moongbari, while harvesting peanuts with his family. For irrigating three acres, around Rs 15,000 has to be spent annually on electricity bill, which is a huge amount for small farmers like Dinesh. In case of motor failure in a dual pump, the cost of repair comes to Rs 30,000 to 35,000. If the panel is faulty, it costs Rs 8,000 to 10,000. Malfunctioning high mast lamps can be replaced at the panchayat’s expense. However, in case of severe malfunction, the panchayat does not pay attention to the complaints. Solar panels and high mast lamps in Satpura hills tell a lot about the perpetual energy’s penetration. However, unaware of the benefits of low-cost clean energy, the poor tribals are shifting to grid electricity. Falling groundwater table, technical issues and distrust in solar efficiency aid the shift. Not only in remote hilly areas, solar dual pumps are not working even in Dhadgaon town. Sanjay Gandhi tribal settlement of Dhadgaon faces severe water shortage. “The municipal council does not supply us with water. Three dual solar pumps for drinking water are present here, but no water comes out of them due to low water availability,” said Minish Pawara. At Pipalkhunta, Jal Jeevan Mission and Ground Water Survey and Development Agency have installed a 1 HP solar dual pump with a 5,000-litre tank to supply potable water to around 20 families. This was the only functional solar pump found in areas visited in Dhadgaon block and Akkalkuwa block’s Molgi region. Efforts to reach Nandurbar District Council and Maharashtra Energy Department seeking data on the total number of solar pumps installed in Nandurbar for drinking water and agriculture, the number of the functional pumps, and the reason for non-functioning were not successful. The place where a solar dual pump is installed under Mukhyamantri Saur Krushi Pump Yojana is surveyed by three agencies — the Ground Water Survey Department, vendor company and representatives of Mahaurja (discom) — keeping in mind whether groundwater will be available throughout the year. Yet, most of the pumps run dry. Over a dozen solar providers have launched services in Nandurbar to cater to the demand in the last three years. Maharashtra government plans to create 25,000 jobs in the solar sector by 2050. Rajput Solar provides solar panel installation and technical services. Its director Nandu Rajput said that solar has expanded widely in the district’s hilly areas in the last three years, with around 4,000 pumps installed under the government schemes. “A pump may malfunction due to depleting groundwater, motor blockage, or battery or starter problem, but tribals do not know how to register complaints online. The hilly area also makes it difficult to provide service. Small problems can be resolved at the panchayat level, but that does not happen,” Nandu detailed. Prasad Kulkarni, director, Gram Oorja, a Pune-based organisation that works on solar energy in tribal and rural areas, said that technical support should ideally be available at the local level, which will also provide local employment. Maharashtra has the potential to generate up to 1.5 million units per year through solar photovoltaic systems and up to 2.5 million units per year through solar thermal systems. There are 250 to 300 days of clear sunshine. An average of 4 to 6 kWh/ m2 of radiation is available per day. Dhulia, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts receive more radiation, at about 6 kWh/m2 per day. Ashwin Gambhir, research fellow, Prayas Energy Institute, has written in an article that the Maharashtra government is working towards a 9,000 MW distributed solar capacity dedicated to supplying reliable daytime electricity to agriculture, which would be the largest in India. As of now, damaged and unused solar panels dumped on rooftops or in a corner of the house is a recurring sight in Nandurbar district. A strong technical service network with a local focus should be the first line of action to bring back the solar shine. Get real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now. Prev Post",

        "content": "Russia will remove the Taliban from a list of banned terrorist organisations, three years after they returned to power in Afghanistan, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said Monday. Russia has for years fostered relations with the Taliban, holding multiple rounds of talks and boosting trade with Afghanistan despite international sanctions. “Kazakhstan has recently taken the decision, which we are also going to take, to remove them from the list of terrorist organisations,” RIA Novosti quoted Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying. By the end of 2023, Kazakhstan has taken the Taliban off its list of prohibited organizations. Although the move would not amount to an official recognition of the Taliban administration and what it refers to as the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” it might further strengthen diplomatic relations between Russia and Afghanistan. In 2021, the Taliban overthrew a government that the US had supported. They have imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law that essentially forbids women from engaging in public life. According to Lavrov, Russia made its decision after taking into account the local circumstances. “They are the real power. We are not indifferent to Afghanistan. And above all our allies in Central Asia are not indifferent,” Lavrov said. According to official media, Russia extended an invitation to Taliban delegates to attend its premier Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum. Once upon a time, this occasion was regarded as the cornerstone of Russia’s trade ties with the West. Russia has supported relations with the Taliban for a long time. In 2018, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan asserted that Moscow was arming the group; Moscow refuted these claims at the time. Russia has classified the Taliban as a terrorist organization since 2003. Moscow itself has a convoluted history with Afghanistan; in the 1980s, it waged a ten-year war against guerilla mujahideen militants in order to support a government backed by the Kremlin.",

(AP Photo/Zurab Tsertsvadze) TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — A Georgian parliament committee on Monday rejected the president’s veto of the “foreign agents” legislation that has sparked massive protests for weeks. The move by the parliament’s judiciary committee sets up the possibility of a vote of the full legislature on Tuesday to override President Salome Zourabichvili’s veto of the measure, which she and other critics say will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia’s chances of joining the European Union. The law would require news media and non-governmental organizations that get more than 20% of their budget from abroad to register as “carrying out the interests of a foreign power.” Opponents denounce it as “the Russian law” because it resembles measures pushed through by the Kremlin. The ruling Georgian Dream party has insisted that the bill is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people. “It's absolutely important for Georgia,” Maka Bochorishvili, a ruling party member who heads the parliamentary EU integration committee, told The Associated Press. She argued that the bill should help make the country “stable and peaceful” and rejected the opposition's labeling of it as “the Russian law” as unfair. “I do believe that if there is proper understanding of the objective of this law, nobody would prove why transparency can go against European integration,” Bochorishvili said, adding that she expects the country's Western partners “to have better understanding of the necessity of this legislation for Georgia.” Zourabichvili vetoed the law on May 18 after it was passed in parliament by deputies from the Georgian Dream and its allies. That bloc has sufficient votes in parliament to override the veto. Large protests have repeatedly gripped the capital, Tbilisi, as the measure made its way through parliament. On Sunday, Zourabichvili and Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze assailed each other in speeches at a ceremony marking Georgia's Independence Day. “As the specter of Russia looms over us, partnership and rapprochement with Europe are the true path to preserving and strengthening our independence and peace. Those who sabotage and undermine this path trample upon and damage the peaceful and secure future of our country, hindering the path towards becoming a full member of the free and democratic world,” Zourabichvili said. Kobakhidze shot back, accusing Zourabichvili of betraying the country. “It was the unity and reasonable steps of the people and their elected government that gave us the opportunity to maintain peace in the country for the past two years despite existential threats and multiple betrayals, including the betrayal of the president of Georgia.” he said. The European Union’s foreign policy arm has said that adoption of the law \"negatively impacts Georgia’s progress on the EU path.” Critics say it may have been driven by Russia to thwart Georgia’s chances of further integrating with the West. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials “who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia.” He added that “it remains our hope that Georgia’s leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation’s democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.” Sophiko Megrelidze, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

        "description": "The US and Kenya level up their strategic relationship with a slate of new clean energy programs for sustainability and national security.The post The Significance Of The US-Kenya Climate & Clean Energy Industrial Partnership appeared first on CleanTechnica.",
        "content": "Everyone is talking about the potential for clean energy development in Africa, including the US. Instead of focusing narrowly on promoting government-sponsored projects that pile up burdensome debts, though, the US and Kenya have just announced agreement on an intricate series of initiatives including risk management, STEM education, women’s energy entrepreneurship, and other elements of a long term platform for a rapid and economically beneficial transition to clean energy. If you’re wondering why Kenya, that’s a good question. The White House hosted a state dinner for Kenyan President William Ruto last week. That’s the first time such an event has occurred since 2003, when the US and Kenya began launched a long term collaboration on AIDS. For that matter, the last time any African head of state received a White House state dinner was back in 2008, Associated Press notes. Nevertheless, last week’s dinner invitation did not come up out of the blue. The US recognized the nation of Kenya upon its independence from the UK in 1963, and the two nations established formal diplomatic ties in 1964. Sixty years later, in October of 2023, the US Department of State posted an update of ongoing strategic trade and investment negotiations between the two countries. “Kenya has East Africa’s most dynamic economy and is a growing regional business and financial hub,” the State Department noted. “In 2018, the United States and Kenya formally elevated the relationship to a strategic partnership and established a corresponding bilateral strategic dialogue,” the State Department added. “The dialogue prioritizes five pillars of engagement: economic prosperity, trade, and investment; defense cooperation; democracy, governance, and civilian security; multilateral and regional issues; and public health cooperation.” Last week’s state dinner marked the successful conclusion of the negotiations under the title, “ The U.S.-Kenya Climate And Clean Energy Industrial Partnership .” Among the agreement’s long list of commitments are measures aimed at fostering a rapid, efficient transition to clean energy in Kenya, and supporting follow-on effects throughout Africa as well. With Russia, China, and the EU also jockeying for strategic positions in Africa — based partly on access to critical minerals — it’s also worth noting that the White House and Kenya also concluded a separate series of negotiations last week, culminating in President Joe Biden notifying Congress of his intent to designate Kenya a “Major Non-NATO Ally.” This is the first such relationship between the US and a sub-Saharan nation. “Kenya is one of the United States Government’s top counterterrorism and security partners in sub-Saharan Africa, and the designation will demonstrate that the United States sees African contributions to global peace and security as equivalent to those of our Major Non-NATO Allies in other regions,” President Biden explained. Accelerating the energy transition is a particular challenge for communities with limited or no access to clean energy. In that regard, CleanTechnica contributor Remeredzai Joseph Kuhudzai has been drawing attention to the transformative power of clean energy development in sub-Saharan Africa , including Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe (see our complete Africa archive here ). With that in mind, let’s take a look at the commitments in the new US-Kenya Climate and Clean Energy Industrial partnership. The Biden administration notes that the new partnership elevates “climate action and green industrialization as a critical pillar” of US-Kenya relations. “We also signaled our intent to implement a new green growth framework throughout Africa,” the White House notes. That pan-African angle remains to be seen, but a big attention-getter is the partnership’s focus on collaborating with the international financial community to deploy development banks and climate funds, with the aim of lowering the cost of new clean energy projects. The US commitment includes part of the $568 million in catalytic financing that the US provided to the Clean Technology Fund last year. Clean energy financing is just one element of a broader debt relief advocacy plan expressed in the partnership’s “Nairobi-Washington Initiative.” That’s an attractive contrast with the “debt-trap diplomacy” attributed to China. In addition, the financial angle may also attract African leaders seeking pathways for avoiding political upheava l linked to Russia. As for boot-on-the-ground initiatives, the partnership includes a $3.6 million commitment to help individual ratepayers in Kenya connect to clean electricity through the Empowering East and Central Africa program of the Power Africa initiative, along with a $300,000 commitment to support gender equity and women entrepreneurs in the clean energy sector. Another grassroots-oriented element is a $60 million, 4-year grant from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, aimed at improving public transportation access and transportation safety, particularly for women. On the industrial level, the partnership includes a $10 million direct loan to the Kenyan electric bus company BasiGo and a $10 million loan to the Kenyan electric motorcycle company Roam Electric, through DFC (the US International Development Finance Corporation). DFC also recently provided a $10 million loan to Mogo Auto Kenya to support President Ruto’s Africa Green Industrialization Initiative. MAK is deploying the funds to make financing more affordable for electric car and motorcycle buyers. “The U.S. Department of State also announced $100,000 for technical assistance to support accelerating the transition to zero-emissions vehicles in Kenya, including through policy development and implementation, capacity building and peer-to-peer learning, and workforce development,” the White House notes. The bilateral partnership is not a one-way street. One example is Virunga Power , which the White House describes as “a U.S. company.” Virunga is a Power Africa partner with $100 million worth of hydropower projects in the works in Kenya over the next five years, totaling 31 megawatts. The company specializes in rural electrification and run-of-the-river projects that minimize infrastructure (if anyone out there can confirm that US connection, drop us a note in the comment thread). The partnership’s focus on geothermal energy in Kenya also opens up some opportunities for the US geothermal industry. The US geothermal industry is only just waking up from a decades-long slumber, with just a handful of commercial facilities currently in operation. However, throughout the years the US Department of Energy has been supporting the domestic geothermal industry as an exporter of new geothermal technology to other nations. All that hard work is finally beginning to pay off with new geothermal projects here in the US as well as a strong position on technology exports (see more geothermal news here ). New science collaborations and youth STEM education programs also take up a significant amount of space in the new partnership. CleanTechnica is especially interested to see how those programs connect with the clean cookstoves movement in terms of youth engagement and habitat conservation , so stay tuned for more on that.

        "content": "Drop of pork prices? Release piglets in supermarkets in western France . Low prices of eggs? Smash 200,000 yolks. Changes in tobacco packaging? Leave four tonnes of carrots outside the Socialist Party offices. Protesting – in particular, radical acts of rebellion – are embedded in the French’s relationship with the government . And next on the list is the £1.2 billion state-backed plan to clean up the Seine in Paris ahead of this summer’s Olympic Games . People are now organising a ‘sh*t flashmob’ in the river on the day that president Emmanuel Macron and mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, promised to take a swim in it to prove that their efforts are not in vain. The hashtag #JeChieDansLaSeineLe23Juin, which translates to ‘I sh*t in the Seine on June 23’ began trending on X last week after she announced the date of her dip. A website with the same name was also set up, where participants can enter the location where they are planning to defecate. ð ̈ð ̈ðμ FLASH – Pour lutter contre l’opÃ©ration #JeChieDansLaSeineLe23Juin , la ville de #Paris a dÃ©cidÃ© de placer des toilettes en bord de Seine. pic.twitter.com/vzOlGCzKu6 ‘Because after putting us in sh*t it is up to them to bathe in our sh*t,’ a message on it read. This is also the slogan of the campaign. A posted announcing the event, which is circulating on X, says: ‘On Sunday, June 23, we expect many of you to come and take a sh*t in the Seine!’ Under ‘ticket’ it states, ‘Without reservation, free access’. The location is down as Pont Marie in the 4th arrondissement. Social media has been flooded with its fair share of memes reacting to the threat. Perhaps the most family-friendly one is an AI image of toilets being installed on the banks of the Seine by ‘the City of Paris’ to counter the operation. Another fake picture shows the French president standing on a bridge over the river covered in poo. The protest comes amid the ongoing efforts to clean up the Seine, so that people can swim in it again, as was the case during the 1900 Paris Olympics. A sewer problem in the summer of 2023 led to the cancellation of a pre-Olympics swimming event. ‘You bet I will,’ Macron told reporters when asked if he would swim in the Seine. ‘I will do it. But I won’t give you the date, or you risk being there.’ Baby 'beheaded' and children 'burnt alive' in Israeli strikes on makeshift shelter Passengers describe panic on Dublin flight as turbulence threw them around cabin Pensioner mugged with 'lion killer' jiu-jitsu move in Benidorm Seven newborn babies killed after fire rips through children's hospital Olympic Open water and triathlon events are scheduled to take place in the river during the Paris 2024 Games. Yet the French nonprofit Surfrider says more work might have to be done to make some sections of the Seine swimmable by July, with campaigners finding ‘concentrations of enterococci and E. coli’ in the river. Dr Leon Davis, Senior Lecturer in Marketing and Events Management at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, England, told Metro.co.uk that the biggest issue for the games will be the Seine. He said: ‘The biggest issue will be the Seine, and whether it will be ready for the opening ceremony, especially as it will break tradition for the first time by not being held at the stadium,.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk .

        "content": "Kochi: The Kerala Police, which has launched a drive against mafia and goons, was left embarrassed after a police official, along with three others, was seen at a party hosted by a criminal at his residence. Deputy Superintendent of Police M.G. Sabu, posted with the Crime Branch at Alappuzha, and three other police officers, were at the house of Thamanem Faizal near here late Sunday evening. Acting on a tip-off, local police officials reached the house of Faizal, who is on their radar, but were taken aback at seeing four police officers there. The local police on Monday afternoon submitted its report which was followed by the suspension of two of the policemen concerned - Sabu's official driver and another civil police official. The third police official is reported to be from the Vigilance Department which has started assessing the incident. DSP Sabu is due to retire from service on May 31 and the top officials of Kerala Police have gone into a huddle to decide his fate. His retirement function has been called off. Senior Congress legislator and former Home Minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan said such incidents, when police officials are seen hand-in-glove with those with a criminal background, are most disgraceful for the police and demanded strong action be taken against all erring officials. Meanwhile, Sabu blamed the police officials for misleading him, while the suspended officials said it was Sabu who took them to the criminal's house and they were not involved in any wrongdoing.",

        "content": "TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — A Georgian parliament committee on Monday rejected the president’s veto of the “foreign agents” legislation that has sparked massive protests for weeks. The move by the parliament’s judiciary committee sets up the possibility of a vote of the full legislature on Tuesday to override President Salome Zourabichvili’s veto of the measure, which she and other critics say will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia’s chances of joining the European Union. The law would require news media and non-governmental organizations that get more than 20% of their budget from abroad to register as “carrying out the interests of a foreign power.” Opponents denounce it as “the Russian law” because it resembles measures pushed through by the Kremlin. The ruling Georgian Dream party has insisted that the bill is needed to stem what it deems to be harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people. “It’s absolutely important for Georgia,” Maka Bochorishvili, a ruling party member who heads the parliamentary EU integration committee, told The Associated Press. She argued that the bill should help make the country “stable and peaceful” and rejected the opposition’s labeling of it as “the Russian law” as unfair. “I do believe that if there is proper understanding of the objective of this law, nobody would prove why transparency can go against European integration,” Bochorishvili said, adding that she expects the country’s Western partners “to have better understanding of the necessity of this legislation for Georgia.” Zourabichvili vetoed the law on May 18 after it was passed in parliament by deputies from the Georgian Dream and its allies. That bloc has sufficient votes in parliament to override the veto. Large protests have repeatedly gripped the capital, Tbilisi, as the measure made its way through parliament. On Sunday, Zourabichvili and Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze assailed each other in speeches at a ceremony marking Georgia’s Independence Day. “As the specter of Russia looms over us, partnership and rapprochement with Europe are the true path to preserving and strengthening our independence and peace. Those who sabotage and undermine this path trample upon and damage the peaceful and secure future of our country, hindering the path towards becoming a full member of the free and democratic world,” Zourabichvili said. Kobakhidze shot back, accusing Zourabichvili of betraying the country. “It was the unity and reasonable steps of the people and their elected government that gave us the opportunity to maintain peace in the country for the past two years despite existential threats and multiple betrayals, including the betrayal of the president of Georgia.” he said. The European Union’s foreign policy arm has said that adoption of the law “negatively impacts Georgia’s progress on the EU path.” Critics say it may have been driven by Russia to thwart Georgia’s chances of further integrating with the West. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday announced that travel sanctions would be imposed on Georgian officials “who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia.” He added that “it remains our hope that Georgia’s leaders will reconsider the draft law and take steps to move forward with their nation’s democratic and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.”",

        "content": "Alienware If you’re the type of person who plays competitive games and wants to get into the esports scene, then having a high-refresh-rate monitor can make all the difference in the world. While there are a ton of options out there, probably one of the fastest, if not the fastest, is Alienware’s whopping 500Hz gaming monitor, which is such a high amount that it’s hard to wrap our heads around. Of course, that high refresh comes at a significant cost, but luckily, this Memorial Day deal will let you snag it for just $400 rather than the usual eye-watering $700. Why you should buy the Alienware 500Hz Gaming Monitor The Alienware 500Hz Gaming Monitor is a very peculiar monitor because it occupies an interesting niche that’s hard to justify for a lot of other folks. It’s a monitor that is made to cater to a very specific set of competitive games, which are primarily games like Valorant, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, and even League of Legends. And while it’s true that these games are the ones that are going to get the most benefit, other games also have a much smoother experience, even if it’s a sort of thing that will give you diminishing returns. Also, it’s worth noting that, even though it runs at 1080p, you’re still going to need something like an RTX 4090 to really reach that 500hz refresh rate, so you are going to add considerably to the cost. That said, it’s hard to argue against the results of the Alienware 500hz gaming monitor when you get it going, and beyond just the fast refresh rate, it has a lot of other features, such as a minimum Gray-to-Gray time of 0.5ms, which is pretty incredible considering that it’s essentially matching the refresh rate of the monitor. Not only that, but it also has support for NVIDIA G-SYNC, so you aren’t going to get tearing and ghosting, which are real problems at these speeds. Also, you get HDR 400, as well as 99% coverage of the sRGB color gamut, so you’re still getting a high-quality screen with excellent image fidelity.

        "content": "The potent greenhouse gas will be regulated for the first time in the EU with implications overseas. EU countries adopted today (May 27) first-ever rules to measure, report and verify methane emissions in the energy sector in a bid to slash the volume of these short-lived air pollutants, known to be up to 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2). Following an almost unanimous vote, opposed by Hungary, energy operators will need to comply, as of 2025, with new requirements to ensure mitigation measures, such as detecting and repairing methane leaks, and measuring emissions at source level. They will also be required to draw up monitoring reports that will be checked by independent accredited verifiers, according to the new rules, as well as carry out surveys of methane leaks in different types of infrastructures. In cases where methane leak levels — due to aging infrastructure, poor maintenance or accidental damage — are above a certain threshold, energy operators will need to repair or replace within stipulated time limits. Oil, gas and coal companies will need to carry out an inventory of closed, inactive, plugged and abandoned assets, such as wells and mines, to monitor their emissions. Methane emissions deriving from EU energy imports will also be traced, as of 2027, since the new rules introduce global monitoring tools to increase transparency from oil, gas and coal entering the bloc. “My task as one of the lead negotiators for the methane file will be to remind them [biggest oil and gas exporter states] of their obligation and to also tell them we will be watching you,” lawmaker Jutta Paulus (Germany/Greens) said during the COP28 in Dubai. Tinne Van der Straeten, Belgian minister for energy, said methane emissions were the “second most important greenhouse gas” to tackle in the fight against climate change and expressed confidence the new law will guarantee “proper monitoring” across the energy value chains. “To meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and achieving climate neutrality by 2050, we must cut methane emissions in the oil, gas, and coal sectors,” said Van der Straeten. Brandon Locke, Europe policy manager at Clean Air Task Force (CATF) welcomed today’s law as a “blueprint for other major importers” but warned the “work isn’t done”. “The lion's share of the EU's energy emissions come from abroad, so the EU import standard has the potential to drive down 30% of methane emissions from oil and gas globally,” Locke told Euronews. However, the devil will be in the details, Locke added, saying the methodology applied to calculate the emission limits, how it is implemented and enforced will be vital as well as how trading partners are engaged to proactively abate emissions before 2030. Today’s final adoption by member states follows several inter-institutional negotiations, since the European Commission tabled the proposal in December 2021 under the so-called “Gas Package”, aimed at supporting the EU to reach climate neutrality by 2050. The Commission will assess the progress of the new rules in 2028.",

        "description": "The UN bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology.",
        "content": "The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main north-western space centre. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after lift-off due to a suspected engine problem. Earlier on Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket,” with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff later said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space centre at 10.44pm on Monday. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said. Japanese officials earlier issued a missile alert for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch. The alert was lifted soon after. Japan’s NHK public television earlier reported that an image captured by a camera in north-eastern China showed an orange light in the sky and then an apparent explosion a moment later. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing US-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after lift-off. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The UN bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Mr Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor US and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. Monday’s launch came hours after the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It is highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative military action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region.",

After three years of horrific battle in the trenches of France and Belgium, the Allies are on the verge of collapse—and Germany the cusp of victory. The United States is forced to rapidly train, arm, and ship millions of young soldiers overseas to Europe for the first time. “The Great War” weaves together the stories of these four men to tell one story: how an isolationist America reluctantly entered World War I and emerged a global power.

To pay their respects, hundreds gathered in areas across the country and the Coastal Empire to honor our fallen soldiers on Memorial Day. One of the solemn ceremonies was held this morning at Laurel Grove South Cemetery in Savannah. During the era of slavery, there were more freedmen interred in Laurel Grove than any other site in the Southeast. The cemetery continues to serve as a culturally significant burial ground for African Americans. “We have so many families out here we do not want them to forget their loved ones,” says US Army Staff Sergeant Sabrina Scales, “We bring the community together to keep those memories alive.” Laurel Grove Cemetery is open to the public daily from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.",

        "content": "Report Third washout in four days blights return of cricket to New Road Worcestershire's blushes saved but questions remain about ground's viability as their permanent home ECB Reporters Network 27-May-2024 • 1 hr ago Overnight rain meant Nottinghamshire could not press home their advantage at New Road • Getty Images Nottinghamshire 234 for 3 (Hameed 100, Clarke 73*, Smith 2-31) lead Worcestershire 80 (Fletcher 3-18, Pennington 3-25) by 154 runs Nottinghamshire's hopes of pushing for a last-day victory were wrecked by the weather during the rain-ruined draw with Worcestershire in the Vitality County Championship encounter at Visit Worcestershire New Road. Despite the wash-out of two of the first three days, Nottinghamshire were strongly placed, coming into Monday 154 runs ahead. But heavy overnight rain and a steady stream of morning showers dashed any hopes of the players being able to take the field. Umpires Nigel Llong and Suri Shanmugam carried out a series of inspections. The visitors are entitled to feel frustrated after completely outplaying Worcestershire on Saturday, the only day of play possible. While Worcestershire avoided any awkwardness on the final day, it was a demoralising end to this first chunk of the County Championship. The final round of the opening block of red ball matches was supposed to be a welcome return to New Road after eight floods over the winter forced them to relocate their first two home games to Kidderminster. Last month, chief executive Ashley Giles floated the idea of moving the club to a new permanent home because the ground is built on a floodplain which relieves the River Severn, making it extremely susceptible to bad weather. \"It's costing us a lot of money,\" Giles told BBC Hereford and Worcester. \"We're going to lose virtually two months of a six-month season. The ground is here to stage cricket, to be a venue for entertainment and hospitality. But conditions are seemingly getting worse.\" New Road is due to host its next match on Friday, a Vitality Blast match against Lancashire Lightning. While the ground staff worked relentlessly over the last four days, further inclement weather could affect preparations for that fixture. As a non-Test venue, the Blast is an important part of the club's matchday revenues over a season. The ground will also host a women's ODI between England and New Zealand on June 30. \"A disappointing day in the field, and, ultimately, three disappointing days being back at New Road and not being able to get on the park as well,\" said Worcestershire head coach Alan Richardson. \"It's lovely to be back but four days that we probably don't want to remember for too long.\" Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores echoed Richardson's frustrations about the weather, while lauding a professional performance from his team. Luke Fletcher was the star performer with the ball but a disciplined attack took full advantage of the seamer-friendly conditions to dismiss the hosts for 80. Then skipper Haseeb Hameed scored an excellent century to press home Nottinghamshire's advantage, with former Worcestershire batter Joe Clarke notching an unbeaten 73. \"It's been frustrating because as soon as we got here and saw the outfield, we knew it was going to be difficult if we got any rain, and we did get rain over three days,\" said Moores. \"We played brilliantly in the game so credit to the lads. To bowl them out in a session was a fantastic effort, not just the quality of the bowling but the catching that went with it. \"All in all, no complaints there, and were then getting to a very strong position in the game with the partnership between Hameed and Clarke on the second day.\" Worcestershire Nottinghamshire Worcs vs Notts County Championship Division One New Road",

        "content": "Edo Queens on Sunday emerged champions of the Nigeria Women’s Football League after a 1-1 stalemate with hosts Bayelsa Queens in an explosive match played at the Samson Siasia Stadium, Yenagoa in the final game of the 2023/24 NWFL Super Six tournament. Moses Aduku’s side needed a win to stay top of the standings regardless of the outcome of other games but a stalemate between seven-time champions Rivers Angels and Super Six debutants Heartland Queens in Nembe meant they were crowned champions regardless. Edo Queens forward Emem Essien netted the opening goal in the 29th minute with an overhead kick inside the six-yard box. Despite pressure from the home side, backed by their vociferous fans, the Edo girls held on and went into the break with the 1-0 advantage. But Bayelsa Queens got the equaliser just three minutes after the restart from a long range free kick by Olapde Zainab. The goal triggered home fans into wild celebrations and cheered their side on for the winner , which would have earned them the title, but Edo Queens soaked the pressure, thwarting move after move. In the other game that was played simultaneously in Nembe, Rivers Angels took the lead in the 72nd minute with a goal from Olamide Adugbe, shifting the table in their favour. This put pressure on both teams in Yenagoa to find another goal to reclaim the top spot. Bayelsa Queens needed more goals to surpass their South-South neighbours. However, Heartland Queens played spoilers for Rivers Angels as substitute Emmanuella James scored from a goalmouth scramble, equalising on the dot of 90 minutes. This twist returned the title race in favour of Edo Queens. Ultimately, both deciding matches ended in 1-1 draws, securing the league title for Edo Queens for the first time. Rivers Angels thus missed out on their chance to win a record-breaking eighth title to finish second, while Bayelsa Queens also fell short of claiming their sixth title to end in third after successes in the2004, 2006, 2007, 2018 and 2022 seasons. Frustration then set in for Bayelsa fans after news filtered in that Heartland Queens had held favourites Rivers Angels 1-1 in Nembe, which was played simultaneously. Edo Queens amassed 10 points — while Bayelsa Queens and Rivers Angels had nine points each — to be crowned deserved champions for the first time ever. Meanwhile, the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has congratulated Edo Queens for winning the NWFL and picking a ticket for the CAF Women Champions League. In a statement, the Governor praised the team’s doggedness in holding Bayelsa Queens to a 1-1 draw at the NWFL Super Six Playoffs to win their first league title. Obaseki stated, “I am elated to congratulate our darling girls, Edo Queens, on their outstanding performance in the NWFL Super Six play-offs where they emerged winners and cemented their place for continental action, which is truly where they belong. “This feat is a reflection of the attention paid to sports development over the years, which includes inclusive welfare packages and other initiatives that have lifted the profile of women’s football in the state.”",

Advertisement If you're a data scientist working remotely, one thing you might enjoy analyzing is your paycheck . A snapshot of remote gigs found that these workers, who know their way around a spreadsheet, earned about $132,000 on average. Next were business analysts, who brought in $100,000, and project managers, who earned $88,000. The findings by Greenback Expat Tax Services , which provides tax services for expats, were based on a review of nearly 6,800 job listings posted on Indeed from around the world. This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . Greenback also surveyed about 1,000 Americans interested in becoming digital nomads. Among those polled, more than one-third said they weren't happy with cubicle life — or their commutes. Two in five were preparing to hit the road within the next year. Advertisement The curiosity about working remotely comes as some of these jobs are getting harder to land following return-to-office mandates. Indeed, some people are having a harder time finding lucrative desk jobs generally in the US, even as overall unemployment remains low. Just over half of those surveyed were weighing leaving the US. Gen Z workers were most interested in heading abroad, with six in 10 saying they were considering becoming expats. How much do you need to earn to make the switch to a remote job comfortable? About $72,000, according to the survey. Related stories That's one reason staying stateside might make sense for some workers. In the US, the average pay for a remote data scientist role was $143,000. In fact, the US had the most remote work opportunities and the highest average pay for such roles at $100,000. France was next at $90,000, and Australia was at $79,000. Advertisement The review converted currencies to dollars. Those Americans who want to get their passports stamped might consider Italy, Canada, and the UK. These were among the countries showing the most number of remote jobs, according to the study. The primary jobs that Americans looking to ditch the office wanted to have were content creator and freelance writer. Close behind were virtual assistant and teacher. The reasons survey respondents wanted to log on from somewhere else weren't surprising. Seven in 10 said their chief aim was the ability to work from anywhere. Nearly six in 10 pointed to greater flexibility. Advertisement Just over half said it was to travel or have adventures. And half said it was to achieve a better work-life balance . Yet, only about one in four said they intended to work remotely forever. For some people, the flexibility of remote work is essential. Erik Braund, founder and CEO of Katmai, which uses video feeds to create virtual offices , told Business Insider in late 2023 that he'd worked side-by-side with a colleague since 2020. Yet Braund is based in the US, and his coworker is based in the Netherlands. The ability to work virtually — while still being together — was the next best option to being alongside each other IRL, Braund said. The approach lets him better balance work with the rest of his life. \"I missed the first two years of my first kid's life. I didn't miss the first two years of my second kid's life,\" Braund said.",

        "content": "Whenever two drivers collide it’s not unusual for each to express anger at the other’s role in the crash. Advert | Become a Supporter & go ad-free Should it have been – and should either he or rival Kevin Magnussen been held responsible for their destructive shunt? The collision happened on the first lap as cars tackled the uphill run from the first ‘true’ corner, Sainte Devote, to the second, Massenet. At this point the track winds left and right and the ordinary racing line plots a reasonably straight course between the barriers. However at the start of a race drivers often climb the hill side-by-side with their rivals and have to give them more room. As Magnussen moved to the right-hand of Perez heading up the hill, the pair made contact, triggering a huge crash. Perez and the Haas drivers retired due to huge crash Perez said Magnussen should have realised he wasn’t far enough alongside the Red Bull to pass and backed out: It’s lap one, it’s just important if you’re not in the right position, automatically you’re going to end up losing. I was getting out of the corner. If you see my onboard, there’s no point where you see Kevin. I was just pretty surprised that he kept it flat at that point because it was just very unnecessary. Sergio Perez Magnussen believes he was far enough alongside Perez to be left space: From my point of view I had a good part of my front along Perez’s rear. When he went to the wall, I just got pushed into the wall and made contact with him. I trusted that he was going to leave a space for me since I was there. It’s not a corner that you’re braking into. It’s just like a little bend on the straight so you have to have a car width otherwise you leave the guy no option. Kevin Magnussen Advert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free Magnussen’s team mate Nico Hulkenberg , who was also eliminated in the same collision, described it as follows: I think it’s somewhat a racing incident. It looked maybe a bit optimistic from Kevin, but I don’t know, Checo could have also maybe seen him and left room. So unfortunate, obviously, the outcome. Nico Hulkenberg This angle captured the moment the crash began: The stewards did not investigate the incident. The stewards have previously taken a more lenient stance on collisions which happen on the first lap of the race. However they did penalise Esteban Ocon for a collision with Pierre Gasly on the first lap of yesterday’s race.

        "content": "Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard (180 meter) hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Tom Kopke from Munich, Germany won one of the three men's races. He said attitude was more important than technique. \"You start and then the adrenaline takes over and you just go, go go,\" Kopke said. \"Look at this event, look at this hill,\" added the muddy, breathless winner. \"England is mad. I love it.\" Local competitor Josh Shepherd and Dylan Twiss from Perth, Australia won the other two men's downhill races. Abby Lampe from North Carolina triumphed in the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. \"You just have to roll,\" said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. \"There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.\" Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) over a 240-yard (220-meter) course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Temperatures rose above 52 degrees Celsius (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh, the highest reading of the summer and close to the country’s record high amid an ongoing heatwave, the met office said on Monday. Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters. The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers. But with the current heatwave, shops are seeing almost no footfall. \"The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,\" Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town. \"I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.\" Close to Ali's shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop's shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water. “Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,” Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, said at a news conference on Friday adding that the government is running awareness campaigns due to the heatwaves. The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54 C (129.2 F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said Sardar Sarfaraz, Chief Meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological Department The heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in Sindh, including the capital, Karachi - Pakistan's largest city. A volcano on the remote Indonesian island of Halmahera erupted on Monday spewing a grey ash cloud six kms (four miles) into the sky, the country's volcanology agency said, adding it had issued a warning for aviation authorities managing local flights. This follows a series of eruptions this month after authorities noticed an uptick of volcanic activity since April, leading to evacuations of people from seven nearby villages. \"The ash column is seen to be thick and grey and moving westward,\" the agency said, adding the eruption occurred at 3 a.m. local time (7 p.m. GMT) and recommending that a seven-km (4.35-mile) radius be cleared. Footage shared by the agency on Monday showed the volcano spewing ash that grew thicker and eventually obscured it. The agency also issued a \"red\" color code warning to local aviation authorities on Monday, the highest of its kind due to ash exceeding six kms in height, its website stated. It previously raised the alert level of the volcano to the highest on its scale on May 16. Ibu's activities follow a series of eruptions of different volcanoes in Indonesia, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" and has 127 active volcanoes. Flash floods and cold lava flow from Mount Marapi, one of the most active in West Sumatra province, covered several nearby districts following torrential rain on May 11, killing at least 62 people with 10 people still missing. In recent weeks North Sulawesi's Ruang volcano has erupted, spewing incandescent lava. The eruption prompted authorities to evacuate more than 12,000 people on a nearby island. Pilgrims arriving in Saudi Arabia for this year’s Hajj season will benefit from a well-organized transportation system. The system ensures pilgrims safe and comfortable travel between Makkah and Medina, enhancing their spiritual journey. In the past, pilgrims traveled between Makkah and Madinah on camelback, a journey that took almost 10 days. Now, with cars and buses, it’s down to about 6 hours. But with the “Haramain High Speed Railway,” pilgrims can make the trip in just 135 minutes. Once on board, pilgrims have everything they need for a comfortable journey, allowing them to focus on their worship and prayers. The railway project, one of the largest in the Middle East, is providing around 1.6 million seats on 3,800 trips for pilgrims and visitors this Hajj season. The train stations in Makkah and Madinah are conveniently located near the holy sites. With a capacity for 60 million passengers a year and speeds of up to 300 kilometers per hour, the railway meets the increasing demand for transportation services. At the train stations in the al-Sulaymaniyah district and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Asharq Al-Awsat observed smooth passenger traffic. Local staff warmly welcomed the pilgrims, assisting them with inquiries and guiding them to departure lounges while informing them of train schedules. Passenger journeys start with quick procedures, checking reservations and luggage allowances. Passengers then move to the departure lounge and to their seats, which are comfortable with individual screens. The train provides services for business class and support for passengers with special needs. Operations run with 35 electric trains, each carrying up to 417 passengers. These trains have 13 carriages, five for business class and eight for economy, all equipped with food vending carts. Many travelers praised the top-notch care they received upon arriving in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the Haramain High Speed Railway. The pilgrims appreciated the “excellent and outstanding” services that made traveling between the two holy cities easier. E-services let travelers book early, check schedules, and choose departure stations. The smooth running of train journeys and punctual schedules across different stations show how well the teams manage the numerous daily trips along the electric railway track. Stations are located in Makkah, Madinah, al-Sulaymaniyah district, King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, and King Abdullah Economic City station in the Rabigh governorate. The stations’ architectural design is inspired by the landmarks of Makkah and Madinah, reflecting their Islamic and unique architectural styles. The stations offer various traveler services like parking, e-booking, ticket counters, and assistance desks. The station at King Abdulaziz International Airport is the world’s largest airport-connected train station, covering over 105,000 square meters with multiple floors and six platforms, making it easy for travelers heading to Makkah or Madinah. Since its launch in 2018, the Haramain High Speed Railway’s success has made booking, scheduling, and travel between the holy sites easier for a growing number of passengers. Built with high-quality standards and safety features, the train plays a crucial role in Saudi Arabia’s railway network development and expansion plan. In a cowshed in Gaza's Khan Yunis, zookeeper Fathi Ahmed Gomaa has created a temporary home for dozens of animals including lions and baboons, having fled with them from Israel's offensive in Rafah. \"We've moved all the animals we had, except for three big lions that remain (in Rafah)\", he told Agence France Presse. \"I ran out of time and couldn't move them.\" Ahmed abandoned his zoo in Rafah when Israel ordered the evacuation of parts of the southern Gazan city. Before the offensive, the city on the border with Egypt had been spared a ground invasion and more than half of the Gaza Strip's population was sheltering there. \"I am appealing to the Israeli authorities: these animals have no connection to terrorism\", Gomaa told AFP, saying he wanted their help in coordinating with aid agencies to rescue the lions left behind in Rafah. He fears they won't survive long on their own. \"Of course, within a week or 10 days, if we don't get them out they will die because they'll be left with no food or water.\" Gomaa said he had already lost several of his animals to the war. \"Three lion cubs, five monkeys, a newborn monkey and nine squirrels,\" he said. And while the squawking of parrots fills the air, many of Gomaa's other birds are no longer with him. \"I released some of the dogs, some of the hawks and eagles, some of the pigeons and some of the ornamental birds. I released a lot of them because we didn't have cages to transport them.\" In the cowshed, Gomaa is making do with what he has, using improvised fencing to raise the heights of the pens so that their new inhabitants, spotted deer, can't leap out. The Soudah Development Company, a subsidiary of the Public Investment Fund, announced the birth of three ibexes in the \"Red Rock\" area within King Abdullah National Park in Soudah. These new arrivals follow the release of 23 ibexes into the natural areas last year in collaboration with the National Center for Wildlife (NCW) as part of the company's initiative to release endangered animals and the center's program to breed and re-localize wildlife species, reported the Saudi Press Agency on Sunday. Previously, the NCW released two mothers who recently gave birth to the ibexes in the \"Red Rock\" area. The third mother, approximately two years old, was born in an enclosed area before being released into the project area in February 2023 and recently gave birth in the park, contributing to the increase in ibex numbers within the protected area. Currently, Soudah Development Company is monitoring nine ibexes and providing a suitable environment for them to live in the park's \"Red Rock\" area. CEO of Soudah Development Company, Eng. Saleh Al-Oraini, stressed that these births represent a significant step towards re-localizing endangered species and enhancing ecosystems in the region. He also highlighted the company's steadfast commitment to the goals of the Saudi Green Initiative and its contribution to the sustainability of the local environment and biodiversity in the Soudah Peaks. In a Beirut car park, migrant workers cheer as their teams face off in a cricket tournament, a moment of respite in crisis-hit Lebanon, where working conditions are often tough. \"Sunday we are so happy... We eat together, we laugh together,\" said cricketer Pradeepa Silva, a 42-year-old Sri Lankan, as she and her teammates prepared coconut rice and other traditional food nearby to share. \"Work is very tiring\" and workers are stressed and worried, said Silva, who is employed as a housemaid six days a week and pays for her daughter's university studies back home. Every Sunday, players mainly from Sri Lanka but also from the Philippines, India and Pakistan gather in Beirut's Ashrafieh neighborhood to play cricket -- a little-known sport in Lebanon. Migrant workers are employed under Lebanon's controversial \"kafala\" sponsorship system, which rights groups have repeatedly denounced saying that it enables a wide range of abuses. On May 19, several hundred people gathered for a tournament that also brought together traditional food stalls, a DJ playing Bollywood hits and other music, teams from the British and Sri Lankan embassies and young Syrian refugee players. Iris Sagario from the Philippines ran onto the field for the Roaring Lions women's team, wearing an orange and blue shirt with her name printed on the back. \"I love cricket,\" said the 43-year-old, who works as a housekeeper. \"I'm very excited to play every Sunday\" -- her only day off. After winning their match, Sagario's team broke out into cheers, hugging and high-fiving each other. They went on to take the women's trophy. - 'Lord's of Lebanon' - More than 160,000 migrants from 84 nationalities were in Lebanon last year, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration. With daily bombardment in south Lebanon as Hezbollah and the Israeli army clash amid tensions over the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, some foreign embassies have advised their nationals to leave the country. \"At first I was worried\" but \"my sir (employer) assured me that all is good,\" said Sagario, who was also in Lebanon in 2006, when Israel and Hezbollah last went to war. \"I'm choosing to stay because... I don't know what I'll do if I go back to the Philippines. I want to give financial (help) to my family,\" she said. Curious passersby sometimes peered over a tumbledown stone wall to watch the matches. Organizer Fernando Sugath, 52, from Sri Lanka said some players nicknamed the car park they have been using for around two decades \"Lord's of Lebanon\", a reference to the famous Lord's cricket ground in London, which is known as the \"home of cricket\". Matches in the car park were halted for five years when the players lost access to the site but resumed in 2022, Sugath said. His team changed its name to the Saint Joseph Cricket Club in honor of the neighboring church that helped them return to the site. - 'Let them have some freedom' - Migrant workers at the cricket match \"are very lucky that they've got some good employers who give them the Sunday off\", said Sugath, who first came to Lebanon in 1996 as a cleaner and is now an administrative assistant. Rights groups have long criticized Lebanon's restrictive sponsorship system, saying it facilitates exploitation and leaves migrant workers at the mercy of their employers, amid persistent reports of physical and sexual abuse, unpaid wages and long work hours. Sugath appealed to all employers to give workers \"at least one hour, two hours off on Sunday... Let them have some freedom, let them use the phone, call their families\". As the men's competition kicked off, big hitters began smashing the ball into the trees lining the car park as fielders scrambled for a catch. Majid Satti, 39, from Pakistan, captains the Eleven Brothers team -- with five players from Pakistan and six from India -- which came runner-up in the men's tournament. Their two countries have long had a strained relationship, but \"we have no issue... we are all like brothers here,\" said Satti, a concierge who has been in Lebanon for 15 years. Vice-captain Raju Singh, 41, from India, said the players \"never think about\" politics. An electrician by trade, Singh wore his team's traditional cricket whites, with long white trousers and shoes, and was among those in charge of the coin toss to decide which teams would field or bat first. The Lebanese 500 lira coin he used, valued until 2019 at around 35 US cents, is now worth less than a single cent following Lebanon's economic collapse, during which some migrant workers were abandoned by their employers and others pushed to leave the country. Singh said he loved cricket and travelled almost 30 kilometers (20 miles) each week for the Sunday games. \"When we finish (and) we go home, we are waiting for next Sunday,\" he said. The \"abab\" plant, also known as \"Saudi ginseng\" or \"ashwagandha\", has returned after a 20-year absence in the deserts of the Northern Borders Region, the Saudi Press Agency said on Sunday. This evergreen shrub with yellow flowers has reemerged, alongside other wild plants. In an interview with SPA, Director of the Amana Environmental Association in the region Nasser Rashid Al-Majlad, said that the area's rich green wealth presents economic opportunities. By utilizing natural plant resources, the region can enhance biodiversity, combat desertification, expand green spaces, promote tourism, and foster human development. Al-Majlad said that these efforts align with the principles of the green economy, which aims to strike a balance between economic and environmental needs for the benefit of both humanity and the planet. Khonaysser Al-Anazi, a plant enthusiast, said the abab plants on the outskirts of Arar city reappeared due to increased rainfall and the expansion of green areas. He highlighted the potential for cultivation and utilization of these plants for various purposes. The estimated number of wolves in France last year was 1,003, down nine percent from the year before, environmental associations said earlier this week, urging the French government to lower its quota for the number of the animals which can be killed each year. The drop in the predator's population is the first in almost ten years, according to loupfrance.fr, a site managed by France’s biodiversity authority. \"This new estimate reinforces the finding that the species' conservation status is not good,\" the six conservation groups wrote. The current quota allows for 19 percent of the French wolf population to be legally killed. But an administrative source close to the matter —- who confirmed the 1,003 figure —- told AFP that current hunting limits would be maintained, allowing for \"209 wolves\" to be culled, AFP reported. The percentage is \"based on the estimated population at the end of the winter, which was 1,104,\" said the source, asking not to be named. The number of wolf attacks is also on the rise, added the source. For their part, agricultural groups argue culling nearly one-fifth of the predator's population is still too low to prevent what they say is a growing number of attacks on livestock. Wolves had vanished from France but began returning in the 1990s, with farmers saying they suffered 12,000 attacks on their animals in 2022. \"For 2024, we're expecting to see an increase in the number of reports and victims,\" said a representative for France's sheep farmers group, Claude Font. \"If we hold at 19 percent of the estimated wolf population, we're not going to stop the number of sheep being killed,\" he said, calling for political action at the highest level to increase the percentage. But for League of the Protection of Birds (LPO) president Allain Bougrain-Dubourg, \"wolves are being sacrificed on the altar of agricultural demagoguery\". In addition to authorised hunting, \"we're seeing an upsurge in poaching and poisoning\", he told AFP. The National Wolf Group (GNL) meeting, scheduled for Friday, will bring together environmentalists, elected officials, civil servants, the agricultural industry, and hunters. But several environmental groups pulled out of the organisation in September 2023, deeming the government's 2024-2029 wolf plan \"unacceptable\". The proposition calls for increased support for farmers dealing with livestock loss from wolf attacks, simplified population culling, and an overhaul of the current counting system, which is an estimate drawn up by France's biodiversity authority. The wolf is categorised as \"strictly protected\" in the European Union, but France's new plan raises the possibility of reviewing the animal's status. In September 2023, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned that \"the concentration of wolf packs in some European regions has become a real danger for livestock and potentially also for humans\". For conservation groups, however, the dip in the wolf population is a clear sign that efforts to protect the predator are falling short. The government must \"stop advocating downgrading the species’ level of protection\". Germany's health minister, Karl Lauterbach, plans to introduce stricter rules to curb the sale of nitrous oxide, sometimes known as laughing gas, especially to young people. The drug, which is used in medicine as an anaesthetic and for pain reduction, has become a particularly popular party drug among young people in Germany. The sale and consumption of nitrous oxide is not restricted under current law, dpa reported. \"We will come up with a regulation quickly,\" Lauterbach told public broadcaster ARD on Friday. Among the possibilities is including nitrous oxide in the list of psychoactive substances, which come with very strict rules for sale and possession. He said that a complete ban would not be possible because nitrous oxide is used for industrial purposes as well. \"We are now tackling this very quickly,\" assured the minister. Until the government takes action, Lauterbach recommended that parents educate their children: \"It may sound fun and harmless, but it's not,\" the minister warned. Regular consumption could lead to accidents or even neurological damage, and permanent damage cannot be ruled out either, he said. \"It's very dangerous for children and young people,\" said Lauterbach. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Britain in small boats so far this year, updated government data showed on Saturday, underlining a key challenge facing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ahead of a July 4 national election. The number of people landing on England's southern beaches after making the dangerous Channel crossing fell by a third in 2023, but the latest numbers on a government website showed 10,170 arrived between January and May 25, up from 7,395 over the same period last year. Sunak, who announced the election date on Wednesday, said later this week that asylum seekers who come to Britain illegally would not be deported to Rwanda before the vote - casting doubt on one of his Conservative Party's flagship policies, Reuters reported. The plan has been bogged down by legal obstacles for more than two years, and the opposition Labor Party, which is about 20 points ahead in opinion polls and seen on track to end 14 years of Conservative rule, has promised to scrap the policy if it wins the election. Labor's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said Sunak's government had not done enough to tackle the issue. \"Because all the government's efforts are now focused on getting a few hundred people flown to Rwanda, they have lost sight of the thousands more who are crossing the Channel every month,\" Kinnock said in a statement. Labor has said if elected it would create a Border Security Command that would bring together staff from the police, the domestic intelligence agency and prosecutors to work with international agencies to stop people smuggling.",

        "description": "Brian Benesh’s decades-long mission to honor veterans brightens Dickinson cemeteries in wake of cleanup controversy.",
        "content": "DICKINSON — Memorial Day is a time to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice for the United States. In Stark County a long-standing tradition continues as Brian Benesh, a Vietnam combat medic, has spent over 25 years ensuring that local veterans are remembered. This year’s flag-placing event on Memorial Day weekend took on added significance following a controversy over the unannounced removal of personal items from graves by city officials during a recent cemetery cleanup. Benesh's mission began with his experiences in Vietnam, where he served as a combat medic from 1969 to 1970, achieving a 98% survival rate for the soldiers he treated. Upon his return, he noticed that local cemeteries in Dickinson were not receiving the same level of respect he remembered from his childhood Memorial Day ceremonies in Washburn. “Many, many years ago when I was much younger, my folks used to go to the little town of Washburn,” Benesh said. “They had a ceremony where they would go on the hill to the cemetery. And as a young kid, I noticed there were certain graves that had little American flags. And I found out what they were for.” Inspired by these memories, Benesh began placing flags on veterans' graves in Dickinson, starting with 900 flags and now increasing that number to around 1,060. Initially, he performed this task mostly alone, with help from two other Vietnam veterans. Over time, the effort has grown to include younger veterans and community members. ADVERTISEMENT Benesh's dedication to this cause has earned him several recognitions, including the Stark County Spirit of Excellence Award . During a ceremony for the Spirit of Excellence Award two years ago, Dickinson Mayor Scott Decker highlighted Benesh's impact. “It’s not for us present veterans, but for those who have passed before us, who have served, and most notably for those who made the ultimate sacrifice,” Decker said. “Those are the individuals that we especially need to remember, but it’s a day for all veterans who defended the country and have passed on so we can memorialize them.” In addition to placing flags, Benesh encourages the public to participate in an \"adopt a vet\" initiative by placing flowers on veterans' graves. “I ask the public when they go to the cemetery to take an extra flower. And if they see a veteran’s marker, have their kids or grandkids place that flower on the grave marker,” Benesh said. Benesh's commitment to honoring veterans extends beyond Memorial Day. For 18 years, he has been actively involved in organizing Veterans Day programming in Dickinson, though he has since passed on these responsibilities due to health issues. His daughter, Holly Bloodsaw, expressed her commitment to continuing his work. “I have understood for many years that the tradition of decorating the veterans' graves will become the responsibility of myself and my children. And Dad, I can assure you, it will be done with the utmost respect and honor that you have always given it,” Bloodsaw said. The Stark County Sheriff’s Office and various community members support Benesh’s efforts. Each year, they join him in placing flags on veterans' graves. “We were once again proud to assist and support Brian Benesh and his friends and family as they made sure that each and every veteran in our local cemeteries is represented and honored with a flag at each of their gravesites,” the Stark County Sheriff’s Office stated. ADVERTISEMENT As Memorial Day approaches, Benesh emphasized the importance of remembering the veterans. “Please, please do not ever forget our veterans,” Benesh said.",

        "content": "Visitors enjoyed a complimentary barbecue lunch while engaging with the military community from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. City of Cold Lake Mayor Craig Copeland expressed his excitement about the event, emphasizing the value of public exposure to military operations. “It’s great that they get to show off what goes on, on the Wing here. I mean as the mayor we get exposed to it all the time, but it’s great for the personnel too, especially with the kids.” He added, the open house offered an opportunity for young people to see the many jobs that exist on the base, “and maybe expose future military people that want to join the armed forces.” Copeland also pointed out that there are “people in Cold Lake that are retired, and so it’s great for them to reminisce. There’s a lot of Air Force enthusiasts that come all the way up to the open house here to see the jets and all the helicopters and all the equipment - and it’s pretty cool.” The mayor also highlighted the significance of the upcoming introduction of the F-35 aircraft. “It’s a real excitement because the future of the F-35. Finally, we’re going to get a new plane for the men and women that fly for Cold Lake and work on the planes. I mean they’ve had the F-18 for many years and they do a great job keeping the plane up, but there’s a lot of excitement.” He added, “There’ll be a big, huge construction project going on... When the F-35 shows up here for the air show, I think people are going to be in for a great surprise. I think it’s going to be a new platform and leading edge - and finally, Canada’s investing in the best technology for their people and to protect Canada.” Lt.-Col. Frederick Dubeau, the company officer of the 4 Mission Support Squadron and the organizer of the open house, shared insights into the event’s planning and purpose. “The goal is to celebrate our 100th anniversary for the RCAF. So, this activity is organized to thank the community and enhance our relationship with them. So obviously, it’s open to anyone to come over here and see what we do, talk to our people, so they can learn about what they do for the country.” Dubeau highlighted the diverse capabilities on display, noting the various trades represented at the event. “Everybody knows that Cold Lake is the fighter’s wing, so we have the jets here. As you can see this morning, we have tons of other capabilities. So, it’s an honour for us to show our equipment and show what we do for the country. It’s an opportunity for us to engage with the community.” He added, “We have pilots, technicians that are fixing the aircraft, we have weapons on the display. There’s something for everyone.” Reflecting on the importance of community engagement, Dubeau said the open house offered a more intimate chance for the community to visit the air base, compared to the airshow taking place in July – with 27,000 people expected to attend that event. He emphasized the value of showcasing military capabilities to everyday Canadians, noting that, “we’re all taxpayers. The Department of National Defense is the biggest budget for the government. So, it’s important to see the capabilities that we’re buying and what we’re doing.” The open house also provided a platform for military personnel to share their experiences and career paths. “All the people that were here made big decisions when they enrolled. It’s definitely a different kind of life... And it goes beyond just a normal salary. It has become a passion for all of us. So come and meet with us and learn. We can tell you about our careers, where we’re coming from,” said Dubeau. A recruitment kiosk was also available for people to stop by. “You never know, it might trigger some things for some people. We’re ready to talk about the careers,” said Dubeau.",

        "content": "Pune: A Pune court magistrate A.A. Pande on Monday remanded two doctors of a government hospital and a peon to police custody till May 30 (Thursday) for alleged tampering of the blood samples of a minor boy whose Porsche car killed two techies. The medicos are -- Sassoon Hospital's Head of Forensics Department, Dr. Ajay Taware and Blood Bank head, Dr. Shrihari Halnor, besides a peon Atul Ghatkamble, who was the alleged conduit for the illegal gratification in the matter. Arguing for police remand, the police said that they wanted to investigate the hospital records, mobile phone details and other connected aspects, but accused Dr. Taware's lawyer Jitendra Sawant and others argued strongly against the police custody. Marking a sensational twist, Pune Commissioner of Police Amitesh Kumar said earlier on Monday that the blood samples analysed by the Sassoon Hospital did not match with the minor accused in the Porsche car crash. Kumar said that the purported blood sample of the 17-year-old who was caught in the car crash, was \"thrown in the dustbin\" and the blood sample analysed was of a 'third person', which is being probed now. The shocking details emerged barely hours after the Pune Police raided and arrested the senior doctors and the peon of the Sassoon Hospital for allegedly 'tampering' with the minor accused's blood report. \"We had taken a second blood sample which was given to another hospital for analysis with the intention of carrying out a DNA test later. Now, it has come to light that the Sassoon Hospital blood forensic report was of some other person,\" Kumar told mediapersons. Kumar said that Vishal A. Agarwal (the accused's father) had telephoned Dr. Taware on WhatsApp which is being probed, and the police now have sufficient technical evidence in the matter to prepare a water-tight case against all the accused. The three accused have been shunted to police custody for three days, as the charges of manipulating the crucial blood samples of the 17-year-old boy and submitting a fake blood test report could directly impact the prosecution case and the direction of the police investigation. \"I shall repeat... our case does not rest on the blood samples. The minor boy was in his full senses and aware of the consequences of drinking and driving the car at high speed,\" reiterated Kumar. The 'clean chit' in the blood test report of the accused minor boy, the son of a prominent realtor Vishal S. Agarwal, had sparked a huge row as it enabled him to get off on bail within 15 hours of the fatal May 19 crash in Kalyani Nagar area. In the same case, Vishal S. Agarwal, who was sent to judicial custody for 14 days, was booked in a case pertaining to the tampering of evidence, confining, luring and threatening driver Gangaram Poojari to take the blame for the accident, but he refused and has become a prime prosecution witness. The fatal crash claimed the lives of two IT engineers -- Ashwini Koshtha and her friend Aneesh Awadhiya -- both 24, and hailing from Madhya Pradesh. The minor boy is currently lodged in a Juvenile Correctional Home in Pune. His father is in judicial custody while his grandfather Surendra Kumar Agarwal is in police custody in the same case that has sparked a nationwide furor. So far, at least 9 persons have been arrested in the Porsche case, including three generations of the Agarwal family. They are -- the 17-year-old boy, his father Vishal S. Agarwal, his grandfather Surendra Kumar Agarwal, the two doctors, a peon, the three owners-managers of the pub and bar where the boy and his friends had partied on Saturday-Sunday night -- while two cops of Yerwada Police Station, PI Rahul Jagdale and API Vishwanath Todkari have been suspended for alleged dereliction of duty and other lapses pertaining to the accident, as public anger continues to simmer.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to get economic sanctions imposed over it’s controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing it down. This is all and likely won’t change after last week’s helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president and foreign minister. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further to weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of . Grossi has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The latest IAEA report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran’s decision to bar inspectors — a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. Iran and the IAEA are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The latest report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA’s years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. The report said that the IAEA’s request needed to be resolved otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations” under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.” Stephanie Liechtenstein, The Associated Press",

The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief , Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program.

        "content": "Ninja If your Memorial Day cooking plans aren’t really panning out, you can act really quickly and save the day with a cool, new, conversation-worthy pickup. What we’re talking about is the Ninja Outdoor Grill & Smoker, a multi-purpose weather-resistant outdoor cooker that can do everything from BBQ smoking to competing with the best air fryers , all in one device. And, as a bonus, it is now on sale. Usually $370, you can get yours for $71 off, bringing the price down to $299. It’s a part of the Best Buy’s Memorial Day sale , which ends today. The good news is that you can buy online now and pick it up later in the day at your local store, saving your dinner plans from disaster. The bad news is that you’ll need to do so quickly as this 4.8-star rated item is flowing off the shelves quickly (my local store only has two left). Why you should buy the Ninja Outdoor Grill & Smoker There’s a lot to love about this cooker. For starters, it has 141 square inches of cooking space that fit in a compound area on your picnic table of less than 2 x 2 feet. And, unlike big iron grills, it only weighs 30 pounds. Chances are, you can probably lift it. But what really makes this one great is its versatility. As a grill, you can make up to 6 steaks for your family or 30 hot dogs for the whole neighborhood. Get your air fryer game on and make three pounds of chicken in the same batch. Or, barbeque up a nine pound brisket to take advantage of the Ninja Woodfire tech — just a half pound of Ninja wood pellets will get you the smoked flavor you crave. Generally speaking, customers praise the cooker for its ease-of-use and quality of smoking for the size. These smokers are likely going to sell out quickly, especially at their discounted rate of $71 off, which brings the price from $370 to just $299. To make sure you get yours, be sure to tap the button below and order now. Then, if you’re a Ninja fan, be sure to check out these Ninja Foodi deals to complete your Ninja kitchen.

        "description": "The Grand Tour presenter Jeremy Clarkson has slammed the controversial Tory proposal of National Service for young Brits.",
        "content": "The Diddly Squat Farm owner and Amazon presenter took to X, formerly known as Twitter, earlier today and offered an alternative solution. The 63-year-old former Top Gear presenter said: \"Here’s an idea. Instead of national service, which is obviously idiotic, how about kids working on farms.\" Here’s an idea. Instead of national service, which is obviously idiotic, how about kids working on farms. Under the Conservatives’ new proposal, young people would be given a choice between a full-time placement in the armed forces for 12 months or spending one weekend a month for a year “volunteering” in their community, the Tories said. This has since proved hugely controversial. In an apparent pitch to older voters, he said volunteering could include helping local fire, police and NHS services as well as charities tackling loneliness and supporting elderly, isolated people. Jeremy Clarkson talks about ending Clarkson's Farm series Jeremy Clarkson hosts charity auction for Oxfordshire pool Jeremy Clarkson and James May speak out on latest rumours James Cleverly said that teenagers would not be sent to jail for refusing to comply with the Tories’ proposed “mandatory” national service. The Home Secretary said there would be no criminal sanctions for young people if they defied the plans under a Conservative government. In the first major policy announcement ahead of the General Election , Rishi Sunak pledged to get 18-year-olds to either join the military for 12 months or do “volunteer” work one weekend a month for a year. The Prime Minister said the policy would help unite society in an “increasingly uncertain world” and give young people a “shared sense of purpose”. In an apparent pitch to older voters and those who may turn to Reform UK, the Conservatives said volunteering could include helping local fire, police and NHS services, and charities tackling loneliness and supporting elderly people. Touring broadcast studios on Sunday, Mr Cleverly said the Tories would ensure the scheme “fits with different people’s attitudes and aspirations” after questions arose over whether teenagers would be punished for not taking part.",

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Technology Park comes up in Bengaluru Seoul: South Korea's antitrust regulator said on Monday it hosted a conference on artificial intelligence (AI) and competition policy with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The conference, held in Seoul, invited experts to discuss the role of competition in the supply chain of generative AI platforms, according to the Fair Trade Commission (FTC). Generative AI refers to technologies that create various types of content, including text, images and videos, by learning and analyzing data, reports Yonhap news agency. \"We need to build grounds for fair competition in AI-related industries, so that they maintain innovative growth while preventing unfair practices,\" Han Ki-jeong, the chairperson of the FTC, said. Frederic Jenny, chairman of the OECD's competition committee, also noted that there needs to be balanced regulation to ensure fair competition in the market while promoting innovation. The regulator noted the government will aim to roll out antitrust policies to address the rapidly changing trends in the generative AI sector.",

        "content": "Rajasthan Royals star player Riyan Parag has suddenly gone trending in online forums for odd reasons. The Guwahati-born hard hitter had a season to remember in IPL where he contributed largely to the teams’ successful playoff entry. However, he is now mired in some ugly online discussions after committing a big gaffe during YouTube streaming the other day. The cricketer was conducting live streaming on YouTube and was about to search for a Hindi song when his previous search history appeared on the tab. The search read in lucid letters \"Ananya Panday hot, Sara Ali Khan hot” which didn’t miss the vigilant eye of some of Parag’s viewers. The authenticity of the video is still in doubt and it may also be a jibe from some fans for Rajasthan crashing out of the playoffs. However, social media is abuzz with the cricketer's search history details while hilarious comments from netizens are filling the internet space. Parag surpassed 500 runs in this year’s IPL and was arguably Rajasthan’s player of the season.

        "description": "HARARE – Nelson Chamisa, former leader of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), has urged [...]",
        "content": "Former opposition politician Nelson Chamisa has called on his supporters to refrain from using violence to pressure the ruling Zanu PF party into addressing the August 2023 electoral dispute. Chamisa, who disputes President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s legitimacy due to alleged electoral fraud, emphasized seeking an amicable resolution to the political impasse. Chamisa, the former leader of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), left the party he founded, citing infiltration by Zanu PF, but has vowed to remain active in politics. Amid speculation about his next move, including the potential formation of a new political party, Chamisa has kept his plans under wraps. In his first public statement since his resignation, Chamisa stressed the importance of peaceful conflict resolution, describing Zimbabwe as “too beautiful and precious” to be marred by violence. “Fellow citizens, may I hasten to say, following statutory procedures and peaceful means to resolve your issues is not a manifestation of weakness or that we are devoid of other ideas and means,” Chamisa stated. “It is our strict commitment to finding each other and amicably resolving our points of conflict, disjuncture, and disagreement. We have committed to a peaceful resolution of disputes and intend to exhaust all available peaceful remedies.” Chamisa reiterated his call for dialogue with Mnangagwa to resolve the electoral dispute before the next elections in 2028. He emphasized that Zimbabwe cannot progress amid disunity and successive disputed national processes, including contested elections. “Our beautiful country can never progress on the back of disunity and successive disputed national processes, including contested elections,” Chamisa said. “We are acutely aware of the urgency of this matter and more importantly that there can never be any talk of 2028 or a viable and stable future for this country without resolving August 2023, the broken past, and disputed politics.” Chamisa has pinned his hopes on the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) to intervene in the crisis, following the regional body’s criticism of the August 2023 polls. He revealed ongoing communication with Sadc regarding the electoral dispute. “Meanwhile, we have noted the various meetings the leadership of Sadc has held, including the latest Extraordinary Summit of the Organ Troika on the 23rd of March 2024 in Lusaka, Zambia. Therefore, we have advisedly been patiently waiting on our request,” he said. “On the 29th of April, however, since considerable time has passed, yet we had sought to resolve this issue much earlier, we delivered our follow-up to Sadc for which we await a response to determine a clear path forward to resolve the governance crisis.” Political commentator and Southern Africa programme head for the Institute for Security Studies, Piers Pigou, expressed skepticism about Zanu PF’s willingness to engage in dialogue. “I don’t think he [Mnangagwa] would settle for dialogue. There is no political need to make this move (dialogue), as far as Zanu PF is concerned, they have won in the elections and they don’t agree with key aspects of reforms. There is a lot of positive thinking that exists within the ruling party but the individuals do not have the power to ensure that a policy commitment is made, or that there is accountability. That power lies in an elitist clique within Zanu PF,” Pigou said. Despite the challenges, Chamisa remains committed to a peaceful resolution and urges his supporters to stay vigilant and maintain their commitment to non-violent means of addressing the political impasse.",

        "content": "esterday, during Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, the Dallas Mavericks took a commanding 3-0 lead with a over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Among the spectators at the American Airlines Center in Dallas were several stars from the reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, including , , and their newest addition, The Chiefs' trio enjoyed a spectacular performance by , who combined for 66 points. Interestingly, the Chiefs' rookie wide receiver from last season, was also spotted enjoying the game. This has about the dynamic within the Chiefs' squad, especially given Rice's recent off-field issues. In April, Rice was involved in a , which is still under investigation. In May, he was accused of assaulting a photographer outside a nightclub, although the as the photographer stated it was a misunderstanding. Despite the resolution of the assault allegation, are far from over. The ongoing investigation into the car accident could lead to NFL discipline, potentially resulting in a multi-game suspension. The presence of at the game without Rice makes me wonder that the team's star players might be distancing themselves from Rice due to his off-field behavior. It might also be a subtle message to Rice about the and the standards expected within the team. If Rice avoids suspension, the Chiefs could have a formidable trio of receivers with Rice, Brown, and first-round draft pick Combined with superstar tight end Travis Kelce, this lineup positions the Chiefs as strong contenders for a third consecutive Super Bowl title and their fourth in six seasons.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief has warned Tehran has enough enriched uranium for “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.",

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to get economic sanctions imposed over it’s controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing it down. This is all under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader and likely won’t change after last week’s helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president and foreign minister. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further to weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Grossi has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The latest IAEA report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran’s decision to bar inspectors — a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. Iran and the IAEA are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The latest report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA’s years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. The report said that the IAEA’s request needed to be resolved otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations” under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "description": "The list of driver options for Mercedes to replace Lewis Hamilton with has reduced by one in the eyes of Sky Sports' Martin Brundle after an incident at the Monaco Grand Prix",
        "content": "F1 legend Martin Brundle believes Esteban Ocon has destroyed any hope of replacing Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes . Ocon had a nightmare Monaco Grand Prix, being forced to retire after crashing into team-mate Pierre Gasly . It marked the latest chapter in their long-standing rivalry which dates back to their go-karting days, reports the Express . And the Frenchman also has a lengthy record of contentious incidents with other drivers, which Brundle thinks makes him an unwanted prospect for the elite teams - despite being linked with the seat Hamilton is going to be vacating. In his Sky Sports column, Brundle argued: \"Ocon is a fine and fast racing driver, but history clearly demonstrates that he has an irrational red mist when it comes to racing, particularly against his team-mates. Mick Schumacher in frame for F1 return as team boss admits he's a candidate Sergio Perez crash leaves Red Bull with £2m bill and \"critical situation\" \"He has been heavily criticised before by Sergio Perez and Fernando Alonso for his intra-team aggression and contact, and now Gasly too. It will cost Esteban heavily as no front running team would entertain that kind of mentality, or even perhaps any team. \"A driver represents hundreds of hard working and professional people, and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment and sponsorship when driving for an F1 team. You simply can't keep attacking your one team-mate with abandon.\" It looks like Ocon could be facing the music, with Sky Sports News reporting that he's at risk of being dropped for the upcoming Canadian Grand Prix. Alpine team boss Bruno Famin was spotted talking to reserve driver Jack Doohan after his crash. \"Esteban's attack was completely out of line. It's exactly what we didn't want to see, and there will be consequences,\" Famin declared to Canal+. \"We are going to make a tough decision. On the first lap at the Portier, it was not the place to make a move, leaving no room for his team-mate.\" Ocon crashed into Pierre Gasly on the first lap in Monaco - and it's not the first time ( Image: Getty Images) Despite the incident, Gasly managed to soldier on to finish 10th, bagging his first point of the season. However, he was visibly frustrated when speaking to Sky post-race. \"I'm just disappointed with Esteban because it shouldn't have happened, and for the team. We can't afford to have this sort of behaviour,\" he declared. \"We had clear instructions before the race and this hasn't been respected, and you should never take that much risk to take both cars out with your team-mate. I'm sure it will be discussed and we can't afford to have a similar situation in the future.\" Ocon, who has been slapped with a grid penalty for his next race, initially dodged commenting on his rash manoeuvre but later expressed remorse on social media, stating: \"Today's incident was my fault, the gap was too small in the end and I apologise to the team on this one.

        "content": "Sen. Sharafadeen Alli (APC-Oyo South), has extended heartfelt felicitation to children across the nation in celebration of Children’s Day, urging them to uphold virtues of good behaviour and discipline. This is contained in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media, Akeem Abas, and made available to newsmen in Ibadan, wherein he expressed his best wishes to them, emphasising the importance of childhood and the role of children in the future of the nation. In a similar vein, the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), B Zone appealed to all stakeholders in the society to stop any forms of violence, discrimination, stigmatization, molestation and exploitation against children as they are an integral part of our society. The Zone, in a statement to commemorate the year 2024 Children’s Day and jointly signed by the Vice Chairperson, Adeola Adekunle, and the Secretary, Adeola Adewole, describes this year’s theme: ‘Inclusion for Every Child Belonging to any Society ‘ as a clarion call that no child should be left behind in all the welfare programs available in the society, irrespective of gender, age, tribe, culture or religion. Alli said, “Let’s embrace their dreams; so pure and bold, with love and kindness. Let their dreams unfold. Nurture their talents and aid them to forge their paths. Children are our hope, our future, we say,” he said. The lawmaker urged children to remain obedient and respectful, stressing the fundamental role these virtues play in forming their personalities and shaping a brighter future for themselves and the country. Alli acknowledged the efforts of parents and guardians, praising their dedication, as well as, commitment to raising responsible citizens, noting that the guidance provided by adults is crucial during the formative years of a child’s life. He encouraged parents to continue instilling good values and morals in their children. NAWOJ therefore called on the “Government at all levels to prioritize and promote protection of Children, quality education, improved health care delivery and passionately appeals for effective implementation of the Child Welfare and Protection Law (CWPL) and Violence Against Persons Prohibition Law (VAPP) to deal decisively with anyone caught violating the rights of the children”.",

        "content": "Bengaluru: In his first appearance after the alleged sex video scandal surfaced, prime accused — fugitive Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) MP Prajwal Revanna — released a video on Monday claiming that he would appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) for questioning on May 31. In the 2.57-minute video, Prajwal Revanna refuted allegations against him and called them part of a political conspiracy. “No one should take me wrong. I am appearing before the SIT on Friday, May 31 at 10 a.m. I want to answer in connection with the allegations against me by fully cooperating with the SIT and answering all questions,” he said. “I have full faith in the courts and will fight against false cases against me there. I will also come out of these false cases through the court only,” he added. “The forces in my native Hassan came together against me and made all attempts to bring me down as making progress in politics. After seeing all these developments, I was shocked and stayed away,” Prajwal Revanna claimed. In the opening moments of the video, Prajwal Revanna can be heard saying: “Firstly, I apologise to my parents (former zilla panchayat member Bhavani Revanna and JD-S MLA H.D. Revanna), grandfather (former PM H.D. Deve Gowda), Kumaranna (his uncle & former CM H.D. Kumaraswamy), party workers. I have come out to give information about my whereabouts in a foreign country.” “The election was held on April 26. Then, there was no case or FIR lodged against me. My foreign trip on April 26 was pre-planned. I went abroad accordingly and after three days, I happened to see Youtube videos. Then I got to know about the case,” he said. “The SIT had sent a notice to me and I had sought seven days to appear before the authorities and I also communicated the same with the SIT through my advocate,” Prajwal Revanna said. “Next day onwards, including Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leaders raising this issue started to campaign. After seeing all this, I went into depression. In that background I had sought apologies from everyone,” he said. “I ask for the blessings of God, family and my people in my attempt to come out of these false cases. I am appearing before the SIT on the morning of May 31. I will bring down the curtains on everything. I want to apologise to everyone and I also want to convey my thanks to all,” he stated.",

        "content": "I’ve been using the new M4 iPad Pro for the last week exclusively, resisting any urge to use my MacBook Pro as a crutch. Needless to say, it’s been an enlightening, interesting, and dare I say, a experience on a lot of fronts. My biggest takeaway? The iPad has flaws, but iPadOS does not need to be macOS to make it a good computer. There is a large contingent of iPad users who are using computers today because of iPadOS and how accessible it is to them. The iPad has arguably made computers more accessible to users who were once downright afraid of computers. For that reason alone, we should . Before the latest batch of iPad Pro reviews came out, I predicted what the running story would be, and I’m not even very good at making predictions. We’ve seen the same story time and time again over the years. Yes, the hardware is great...but the software falls short. Oh, and by the way, I’m guilty of it as well. Open > iPad Pro (2018) review.docx ... Copy > Paste > iPad Pro (2018) review copy.docx .... Rename > iPad Pro (2024) review.docx — Jeff Benjamin (@JeffBenjam) For years, the iPad Pro has sported hardware under the hood that’s more than capable for getting things done. For some users, it has been iPadOS’ shortcomings and idiosyncrasies that have make it challenging to get the most out of its power. However, that does not mean that the iPad needs to run macOS to reach its full potential. It just needs to be the very best version of . What does the best version of iPadOS look like? I don’t think it looks like Apple copied and pasted macOS onto the iPad. I think it still looks very much like iPadOS appears today, just with the type of refinements and creature comforts that more advanced users expect. It also needs app developers to treat the platform like a first-class citizen. There are many areas where I think iPadOS can improve, but there are three main areas that I think are among the most important. 1. iPadOS apps and the need for a common thread iPadOS apps almost feel like their own little mini operating systems running on the iPad. That’s because every app has its own unique method for interacting with it, accessing needed tools, etc. It’s missing the common thread that binds all apps together to make it a cohesive experience. On the Mac, that common thread is the menu bar. It’s the place where, no matter the app, you can go there to do the thing...whatever that thing happens to be. One could argue that the current methodology for viewing keyboard shortcuts – holding the Command ( ) key – is basically iPadOS’ version of the menu bar. The problem with the keyboard shortcuts menu is that it relies on a connected keyboard, is slow to invoke, and it takes up too much space, I think a more thought out redesign that serves both touch and keyboard users is needed. 2. Keyboard Shortcuts, but taken seriously This is both an iPadOS problem, and an individual app problem. As fun and handy as touch interfaces can be, they aren’t always appropriate for certain tasks. Power users rely on keyboard shortcuts to get things done more efficiently. Of course, iPadOS keyboard shortcuts, but they need to be taken more seriously by app developers, including Apple. If it exists as a function, it should, in most cases, have a corresponding keyboard shortcut. I encountered one of the most egregious examples of this problem while editing the entire video embedded above on my iPad using Final Cut Pro. Apple’s pro NLE is an amazing experience in a lot of ways, especially for its touch-first interface. I think this app has a of potential, and I’m excited for , which should ship within the next month. That being said, there are missing features that video editors need that just aren’t there yet, and that’s understandable given the app’s short time in existence. What isn’t as understandable is the lack of keyboard shortcuts for certain commands that currently exist, such as copying and pasting effects between clips. Because there were no keyboard shortcuts for these commands, I had to undergo the time-consuming process of manually copying and pasting effects between the one hundred or so clips in my timeline so that they would all match. Apple should also implement a way to allow users create their own keyboard shortcuts. Such a feature already somewhat exists as an accessibility setting in Settings > Accessibility > Keyboards > Full Keyboard Access, but it’s only for customizing the keyboard shortcuts used to navigate iPadOS, not for individual apps. 3. File management for tots The Files app is a huge improvement over its first iteration back when it was called iCloud Drive. I appreciate how we now have more detailed file information, how we can compress and decompress files, etc., but there needs to be more flexibility for users to manage files. One of the many frustrating things I encountered was the inability to preview a video shot with my Sony FX30 via Quick Look. Opening the file with Quick Look produced a blank screen prompting me to open the file in another app. There are many little issues like this that, by themselves, aren’t a big deal. But when you start adding up all of the smaller shortcomings of file management in iPadOS, it stands out. iPadOS doesn’t need to be “fixed” I’ve compared the difference between using macOS and iPadOS to get the same task done like the difference between running on land, and running while submerged in water. Eventually, you’ll both make it to the destination, but who will finish first? Better yet, who will feel better the run? Apple has drained a lot of the water that has bogged down the iPad experience, but more needs to be done. iPadOS is a highly capable platform, with its own unique paradigms. Some of its shortcomings might be viewed as strengths depending on how the light is hitting the prism so to speak. Shortcomings can also spur innovation when engineers are forced to approach a problem in a different way. iPadOS doesn’t need to be fixed, because that implies that iPadOS is broken. iPadOS needs to be improved and optimized. Improving the platform isn’t just about copying and pasting macOS onto the iPad. Improving iPadOS involves Apple paying close attention to the most basic user experience and interface shortcomings, while also continuing to build it out with new and unique features year after year. Apple hasn’t been perfect on this thus far, but we must recognize how far the iPad has come in a relatively short time. 9to5Mac’s Take Although Apple probably should have read the room before it published the where it crushed all of the beloved physical relics of creativity into a thin and light iPad Pro, I got where it was going with it. This machine can wear an infinite amount of hats, and it’s arguably the most versatile piece of consumer electronics that’s ever been created. The software that powers it, iPadOS, is fine. Swaths of users will second that thought. We just have to be patient, let iPadOS be iPadOS, and allow the platform to keep maturing.

        "content": "Leicester City midfielder Harry Winks hailed Enzo Maresca as the best manager he’s ever played under ahead of the Italian ’s move to Chelsea . Maresca guided Leicester to victory in the Championship this season, which has secured promotion back to the Premier League. The 44-year-old, who spent a year as Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Manchester City before joining Leicester, is now the leading candidate to replace Mauricio Pochettino as Chelsea manager . And Winks already predicted this season that Mareca is destined for success with an elite club. ‘He’s by far the best manager I’ve worked for,’ Winks told Sky Sports in March. ‘He’s incredible. I think everybody will say he’s going right to the top in [terms of] managerial stature. He’s got everything. ‘He’s a great man-manager. He’s tactically incredible, some of the decisions that he tells us to do before the game and how he views the match is something I’ve never experienced before in football. ‘So, yeah, it’s opened my eyes a lot to football in the way it’s played and the kind of Pep Guardiola style as well, I know he worked with for a long time. ‘I’m loving my football, it works perfectly for me. It’s exactly the kind of football that I want to play and buy into. ‘ I think since he has come in, I’ve learned so much and continue to do that.’ Gary Lineker questions if Man Utd star faked injury to get out of FA Cup final Will Chelsea decline Europa Conference League place and who can they face? Chelsea make final decision on Kieran McKenna with only two options left Who do Man Utd play in Community Shield 2024 after FA Cup win? In a separate interview with talkSPORT in February, Winks praised Mareca’s ability to communicate clearly with Leicester’s players. ‘He’s incredible in every way,’ said Winks. ‘He’s a manager who I think will certainly go to the very top. His understanding of football is something I’ve never witnessed before. ‘I think his approachability and man-management is exceptional. I’ve really enjoyed working for him so much already and I’m still learning so much every day. ‘When you go out on the pitch you know exactly what to do and how the opposition are going to operate and what you can do to affect that. ‘To do it so simply is the most important thing. That’s a thing a lot of managers probably struggle with, getting the message across, but the gaffer does it so well here.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page .

        "content": "Felicity Igbo, a 26-year-old furniture designer, reveals to ABDULLATEEF FOWEWE the inspiration behind her decision to pursue a career in furniture making, despite holding a university degree What inspired your decision to pursue a career in the furniture-making industry, a traditionally male-dominated field, especially considering your academic background and gender? My name is Felicity C. Igbo. I am 26 years old and from Mbaitoli Local Government Area in Imo State. I come from a family of four, where I am the second child and daughter. Currently, I am involved in furniture making. My passion for interiors and a strong desire to uncover the unknown drove me into this field. Despite suggestions that I should have pursued interior decoration instead, I chose furniture making because I am curious about the entire process: how furniture is made, the materials used, and the craftsmanship involved. This, however, isn’t the first skill I’ve learnt. I previously studied sewing while in my second year at university. However, sewing didn’t provide the satisfaction I sought. I realised my true passion was for interiors when I found myself examining the furnishings of every house I entered. This realisation led me to explore the world of furniture making, and I eagerly sought out information and training in this craft. Moreover, my decision to venture into furniture making was driven by a desire for uniqueness. I wanted to pursue a path different from what other women were following. From the moment I began working in this field, I felt a sense of joy and fulfilment. Igbo’s sister What was your parent’s reaction when you shared your plans to embark on a career in furniture making? Despite being in school when I started learning this skill, I chose not to inform my parents about my new venture. I personally funded my apprenticeship because I knew my father would not approve of such a decision. He strongly believes in the value of education, and while his assertion holds truth, considering the current state of the country, waiting for white-collar jobs is not always feasible. So, they became aware of my venture through my social media accounts, yet they never inquired about it. They thought it was mere play. It was only a year later that I disclosed my pursuit to them. At that point, they had no choice but to support me, seeing the dedication and effort I was putting into it. What were some of the challenges you faced while learning the skill? There were several challenges, but to name a few: first, the physical demands of carrying boards to be cut on the sawing machine; second, the social dynamics of working predominantly with male peers, some of whom mocked my involvement due to my educational background and choice of field. Additionally, the challenge of working with individuals whose perspectives differed significantly from mine. This often led to arguments that I sometimes had to concede, despite knowing the correctness of my stance, simply to avoid prolonged disputes. Igbo’s brother Have you faced any mistreatment from your boss or higher-ranking colleagues? Not at all. They show me great respect; some even refer to me as madam or sister. Can you share information about your educational background? I graduated from the Imo State University with a degree in philosophy. Although law was my preferred choice, I couldn’t secure law admission. However, I am currently pursuing a second degree in law. How did your classmates react when they saw you at the furniture shop? Some mocked me, calling me a carpenter, while others praised and encouraged me for taking such a bold step. Some even brought work for me to do. Given your dedication to your job, how do you manage to balance it with your education? At one point, I had to reduce my stays at the workshop, sometimes going only once or twice a week in the evenings. However, now that I no longer have lectures to attend, I have been able to fully commit to my work. Where is your current base of operations? Currently, I am still working under my boss here in Owerri, Imo State. I am, however, praying and planning to raise the funds needed to establish my own business. Have you ever felt like giving up on your job due to the ridicule and challenges you have faced? Not once have I thought of giving up on this trade. I am determined and clear about what I want and what the future holds for me. Could you share insights into a particularly rewarding project you’ve undertaken? My favourite projects are TV panels and designed beds. I find immense joy in working on them, from sourcing designs online to drawing, cutting, and assembling the pieces. It’s incredibly satisfying to see the final product match the vision I had on my phone. In what ways do you believe your university education distinguishes your approach to furniture making from that of your peers? My unique and trending sales are largely due to the strong educational foundation upon which I built my business. Education has taught me how to communicate and relate to my customers ethically and professionally, allowing me to deliver my work effectively. Additionally, my education has opened up more business opportunities. I can publicise my work both within and outside the state using social media and other platforms, which many others cannot. Education has also equipped me with the skills to keep precise accounts of my business activities, ensuring I manage finances responsibly and avoid debts. Moreover, as a philosopher, education has shaped my thoughts and perspectives, allowing me to stand out due to the knowledge I’ve gained. Lastly, my education gave me the confidence to choose this unique career path. I understand that furniture making is a rare field for a woman, and excelling in it opens up even greater opportunities. How do you balance creativity with technical precision in your work? As a furniture maker, I must present my ideas in a way that showcases both my vision and creativity. Before starting a project for a client, I ensure I understand exactly what they want, including details like material, colour, height, width, and budget. This helps me meet their expectations without wasting resources. When making quotations for clients, I sketch out the design to provide a clear illustration of the final product. Additionally, I sometimes solicit feedback from others to ensure my choice of colours and designs fits the intended space perfectly. How do you stay current with industry trends and new technologies in furniture making? Education has profoundly shaped my approach to staying updated with industry trends. I follow several furniture-related social media handles to keep abreast of the latest developments in the field. I make it a point to update myself daily by researching and sometimes practising new techniques. Although access to certain materials is limited in Owerri, I often order what I need from Lagos to stay on top of the latest trends. What does it take for someone to become a furniture maker? To become a furniture maker, one must possess a strong sense of calculation, dedication, and physical fitness. Health issues may hinder some individuals from working with wood dust and heavy boards. Additionally, financial stability is necessary to purchase the required equipment. Where do you envision your business and craftsmanship heading in the coming years, and how do you plan to continue growing and learning as a furniture maker? I see my business expanding and providing new opportunities. I hope to connect with esteemed individuals in the industry. I have set goals to attend advanced classes in Lagos or Abuja once I have the necessary funds to learn about current trends and further enhance my skills. Would you recommend that other women consider entering the furniture-making trade? To be honest, my journey in this field has been challenging. As a woman, I’ve faced unique difficulties, such as experiencing body pains from the physical nature of the work. However, I believe that if you have a genuine passion for furniture making, it will serve as a driving force that helps you overcome any obstacles. Passion is a powerful motivator, capable of pushing you to achieve your dreams despite the challenges. Speaking from my own experience, there was a time when I had no customers and received no support from my family. I started from scratch, but through perseverance, I have gradually built up my business. I never let the mocking and challenges deter me. Have you collaborated with other furniture makers, designers, or artists on projects? If so, what did you learn from these experiences? Working in a furniture company, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with various individuals from different backgrounds. These collaborations have exposed me to different approaches and techniques used by others in the field. It has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to broaden my skills and knowledge. How do you manage the physical demands of furniture making, and what self-care practices do you prioritise? To manage the physical demands of my work, I maintain a detailed recording book where I document all my projects. This includes the date of delivery and any specific requirements to ensure that I execute the work accurately and efficiently. I also emphasise to my clients the importance of giving me ample time to complete their projects to perfection, without rushing. In terms of self-care, I prioritise my health by always wearing a nose mask and gloves. This is essential because the dust generated from working with wood can be harmful to my health.",

It's a doomed pursuit as even the virtually free-falling racers are unlikely to hit even 30mph. But to take in the wider vista of this home-grown worldwide phenomenon of Gloucestershire Cheese Rolling, you need to rise up above the cheese and houses to see the spectators standing by and the racers reading to rumble and tumble.

And she went a step further on Monday, declaring on X, previously known as Twitter: “I am supporting Alan Adams to be Telford’s next MP. If you want to help Alan or donate to his campaign, sign up on his website.” She added: Outgoing Telford MP Lucy Allan said she had quit the Conservatives in order to support Reform UK's candidate in the seat. She said: \"I have resigned from the Conservative Party to support Alan Adams to be Telford's next MP. \"I have known Alan for many years and he is genuinely the best person for the job. I want the best for Telford and I can't just let the Labour candidate have a walkover. \" She added: \"As a Royal Navy veteran, Alan knows what it means to serve. \"He is the candidate who is most in touch with Telford people and best able to represent them. He will serve all residents, not just those who vote for him. \"Alan is not in it for personal advantage, power, or control over people. Alan's motivation for standing for election is profoundly honourable. He will be honest with Telford and put Telford first. \"Alan gives Telford a choice, so that Telford does not have to settle for more of the same politics and more of the same politicians.\" Lee Anderson, Reform UK's only MP after defecting from the Conservatives , thanked Ms Allan, adding that it was a \"great move\". Nigel Farage , the party's Honorary President, added: \"The Reform UK campaign is building momentum.\" The Conservatives confirmed Ms Allan has been suspended from the party, adding that a \"vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer .\" A spokesperson added: “Lucy Allan has been suspended from the Party with immediate effect. The people of Telford now have the chance to vote for a dedicated and hardworking new candidate who will put Telford first. A vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer .” It comes less than 24 hours before Mr Farage will make his first major intervention in the General Election campaign on immigration. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is hoping to keep the keys to Downing Street (Image: Getty) Reform UK leader Richard Tice (Image: Getty) Conservative strategists fear a wave of support for Reform UK will hand Sir Keir Starmer the keys to Downing Street. Allan won the seat from Labour with a slim 730-vote majority, which was squeezed to 720 in 2017. But that was extended to a majority of 10,941 at the 2019 vote. Mr Sunak has been dealt a series of blows in the early days of the campaign, with senior members of the Government – Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom – announcing their intention to quit Parliament. A post-war record of nearly 80 Conservative MPs have stepped down ahead of the General Election as the party languishes behind Labour in opinion polls. The total number not seeking re-election on July 4 hit 77 on Friday, surpassing the previous record of 72 who quit prior to Sir Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide victory for Labour. Former ministers Sir David Evennett, Greg Clark and Sir John Redwood also announced they were standing down. Trending Ms Allan announced last June she would not be standing for re-election. She said: In her statement she said: \"I have decided not to stand as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Telford at the next general election. “Together with my fantastic team, I will continue to serve our community to the best of my ability for the remainder of the Parliament. \"It’s been an immense privilege to serve such an incredible town, particularly during a period when, against the odds, and despite many local and national challenges, Telford has flourished. “I am honoured that so many of my constituents have trusted me to help them with some of the most sensitive and painful events in their lives. “I will of course continue to support every resident until a successor is elected. \"Over the last 10 years Telford has grown in optimism and confidence, realising its true potential as the West Midlands' economic power house. “It is a wonderful place to live and work. The air is clean, the light is beautiful, the housing is good value and our green spaces are second to none. “We have created new skilled jobs and fantastic opportunities for the next generation.” This is a breaking story.

        "content": "Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. The latest quarterly earnings reported by retailers Walmart, Macy's and Ralph Lauren showed consumers have continued to spend at their stores. However, multiple CEOs, including the heads of McDonald's, Starbucks and home improvement retailer Home Depot, have observed a decline in sales as people are becoming more price-conscious and choosy. A January poll by consulting firm Revenue Management Solutions found that about 25% of people who make under $50,000 were cutting back on fast food , pointing to cost as a concern. \"Retailers recognize that unless they pull out some stops on pricing, they are going to have difficulty holding on to the customers they got,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting and data analysis firm GlobalData, said. \"The consumer really has had enough of inflation, and they're starting to take action in terms of where they shop, how they shop, the amount they buy.\" For now, companies appear to be looking toward rewards points programs, discounts and mobile apps in an effort to keep customers loyal. But McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski acknowledged the impact of rising prices last month in an earnings call. \"Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they face elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry,\" Kempczinski said. \"[I]t's imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers.\" Home Depot's sales continued to soften in the first quarter as Americans are pulling back on large home remodeling projects, like bathrooms and kitchens, and that is hitting Home Depot, said Saunders. Sales at the nation's largest home improvement retailer slipped 2.3% to $36.42 billion for the period ended April 28, just shy of the $36.65 billion that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected. It was the third consecutive quarter of declining sales for the retailers, which saw sales skyrocket during the pandemic. \"Overall, Home Depot remains a formidable business. The current challenges are all caused by a period of churn in the consumer economy rather than by any missteps the company has made. Even so, we think the year ahead will be one of continued reset,\" he said. Price war taking hold While discounts are an everyday tool in retail, Saunders said these price cuts mark the first big \"price war\" since inflation started taking hold. Higher-income shoppers looking to save money have helped Walmart maintain strong sales in recent quarters. But earlier this month, the nation's largest retailer expanded its price rollbacks — temporary discounts that can last a few months — to nearly 7,000 grocery items, a 45% increase. Items include a 28-ounce can of Bush's baked beans marked down to $2.22, from $2.48, and a 24-pack of 12-ounce Diet Coke priced at $12.78 from $14.28. Company executives said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is seeing evidence that more people are eating at home versus eating out. Walmart believes its discounts will help the business over the remainder of the year. \"We're going to lead on price, and we're going to manage our (profit) margins, and we're going to be the Walmart that we've always been,\" CEO Doug McMillon told analysts earlier this month. Not to be outdone by its closest competitor, Target last week cut prices on 1,500 items and said it planned to make price cuts on another 3,500 this summer. The initiative primarily applies to food, beverage and essential household items. For example, Clorox scented wipes that previously cost $5.79 are on shelves for $4.99. Huggies Baby Wipes, which were priced at $1.19, now cost 99 cents. Low-cost supermarket chain Aldi said earlier this month that it was cutting prices on 250 products, including favorites for barbecues and picnics, as part of a promotion set to last through Labor Day. Fast-food promos McDonald's plans to introduce a limited-time $5 meal deal in the U.S. next month to counter slowing sales and customers' frustration with high prices. Burger King recently announced it is planning to offer its own $5 value promotion ahead of McDonald's. Other fast-food chains offering new promos include Wendy's, which recently announced a new breakfast combo of potatoes plus an egg sandwich for $3. Arko Corp., a large operator of convenience stores in rural areas and small towns, is launching its most aggressive deals in terms of their depth in roughly 20 years for both members of its free loyalty program and other customers, according to Arie Kotler, the company's chairman, president and CEO. For example, members of Arko's free loyalty program who buy two 12-packs of Pepsi beverages get a free pizza. The promotions kicked off May 15 and are due to end September 3. Kotler said he focused on essential items that people use to feed their families after observing that the cumulative effects of higher gas prices and inflation in other areas had customers hold back compared to a year ago. \"Over the past two quarters, we have seen the trend of consumers cutting back, consumers coming less often, and consumers reducing their purchases,\" he said. Other retailers In the non-food category, crafts chain Michaels last month reduced prices of frequently purchased items like paint, markers and artist canvases. The price reductions ranged from 15% to up to 40%. Michaels said the cuts are intended to be permanent. Many retailers said their goal was to offer some relief for shoppers. But Michaels said its new discounts brought prices for some things down to where they were in 2019. \"Our intention with these cuts is to ensure we're delivering value to the customer,\" The Michaels Companies said. \"We see it as an investment in customer loyalty more than anything else.\" Target said it was difficult to compare what its price-reduced products cost now to a specific time frame since inflation levels are different for each item and the reductions varied by item. The retailer this month said it's slashing prices on 5,000 different items, as consumers feel pressure to maximize their budgets. Discounted goods include fruit, milk, meat, peanut butter, pet food, paper towels and more. Food prices soar The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks consumer prices, said the average price of a two-liter bottle of soda in April was $2.27. That compares with $1.53 in the same month five years ago. A pound of white bread cost an average of $2 last month but $1.29 in April 2019. One pound of ground chuck that averaged $5.28 in April cost $3.91 five years ago. U.S. consumer confidence deteriorated for the third straight month in April as Americans continued to fret about their short-term financial futures, according to the latest report released late last month from the Conference Board, a business research group. With shoppers focusing more on bargains, particularly online , retailers are trying to get customers back to their stores. Target this month posted its fourth consecutive quarterly decline in comparable sales — those from stores or digital channels operating at least 12 months..

        "content": "DALLAS — It's one of the most exciting times to be a Dallas sports fan in decades and even Taylor Swift's boyfriend wants in on the action. As the Mavericks fought for a Game 3 win against the Timberwolves on Sunday, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were there to take it all in. As the camera panned to the Kansas City Chiefs stars seated courtside, Mavs fans in the American Airlines Center booed Kelce before celebrating Texas native Mahomes as he hyped up the crowd. Mahomes, a big-time Dallas sports fan, regularly attends Mavericks games courtside. Kelce was also spotted attending Game 2 of the NHL's 2024 Western Conference Final between the Edmonton Oilers and the Dallas Stars in a suite with Stars President and CEO Brad Alberts The Dallas Mavericks referred to Mahomes as \"our guy Pat,\" in a post to X while poking fun at Kelce for his relationship with Taylor Swift, identifying him solely as Swift's boyfriend.

It's unclear whether Mahomes or Kelce will stick around to see if the Stars can pull away from a tied series with the Oilers tonight, or watch the Mavs potentially pull off a sweep against the T-wolves Tuesday. Even if they are, Kelce's superstar girlfriend likely won't join them, as Swift prepares to perform two concerts in Madrid starting Wednesday night. Queen Latifah and Mavs legend Dirk Nowitzki were also at the ACC to watch the Mavs secure the 116-107 win against Minnesota.",

        "content": "@Th3solution You know, I hadn't even noticed it hadn't been continuing. I did like the Platinum line from the early days, but the red banner of Greatest Hits titles I found rather ugly. Anyway, could it be something to do with most games being sold through digital storefronts now, and continual sales? I'm ashamed to admit, but I couldn't tell you the last time I looked at games in a physical store. Even having said that, they could do a section in the digital store announcing a line that hits a certain sales threshold (and if you notice, some games do get stealth permanent price drops), thereby getting a lower price and becoming platinum or whatever. There's a lot they could do to improve the store, I feel. @BAMozzy The Greatest Hits program was never exclusive to first party games. In fact the majority of games on it were third party. Stuff like Battlefield, Crash Bandicoot, Battlefront, Monster Hunter, Metal Gear Solid, LEGO, Resident Evil, and Yakuza games, to name a few from the PS4 gen GH collection. For first party, I agree it becomes a little sticky when a game is cross gen, but some of them are sold as a package with both PS4/PS5 versions included. I also agree that the PC releases also complicate things because they seem to be releasing around the timeframe that a game would be considered a “greatest hit”. Remakes shouldn’t be a problem though since it didn’t stop them before (The Last of Us Remastered is a Greatest Hit on PS4, as is The Nathan Drake Collection) Still, at this point I think it would easily make sense to consider games like Demon’s Souls, Returnal, Horizon Forbidden West, R&C Rift Apart, GoW Ragnarok, SM1 & Miles Morales, UC Legacy of Thieves Collection; as well as 3rd party games like It Takes Two, Resident Evil 8, Yakuza Like a Dragon, No Man’s Sky, Hades, DMC5, Deathloop, GT7, AC Valhalla, FF7 Remake, Control, Stray... etc, etc. We’ve reached a point where there are enough games that have sold well and/or received accolades that they can be celebrated (and sold at a discount). Of course, I’ve always thought there was a weird inconsistency of which games get the special “Greatest Hits” moniker on their cover art. Games like Friday the 13th, Project CARS, and Plants vs Zombie: Garden Warfare 2 were included and yet hits like Shadow of the Colossus Remake, RDR2, and Detroit Become Human were not. Edit: As far as a GH collection cannibalizing the subscription service, I don’t think it would. PS+ subscription numbers have remained stagnant anyways. Some people would rather buy their games and I think the promotion of being a discounted GH would help sales. @Malaise The red “Greatest Hits” stripe still appears on the digital cover art, but it’s less noticeable than the red disc jacket of the physical versions. Like you say, the tradition could easily transfer over to the digital storefront, especially if the games are getting a price drop anyways. @Th3solution What I meant was that the main reason behind the 'Greatest Hits' maybe no longer relevant. The 'purpose' from the business perspective wasn't 'Customer' focussed but a way to have a secondary PR run to boost sales of an 'older' game that wasn't really selling anymore. Now they have PC and PS+ Sub services and the 'hype/PR' around those games releasing on PC or into a Sub service generates 'sales' on PS5. When Spider-Man came to PC, PS5 sales were also 'boosted' because of the PR. All I am saying is that Sony/Playstation is not the 'same' as it was when they weren't releasing games on PC to generate a second wave of 'sales' and if you missed their 'Greatest Hits', Subscribe to a higher tier to get to play them. If they were 'budget' price now on PS5, it devalues their Sub service and/or being able to sell the game at 'full' Price on PC. Essentially, that Sony are not in the same situation they were in, their 'market' has changed as they aren't solely relying on Game Sales on their Console as its now supplemented by PC and Subscription sales. Those still 'remind' people those games are all on Playstation too...",

        "content": "THERE are days when life is so full of splendor and majesty that you can’t stop smiling. Consequently, like two halves of a coin, the inverse can also be true because light and dark co-exist on an ever-present basis. And, on the days when life feels dark and devoid of joy, time virtually stops. In the worst of circumstances, the grief is all-consuming. In the space where on a good day there would be happiness, there is only emptiness and it feels like it will last forever. Perhaps that’s where the phrase, “Time flies when you’re having fun” emanates since it conversely stands still when you are in that dark space. But the notion that we will have dark days is not what frightens us the most, it’s the fact that life can change in a split second and we can oscillate from good to bad without any warning. No one understands this better than Dawn, her husband, Ray, and their nine children. Their life changed in an instant three years ago on December 17, 2021 as they were preparing for the Christmas holidays. Their story is so compelling that it was previously featured on an episode of Dr Phil, where I first saw it, and multiple news outlets in the US. Today marks the first time that this family has shared their incredible story with an international news publication. Dawn and Ray were born and raised in a small town called Jeanerette in South Louisiana, US. They’ve known each other since childhood and began dating after high school. They were married on November 14, 1987, and they never planned on having such a large family, but after their first son, Ren, was born, Dawn says that she experienced a love like she never imagined. She’d lost her mom at the age of seven so motherhood filled her with immense joy. Eventually, she and Ray went on to have (in chronological order) Katie, Shea, Rhett, Carly, Kyle, Lindy, Christopher and Kamryn. Dawn says that from the day that each of her children was born, she remained so tethered to their life force that their souls became inseparable. Dawn worked six days a week for the United States Postal Service and Ray worked for a local utility company. They lived next door to Ray’s family which was a tremendous help with raising their kids, particularly during their pre-school years. Their home, as one can imagine, was always bustling with activity swaying endlessly between church, school, family and other community commitments. Her busy work schedule aside, Dawn rarely missed an event and at the end of each day, no matter how tired she was, having one or three or five of her children sitting on the couch with her laughing and sharing stories about their day made every sacrifice worth it. Admittedly, her relationship with Lindy (age 20), Christopher (age 17) and Kamryn (age 15) was different from her other kids because these were her three youngest and, at age 57, she was able to give them more attention and pour her heart and soul into them in a way that was impossible to do with her older children. So, when Christopher had a basketball game in Monroe, Louisiana, which is four hours from where they lived, Dawn dropped everything to make sure she could be there. Ray couldn’t attend because of work obligations and Katie also wanted to go but stayed behind to attend a Christmas party with her husband and in-laws. It was the last day of school before Christmas break and on the day of Christopher’s basketball game, the weather was perfect. So, when his team won, it felt like a perfect day. They were undefeated and the entire stadium erupted in a loud applause. Many who attended can still recall the raucous celebration and excitement that reverberated throughout the room. It was moments like this that made Dawn especially glad that she made every effort to spend time with her kids, attend their games and be there for them whether they won or lost. Ever the sportsman, Christopher was a bit disappointed that he didn’t perform as well as he wanted and when they stopped to get some food from Subway on their way home, he didn’t get anything. His favourite fast-food restaurant was Wendy’s and Dawn had offered to stop to get him something from there, but he said he’d wait until he got home. Because she didn’t know the area well, she didn’t insist and they headed home around 6pm travelling on the I-49 highway. Being just before Christmas, it was already dark when they got on the highway. Lindy was driving since Dawn didn’t see well at night, but she sat in the front passenger seat to assist with directions. In the back of the car were Christopher, Kamryn and Christopher’s girlfriend Marissa. In a decision that would alter many lives, a drunk driver by the name of John Christopher Lundy (age 54) entered the highway driving at 90 miles per hour in the wrong direction. He was in his underwear, intoxicated three times the legal limit, and at 9.01pm he crashed into the car with Dawn and her children, smashing it like a hammer on a piece of pottery. The force of the impact was essentially a mini atomic bomb. The car practically exploded, spinning relentlessly while ricocheting fragments miles away like bullets. By 9.02pm, in that split second, Dawn and her family’s life would never be the same. Ray received a call from a paramedic 30 minutes later (using Dawn’s phone) saying that his family was involved in a car accident and his wife was critical, but stable. The paramedic said that she was being transported to Lafayette General Hospital and begged him to get there as soon as possible. Ray asked about Marissa and his children but the paramedic said that he only had his wife and didn’t know the condition or whereabouts of any of the other passengers. Ray immediately called Katie and two of his sons to let them know what happened and they all headed to Lafayette Hospital. Katie drove to the hospital with her husband and before she could park, her father and Shea came running toward the car. They’d just arrived at the hospital and on the way, they’d heard from a news report that there were two victims who died during a car crash on I-49. Two of the drivers, according to the report, had been killed so they knew that one of the fatalities had to be one of their siblings. Katie told them not to over react because they didn’t know if it was the same crash and, in her mind, there was no way any of her siblings could have died since her mom was likely in the front seat and she was still alive. Katie went to the front desk at the hospital entrance and asked about her mom, Marissa and her three siblings but only her mom and Marissa were at that hospital. Marissa (age 16 at the time of the crash) sustained a femur fracture, dislocated spine, left foot sprain, right hand fracture, neck sprain and severe whiplash. Dawn’s injuries were infinitely more serious. She’d torn both carotid arteries, sustained a spleen laceration, collapsed lung, multiple rib fractures, sternum fracture and had multiple broken limbs (her wrist, left ankle, right ankle and right tibia and fibula were all shattered in pieces). By the time paramedics got to the hospital, she was graded as 35; for context, anyone above 25 is not expected to survive. Another state trooper phoned Ray while he was frantically trying to get information on the accident and everyone else’s whereabouts. The trooper confirmed that the two drivers were killed instantly. John Lundy was at a rest stop, (alcohol level 0.22), didn’t have a seat belt on and merged onto the lane going in the wrong direction. He went down I-49 driving six miles in the wrong direction before he hit Dawn’s car and was ejected from the front wind shield and his car landed on top of him. Since Dawn was at the hospital with him, Ray knew that the only other person driving their vehicle had to be Lindy and his worst nightmare had become his immediate reality. His baby daughter had been killed and no one had any idea where she and his other children were. Ray was beside himself. Sensing his anguish, Katie put aside her own pain and sprang into action. She and her best friend of twenty years began calling every hospital in the area trying to find her siblings. They called hospital after hospital and no one matching their description had been brought in. When Katie’s mother-in-law got to Lafayette General, they decided to drive to Opelousas hospital since it was the hospital nearest the crash. Katie wanted her dad and brothers to stay with her mom because Dawn needed Ray and Ray needed the support of Shea and Kyle who were with him at the time. The best thing she could do in this situation was to bring their family back together and end their nightmare. So, while her mom’s life hung in the balance, Katie hugged her family, said a prayer and headed off in the middle of the night to find her siblings. This is The KDK Report. • Part 2 of this series will be published next Monday, June 3.",

A judge has granted the university a partial injunction against pro-Palestinian protesters who set up an encampment on its downtown campus earlier this month.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christinne Muschi MONTREAL — A judge has granted Université du Québec à Montréal a partial injunction against pro-Palestinian protesters who set up an encampment on its downtown campus earlier this month. Superior Court Justice Louis J. Gouin ruled Monday that safety measures need to be put in place at the encampment, and that doing so won't infringe on the encampment members' right to protest. \"It's essential that appropriate security measures be put in place immediately in order to prevent an unfortunate event from happening and for UQAM to suffer serious or irreparable harm,\" Gouin wrote. \"In the present circumstances, it is definitely preferable to prevent rather than to heal.\" Gouin said he was prohibiting protesters from setting up tents and other material within two metres of campus buildings, instead of the three metres UQAM had requested. The protesters had asked that the distance be set at one metre. Protesters have also been ordered to ensure doors, windows and walls are clear of obstructions; to remove cardboard blocking security cameras; and to allow representatives from the school and fire department to visit the camp to make sure it's safe. Protesters had said the security corridor requested by the school would force them to dismantle their camp, an argument that Gouin rejected. He said that while protesters might have to reduce the size of the encampment or rearrange it, the rules he was imposing were in everyone's best interest. \"These security measures won't harm the exercise of the right to freedom of expression, including to protest, of the defendants,\" he wrote. \"In fact, it will help set limits on the demonstration ... for it to take place in complete safety for all parties, subject to their respective rights to be asserted during the subsequent steps in the injunction process.\" UQAM had argued that protesters were posing a safety risk by blocking an emergency exit, being in possession of gasoline canisters and iron bars, and potentially \"overloading\" the university's electrical network with unauthorized extension cords. On the other side, lawyers for the protesters said the encampment members had already taken steps to clear exits, and that the demonstration was safe and peaceful. Since the encampment started on May 12, protesters have demanded that the university cut ties with Israeli institutions and disclose its links to Israel, and that the Quebec government cancel plans for a diplomatic office in the country. The university's court application said the inner courtyard of its science complex is being occupied by about 40 tents. UQAM's administration said it will take time to study the judgment before responding. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "The Group Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer of Repton Group, Odeyeyiwa Olayemi, has urged jobseekers in the country to demonstrate the required passion and focus to achieve career advancement. Olayemi, who was the keynote speaker at the Lagos Career Fair 2024 recently, also stressed the need for jobseekers to be diligent and resilient, position themselves correctly, and acquire special skills to get to the top of their careers. He said, “These career success basics become imperative because jobseekers are now faced with stiffer competition from millions of other jobseekers in today’s expanded job market, following the digital technology explosion that has made the world a global village by dismantling geographical boundaries, globalising competition and widening the scope of career opportunities.” According to Olayemi, apart from jobseekers, workers are also in constant local and global competition in the workplace with a lot of prospective employees, ambitious subordinates, determined peers and even toxic or insecure bosses, all seeking the brass ring of career success. “You need to sharpen your employability skills, strategically position yourself and be resilient to be able to stay ahead of the competition and achieve accelerated career advancement,” he added. The Repton CEO explained that employability skills refer to a set of skills, especially personal attributes, that make individuals more likely to gain employment and be successful in their chosen careers. “They are the skills that employers value more in prospective and existing employees, as specialist or technical skills associated with different roles are less important for business success,” he averred. He explained that some of these skills are effective communication skills, interpersonal skills, personal development/learning, self-awareness, emotional intelligence, problem-solving/analytical skills, creativity, and innovation. “As a jobseeker or worker, you need to build your brand and then position yourself as a good brand for recognition, advancement opportunities and growth,” he stated. Olayemi asserted, “Jobseekers should be creative in their job-search efforts by concentrating more on an unsolicited job application strategy where they will often be the only candidates being interviewed rather than the solicited application approach of merely responding to vacancy adverts that millions of other job-seekers are also applying for.” He noted that the development of employability and technical skills, as well as the employment of strategic positioning, may still not quickly guarantee career success in some instances, as expected. “This may lead to the boundary of your patience being overstretched. One potent tool you need to survive such a situation is resilience, the mentality of a winner,” Olayemi added. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria’s unemployment rate stood at 4.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2023.",

        "description": "It is the first time in school history that Stanford will make back-to-back trips to the College World Series.",
        "content": "STANFORD – Stanford will begin its Women’s College World Series against the No. 1 seed for the second straight year. But while the eighth-seeded Cardinal will be the underdogs against Texas on Thursday, it will have arguably the best pitcher in the country playing at the top of her game. Sophomore NiJaree Canady pitched a two-hitter in Stanford’s 3-0 win against No. 9 LSU on Saturday, and followed that up with a three-hitter against the Tigers on Sunday as the Cardinal won 8-0 in six innings to advance out of the Stanford Super Regional. It is the first time in school history that Stanford will make back-to-back trips to Oklahoma City. The Cardinal made the national semifinals last season, before losing to No. 1 seed and eventual champion Oklahoma for a second time. “I remember (former Stanford player and current ESPN reporter Ramona Shelburne) last year said it’s hard to get back, and I remember when she said that, I brushed it off,” Canady said. “I said, ‘Ok, we’ll get back.’ But she’s right, it’s hard. Last year I didn’t take it in as much as I should have, it being your first year, you just expect that this is normal. But looking back on it, only eight teams make the World Series, and this time around I’m going to try and cherish it because it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — or twice.” It’s no coincidence that Stanford’s first consecutive appearances in the WCWS came after Canady arrived from Kansas. Canady (23-5) leads the NCAA in ERA (0.65), has 310 strikeouts to 37 walks and has allowed just 99 hits in 204.2 innings. The 13 shutout innings by Canady in the two elimination games came after she allowed a career-worst six runs in four innings in the opening game of the best-of-three super regional on Friday. “I am so incredibly proud of this group of women,” Stanford coach Jessica Allister said. “To come back during regionals, and to come back after a tough first day, it takes so much grit, so much tenacity. I think it speaks to the strength of our team, and obviously NiJa put together an unbelievable weekend.” The only other two WCWS appearances in school history came in 2001 and 2004, when Allister was the Cardinal’s starting catcher. “I went my freshman year and had the same thought (as Canady), ‘This is how it goes,’ and I didn’t get back until my senior year,” Allister said. “I know how hard it is to get to Oklahoma City and there are so many good teams and margins are so small, you have to play good ball at the right moments, have to get some breaks. It’s wonderful because you get to see these young women live their dreams.” While last year’s team went undefeated in the regionals and super regionals, this season Stanford needed to win three elimination games to advance to the WCWS, an experience that Allison hopes will make the team more prepared this week. “Last season almost felt easy,” Allison said. “And this year was different. This is how you win it all, because you have all of this in your back pocket, and when you go through these things and you gain confidence, you’re a different team when you come out on the other side. It’s great to be able to perform in those situations and for that belief to just grow.” In Sunday’s winner-take-all game, the game was scoreless in the fifth inning when Kyra Chen caught a fly ball in left field and threw out an LSU runner tagging from third. The Cardinal then exploded for seven runs in the bottom half of the inning. River Mahler led off with a triple and scored on a grounder to put Stanford in front. The Cardinal had two runners thrown out at the plate in the inning, but RBI singles by Ava Gall, Aly Kaneshiro and Caelen Koch stretched the lead and chased LSU starter Sydney Berzon. Freshman Jade Berry hit a three-run homer on the first pitch from reliever Raelin Chaffin to make it 7-0, and Kaitlyn Lim ended the game with a leadoff homer in the sixth inning. The lineup’s power is a reason that Stanford (48-15) could advance farther in the WCWS this season after scoring just five runs in four WCWS games in 2023. While last year’s team hit 26 home runs, this year’s team already has 54, and four players have at least seven. Three-time defending champion Oklahoma is also on the other side of the bracket this time, though No. 1 Texas will be a formidable first opponent when the teams face off at 4 p.m. on ESPN2. The other two teams on Stanford’s side are No. 4 Florida and No. 5 Oklahoma State. “Bring (Texas) on, I don’t care,” Allister said. “They’re good. Everybody there is good. When you get into the postseason, everybody you play is good. They’ll be ready for us, we’ll be ready for them.” College World Series schedule (all times Pacific) Thursday, May 30 Game 1: (14) Alabama vs. (6) UCLA | 9 a.m. | ESPN (Fubo)Game 2: (10) Duke vs. (2) Oklahoma | 10:30 a.m. | ESPN (Fubo)Game 3: (8) Stanford vs. (1) Texas | 3 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo)Game 4: (5) Oklahoma State vs. (4) Florida | 5:30 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo) Friday, May 31 Game 5: TBD vs. TBD | 3 p.m. | ESPN2 (Fubo)Game 6: TBD vs. TBD | 5:30 p.m. | ESPN2 (Fubo) Saturday, June 1 Game 7: TBD vs. TBD | 11 a.m. | ABC (Fubo)Game 8: TBD vs. TBD | 3 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo) Sunday, June 2 Game 9: TBD vs. TBD | 11 a.m. | ESPN (Fubo)Game 10: TBD vs. TBD | 3 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo) Monday, June 3 Game 11: TBD vs. TBD | 8 a.m. | ESPN (Fubo)Game 12*: TBD vs. TBD | 10:30 a.m. | ESPN (Fubo)Game 13: TBD vs. TBD | 3 p.m. | ESPN2 (Fubo)Game 14*: TBD vs. TBD | 5:30 p.m. | ESPN2 (Fubo)* If necessary WCWS finals schedule Wednesday, June 5 Game 1: TBD vs. TBD | 4 p.m | ESPN (Fubo) Thursday, June 6 Game 2: TBD vs. TBD | 4 p.m | ESPN (Fubo) Friday, June 7 Game 3*: TBD vs. TBD | 4 p.m | ESPN (Fubo)* If necessary",

        "description": "It is the first time in school history that Stanford will make back-to-back trips to the College World Series.",
        "content": "STANFORD – Stanford will begin its Women’s College World Series against the No. 1 seed for the second straight year. But while the eighth-seeded Cardinal will be the underdogs against Texas on Thursday, it will have arguably the best pitcher in the country playing at the top of her game. Sophomore NiJaree Canady pitched a two-hitter in Stanford’s 3-0 win against No. 9 LSU on Saturday, and followed that up with a three-hitter against the Tigers on Sunday as the Cardinal won 8-0 in six innings to advance out of the Stanford Super Regional. It is the first time in school history that Stanford will make back-to-back trips to Oklahoma City. The Cardinal made the national semifinals last season, before losing to No. 1 seed and eventual champion Oklahoma for a second time. “I remember (former Stanford player and current ESPN reporter Ramona Shelburne) last year said it’s hard to get back, and I remember when she said that, I brushed it off,” Canady said. “I said, ‘Ok, we’ll get back.’ But she’s right, it’s hard. Last year I didn’t take it in as much as I should have, it being your first year, you just expect that this is normal. But looking back on it, only eight teams make the World Series, and this time around I’m going to try and cherish it because it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — or twice.” It’s no coincidence that Stanford’s first consecutive appearances in the WCWS came after Canady arrived from Kansas. Canady (23-5) leads the NCAA in ERA (0.65), has 310 strikeouts to 37 walks and has allowed just 99 hits in 204.2 innings. The 13 shutout innings by Canady in the two elimination games came after she allowed a career-worst six runs in four innings in the opening game of the best-of-three super regional on Friday. “I am so incredibly proud of this group of women,” Stanford coach Jessica Allister said. “To come back during regionals, and to come back after a tough first day, it takes so much grit, so much tenacity. I think it speaks to the strength of our team, and obviously NiJa put together an unbelievable weekend.” The only other two WCWS appearances in school history came in 2001 and 2004, when Allister was the Cardinal’s starting catcher. “I went my freshman year and had the same thought (as Canady), ‘This is how it goes,’ and I didn’t get back until my senior year,” Allister said. “I know how hard it is to get to Oklahoma City and there are so many good teams and margins are so small, you have to play good ball at the right moments, have to get some breaks. It’s wonderful because you get to see these young women live their dreams.” While last year’s team went undefeated in the regionals and super regionals, this season Stanford needed to win three elimination games to advance to the WCWS, an experience that Allison hopes will make the team more prepared this week. “Last season almost felt easy,” Allison said. “And this year was different.

        "content": "Expectations of Nigeria’s cadet football team, Golden Eaglets playing in the 2025 U-17 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and FIFA U-17 World Cup final in Qatar is fast disappearing like the early morning dews following the team’s 1-0 defeat by Les Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire in the semi-final match of the ongoing West Africa Football Union (WAFU) Zone B U-17 Championship played at the University of Ghana Stadium, Accra on Saturday. Youbah Coulibaly took advantage of a defensive mix-up by Manu Garba’s side in the 54th minute to fire Cote d’Ivoire ahead and that turned out to be the only goal of the encounter on Saturday, a result which means Nigeria will not qualify for the 2025 U-17 Africa Cup of Nations and the FIFA U-17 World Cup. But, since Nigeria’s failure to reach the final of WAFU-B tournament at the weekend, some people in the country are still optimistic that the Eaglets may still qualify for the two competitions next year because of the recent expansion of the FIFA U-17 World Cup to a 48-team field and African continent has already been alloted 10 spots in the final, an increase of six more teams to represent Africa. However, more facts have emerged on the sharing formula for the 10 slots alloted to CAF by the world football governing body which had ratified the slots par six FIFA Confederations at its recent FIFA Council meeting prior to the 74th FIFA Congress in Bangkok, Thailand. FIFA adopted several key decisions, particularly in relation to the future of football and unanimously approved the increase in the number of teams in the FIFA U-17 World Cup final from 24 to 48. Subsequently, the slot allocation was confirmed as follows: AFC: 9; CAF: 10; Concacaf: 8; CONMEBOL: 7; OFC: 3; UEFA 11, for FIFA U-17 World Cup in Qatar 2025-2029. But Prompt News has exclusively gathered that Nigeria may still not qualify for AFCON and World Cup because the West African subregion which has two Zones (WAFU-A and WAFU-B) comprising 16 countries is entitled to produce four representatives while UNAF (5-North Africa), UNIFFAC (8-Central Africa), CECAFA (12-East Africa) and COSAFA (14-Southern Africa) will produce the remaining teams to represent CAF in the global tournament from next year. It was also gathered that WAFU- B with seven countries namely Benin Republic, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Niger, Nigeria and Togo cannot produce three or four AFCON qualifiers at the expense of WAFU-A with nine countries of Cape Verde, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone. If the the situation continues like this only the finalists of the WAFU-B tournament will advance to the 2025 U-17 AFCON, which in turn serves as the qualifying competition for the FIFA U-17 World Cup. Regrettably, it will also be the second time in a row that the 5-time World Champions, Golden Eaglets, who won their last FIFA U-17 title in 2015 under the guidance of Coach Emmanuel Amuneke, have failed to qualify for the global tournament. Meanwhile, as the debate continues on the sharing formula for the additional six slots alloted to the Confederation by FIFA, CAF hierarchy are yet to make official announcements on the allocation of the additional six slots to the regional bodies of UNAF, WAFU, UNIFFAC, CECAFA and COSAFA respectively. But common sense dictates that regional bodies with more members like WAFU (16), COSAFA (14) and CECAFA (12) will get additional slots when CAF decides to make official pronouncement on the sharing formula for the six more slots.",

Granny chic looks different on a 50-year-old.\" The hairdresser defined his own take on the cut as being slightly undone, even if straight and smooth, with a natural feel. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) READ MORE M&S £30 'no-crease' linen dress a hit with shoppers as it 'flatters all figures' Priyanka Chopra sports a bob to show off a Bulgari necklace in Rome (Image: Getty) Don't miss...

        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi returning to power for a rare third consecutive term will boost shares of defence, infrastructure, railway and capital goods companies, the head of brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. “These were areas where the government has focussed on, invested money. High probability that the ruling government will continue. If they return... they’ll go (with) much more vigor,” Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman and co-founder of the brokerage, said on Saturday. “In the next 5 years, you’ll see major action from the government, powering these sectors.” India’s weeks-long general elections end on Saturday, with the ballots set to be counted on June 4. Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to return to power, according to opinion polls, although low voter turnout has led to some concerns about the margin of victory. Analysts see a shock defeat for Modi as an unlikely event, but fear a market correction – like one witnessed two decades ago – in the event of an ‘unclear’ mandate. India’s benchmark Nifty 50 (.NSEI) had slumped 17% in two sessions after the 2004 election results, when the then ruling BJP-led coalition lost, despite being tipped to retain power. In his two terms, Modi has focused on improving India’s ramshackle infrastructure and boosting domestic manufacturing, including in the defence sector. The government has proposed a record infrastructure spending of $133 billion in the financial year 2025. Shares of top defence, infrastructure and capital goods companies have risen between 64% and 480% over the last 12 months, outperforming the Nifty 50’s one-fourth rise. Reuters Graphics “If, for whatever reason, there is no clear mandate to the ruling party, then it’s scary. The correction will be pretty sharp because the expectation built for policy continuity is very high,” Motilal Oswal’s Agrawal said. Any changes to the country’s capital gains tax regime in the post-election budget could also hurt the market, he said. “The issue of capital gains tax tweaks is definitely there on the table. The government has not denied it. It is a major unknown,” Agrawal said.",

        "content": "@XandertheWise It depends on when the first day of school is of that year. My high school typically started very early in August, then seniors wouldn't be around anymore in May. I graduated in 2008 and during that year they pushed our first day into late August. So while my graduation was the first day of June, on Sunday, our last day of classes was the 2nd week of May. Sorry for the late reply @Bundersvessel ! I pulled a back muscle and I was in so much pain over the weekend. The joys of getting old Yeah it was an extraction. It seems to be doing rather well now.. So surreal that it's gone though. Ooooh boy I don't envy you. Mine are already all grown up thankfully (Though that comes with it's own problems). I don't think I could manage with a baby/toddler at my age now... I deal with kids enough as a teacher ha ha Is this where @kyleforrester87 is at? @JohnnyShoulder nah but I have seen that in recent years. We are total bad asses! Went to a local Tekken 8 tournament last night and it was pretty cool. I didn't do great @Voltan Cool. How many took part in that? @oliverp It was actually quite big (and a Dojo event for Tekken World Tour) - 48 players in the bracket @Jimmer-jammer How are you man? I'm still downloading RotR, despite having completed the tutorial, as I have a very slow internet connection/set up my Ps5 with performance settings that somehow cause slow downloads, anyway, it is a big game as well so that probably contributes to that. Anyway, how's work and life treating you? Is your job anything like the TV Show 'The King of Queens'? 🤣 @Black_Swordsman Doing well, thanks! Yeah, RotR is a really big game, so that’s surely a factor. As for my job, it’s less King of Queens and more Highway Thru Hell. In fact, parts of the show were filmed in my neck of the woods. I haul petroleum crude, so there’s the added stress of dealing with a dangerous goods product but the nice thing is that I work a 9 on and 5 off schedule, which works well for managing my life, especially when my real passions are decidedly less blue collar. I did, for a time, deliver and service portable toilets across Calgary and Vancouver, including at the 2010 winter olympics, which probably could have been its own tv show 😂 How are you doing? Have you carried on with your studies? Still operating the helplines? @Jimmer-jammer Yeah, good thanks, I am applying for courses at the moment so hopefully I'll get on to a good one, and yes, still operating the helplines. It's quite rewarding and enjoyable. That's interesting about your former employment. Definitely a TV Show I would have paid to watch! @Black_Swordsman Glad to hear you’re doing well! Being an ear for people in need is a real gift and takes a tremendous amount of personal fortitude. Here’s hoping your courses pan out the way you’d like! Plan a game purchase for tomorrow (its the day when the salary comes here where I live so) feel like I deserve to buy a game then (have planed the purchase for quite some time). @oliverp Which one? I cna't wait to buy Paper Mario 2, but unfortunately I had an awful pay day this month. That on top of me having spent all my savings over the last year, makes it really hard to justify new game prices. Especially since I still have quite some games left unfinished. Finances will probably return to normal by next month, so it's nothing to be worried about. Just sad that the one game I was looking forward to happened to release this month. @kidfred Oh its a big one which I might announce in the purchase thread. I of course hope that you soon will be able to pick up some new games. @oliverp I might have an idea about which game 😉 I have decided to give up on the idea of being a professional musician and focus purely on psychology for a future career path. It was an accumulation of things that led to this decision, I suppose, but mostly the fact that I realised I had been holding on to my teenage dreams, mostly inspired by reading interviews with musicians, mostly from the band 'Iced Earth' and other rock and heavy metal bands about how you go \"all in\" when you're young if you're gonna make it, and then stick to it, kinda thing. I realised that at this age a career in psychology, another of my interests, is more realistic, and on a personal level, more fulfilling to me. I also felt like I had \"made my mark\" on the music industry, with a handful of gigs from my teens under my belt, in addition to SoundCloud recordings, which people liked, flatteringly, recorded more recently. I will now just play guitar for fun, along with games, and read and watch cricket as my primary hobbies and interests, whilst focusing on psychology for the career and personal fulfillment. I have \"met up\" with my college self in the best possible way now, still focusing on a couple of the same hobbies and interests I had at that age, but without applying the passion and drive necessary to become a professional musician to that unlikely end now, and instead applying it to becoming a professional psychotherapist. @Black_Swordsman I find your decision and self-awareness quite inspiring. I'm closer to retirement than I am to my early working years, and I still don't know what I would choose to do or have a passion for. I do have some experience in psychology having spent many years talking to professionals with my personal history of depression, anxiety and other related mental illnesses, and I can certainly see the appeal and fulfillment of such a career choice.

        "content": "The abducted Paramount Ruler in Mbo Local Government Area of HRM Ogwong Okon A. Abang has been released after paying a N50 million ransom. Confirming the monarch’s release, the State Police Spokesman ASP Timfon John said, “Yes, it’s true” he has been released, but didn’t give any insight as to whether money changed hands.” According to a community leader, who pleaded anonymity, “The monarch was released early this (Monday) morning and I can tell you the abductors collected 50 Million Naira to release him. “The community is bitter, especially from the realization that some youths from within were among the kidnappers. We have vowed to get to the bottom of this and bring them to book. “This whole thing is induced by sheer greed and then envy by some mischievous community stakeholders over the exalted stool the Paramount Rulers occupy. Long may he reign. “The monarch has been taken to a hospital for proper medicare and his wife who was shot while he was being abducted is recuperating fast and will be discharged soon.” New Telegraph recalls that; the abductors opened fire on the palace at 9 p.m. on May 18, dragging the king away and shooting his wife, Obonganwan Okon Abang, in the leg. The tragedy heightened concerns about the state’s rising insecurity, particularly the death and kidnapping of prominent figures, with the Oro ethnic bloc being the most vulnerable due to the state’s destroyed road network and the porosity of its rivers.",

Actor-politician Alfred Vargas was over the moon with joy and surprise when he was announced as the Best Actor for his role in 'Pieta' at the 72nd Famas Awards. The event, held at the Manila Hotel on Sunday, May 26, was a star-studded affair that left Alfred feeling truly honored. When he arrived home, Alfred embraced the trophy and used it as a pillow until he fell asleep for a few hours. Upon waking up, the actor placed the trophy on the dining table and hugged his son Cristiano, whom he also considered his lucky charm. \"Wala pa akong tulog. I want to celebrate,\" said Alfred one day after he won the award. (I haven't slept yet. I want to celebrate.) \"It's an honor to share the Best Actor award with Piolo Pascual. Piolo even told me that we should do a movie together,\" said Alfred during an interview at B Hotel in Quezon City on May 27. Despite previous nominations, it was Alfred's first Famas win. Alfred mentioned that he had no idea what would be the best material for him and Piolo to star in a film together. When asked if he was pressured to do well in his future projects, Alfred said: \"Not at all. This recognition taught me to give my best in showbiz.\" The Quezon City councilor disclosed that the production company had altered its plans for \"Pieta.\" Instead of a traditional commercial release, the drama film would embark on a nationwide tour. In his acceptance speech at the Famas, Alfred expressed gratitude to the cast of \"Pieta\" and the individuals who supported him throughout his showbiz journey. \"Andito po ako dahil ako ay Pilipino mahal ko ang bansang Pilipinas. At mahal na mahal ko ang pelikulang Pilipino. Hanggang sa huling araw ko ito ang pangarap ko na ginagawa ko dahil ito ang first love ko. \"Inaalay ko itong award na ito sa Panginoong Diyos, sa aking pamilya, sa aking asawa: si Yasmien at sa aking apat na anak, lalo na sa aking only boy na si Cristiano. \"Nagpapasalamat din ako kay Direk Adolf Alix for putting up this very humble film at kay Jerry Gracio na nominated din kanina. Imagine napag-sama sama nila si Nora Aunor, Gina Alajar at Jaclyn Jose. Nagpapasalamat ako sa kanilang tatlo dahil dream come true na makagawa ng pelikula na kasama sila. \"Inaalay ko rin ito kay Jaclyn Jose. Ito yata ang huli niyang pelikula. At doon sa scene na magkakasama kami nila Nora, Gina at Jaclyn, nag-uusap kami ni Ms Jane sa tabi at ang dami kong natutunan sa kanya. Ms Jane, para rin sa inyo ito. \"Gusto ko rin magpasalamat sa lahat ng nagtiwala sa akin through the years. From my Tanghalang Ateneo days. Sa aking ABS-CBN talent center kay Mam Charo, Mr. M, Mam Malou, Direk Rolly Quintos. Doon ako nag umpisa sa 'Pangako Sa 'Yo.' Hanggang sa Seiko Films. Boss Robbie Tan. At sa aking manager na si Nanay Lolit Solis. Thank you so much. Para rin sa iyo ito. Thank you rin sa GMA 7 kay Mr Felipe Gozon and Ms Lilybeth Rasonable. \"Gusto ko rin ialay ito sa lahat ng staff ko. They are so hardworking. Kaya pa rin ako makakapag pelikula at acting kasi ang galing ng staff ko. Nababalanse ko ang lahat. Thank you,\" Alfred ended. After \"Pieta,\" Alfred said that there were no plans for him to shoot another movie. Aside from serving his constituents, he will focus on his upcoming inspirational drama series \"Forever Young\" with Nadine Samonte and Euwenn Mikaell, the child sensation from \"Firefly,\" on GMA Network.",

The U.S. Air Force released new pictures of its B-21 Raider, a nuclear-armed stealth bomber currently going through testing. The new photos show the B-21 conducting tests, including flight tests and taxiing, as well as a rarely seen full-frontal view of the new aircraft stored under a hangar at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The aircraft, which is set to replace the B-1 and B-2 bombers in the mid-2020s, is on track to meet its timeline for release, according to Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition Andrew Hunter, who told Congress this month that the test program was \"proceeding well.\" PENTAGON GREENLIGHTS MANUFACTURING OF NUCLEAR-CAPABLE STEALTH BOMBER: REPORTS The B-21 Raider at Edwards Air Force Base, California. (Defense Visual Information Distribution Service) \"It is doing what flight test programs are designed to do, which is helping us learn about the unique characteristics of this platform, but in a very, very effective way,’ Hunter said. According to an Air Force press release, the B-21 will be a long range and \"high survivable\" stealth bomber that will \"play a major role supporting national security objectives and assuring U.S. allies and partners across the globe.\" US AIR FORCE UNVEILS NEW PHOTOS OF B-21 RAIDER DURING COLORADO SYMPOSIUM The B-21 Raider lands at Edwards Air Force Base, California. (Defense Visual Information Distribution Service) The Air Force partnered with Northrop Grumman to build the aircraft, with the goal of producing a minimum of 100 planes during its mid-2020s release timeline. The Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (AFRCO), which is managing the acquisition program for the B-21, said in the release that the test aircraft have been built as \"production-representative as possible,\" a break from the typical flight prototype approach that will allow the Air Force to meet its production timeline more quickly.

(Defense Visual Information Distribution Service) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The B-21 is expected to enter service at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, which is planned as the first main operating base for the new aircraft and will serve as the location of the Formal Training Unit.

        "content": "M exicans elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador president in 2018 for sound reasons; his diagnosis that inequality, insecurity and a corrupt political class were damaging Mexico was convincing. But apart from poverty-reducing minimum-wage increases, Mr López Obrador’s “Fourth Transformation” has taken Mexico backwards. A statist, bent on tearing down the works of his predecessors, he is leaving the health-care and education systems in tatters. His reversal of pro-competition energy-market reforms has made Mexico’s electricity dirty and costly. Water is scarce. His hands-off security policy has let criminal groups strengthen their grip. He has attacked independent institutions, from the electoral body to the Supreme Court. In part because of his animus towards the private sector, the economic growth rate has been on average 2-3% per year in the non-pandemic years of his presidency, a mediocre figure given the huge opportunity facing Mexico, and momentum has slowed in the past six months. Mexicans will decide who inherits this mess when they elect a new president on June 2nd. They are likely to choose Mr López Obrador’s protégée, Claudia Sheinbaum, who belongs to Morena, the ruling party. Her rival, Xóchitl Gálvez, who represents a coalition of older parties, is polling about 20 points behind. How the winner governs will matter not just for Mexicans suffering from violence and inequality, but also for the rest of the world. Mexico has become a crucial actor in the shifting global order. The number of migrants travelling through Mexico to the United States has surged, and illegal migration is currently the most important political issue in the world’s most powerful country. The West looks to Mexico to help it decouple from China , especially for manufacturing vital green technologies and electronics. Mexico’s next president will have great influence on both counts. But its participation is steadily increasing The focus is as much on mitigation and preparation as on suppression The next president must make the country safer",

In a statement, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said the drugs were seized following an operation carried out by a joint team from the Anti-Narcotics Unit (ANU) and the Organized Crime Unit (OSU), which took place in the Komarock Phase 2 estate on Sunday night. DCI said the bhang was discovered in house number 228, belonging to Alah Mohamed Kala, who has been taken into custody as a suspect in the drug trafficking case. The seized bhang, weighing 205 kilograms, was hidden in gunny bags. \"In the latest operation conducted by a joint team of ANU & OSU detectives at Komarock Phase 2 estate last night, 41 bales of bhang stashed in gunny bags were seized from Hse No. 228 belonging to Alah Mohamed Kala, who was also taken into custody as a suspect of trafficking. The seizure weighing 205kg estimated at a street value of Sh6.2 million was processed and marked as exhibit, alongside a Toyota Noah Reg. No. KBL 186E is believed to be a proceed of the illegal trade. Pursuit of Kala's accomplices is underway as he fervently prays for a route back to liberty,\" DCI stated. DCI said the operation also led to the confiscation of a Toyota Noah vehicle, registration number KBL 186E, suspected to have been acquired through proceeds of the illegal drug trade. Authorities are actively pursuing Kala's accomplices. PERSISTENT WAR ON DRUGS AND TRAFFICKERS The DCI has maintained that traffickers in narcotics must eschew illegal dealings and take on legitimate business ventures, or else continue suffering the heat of the unforgiving law. This follows heightened crackdowns across the country... — DCI KENYA (@DCI_Kenya) This comes barely a week after detectives In a statement by the DCI on Wednesday, May 22, 2024, the suspects, Ferdinand Wanjero, 29, and Daniel Juma Mwadimwa, 26, were arrested after members of the public reported suspicious activity. The two men were seen at the busy Busia bus station preparing to board a Climax bus bound for Nairobi, carrying backpacks that aroused suspicion. \"Detectives from the Anti-Narcotics Unit (ANU) Busia have arrested two suspected drug traffickers and seized three bales of bhang stashed in backpacks believed to have been destined for the capital, Nairobi,\" the DCI stated. Adding; \"Ferdinand Wanjero, 29, and Daniel Juma Mwadimwa, 26, were arrested following information from members of the public that two men were spotted at the bustling Busia bus station, preparing to board a Climax bus bound for Nairobi, carrying suspected narcotics in their bags.\" DCI said the anti-narcotics officers acted swiftly on the tip-off and conducted a thorough search of the suspects' backpacks. The search revealed 12 kilograms of cannabis sativa, with an estimated street value of Ksh360,000. \"Anti-narcotics officers responded swiftly and managed to arrest the two, and upon thorough search discovered the 12kg of cannabis sativa with an approximate street value of Sh360,000. Legal processes have been initiated against the duo,\" the DCI's statement read in part. Ferdinand Wanjero and Daniel Juma Mwadimwa are currently in police custody, and legal proceedings are underway.",

The remarkable secondary analysis from the SELECT (Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity) experiment, a randomised trial with a participant pool of 17,604 people, was unveiled by researchers today at the 61st ERA Congress. The study’s findings, according to experts, give individuals who suffer from obesity hope since this illness is known to increase the risk of renal function decline and macroalbuminuria, or abnormally high levels of the albumin protein in urine. With an average follow-up of approximately 3.5 years, among patients who were administered a once-weekly subcutaneous injection of semaglutide 2.4 mg (n=8,803) adverse kidney-related events were experienced by 22% fewer persons (1.8%) compared to those receiving placebo (n=8,801) (2.2%) (p= 50%) decline in kidney function, or onset of persistent macroalbuminuria. Semaglutide’s ability to prevent the onset of macroalbuminuria was highlighted as a pivotal factor in reducing the likelihood of kidney-related complications. The study also assessed the impact of semaglutide on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function in removing waste and excess water from the blood through urine. The findings indicated a significantly lesser decline in eGFR among semaglutide recipients compared to the placebo group, with the effect being more pronounced in participants with baseline eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.001). These results indicate the potential for semaglutide to particularly protect kidney function in individuals with a pre-existing kidney impairment. The reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) further substantiated semaglutide’s beneficial effect on kidney health, with a significant decrease observed in semaglutide-treated individuals compared to placebo (p<0.001). UACR analysis measures the ratio of albumin (a protein) to creatinine (a waste product) in urine, aiding the detection of albuminuria, which can signal kidney damage or dysfunction. With semaglutide, there was a net 8.1% decrease in UACR in those with normal albumin levels at baseline, a 27.2% decrease in those with microalbuminuria (slightly raised albumin) at baseline, and a 31.4% decrease in those with macroalbuminuria at baseline relative to placebo. Importantly, the study found no increased risk of acute kidney injury associated with semaglutide treatment, irrespective of baseline kidney function. Over one billion people worldwide are affected by obesity.3 Rates of obesity are rising significantly, having doubled among adult women (8.8% to 18.5%) and nearly tripled in adult men (4.8% to 14.0%) between 1990 and 2022. The total number of children affected by obesity in 2022 was nearly 160 million, compared to 31 million in 1990. Professor Helen M. Colhoun, lead study author, commented, “By addressing key markers of kidney health, semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly may contribute to a significant reduction in the risk of kidney-related complications, including chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. This could lead to improved management of comorbidities and, ultimately, enhance the quality of life for individuals with obesity.” “The observed benefits in eGFR and UACR are particularly encouraging, suggesting potential for the enhanced management of kidney complications in the patient population with overweight and obesity without diabetes. The findings also underscore the importance of continued research into the possible renal benefits of semaglutide and highlight its role as a promising therapeutic option in the multifaceted management of cardiovascular and renal health in this high-risk population.” (ANI)",

        "content": "Kenny Pickett didn’t want to be in Pittsburgh as a backup to Russell Wilson, but he sounds pretty happy about being a backup for Pennsylvania’s other team. The Eagles traded for Pickett after the Steelers signed Wilson and he’s set to back up Jalen Hurts in an offense that new offensive coordinator Kellen Moore is putting together in Philadelphia. In a recent interview, Pickett had nothing but good things to say about both men and lie around the Eagles in general. “It’s ,” Pickett said, via Rob Kuester of NBC Philadelphia. “Obviously, Jalen’s an incredibly talented player. He’s played in a similar system, and we’re kinda all learning this new one together. So the communication back and forth in the quarterback room has been awesome with the quarterbacks coaching us and Kellen. I couldn’t ask for a better room, better staff to be working with. Obviously, the talent around this team is pretty special, so it’s a great group to be in.” Most first-round picks wouldn’t be thrilled about opening their third NFL seasons in a reserve role, but Pickett’s putting a good face on finding himself in that situation",

        "content": "Josh Berry’s crew chief Rodney Childers penned a touching tribute to the No. 4 Ford team amid Stewart-Haas Racing’s uncertain future. As those within the organization prepare to learn their fate, fans online speculated that Childers’ emotional post signaled the end of SHR . On Sunday, Josh Berry placed P10 in the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600, marking his second top-10 finish of the season. Following the race, the 33-year-old posted a selfie with several members of his pit crew alongside the caption: “4 team is having a blast!” Taking to X, Childers reshared the photo, adding: “This picture describes everything we have going on right now on the 4 team.. We are having SO much fun. We are getting better every week.. @joshberry is driving his butt off and deserves to race on Sundays for a long time.” The heartwarming message caught the attention of NASCAR fans, who believed Childers was making one last-ditch effort to keep his team together. According to FOX Sport’s Bob Pockrass , Stewart-Haas Racing drivers and crew members expect to learn the future of SHR on Tuesday. Dale Earnhardt Jr. begs NASCAR icon not to ditch the sport - 'That would suck' Chase Elliott makes valid point in reaction to Ricky Stenhouse Jr.'s punch fine “Alright guys, let’s get one last group photo that we can all remember the good times by.. I’ve been through that type of scenario a few times, and I can feel that picture,” one reddit user wrote, with another adding: “I think Rodney knows what’s gonna happen Tuesday.” Stewart-Haas Racing has undergone significant changes this year after Smithfield and Busch Light - two of their main sponsors - both left the organization. Its backing from Ford Motor Company, meanwhile, contractually ends at the end of this season. The uncertainty surrounding Stewart-Haas Racing has led some in NASCAR to believe that the team could sell all four of its Cup charters, leaving their drivers without a car to race for next year. Up until this week, SHR’s lineup of drivers have been almost completely left in the dark as to what lies ahead. Speaking to FOX Sports ahead of the NASCAR All-Star Race practice earlier this month, Chase Briscoe conceded it’s been difficult not knowing whether or not he will still have a seat in the 2025 Cup Series field. \"It'd be nice to be able to sleep a little bit easier at night just at least having a clue what's going on,” he said. “I haven't heard anything. I'd love to get some answers for sure.” Noah Gragson, who joined Stewart-Haas Racing this season on what was supposed to be a multiyear deal, expressed similar sentiment. \"There are some nights that you think, ‘Man I don't know what's going to happen' and then I just try to remind myself to focus on trying to run good for this week and just being present-minded and whatnot,\" he said. \"It's a tough sport as it is and when you've got those type of distractions, it doesn't make it any easier. “You can't stress over it too much, but definitely want to try and be in the know,” Gragson continued. “I have a great business manager. ... But at the end of the day, it does somewhat at this time of year keep you up at night if you don't have anything signed. I don't have anything right now signed for next year and don't know the future, but I know I'm in good hands.”",

        "content": "The Taliban now boasts one of the world's most well-armed terror armies, thanks to a windfall of US military hardware worth millions. The staggering cache includes over two million 7.62 bullets for AK47s, valued at more than a million pounds, and an array of military vehicles. They've also acquired A-29 light attack aircraft with a price tag of $17 million and 100,000 70mm rockets designed to unleash devastating human-shredding explosions. Additionally, nearly 61,000 high-explosive 40mm rounds are now in their possession, which could serve al-Qaeda training camps, along with a massive stockpile of 4.72 million 5.56 blank training cartridges. Terrorists plotting attacks 'worse than 9/11' from Afghanistan EasyJet passenger prompted F18 jets after Taliban joke went horribly wrong In a surprising twist, the Taliban have even laid hands on 89,000 new combat shirts, collectively worth about $4million, either for resale or to uniform their forces. This equipment, all brand-new and supplied to the Afghan Army earlier this year by the US, was swiftly commandeered by the Taliban amid allegations of severe human rights violations. This latest bounty adds to the billions in equipment previously brought into Afghanistan by the US over two decades. With this arsenal, the threat of increased attacks against the West has escalated. Colonel Richard Kemp, ex-commander of British forces in Afghanistan, told the Daily Mirror: \"Britain will face more terrorist attacks. The ungoverned space of Afghanistan will be used by the Taliban's partners al-Qaeda and the tallies of equipment now being revealed are deeply disturbing. \"I am not sure what could have done about it as this was given to the Afghan Army and you cannot withdraw the equipment whilst they were fighting the Taliban. But it is a deep concern that this weaponry will be used against us. \"It means we are now facing a very well equipped terrorist army in Afghanistan that is being run by the new rulers of Afghanistan and that should concern us all. \"The Taliban is now fully-armed and in control of the entire country and the west has left this equipment for them to help themselves.\" An anonymous source mentioned: \"Looking at this latest tally of new weaponry distributed to the Afghan Army just a few weeks ago, many western military people may rightly be quite shocked.\" \"In some cases, this means the new Taliban army soldiers, such as they are, are better-equipped than many soldiers serving in the legitimate armies of their home countries.\" \"And if this equipment is not usable by the Taliban, it appears they are already shipping I abroad, either to other terror groups or to be sold on the black market.\" \"An awful lot of very deadly equipment whose sold purpose is to kill and maim human beings has fallen into the hands of the world's most dangerous and capable terrorists.\" While the full extent of what the Taliban has seized remains unclear, a recent report indicates that the militant group now possesses millions of dollars' worth of US military equipment including advanced aircraft and armored vehicles previously given to the Afghan Army. The list below details the aircraft, their total number, and how many are usable, major equipment items were provided to the Afghan National Army, including: A-29 SUPER TUCANO: This is a light attack aircraft capable of carrying a wide variety of weapons, including precision-guided munitions. It was designed for low-cost operation in low-threat environments.

        "content": "Is Wriddhiman Saha returning to Bengal ahead of the upcoming domestic season? Looks like it! The India international caught up with former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sourav Ganguly on Monday and is believed to have shown keenness about featuring in the Bengal Pro T20 League and also be available for Bengal in the domestic tournaments. Wriddhiman Saha caught up with Sourav Ganguly in Kolkata on Monday.| Photo Credit:SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT While the pictures of the meeting between Ganguly and Saha went viral, the latter remained tight-lipped on the issue. Sources in the Tripura Cricket Association confirmed to that though Saha is yet to formally seek a No Objection Certificate from the association, there is a possibility that he might eventually return to Bengal. “All we know so far is that Ganguly has told him to play at least one game for Bengal before hanging up his boots. However, he is yet to formally convey to us his decision,” a TCA official said. In 2022, Saha featured for Tripura after playing for Bengal for more than a decade after a fallout with certain CAB officials. The then CAB chief Avishek Dalmiya tried convincing Saha, but he indicated he may no longer play for Bengal. He was upset with comments by a senior CAB official, who had raised questions over Saha’s commitment after he decided to skip the group stage of the Ranji Trophy due to personal reasons. He even exited the Bengal team’s WhatsApp group, despite coach Arun Lal having a word with the wicketkeeper. Under Saha, who played the role of a player-mentor, Tripura performed decently in the domestic tournaments last season. A couple of weeks ago, Sudip Chatterjee, who had joined Saha at Tripura, also returned to Bengal. Comments Related stories Related Topics",

        "content": "LONDON,- World shares firmed on Monday as investors prepared for a significant week of inflation data that could prompt a European rate cut as early as next week and signal a potential easing of U.S. monetary policy in the coming months. With markets in Britain and the United States closed for holidays, trading volumes were thin ahead of Friday’s core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. MSCI’s broadest index of global stocks edged up 0.2%, recovering from a 0.38% decline last week and hovering near its record high of over 796 points. “The pathway to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target appears longer and more arduous than anticipated last year,” said Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management. Median forecasts suggest the PCE price index for April will rise by 0.3%, maintaining the annual pace at 2.8%, according to a Reuters poll, though risks remain on the downside. “The U.S. economic recovery is uneven,” Schneller told Reuters, noting that while the manufacturing sector shows signs of slowing, services remain resilient. “This complex scenario likely delays any potential rate cuts to late 2024 or beyond, requiring continuous monitoring of incoming data to gauge the appropriate timing and pace of monetary policy adjustments.” In the euro zone, inflation figures due Friday are expected to show a rise to 2.5%, which economists believe will not deter the European Central Bank (ECB) from easing policy next week. Policymakers Piero Cipollone and Fabio Panetta indicated over the weekend that a rate cut is forthcoming, with markets pricing in an 88% chance of an easing to 3.75% on June 6. Societe Generale analysts noted that by Thursday, the ECB will enter a quiet period before its June 6 meeting. The Bank of Canada might also ease its policy next week, while the Federal Reserve is anticipated to hold off until September for its first move. At least eight Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week, including two appearances by the influential New York Fed President, John Williams. On Monday, the head of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stated that the BOJ would proceed cautiously with its inflation-targeting frameworks, acknowledging the unique challenges Japan faces after years of ultra-easy monetary policy. The BOJ holds its policy meeting on June 14, with a slim chance it may increase rates modestly to 0.15%. European stocks remained subdued on Monday with several major markets closed and investors cautiously awaiting this week’s inflation data. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) rose 0.2% by 1228 GMT. With U.S. and UK markets closed, trading activity was light. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures held steady, with U.S. markets set to reopen on Tuesday. Last week, the Nasdaq hit record highs after Nvidia (NVDA.O) surpassed expectations. In currency markets, focus remained on the yen amid concerns over potential Japanese intervention if the dollar approached the 160.00 level. The dollar stood at 156.84 yen, close to its recent peak of 160.245. Japan reiterated its stance against excessive yen depreciation during a G7 finance leaders’ meeting over the weekend. The euro stabilized at $1.0850, below its recent high of $1.0895. Gold rose about 0.6% to $2,348 an ounce, recovering from a 3.4% drop last week and below its all-time high of $2,449.89. Oil prices remained near four-month lows due to demand concerns as the U.S. driving season begins. Investors await the outcome of the OPEC+ online meeting on June 2, though analysts doubt there will be consensus on new output cuts. Brent crude was up 55 cents at $82.67 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 55 cents to $78.27 per barrel.",

        "content": "Bhubaneswar : The Commissionerate Police Bhubaneswar- Cuttack recognizes the critical importance of cyber security in today’s digital age. With the increasing dependence on technology, it is imperative to safeguard sensitive information and infrastructure against cyber threats. To bolster the capabilities in this realm, the Commissionerate Police has initiated this Cyber Security Programme, aimed at nurturing young talents interested in the field of cyber security. Sanjeeb Panda, IPS, Commissioner of Police, Bhubaneswar–Cuttack and DCP Bhubaneswar UPD has initiated the Summer Cyber Security Internship Programme 2024 supported by ICICI Bank, Bhubaneswar for the first time in the state to create Cyber Warriors. Being the capital city, cyber cases come from all over the state to Cyber Police Station Bhubaneswar first. Citing about the cyber cases, Commissioner said that in the last 04 months Bhubaneswar UPD, Cyber Police Station has received around 1515 complaints, registered 100 FIRs, detection is 9 %, valuable lost 17.75 crores, reversed 20 lakhs due to quick action, successfully blocked 7.15 crore ie 40%. It’s a challenge to get back the fraud amount as the complainants do not report immediately as they are not aware to block the amount after the incident. Commissionerate Police is trying to improve the capacity of Cyber Police Station, more simplification to be done in near future. Frauds like UPI related, Credit Card-Debit Cards, Social Media are huge in number and has become a common way of cyber crimes and on larger platform people are victimized of fake job fraud, investment, trading scams, digital arrest etc and losing huge amounts. So Commissionerate Police is planning to work more on awareness part, investigation part, detection part and education part through which people will learn and empowered themselves to report or block immediately by themselves in different government portals line www.cybercrime.gov.in, www.sancharsaathi.gov.in etc. DCP Bhubaneswar UPD Shri Prateek Singh, IPS also highlighted the importance of cyber education for people, cyber crime challenges and the preventive steps to be taken up through this internship and wished the students all the best by looking forward for a good outcome from this progarmme. The Internship period is of 8 weeks ie two months. This internship is designed to provide with valuable industry insights and practical skills that will be instrumental in their professional growth, proactive engagement and commitment which will not only benefit their personal and professional development but also contribute to the ongoing projects and initiatives in making a cyber crime free society. 11 nos of bright, talented technical students from best Institutes of Bhubaneswar from 650 odd applications were selected to undergo the Summer Cyber Security Internship Programme 2024 who will be given with hands-on experience, mentorship, and exposure to real-world cyber security challenges within the framework of law enforcement and will be monitored by Cyber Experts Team.

        "content": "YORK Valkyrie bounced back from their first back-to-back defeats in two years with a 50-12 hammering of Huddersfield Giants at Laund Hill. Emma Kershaw led York’s 10-try rout with a hat-trick, whilst Eboni Partington and debutant Izzy Brennan both notched doubles, alongside further tries from Carrie Roberts, Jess Sharp and Bettie Lambert, as Lindsay Anfield’s side returned to Betfred Women’s Super League action in style. The Valkyrie held a commanding 32-0 lead at the break but despite seeing their defence breached by Giants pair Gracie Hobbs and Hannah Goddard during the second half, never looked like letting the points slip from their grasp. Anfield made three changes to the starting 13 that limped out of the Betfred Women’s Challenge Cup to St Helens last weekend, handing both Manqualo Komaitai and Sian Judd debuts, whilst Sharp started at prop, seeing Liv Wood move to replace Jas Bell at loose forward. Both Georgia Taylor and Lambert returned from their short-term loans at Featherstone Rovers, joined on a new-look bench by Sheffield Eagles youngsters Brennan and Agnes Wood. Huddersfield came out of the blocks well and looked set to strike first after the Valkyrie had given away a cheap penalty on the right edge, but Allana Waller was dragged into touch by Partington a fraction short of the whitewash. Neither side could keep hold of the ball close to the Giants’ line, but a knock-on gifted York the opening score as the ball was worked to Kershaw, who slid over into the right corner with 12 minutes played. In the absence of regular kicker Tara Jane Stanley, Roberts brilliantly tagged on the extras in the first of five successful attempts. As the rain began to pour down in West Yorkshire, conditions worsened, with Anfield’s side again having Partington to thank for collecting Frankie Townend’s dangerous kick to the corner after another knock-on. But it was the Valkyrie who doubled their lead as the half reached its mid-point, as after weathering two consecutive sets on their line, the Giants’ defence parted, allowing Partington to race through into the left corner. Roberts slotted over the extras and wasted no time in crashing over the whitewash herself into the same corner after Huddersfield had been penalised for a high shot on Sharp, but skewed her conversion short. Kershaw’s second of the afternoon on the half-hour left too awkward an angle for the conversion, but both Brennan’s first for the club, and Sharp’s powerful drive, left the centre with attempts hard to miss as the Valkyrie held a commanding 32-0 lead at the break. York wasted no time in adding to that after the interval, Kershaw completing her hat-trick with a superb drive less than a minute after the restart. Roberts could not slot over the conversion, and missed again eight minutes later after Partington surged into the corner with ease for her second of the afternoon. Huddersfield did though hit back, with Hobbs leaving defenders in her wake to cross on the left edge before Townend converted to bring them onto the board. But York’s pursuit of points did not wain. First, Ireland international Lambert exploited a gap in the Giants’ defence to add her name to the scoresheet on the hour, before debutant Brennan crashed over for a second time with 10 minutes left to play. The hosts did however have the last word, Goddard profiting from the momentum gained off the back of a penalty with four minutes remaining. Townend again converted, but it was nothing more than a consolation for Huddersfield as the Valkyrie moved two points behind leaders Wigan Warriors ahead of next Sunday's clash at home to Warrington Wolves (12pm). TRIES: Hobbs (53), Goddard (76) GOALS: Townend 2/2 TRIES: Kershaw (12, 30, 40), Partington (23, 48), Roberts (26), Brennan (33, 70), Sharp (39), Lambert (61) GOALS: Roberts 5/10 HALF TIME: 0-32 POINTS SEQUENCE: 0-4, 0-6, 0-10, 0-12, 0-16, 0-20, 0-24, 0-26, 0-30, 0-32, 0-36, 0-40, 4-40, 6-40, 6-44, 6-46, 6-50, 10-50, 12-50.",

        "content": "New Delhi [India], May 27 (ANI): Continuing the party's attack on the government over the Agnipath scheme, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Monday said that it is against the interests of the country's security and the future of the youth. He alleged that the scheme has compromised India's defence capabilities against China. In a video statement released on X, Jairam Ramesh said that the scheme is \"a compromise with the country's security\". He said after the scheme was implemented by the Modi government, the number of youth being taken into armed forces has reduced to about a fourth of nearly 75,000 recruited earlier. He said the youth taken through the scheme are given training for six months and are sent to the borders. He claimed that the service chiefs had opposed the Agnipath scheme. Jairam Ramesh also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks at an all-party meeting in 2020 following border tensions with China and said these remarks had weakened India's negotiating position. He said the \"outgoing PM\" will have to answer for the scheme after results of Lok Sabha polls on June 4. In the post on X accompanying his video statement, Jairam Rames alleged that the Agnipath scheme had been brought by the Prime Minister without any consultations. \"It has compromised our capabilities against China,\" he said. Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi have been raking up Agniveer scheme in their poll rallies. The Agnipath scheme was announced by the Centre in June 2022. It provides for recruiting soldiers for four years, with a provision to retain 25 per cent of them in regular service. Those recruited under the scheme are called 'Agniveers'. The government has said there will be several job and other avenues open for the youth who are not retained in the defence forces after four years. Congress has said in its manifesto for Lok Sabha polls that it will \"scrap the Agnipath Scheme and return to the normal recruitment processes followed by the Army, Navy and Air Force that will guarantee economic and social security for our soldiers\".

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27 (PTI) The deadline for applying for the post of Indian men's cricket team chief coach ended on Monday but both the BCCI and the top name in its wishlist, Gautam Gambhir chose to keep mum on the development. After guiding Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL trophy on Sunday, it is but natural that Gambhir's name is getting more momentum. While both interested parties haven't said anything on record, the BCCI, it seems, doesn't have too many quality options available at the moment. It is understood that no notable foreign name has applied for the post, especially after BCCI secretary Jay Shah made it clear that the Board is looking at someone who has risen through the ranks and knows the domestic structure. It could be safely said that the BCCI's primary target was VVS Laxman, the National Cricket Academy head, but the stylish Hyderabadi seems not interested in a full time position which requires him to available for 10 months a year. \"The deadline is fine, but the BCCI brass wouldn't mind taking some more time before reaching a decision. Right now, the team will be busy with World T20 for the better part of the month of June. After that seniors will be rested from tours of Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe where any of the NCA-based senior coaches can accompany the team. So what's the hurry,\" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Also, KKR principal owner Shah Rukh Khan shares a deep bond with Gambhir and it is not easy to leave an IPL team which has been a part of identity for the former India opener. There's another aspect that needs to be look into seriously -- what senior India players, currently in New York, feel on whether Gambhir can indeed be Rahul Dravid's replacement.",

        "content": "The news ahead of this weekend's Rally Sardinia follows months of speculation linking the Italian manufacturer, the most successful in World Rally Championship history having won 10 constructors' titles (1974-1976, 1983, 1987-1992), with a rallying comeback. Following the announcement that it is reviving its famous HF [High Fidelity] brand in March , Lancia previewed its high performance all-electric Ypsilon HF and announced a combustion Rally4 programme. The Rally4 version will be powered by 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine that will develop 212 horsepower. As previously reported, a move into two wheel-drive production based Rally4 class seemed the most probable route for Lancia's long-awaited competition return. The brand is owned by the Stellantis Group, which already has two representatives in Rally4: the Peugeot 208 Rally4 and the Opel Corsa Rally4. Both cars are based on the same platform and use the most important common elements (engine, gearbox, suspension concept). Lancia is best known for producing the Delta and later Delta Integrale that powered Juha Kankkunen and Miki Biasion to four drivers titles between 1987 and 1991, but also won the constructors' title in the WRC's Group B pomp with the 037 in 1983 and previously claimed three straight constructors' titles with the Stratos from 1974 to 1976. A statement from Lancia said: “From today, the hearts of many fans and rally enthusiasts will beat again. “In fact, Lancia has decided to return to the world of Rallying, starting from the basics of competition, from Rally 4, the beating heart of Rally: a category that represents pure passion, with young drivers as protagonists who begin their careers with passion to become the professionals of tomorrow. “A new beginning in perfect Lancia style, characterised by ambition, pragmatism and humility, in line with the brand's mission and DNA. “Lancia is still the most successful brand of all time in the world of rallying, with 15 World Rally Championships, three Constructors' World Endurance Championships, a 1000 Miglia, two Targa Florio and a Carrera Panamericana. “The Lancia Ypsilon Rally 4 HF is powered by a 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder four-valve-per-cylinder engine that develops 212hp. “Equipped with front-wheel drive with 5-speed mechanical transmission and mechanical limited-slip differential, the high-performance model is the ideal solution for the enjoyment of all rally enthusiasts, but also a serious candidate for drivers who aspire to victory in the R4 category and in the two-wheel drive championships.” It is unclear when the first Rally4 Ypsilon will first hit the stages.",

        "description": "THE FNM convention is almost upon us – by this time next week, it will all be over and we will know if Michael Pintard has been confirmed as the returning leader or if Dr Hubert Minnis has won what looks at this stage like a very unlikely victory.",
        "content": "By Malcolm Strachan THE FNM convention is almost upon us – by this time next week, it will all be over and we will know if Michael Pintard has been confirmed as the returning leader or if Dr Hubert Minnis has won what looks at this stage like a very unlikely victory. Indeed, unlikely is perhaps being optimistic – at the moment, it seems like an impossible step. On Thursday evening, a succession of well-known FNM faces gathered at the British Colonial hotel for a pre-convention event in support of Mr Pintard. There have been complaints about the convention only being one day long – this felt like an extension in everything but name. It must take something for a former prime minister’s Cabinet members to ditch him and show up for his opponent, but here they were. Former National Security Minister Marvin Dames was there, so was former Tourism Minister Dionisio D’Aguilar. Former Deputy Prime Minister Peter Turnquest has already shown his support for Mr Pintard. Former Health Minister Dr Duane Sands, the party chairman, has been speaking of his support for Mr Pintard of course. Former Speaker Alvin Smith was at the event, as was Katherine Forbes-Smith, the former managing director of the Disaster Reconstruction Unit. Two members of the Rebel Seven were in the crowd too – Richard Lightbourne and Hubert Chipman and might as well have been saying “told you so” about Dr Minnis after their group ousted him as Leader of the Opposition before he became prime minister. That was a strange move that did not seem to have a final outcome in mind, but it certainly showed a lack of confidence in the man who wants once again to become leader. There were more too – Brensil Rolle, Pakesia Parker-Edgecome, Darren Henfield, Dion Foulkes, Elsworth Johnson, Reece Chipman, Brent Symonette have all opted for Team Pintard, it would seem. Meanwhile, over at Team Minnis, there’s Branville McCartney talking about how he will rejoin the FNM if Dr Minnis wins. Wait, no, he said when Dr Minnis whens, not if. When he wins? If he has any commitment to the FNM, he ought to join win or lose – not just roll up after the victory parade to claim whatever prize Dr Minnis has offered. McCartney called Dr Minnis “tried and tested”, but we should not put too much stock in those words given back in 2017 he called Dr Minnis a “bad politician” who was “full of himself”. Elsewhere in Team Minnis, there’s Desmond Bannister, who has been silent in the FNM except when he pops up to support Dr Minnis, and then there’s Renward Wells. Aside from that, there is Mark Humes, strangely, who Dr Minnis ousted from candidacy for a seat in the last election. If you’re looking at which way the wind blows, it’s not looking good for Dr Minnis. Which begs the question, if he loses, what next? When he was in office as prime minister, he advocated for term limits – without actually doing much to implement them. Had he won, his term limit would be up at the next election. If he was set on retiring then – and he is 70 years old at present – will he do the same if he is not leading the party into the election? It is hard to see him being happy playing second fiddle to a Pintard prime ministership, harder still to see him sat behind Mr Pintard in opposition if the party loses. Given the opposition within the party that Dr Minnis has provided to Mr Pintard, it is far from unimaginable that Mr Pintard would decline to offer Dr Minnis a seat to run in. The next week, then, may not just be make or break for Dr Minnis in terms of his hopes of leading the party, but of representing the party in the future at all. He says he is not going anywhere if he loses – saying that whatever the outcome “I will remain loyal and devoted to the party I have supported all my life”. Even if he wins, he will face an uphill battle to convince the electorate. Dr Minnis caught some really tough times when he was prime minister. His administration was served a double whammy of Hurricane Dorian and the COVID-19 pandemic to deal with. Around the world, economies were hard hit by the global shutdown – and we were no different. But the high-handed nature of how he dealt with those disasters alienated many to his leadership – and there seems little sign of them coming back to vote for the FNM if he becomes leader again. Then again, when he was ousted as leader of the Opposition by the Rebel Seven, it seemed impossible for him to win election having split his party – and he did. It seems equally impossible for him to win from here – but we will know more very soon. If he does lose, then Dr Minnis may face the political wilderness ahead of him, perhaps by his own choice – but perhaps not. He has some serious thinking to do.",

        "content": "Kolkata, May 27 (PTI) Nearly 29,500 houses in 24 blocks and 79 municipal wards, mostly in the south coastal areas of West Bengal, were partially or entirely damaged by Cyclone Remal, a state government official said on Monday. Additionally, over 2,140 trees were uprooted, and about 1,700 electric poles fell in various parts of the state, he added. Initial assessments indicate that out of the damaged houses, 27,000 suffered partial damage, while 2,500 were completely destroyed. The official cautioned that these figures might change as evaluations are ongoing, with data collection and damage estimation still in progress. \"The figures will probably change as the evaluation process is still not complete. Data is being collected from the districts and the estimation of the damage is being calculated,\" the official told PTI. The administration had shifted 2,07,060 people to 1,438 safe shelters, he said, adding currently there are 77,288 people. \"In all, 341 gruel kitchens being operated at the moment. We have distributed 17,738 tarpaulins to the affected people in the coastal and low-lying areas,\" he added. The affected areas included Kakdwip, Namkhana, Sagard Island, Diamond Harbour, Fraserganj, Bakkhali and Mandarmani. There were minor breaches of embankments due to the cyclone, he said, adding that those were repaired immediately. \"No major breach of embankment has been reported so far. All those reported were minor ones and were addressed immediately,\" he said. Six persons — one in Kolkata, two women in South 24 Parganas district, one in Panihati in North 24 Parganas district and a father-son duo in Memari in Purba Medinipur — lost their lives due to the cyclone. Coastal regions bore the brunt of cyclone Remal's fury, with significant infrastructural damage reported in both West Bengal and neighboring Bangladesh, where winds reached speeds of up to 135 km/h.",

        "content": "The World No.1 Iga Swiatek unleashed stinging forehands in the first round of playing at the Philippe-Chatrier to wrap up a dominant straight-set victory against qualifier Leolia Jeanjean on Monday in the ongoing French Open 2024. In a match that went a little over an hour, Swiatek hit 26 winners in a match to wrap up the victory 6-1, 6-2. In the second-round clash, World No.1 will face Naomi Osaka. After defeating Lucia Bronzetti in the first round, Osaka won five clay matches in a season for the first time in five years, when she was the World No.1 player. Osaka, who is currently ranked No.134, was asked if she is heading into the match not hoping greatly. “In a weird way, I definitely do feel like it’s a test to see where I’m at. but I wouldn’t say I have low expectations of myself. I’m a person that kind of thinks that I can win every match that I play. That’s kind of gotten me this far. I would never play a match thinking lowly of myself, no,” Osaka said as quoted by WTA. “I’m honestly really excited. I watched her a lot when I was pregnant. I think it’s an honor to play her in the French Open, because she’s won more than once here, for sure. So taking it as an experience and kind of knowing that I feel like I’m the underdog, and I think I thrive in those situations,” Osaka said. Elsewhere, No.8 seed Ons Jabeur started her Roland Garros campaign with a 6-3, 6-2 win over wild card Sachia Vickery in a match that lasted for one hour and 21 minutes under the Court Suzanne-Lenglen roof. Jabeur was off to a fast start in both sets, winning the Vickery serve the first time around. She executed her trademark drop shot well, maintaining her nose in front the entire time. Jabeur even started using it straight off the return of serve as the game went on, which proved to be a profitable strategy. Jabeur, though, exuded confidence following a smooth victory against his third consecutive American opponent. Overcoming some early nervousness, she stated she was able to “play in a relaxed way” as the game progressed. “I aim for a deep run. I did a wonderful preparation. I practised a lot, and I never dropped a set during practice sessions. I hope that I will see that again on the major courts, such as Philippe Chatrier, and I hope to get the upper hand every time. But I will see it point after point, ball after ball, game after game, and we’ll see,” Jabeur said as quoted by WTA. Jabeur stated that she had to orient herself in challenging circumstances, and her accomplishment in doing so was demonstrated by the growing quantity of drop shots she threw at Vickery throughout the game. Jabeur was so sure of them that she would often use them right off the return, and always with great success. “I managed my drop shots well. It has always helped me to overwhelm the opponent, to prevent my opponent from going to the net,” she said. The Tunisian will next face either 2023 Rome finalist Anhelina Kalinina or the two-time Bogota winner Camila Osorio. (ANI)",

The Trilogy companies originally offered $2.25 per share but raised their bid in April. “We are pleased with the result of today’s vote and look forward to continuing our work on Indigo’s transformation strategy,” Reisman said in a statement following the vote. “We remain deeply committed to our customers and to all our stakeholders as we work together to inspire reading and enrich the lives of booklovers across the country.” Indigo spokesperson Madison Downey said in an email to The Canadian Press that Trilogy would not be commenting on the vote. For Trilogy’s offer to be accepted, it required approval by a two-thirds majority vote of Indigo shareholders and a simple majority vote by shareholders not linked to Trilogy and its affiliates. Some 95.09 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at the meeting Monday were in favour of accepting the deal. Just shy of 83 per cent of the votes from shareholders not linked to Trilogy and affiliates were in support of the offer. The privatization allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability and growth back to Canada’s biggest bookstore. “The rationale is not to be saddled with public reporting responsibilities because Indigo has been through a lot,” said Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto, in February, when the Trilogy firms made their offer. Trilogy now faces a hefty amount of work. Indigo is still recovering from a cyber attack that downed its website for a lengthy period last year, a series of quarterly losses leading up to a January layoff, and a succession of changes that saw four of 10 board members depart last year with one claiming mistreatment and “a loss of confidence in board leadership.” Reisman, who retired amid the turmoil, returned within months to helm Indigo. The issues have played out as inflation and high interest rates make many Canadians think twice about opening their wallets, especially for the discretionary items Indigo is known for. The trend cropped up particularly in the holiday season, when Indigo executives admitted they had overbought merchandise and stocked an assortment of merchandise they found customers weren’t looking for in the final weeks before Christmas. “Despite all their best efforts, they are not doing well,” Kai Li, the Canada Research Chair in corporate governance who teaches at the University of British Columbia, said of Indigo in February. “They are bleeding cash.” To turn things around, Indigo has been carrying out a transformation plan since at least November. It’s offered few specifics, but Reisman, who founded the chain in 1996, has said it is meant to “return Indigo to both growth and profitability.” In the months since she mentioned the plan, some stores have seen wellness products and the popular American Girl dolls culled from their shelves and Columbus Café & Co. has moved into some Indigo spaces previously held by Starbucks. Reisman has also pledged in newsletters to bring back its digital inventory search kiosks, program more events and add seating to more stores. Trilogy hasn’t said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted, likely because the money offered reflected a 69 per cent premium on the share price of $1.48 that Indigo had when Trilogy first made its bid. Indigo’s share price sat at $2.48 ahead of the Monday vote. Last month, the offer garnered the support from a special committee of independent directors Indigo formed to assess the deal. Earlier this month, Indigo also said that leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders approve the deal. Indigo has said it expects the transaction to close in June and its shares to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange sometime after.

It’s offered few specifics, but Reisman, who founded the chain in 1996, has said it is meant to “return Indigo to both growth and profitability.” In the months since she mentioned the plan, some stores have seen wellness products and the popular American Girl dolls culled from their shelves and Columbus Café & Co. has moved into some Indigo spaces previously held by Starbucks. Reisman has also pledged in newsletters to bring back its digital inventory search kiosks, program more events and add seating to more stores. Trilogy hasn’t said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted, likely because the money offered reflected a 69 per cent premium on the share price of $1.48 that Indigo had when Trilogy first made its bid. Indigo's share price sat at $2.48 ahead of the Monday vote. Last month, the offer garnered the support from a special committee of independent directors Indigo formed to assess the deal. Earlier this month, Indigo also said that leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders approve the deal. Indigo has said it expects the transaction to close in June and its shares to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange sometime after.

        "description": "TORONTO — Indigo Books & Music Inc. shareholders have voted to approve a deal that will see the retailer become a private company. The offer of $2.50 per share comes from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P.",
        "content": "TORONTO — Indigo Books & Music Inc. shareholders have voted to approve a deal that will see the retailer become a private company. Shareholders voted Monday in favour of a $2.50 per share offer from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P., which have a 56 per cent stake in Indigo and are owned by Gerald Schwartz, the spouse of Indigo chief executive Heather Reisman. The Trilogy companies originally offered $2.25 per share but raised their bid in April. \"We are pleased with the result of today’s vote and look forward to continuing our work on Indigo’s transformation strategy,\" Reisman said in a statement following the vote. \"We remain deeply committed to our customers and to all our stakeholders as we work together to inspire reading and enrich the lives of booklovers across the country.\" Indigo spokesperson Madison Downey said in an email to The Canadian Press that Trilogy would not be commenting on the vote. For Trilogy's offer to be accepted, it required approval by a two-thirds majority vote of Indigo shareholders and a simple majority vote by shareholders not linked to Trilogy and its affiliates. Some 95.09 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at the meeting Monday were in favour of accepting the deal. Just shy of 83 per cent of the votes from shareholders not linked to Trilogy and affiliates were in support of the offer. The privatization allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability and growth back to Canada’s biggest bookstore. “The rationale is not to be saddled with public reporting responsibilities because Indigo has been through a lot,\" said Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto, in February, when the Trilogy firms made their offer. Trilogy now faces a hefty amount of work. Indigo is still recovering from a cyber attack that downed its website for a lengthy period last year, a series of quarterly losses leading up to a January layoff, and a succession of changes that saw four of 10 board members depart last year with one claiming mistreatment and \"a loss of confidence in board leadership.\" Reisman, who retired amid the turmoil, returned within months to helm Indigo. The issues have played out as inflation and high interest rates make many Canadians think twice about opening their wallets, especially for the discretionary items Indigo is known for. The trend cropped up particularly in the holiday season, when Indigo executives admitted they had overbought merchandise and stocked an assortment of merchandise they found customers weren’t looking for in the final weeks before Christmas. \"Despite all their best efforts, they are not doing well,” Kai Li, the Canada Research Chair in corporate governance who teaches at the University of British Columbia, said of Indigo in February. “They are bleeding cash.” To turn things around, Indigo has been carrying out a transformation plan since at least November.

        "content": "NEW YORK, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of common stock of Globe Life Inc. f/k/a Torchmark Corporation (NYSE: NYSE: GL ) between May 8, 2019 and April 10, 2024, both dates inclusive (the Class Period), of the important July 1, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Globe Life common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Globe Life class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24072 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 1, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made numerous materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning: (1) Globe Life's consistent premium revenue growth, particularly from American Income Life Insurance Company (AIL); and (2) Globe Life's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code of Conduct). Specifically, defendants repeatedly attributed Globe Life's consistent premium revenue growth to increased agent count and productivity. In addition, Globe Life's Code of Conduct stated, among other things, that [t]he Company is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment, that [v]iolence and threatening behavior are not permitted, and that [t]he use of illegal drugs in the workplace will not be tolerated. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication proofread by SWPS University Why do people in Paris like seaweed and tofu salad? Will Italians be tempted to try a beetle skewer? How many young Polish consumers are \"food innovators,\" eager to eat chickpea pâté? In an international project, researchers from SWPS University analyzed European consumers' attitudes towards alternative protein food products. In the face of the fight against climate change , more and more people are modifying their diets, giving up or limiting conventional sources of protein (e.g., beef, pork, poultry, and animal dairy) in favor of those with a lower environmental impact. These are the so-called alternative protein food (APF) products, which may be based on legumes, algae, mushrooms, crustaceans and insects. \"Although Europe is the leading market in production and sales of APF and original research on this topic is growing, there has been no synthesis of between-country differences in APF choices across Europe,\" says Hanna Zaleśkiewicz from the CARE-BEH Center for Applied Research on Health Behavior and Health, SWPS University. Researchers from SWPS University together with experts from Germany, Denmark, Greece, Norway and Italy analyzed research from 11 databases of peer-reviewed journals. In total, their analysis included 25 studies conducted in 18 European countries. The results were published in Food Quality and Preference . The researchers focused particularly on data from Denmark, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, Italy, Spain, the UK and Germany. Research shows that many consumers rate hybrid products, i.e. those combining conventional and alternative protein, higher than meat products in terms of the attributes of being healthy, ethical, environmentally friendly, and nutritious. This trend is observed especially among Danish consumers, but also among consumers from other countries, e.g. the UK and Spain. Positive attitudes and beliefs, however, do not always translate to intention to buy such products: 60% of studies addressing APF-related purchase intentions indicate that Danish consumers have relatively low intention to buy APF products. In one study, only 46% of them were willing to buy hybrid meat (a product combining plants and meat), compared to 63% of consumers in Spain and 53% in the UK. Studies show that consumers from Poland and the Czech Republic have less knowledge regarding innovative food products and higher reluctance to adopt novel foods compared to Danish and German consumers. \"These patterns should be considered in the context of persistently high intake of meat (compared to pulses) per capita in the years between 2018 and 2020 in countries such as Poland,\" explains Zaleśkiewicz. A comparison of German and Polish consumers (aged 55 years or older) indicated that Polish respondents had significantly lower levels of knowledge regarding innovative food products (including those containing APF), were more hesitant in their decisions, and less frequently decided to purchase such products. A study of young consumers indicated that among people from Germany, \"food innovators\" (i.e., those who buy soon after various innovative foods are out) and \"early followers\" (those who buy after some consideration) constitute 73% of the population. This contrasts with findings observed for young people from Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. In those countries, \"food innovators\" and \"early followers\" constitute only 24–36% of young consumers. While strong reluctance to buy innovative APF was not found among young consumers from Germany, it was present among 13–17% of consumers from Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Analysis shows that consumers are reluctant to buy insect-based APF. Only 18–22% of consumers in the UK and Spain report their willingness to buy such products. Consumers in Sweden and Finland declare more positive beliefs about insect-based food than consumers in Germany and the Czech Republic. Consumers in Italy are much less likely to choose such products than consumers in Northern or Western Europe (e.g., Denmark, Belgium). \"Food culture and eating patterns in Northern Europe might have changed in recent decades, whereas Italian food culture is considered one of the strongest in Europe, with over 200 food products, where meat plays an important role,\" the researcher from SWPS University points out. Specific differences in consumer acceptance of and interest in APF are observed in certain cities. \"The rural-urban differences within the country may be explained not by the size of the city but rather by its multicultural and cosmopolitan character,\" the researcher comments. For example, cities like Paris and Helsinki, which are more ethnically diverse, tend to exhibit higher levels of consumer acceptance of APF compared to consumers from cities with less ethnically diverse consumers. Consumers from such major cities are also more likely to have restaurants offering alternative cuisine or introducing novel food trends, including alternative protein. A good example is Paris, where the average consumption of seaweed-based APF is higher than in five other French cities. This may be explained by a relatively large population of Asian-origin inhabitants who accept seaweed-based food. The authors of the analysis emphasize that their findings may help develop strategies aiming to increase APF choices. Taking into account different approaches and levels of knowledge about APF in individual countries will allow to use different promotion strategies. \"Considering weak or moderate level of consumption and declared intention to buy APF, it is necessary, for example, to develop and implement promotional campaigns that will increase consumer motivation. The motivational factors could include perceived health benefits, environmental benefits, animal welfare-related motives,\" says Zaleśkiewicz.

        "content": "Beekeepers in Homa Bay County are calling on the national and county governments to support their venture as a key driver of the economy in the region. The farmers led by the coordinator of the Homa Bay Beekeepers Association Samuel Oyugi lamented that despite its potential, beekeeping remains largely unsupported. “We started beekeeping because we saw it as a good source of income. However, beekeeping has not been recognized for its potential and benefit to the community,” Oyugi regretted. The association has over 200 members spread across Oyugis, Homa Bay Town, Ndhiwa, and Rusinga islands. “We are urging the government to commit more resources to beekeeping industry which is a cornerstone of economic stimulus programs,” Oyugi said. He said one hive can produce up to 7 kilograms of honey, and the market is readily available. He added they cannot meet the demand. The association highlighted several challenges hindering their growth such as lack of particularly bee suits. Additionally, he said many beekeepers lacked proper training and essential tools like smokers and centrifuge systems for honey extraction. “We want to see a united front among beekeepers. This way, when companies come for honey, they’ll find a large, reliable source,” Oyugi added. The association is seeking government support for training programs and equipment provision. The bee keepers are also advocating for the formation of beekeeping cooperatives to increase production capacity. “We have some Non-Governmental Organisations who support us, we urge the Lake Basin Development Authority to also support us with training and materials,” he added.",

Emery has transformed Villa’s fortunes since taking charge in October 2022 with the club just three points above the relegation zone. Aston Villa are thrilled to announce Manager Unai Emery has agreed a new five-year contract! ✍️ — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) Villa chairman Nassef Sawiris said: “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Emery, 52, arrived at Villa with a strong reputation as a four-time Europa League winner following impressive spells with Sevilla and Villarreal. He had also won Ligue 1 with Paris St Germain and had Premier League experience after a year in charge of Arsenal from 2018-19. After making an immediate impact by steering the club to a seventh-placed finish in 2023, he has now guided Villa back into Europe’s elite competition for the first time since 1983. With a number of high-profile managerial vacancies opening up this summer, the club have acted decisively to secure his services for the long term. Emery told the club’s website, www.avfc.co.uk: “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club. “Since I came to Villa with (co-owner) Wes (Edens) and Nassef we found always the best environment and structure to develop a project with the highest ambition. “There’s a great chemistry in Aston Villa and the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams.”",

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico’s southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With throughout almost all the country so far this year, , and . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country. The Associated Press",

        "content": "Sunrisers Hyderabad CEO Kavya Maran motivated the heart-broken SRH players after they fell short by a distance in the final of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 against Kolkata Knight Riders. On a Sunday evening with clouds hovering over the Chepauk, and fans present in large numbers to support their franchises, KKR emerged triumphant with an emphatic eight-wicket win over Sunrisers. KKR co-owner and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan took a victory lap to thank the fans and celebrated with the players by embracing them and lifting the trophy with the entire team. There was a sense of disbelief in the SRH camp after they fell short in a star-studded clash. Kavya was spotted crying after SRH’s loss against the Riders. Kavya addressed the team in the dressing room and stated that the players redefined the way T20 cricket is played. “You all have made us so proud. I had to come here and tell you that. I mean you have redefined the way we play T20 cricket and everyone is talking about us. The off-day had to happen today, but a great job, all of you with the bat and ball. Thank you so much,” Kavya said in a video posted by SRH on X. “You’ve made us proud.” 🧡 – Kaviya Maran pic.twitter.com/zMZraivXEE — SunRisers Hyderabad (@SunRisers) May 27, 2024 “And I think even though we finished last place last year, I think all the fans came out in huge numbers because of the potential you guys had. Everyone’s talking about us and even though KKR won, I am sure everyone’s still going to be talking about the style of cricket we have played. Thank you guys, take care and don’t look like this. We played the final, it wasn’t just any other game. I mean all the other teams have been watching us tonight. Thank you guys, I will see you soon,” Kavya concluded. Even though SRH’s final match concluded as a one-sided affair, they broke numerous records throughout the season. They broke the record for the highest score in the history of the competition twice. While facing Royal Challengers Bengaluru the Sunrisers set a total of 287/3 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. They initially broke the record against Mumbai Indians at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad with a score of 277/3. During the record-setting total against RCB, Abhishek Sharma set the tone with his 34- run knock. But it was Travis Head who took the fight against the bowlers and struck 102 off a mere 41 deliveries. Heinrich Klaasen provide the finishing touches with his 67-run knock. Overall, Abhishek amassed 484 runs at an average of 32.27 in 16 matches while, Travis racked up 567 runs in 15 matches at an average of 40.50 at a whopping strike rate of 191.55. (ANI)",

He told the RTÉ Guide: \"She [his mother] had been unwell, so I was in her room, just lying with her and she passed.\" He added: \"It was a shock for all the family. Dealing with grief at such a young age really shaped Alan as a person. \"It made me very determined\" he said. \"And I've always been a glass-half-full person.\" Alan's dear sister Doreen passed away the year after he married his husband, Karl Broderick. He said: \"When Doreen first met Karl, she said 'I really like you but if you do anything on him, I'll come and haunt you!' \"Now, when something good happens for myself and Karl I say, 'Ah they are all looking down on us - Doreen and David (his brother, who died from lung cancer in 2017), Mam and Dad and my dear friend Noel O'Brien. I do believe that there is a God and hope there is a life after this one where I'll meet all those family and friends I've loved. \"Maybe I have that hope because I'm terrified of dying.\" Alan and Karl celebrated their 30th anniversary back in September. That date also marked their wedding anniversary. The Ireland AM star said: \"We have everything big since on that date. We got married on September 30,2011, in the Round Room in the Mansion House in Dublin and last year we had a party to mark our 30th anniversary together?\" The party was also around a special birthday for Alan.",

A man died of his injuries when a wall collapsed due to relentless downpour Sunday evening at Bibir Bagan in Central Kolkata, a state disaster management official said. Also Read Goldman Sachs ups India’s GDP growth forecast 2 hours ago Prajwal Revanna says he will appear before SIT May 31 2 hours ago An elderly woman from Mousuni Island near Namkhana, situated adjacent to the Sundarbans delta, succumbed to her injuries Monday morning after a tree fell on her hut, leading to the collapse of the roof. Two more women, one a resident of Maheshtala in South 24 Parganas and another from Panihati in North 24 Parganas, also lost their lives as a result of the natural calamity. In Purba Bardhaman district’s Memari, a father and son died from electrocution, officials said. Several people were injured in various parts of the state after being hit by debris. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, while addressing an election rally in North Kolkata, claimed three people had died. “The administration is already providing assistance and relief to those whose mud houses and crops have been damaged. I promise that I will provide the necessary assistance” Banerjee said at the meeting. The state government evacuated over two lakh people to relief camps and cyclone shelters. After tearing through the coasts of Bangladesh and West Bengal, Cyclone Remal left a trail of destruction, with pictures of devastation emerging across the state’s coastal areas, showing extensive damage to infrastructure and property soon after daybreak Monday. The state government has initiated relief operations, providing food, drinking water, and medical assistance to the affected people. According to a communication by the state government, more than 1,700 electric poles were damaged and many trees were uprooted by the cyclone. More than 2,500 houses have been completely damaged, whereas 27,000 houses have been partially damaged. “More than 1,400 relief camps are presently operational in the affected districts,” the government said. While several pockets of Kolkata remained waterlogged, suburban train services from Sealdah resumed late in the afternoon. Flight services at Kolkata airport resumed Monday morning after being suspended for 21 hours due to Cyclone Remal. Airport sources, however, said it would take some more time for the situation to return to normal. The cyclone ravaged adjacent coasts of the state and Bangladesh between Sagar Island and Khepupara, near the southwest of Mongla in the neighbouring country, after its landfall process began at 8:30 pm Sunday and lasted for a good four hours. In an update Monday morning, the Met office said ‘Remal’ weakened into a cyclonic storm, about 70 km northeast of Canning and 30 km west-southwest of Mongla. Efforts to restore normalcy are underway, with emergency services working to clear debris and restore power in the affected areas. However, relentless heavy rain is hampering these operations in most of the affected areas, officials said. While the metropolis received around 190 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours, Haldia and other places in the state received around 110 mm to 60 mm. Major arterial roads like Central Avenue and College Street in central Kolkata and pockets of Ballygunge, Dhakuria and Behala in the south continued to remain waterlogged during the later part of the day as well. Reports indicated that approximately 68 trees were uprooted in Kolkata, with an additional 75 trees downed in Salt Lake and Rajarhat. The North and South 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur districts reported widespread damage. News footage from the coastal resort town of Digha showed tidal waves crashing into a seawall, with surging waters sweeping fishing boats inland and inundating mud-and-thatch houses and farmlands. Weathermen have forecast more rain in Kolkata and the southern districts, including Nadia and Murshidabad, with one or two spells of intense downpours, along with gusty surface winds till Tuesday morning. State Power Minister Aroop Biswas said the disruptions and damage to the power supply infrastructure caused by Cyclone Remal will be addressed soon. He noted that there had been one or two incidents of power outages in the CESC area due to fallen trees. A total of 14 National Disaster Response Force teams were deployed for relief and restoration work across districts in south Bengal, including Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, and Hooghly. Relief materials, including dry food and tarpaulins, have been dispatched to the coastal areas, and quick response teams comprising trained civil defence volunteers with equipped vehicles are in place, officials said. Political parties didn’t miss the opportunity in poll-bound Bengal, with leaders of both the BJP and the TMC hitting the roads to help affected people and assist in restoring normalcy. “Coastal West Bengal is reeling under the impact of cyclone #Remal . The only ones out there assisting people in need are NDRF and BJP leaders. Our Dum Dum candidate Silbhadra Dutta and Basirhat co-incharge Dr Archana Majumdar, among others, are standing with people, in need. Mamata Banerjee hasn’t stepped out, at all. Maybe she is scared that her ‘Hawai’ chappal will get wet,” BJP leader Amit Malviya posted on X. TMC refuted Kunal Ghosh refuted the allegations and said, “it is the TMC and the state government which has been working relentlessly to provide relief to the affected masses.” PTI Tags: cyclone Cyclone Remal West Bengal Share Tweet Send Share Suggest A Correction Enter your email to get our daily news in your inbox.

        "content": "I’ve been using the new M4 iPad Pro for the last week exclusively, resisting any urge to use my MacBook Pro as a crutch. Needless to say, it’s been an enlightening, interesting, and dare I say, a experience on a lot of fronts. My biggest takeaway? The iPad has flaws, but iPadOS does not need to be macOS to make it a good computer. There is a large contingent of iPad users who are using computers today because of iPadOS and how accessible it is to them. The iPad has arguably made computers more accessible to users who were once downright afraid of computers. For that reason alone, we should . Before the latest batch of iPad Pro reviews came out, I predicted what the running story would be, and I’m not even very good at making predictions. We’ve seen the same story time and time again over the years. Yes, the hardware is great...but the software falls short. Oh, and by the way, I’m guilty of it as well. Open > iPad Pro (2018) review.docx ... Copy > Paste > iPad Pro (2018) review copy.docx .... Rename > iPad Pro (2024) review.docx For years, the iPad Pro has sported hardware under the hood that’s more than capable for getting things done. For some users, it has been iPadOS’ shortcomings and idiosyncrasies that have make it challenging to get the most out of its power. However, that does not mean that the iPad needs to run macOS to reach its full potential. It just needs to be the very best version of . What does the best version of iPadOS look like? I don’t think it looks like Apple copied and pasted macOS onto the iPad. I think it still looks very much like iPadOS appears today, just with the type of refinements and creature comforts that more advanced users expect. It also needs app developers to treat the platform like a first-class citizen. There are many areas where I think iPadOS can improve, but there are three main areas that I think are among the most important. 1. iPadOS apps and the need for a common thread iPadOS apps almost feel like their own little mini operating systems running on the iPad. That’s because every app has its own unique method for interacting with it, accessing needed tools, etc. It’s missing the common thread that binds all apps together to make it a cohesive experience. On the Mac, that common thread is the menu bar. It’s the place where, no matter the app, you can go there to do the thing...whatever that thing happens to be. One could argue that the current methodology for viewing keyboard shortcuts – holding the Command (⌘) key – is basically iPadOS’ version of the menu bar. The problem with the keyboard shortcuts menu is that it relies on a connected keyboard, is slow to invoke, and it takes up too much space, I think a more thought out redesign that serves both touch and keyboard users is needed. 2. Keyboard Shortcuts, but taken seriously This is both an iPadOS problem, and an individual app problem. As fun and handy as touch interfaces can be, they aren’t always appropriate for certain tasks. Power users rely on keyboard shortcuts to get things done more efficiently. Of course, iPadOS keyboard shortcuts, but they need to be taken more seriously by app developers, including Apple. If it exists as a function, it should, in most cases, have a corresponding keyboard shortcut. I encountered one of the most egregious examples of this problem while editing the entire video embedded above on my iPad using Final Cut Pro. Apple’s pro NLE is an amazing experience in a lot of ways, especially for its touch-first interface. I think this app has a of potential, and I’m excited for , which should ship within the next month. That being said, there are missing features that video editors need that just aren’t there yet, and that’s understandable given the app’s short time in existence. What isn’t as understandable is the lack of keyboard shortcuts for certain commands that currently exist, such as copying and pasting effects between clips. Because there were no keyboard shortcuts for these commands, I had to undergo the time-consuming process of manually copying and pasting effects between the one hundred or so clips in my timeline so that they would all match. Apple should also implement a way to allow users create their own keyboard shortcuts. Such a feature already somewhat exists as an accessibility setting in Settings > Accessibility > Keyboards > Full Keyboard Access, but it’s only for customizing the keyboard shortcuts used to navigate iPadOS, not for individual apps. 3. File management for tots The Files app is a huge improvement over its first iteration back when it was called iCloud Drive. I appreciate how we now have more detailed file information, how we can compress and decompress files, etc., but there needs to be more flexibility for users to manage files. One of the many frustrating things I encountered was the inability to preview a video shot with my Sony FX30 via Quick Look. Opening the file with Quick Look produced a blank screen prompting me to open the file in another app. There are many little issues like this that, by themselves, aren’t a big deal. But when you start adding up all of the smaller shortcomings of file management in iPadOS, it stands out. iPadOS doesn’t need to be “fixed” I’ve compared the difference between using macOS and iPadOS to get the same task done like the difference between running on land, and running while submerged in water. Eventually, you’ll both make it to the destination, but who will finish first? Better yet, who will feel better the run? Apple has drained a lot of the water that has bogged down the iPad experience, but more needs to be done. iPadOS is a highly capable platform, with its own unique paradigms. Some of its shortcomings might be viewed as strengths depending on how the light is hitting the prism so to speak. Shortcomings can also spur innovation when engineers are forced to approach a problem in a different way. iPadOS doesn’t need to be fixed, because that implies that iPadOS is broken. iPadOS needs to be improved and optimized. Improving the platform isn’t just about copying and pasting macOS onto the iPad. Improving iPadOS involves Apple paying close attention to the most basic user experience and interface shortcomings, while also continuing to build it out with new and unique features year after year. Apple hasn’t been perfect on this thus far, but we must recognize how far the iPad has come in a relatively short time. 9to5Mac’s Take Although Apple probably should have read the room before it published the where it crushed all of the beloved physical relics of creativity into a thin and light iPad Pro, I got where it was going with it. This machine can wear an infinite amount of hats, and it’s arguably the most versatile piece of consumer electronics that’s ever been created. The software that powers it, iPadOS, is fine. Swaths of users will second that thought. We just have to be patient, let iPadOS be iPadOS, and allow the platform to keep maturing.",

        "content": "The agreement with Ukraine signed in Madrid includes multimillion-euro contracts for the Spanish defence industry Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy secured a pledge of additional air defence missiles and military support from Spain on Monday. The support is a much-needed boost for Ukraine, which Ukraine's number one says will help fight some 3000 bombs that Russia launches every month at his country. Zelenskyy and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez signed a bilateral security agreement that allocates €1 billion of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and €5 billion by 2027. More Leopard tanks and artillery ammunition are also featured in the package. “After more than two years (of war), Russia’s aggression continues, and that’s why it is more necessary than ever to redouble our support,” Sánchez told the joint news conference. Zelenskyy had been due to visit Spain earlier this month, but he postponed all foreign trips after Moscow launched a cross-border offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region that left Ukrainian troops reeling. That push has further strained Ukraine’s already depleted army, which in recent months has been fighting Russia’s intense drive deeper into the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy told reporters Ukraine still urgently needs another seven US-made Patriot air defence systems to stop Russia hitting its power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets. “If we had these modern Patriot systems, (Russian) aeroplanes wouldn’t be able to fly close enough to drop the (glide) bombs on the civilian population and the military,” Zelenskyy said at the news conference in Spain's capital. Glide bombs are heavy Soviet-era bombs fitted with precision guidance systems and launched from aircraft flying out of range of air defences. The bombs weigh more than a ton and blast targets to smithereens, leaving a huge crater. A glide bomb attack on a Kharkiv shopping mall on Saturday killed 18, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said Monday. Five people are still missing. The Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system that was first deployed in the 1980s. it can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles. The system is expensive but highly effective and sought after by armies around the world. European countries have hesitated to send Patriot systems to Ukraine, fearing they themselves may need them in the future.",

        "description": "The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering.",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a ''synergy'' of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can't yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they're know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico's southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up, and water supplies are running out. Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "description": "the reigning World Series champions — onto the back burner in the Metroplex.",
        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks are one win away from the NBA Finals, and the Stars are still in the mix for the Stanley Cup. It's enough to push the Texas Rangers — the reigning World Series champions — onto the back burner in the Metroplex. Not that the Rangers have done much to compete for attention lately. In the middle of all that basketball and hockey hoopla, Texas hosts the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of the World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven't pitched at all this year, and Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas' starters have an ERA of 3.65, which is in the top half of baseball. The bullpen, however, has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09, with eight blown saves in 17 chances. Offensively, the Rangers were expected to receive a boost from top prospects Evan Carter and Wyatt Langford, but Carter is batting .188. Langford is at .224, and he's currently on the IL. The good news for Texas is that only Seattle (28-26) is above .500 in the AL West at the moment, and the Mariners lead the Rangers by just three games. The whole division is in negative territory in terms of run differential. Texas manager Bruce Bochy has shown time and time again that all you need to do is make the playoffs to have a shot at winning it all, and the Rangers have plenty of time left to turn their season around — and try to add to this impressive run for Dallas-area sports. TAKING STOCK Last year, 10 of the 12 teams that were in playoff position as of Memorial Day went on to make the postseason. The year before, it was eight out of 12. A fast start that's lasted this long is generally enough to put a team in very good shape. The postseason odds at FanGraphs already have the Dodgers (98.7%), Phillies (98.6%), Yankees (98.1%) and Braves (95.7%) as near-locks to make the playoffs. The Orioles (88.8%) aren't far behind. Of the teams not currently in playoff position, FanGraphs gives the Astros (53.1%) the best shot to get in. TRIVIA TIME The last two times both defending league champions finished under .500 were in shortened seasons: It happened to the Astros (29-31) and Nationals (26-34) in 2020 and the Blue Jays (55-60) and Phillies (54-61) in 1994. When is the last time it happened in a full season? LINE OF THE WEEK Baltimore's Kyle Bradish struck out 11 in seven no-hit innings as the Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox 4-1 on Sunday. Bradish left after 103 pitches and Danny Coulombe immediately allowed a home run to Danny Mendick, but that was the only hit of the game for Chicago. COMEBACK OF THE WEEK Pittsburgh trailed by four runs in the bottom of the ninth against San Francisco on Tuesday night before rallying to tie it. Nick Gonzales then hit an RBI single in the 10th to give the Pirates a 7-6 win. The Giants had a win probability of 99.4% in the ninth, according to Baseball Savant. That was the start of a wild week for San Francisco. The Giants overcame deficits of 5-0 and 6-2 to beat the Pirates in their next two games. Then they beat the Mets after being down 6-2 on Friday night and 2-1 in the ninth inning Saturday. New York finally returned the favor Sunday, scoring three runs in the ninth to beat San Francisco 4-3. TRIVIA ANSWER The Royals beat the Cardinals in the 1985 World Series. In 1986, Kansas City went 76-86 and St. Louis was 79-82. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the Texas Rangers are in the AL West, not AL East. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

AKRO between September 13, 2022 and October 9, 2023, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important June 25, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline . SO WHAT: If you purchased Akero common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Akero class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24557 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 25, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Loading... Loading... DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) approximately 20% of the patients enrolled in the SYMMETRY study, a trial that purportedly tested its lead product candidate, efruxifermin (\"EFX\") in patients with Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") induced cirrhosis, had cryptogenic cirrhosis and did not have definitive NASH at baseline; (2) the cryptogenic cirrhotic patients included in the SYMMETRY study did not have biopsy-proven compensated cirrhosis due to definitive NASH; (3) the results from the cryptogenic cirrhosis patients were to be excluded from the calculation of the NASH resolution secondary endpoints; (4) Akero had introduced a confounding factor into the SYMMETRY study's design, materially influencing the study's potential results and increasing the risks that the study would fail to meet its primary endpoint; (5) the SYMMETRY study did not align with U.S. Food & Drug Administration guidance for testing a drug in treating NASH cirrhotics because Akero had not ruled out potential causes of each patient's cirrhosis other than NASH; and (6) consequently, Akero had materially misrepresented the nature of the SYMMETRY trial, its usefulness in supporting any new drug application, the likelihood that the SYMMETRY trial would be successful as measured by its primary endpoint, and the likelihood EFX would become a commercial treatment for NASH cirrhotics. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Akero class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24557 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

        "content": "The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are closing, and the results will be on June 4. The aftermath of the election is not simply about winners and losers. It is about more than just the anticipated outcomes. It includes the potential for unforeseen alliances, dramatic shifts in power dynamics, and the emergence of new political forces, all of which are yet to be unveiled. The BJP’s potential win in the election is a significant event that could reshape the political landscape. However, the outcome is uncertain, with two possible scenarios, each with implications. One scenario predicts a massive victory for the BJP, possibly even exceeding 400 seats. The other scenario suggests a more modest result for the BJP with fewer seats. A landslide victory for the BJP could have far-reaching consequences. In a worst-case scenario, if the BJP wins fewer seats, the party could still secure support from other parties. If the party emerges as the single largest, albeit with fewer seats than in the 2019 poll, it has a plan B to form the government with the help of some neutral parties. The strategic decisions made by the Congress party, such as reducing the number of contested constituencies, highlight the depth and complexity of Indian politics. Each move is a calculated step towards a larger goal. As the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded on Saturday, the Congress claimed the BJP’s fate is “all but sealed,” with the INDIA bloc having already crossed the halfway mark of 272 seats and is on course for a total of over 350 seats. The INDIA Alliance, a significant player in Indian politics, was formed by 26 Opposition parties last year to fight Modi unitedly. However, if the BJP returns to power, the alliance may face a significant challenge. Some partners, such as the Trinamool Congress and the AAP, have decided to refrain from forming partnerships for the Lok Sabha polls, weakening the Congress’s position. A BJP victory could lead to reevaluating the INDIA Alliance’s strategy, with some partners choosing to align with the BJP and others seeking new partnerships or independent paths. If the BJP wins more seats, smaller parties may rush to join the alliance. This rush may be fueled by their desire to align with the winning side, which could impact the post-election scenario. However, this rush to join the coalition may be more than just motivated by political interests. Some parties want to oppose Modi, while others see alliances as a failed attempt. Others, like the Trinamool Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab, have chosen to refrain from engaging in partnerships. They, along with the Congress and the Left Parties, would challenge the NDA. This could result in the collapse of the newly formed India coalition, as this alliance has many fair-weather friends who may ally with any party based solely on their self-interest. The BJP’s ability to secure more seats or gain support from other parties will not be a surprise. This could impact the political landscape, potentially leading to a realignment of political forces, including the INDIA Alliance. The BJP has lost some crucial allies, such as SAD, Shiv Sena, and JD (U). However, JD (U) and the TDP have now rejoined. In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK, a former NDA ally, may also rejoin the NDA depending on its performance in the polls. Even the ruling DMK is considering its options after the election. The party understands the importance of maintaining a solid working relationship with the NDA and PM Modi. These potential alliances and shifts in power dynamics could significantly impact the political landscape after the elections. The BJP could seek support from parties led by influential leaders such as Naveen Patnaik, Jagan Mohan Reddy, K Chandrasekhar Rao, Mayawati, and others. Though not aligned with any coalition, these leaders have significant political influence and have helped the BJP in the past when the ruling party needed them. Their potential role in the post-election scenario could significantly shape the political landscape. The Uddhav Thackeray faction of the Shiv Sena and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP were previously with the BJP, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they helped the NDA. Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal is ambitious and eyeing the premiership. He will remain in opposition. Kejriwal predicted that if Modi wins again on June 4, he will put Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar, Rahul Gandhi, and Mallikarjun Kharge in jail. He would also be sent back to jail. However, it’s important to note that these are potential scenarios and not confirmed outcomes. Various factors, including the election outcome, can influence it. The June 4 election results will show how politics will shape the INDIA alliance, splintering or strengthening it. They will also indicate whether the BJP will become more arrogant with a hat trick under its belt. A third consecutive BJP win could embolden the party, leading to a more assertive political landscape.",

(AP Photo/Luis Sanchez) MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico’s southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "It's over for another year and the winners have been announced. But what were the key talking points and takeaways of 2024's Cannes Film Festival? We've narrowed them down to 10. You're welcome. The 77th is over, and they’ve rolled up the red carpet. Time to look back at the 10 main talking points from this year’s edition, after a broadly satisfying set of results. The build-up to Cannes this year was all about the from festival workers, and the rumoured set to rock the French industry. This was going to be one of the most politically charged editions yet, which was saying something, as Cannes is no stranger to agitation. However, the end result was muted. There was little disruption from festival workers, whose work is invaluable for these festivals to function, and the #MeToo accusations dissolved. But as Coralie Fargeat stated in her acceptance speech for Best Screenplay for , the revolution is an ongoing thing, and it’s a brick-by-brick affair, as opposed to a standalone moment of reckoning. As for any statements with regards to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, there were some subtle callbacks (Cate Blanchett wore a black dress with white and green lining, which with the red carpet, resembled the Palestinian flag), a handful of overt calls (Laura Blajman-Kadar, a survivor of the Oct. 7 attacks, wore a yellow dress bearing images of Israeli hostages still being held and a sash reading “Bring them home”) and mentions during speeches, but real life atrocities were largely kept out of the Cannes bubble this year. It seems thierry Frémaux got this year. The festival came to a when Greta Gerwig and her jury announced that Sean Baker’s had won the Palme d’Or. It is a worthy winner: fast-paced, funny, moving – the lot. Baker became the first American director to win the festival’s top prize since Terrence Malick ( ) in 2011. He dedicated the award to sex workers everywhere, a fitting tribute from a director who has put their lives at the centre of so many of his films ( ). He also had some choice words for the “tech companies” behind the “streaming revolution”, declaring: “The future of cinema is where it started: in a movie theatre.” Bravo. As euphoric as the film and its win were, there are some who felt that dissident and exiled Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof should have taken home the Palme for his film – a film shot entirely in secret and which would have been the more political choice. A missed opportunity? Perhaps, as this fable focusing on misogyny and paranoia deserved more than a special award. The Grand Prix could have been fitting. Still, it was a double-edged sword, as a win could have led some less charitable or reactionary commentators to suggest that it was all telegraphed with a purely political statement in mind. Still, Rasoulof’s presence at the festival was one of Cannes’ most emotional and , a meaningful act of bravery in the name of justice, rebellion, and art. What seemed like a mess on paper was a triumph in execution. Jacques Audiard’s , a Mexico-set gangster trans musical featuring gender transitioning, cartels, gorgeous choreographies and songs about vaginoplasty was an explosion of joy, as well as a unanimous hit. Zoe Saldaña, Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz took home the Best Actress award as an ensemble cast, with Gascón becoming the first trans performer to take the prize in Cannes. The decision was made because the film celebrated sisterhood, according to the jury. Some were disappointed that the award wasn’t given to Gascón on her own, but the collective recognition of all female performers here was merited, and even sent a message about cis / trans solidarity. Then, the film nabbed a second award: the Jury Prize. It’s a rare occurrence in Cannes, as once a film secures one of the main prizes, it takes itself out of the running for a second. So, congrats to Audiard, who had previously won the Palme d’Or in 2015 for . However, was that Jury Prize really necessary? We were hoping that would win it, or that the likes of Andrea Arnold’s and Magnus von Horn’s could have a look-in, as both these standouts went home empty-handed. Ali Abbasi’s was a hyped title this year, a film chronicling the rise of Donald Trump as a New York real estate baron. The performances were great, and never fell into SNL caricature; the story was compelling; and the soundtrack featured some period-appropriate tunes. However, several scenes caused a stir – especially for the tangerine menace, who has . The moments in question see Trump raping his first wife, Ivana; the scene in which he gets liposuction and a scalp reduction proceedure for his fading hairline; and even a moment of erectile disfunction. During their real-life divorce proceedings, Ivana accused Trump of raping her, although she later retracted the allegation prior to her ex-husband's run for president. Speaking to Vanity Fair before the premiere, Abbasi had said the aim was \"to do a punk rock version of a historical movie... [not] get too anal about details and what's right and what's wrong\". Trump's campaign communications director Steven Cheung said legal action would be taken \"to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers\". While in no way a hit job against Trump, the film is clearly too much for the MAGA crowd (even before they've seen it) and the famously thin-skinned Trump. Especially on an election year. Or any year, come to think of it. From to , via , , and , there was a lot of nudity on screen this year, making this edition one of the most sexually charged in recent memory. However, while there is a common kneejerk reaction to morally inspect films – especially when it comes to assessing nudity, the “male gaze” and with the ongoing conversation regarding the (vital) work of intimacy coordinators on set, these depictions of nudity and sex never felt gratuitous. They fully served the narratives and themes regarding aging, sex work, influencer culture, cautionary fetishization, beauty worship and love. So, are audiences and critics getting more prudish? A common theme this year is that no matter the highlight or lowlight, the films could have all done with a bit of a trim. 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there... Even the shorter ones needed an edit. Whether you loved or not, it’s baggy. was hilarious but would have functioned better as an 80-minute satire. And even the excellent felt like it could have been tighter with 10 minutes off. Less is definitely more. There were a lot of old masters this year in Competition and Out of Competition, and aside from a few exceptions, their output was disappointing. No one is saying there should be an age limit, or failing to understand that their presence in Cannes is important for the festival’s profile. However, some inclusions should not have made it into Competition, slots which could have gone to less obvious choices or to more female voices, as 4 out of 22 titles this year feels like another letdown. Whether it’s Francis Ford Coppola’s hubristic folly ; Kevin Costner’s patience-testing ; David Cronenberg’s continued downfall trajectory with ; Paul Schrader’s (a significant step down from his trilogy of dramas about male redemption – and ); or even Jia Zhangke’s (a fascinating film which nonetheless feels like it requires homework if you’re not familiar with the Chinese director’s oeuvre), this year showed that just because you’re a festival mainstay and have directed classics, it does not mean that your newest project is automatically deserving of praise or a pass because of past triumphs. Maybe the Cannes Film Festival can set up a special sidebar? Then everyone’s happy. Yórgos Lánthimos was back in festivals, just one year after his Venice Golden Lion and Oscar-winning . And his newest, , won yet another prize (Best Actor for Jesse Plemons), meaning that film festivals just can’t resist the charms of the Master of the Greek Weird Wave. Every film he has submitted to either Cannes or Venice has won a prize: (Un Certain Regard Palme – 2009); (Best Screenplay in Venice - 2011); (Cannes Jury Prize – 2015); (Cannes Best Screenplay – 2017); (Grand Jury Prize in Venice - 2018); (Gold Lion in Venice - 2023). All that’s missing is Best Actress and Best Director. And we wouldn’t put it past him to nab those two in the next decade. Μπράβο, Yórgos. And you, dear reader - get betting for the next time he's selected. The New York-based indie movie outfit has been dubbed \"the Palme d'Or whisperer\", and for good reason. It’s current track record is making the world's most powerful movie producers turn green with envy. Is anyone checking whether A24 is alright? (2019), (2021), (2022) and (2023) - the last four winners in Cannes, since the 2020 edition was cancelled because of COVID - were all released in US theatres by NEON, under deals struck before they won the prize. And they’ve done it again with , as they bought North American rights to Sean Baker’s film weeks before Cannes kicked off, in a move that cements the company’s soothsaying reputation. NEON also snapped up , which won a Special Jury Prize, as well as Julia Ducournau’s “genre-defying” follow-up , which should come out next year – and maybe feature in Cannes’ 78th edition. Last year’s edition of Cannes was and the international press found it very hard booking tickets. Cannes head honcho Thierry Frémaux even had to apologise. And it seems the bellyaching did not fall on deaf ears, as this year’s online booking system worked like a dream. As long as you were online at 7am, you had every chance of securing your spot in the screenings you wanted. Chapeau, Cannes. The songs featured in the Competition films were rather good. So much so, we did an piece to honour the art of the needle drop. Check it out . Shout-out to Miguel Gomes’ wonderful and poetic inclusion of Bobby Darin’s ‘Beyond The Sea’ at the end of , which failed to make the final cut because we forgot all about it! 37 films watched in 11 days – some details are bound to fall by the wayside. A female security guard was at the heart of a scandal this year, with a viral video showing ex-Destiny's Child Kelly Rowland posing for pictures on the red carpet before an apparent row broke out. Rowland said she was treated differently to other women on the red carpet. Worse, the security guard in question has prior form in Cannes, leading many to call for her dismissal. A late-festival bit of gossip, granted, but it did briefly dominate the conversation. That being said, many thanks to all the security and staff at the Croisette - whether in Debussy, Varda, the Grand Théâtre Lumière, or the Palais, their professionalism and kind words were always appreciated, and one bad appple shouldn't spoil the bunch. There we have it. Our full coverage of Cannes 2024 – news, reviews, interviews, and videos – . See you next year. Video editor",

        "content": "Tyrese Gibson, Cody Walker, Paul Walker. Getty Images (3) More than a decade after Paul Walker ‘s 2013 death, his brother Cody Walker and Fast & Furious costar Tyrese Gibson are still committed to honoring him at FuelFest. “I miss him. It’s really hard to not think about Paul,” Gibson, 45, told Us Weekly in an exclusive interview alongside Cody while promoting the car show. FuelFest, presented by Jada Toys, takes place June 1 in Irwindale, California and helps raise money for Reach Out WorldWide (ROWW), the nonprofit charity founded by Paul. “Tyrese and I, and through FuelFest and through everything we’ve done here, we’ve been able to raise about a half a million dollars to date, so we’re very, very proud of that,” Cody told Us of their FuelFest fundraising efforts. “Obviously, that’s a piece of Paul that he left behind that we see as part of his legacy, so it’s an honor to be able to have so much fun and doing something that he would himself enjoy and something that helps to keep that dream alive.” Gibson explained that ROWW sends help to areas affected by earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters. “Whatever the natural disaster is, they go there and they help out,” the Fast & Furious star explained. “So this is what Paul was doing on his private time when he wasn’t on a movie set. And it has been an honor to keep that specific passion of Paul’s alive on behalf of our brothers. We are doing events, but we do things with a heart and we do things just really thinking about the impact and the inspiration that we’re creating.” The duo described FuelFest as more than just a car show and more like Comic Con for automobile enthusiasts. “It’s a celebration of car culture,” Cody told Us, noting that it’s a family-friendly event. “We’ve got Xzibit , who’s going to be performing for us live on the stage. We’re going to have different DJ sets throughout the day. Huge car show, drifting all day long — and that involves also ride-alongs. People can actually sign up to go for a ride-along with a drift driver, which is just an incredible experience. And we’re also raising money for charity.” Both men are California natives, and there are plenty of reunions with friends and family every time FuelFest hits Los Angeles. (The 2024 event marks their sixth time coming back to the City of Angels.) “As someone born and raised on the West Coast from the ghetto from South Central LA, the fact that we got Xzibit performing? Oh, I can’t take it,” Gibson gushed. “It is very expected of me to not have a voice left when I leave this event.” FuelFest Gibson even revealed to Cody that he has lifelong friends coming to the event. “Cody, you don’t know this, but I’ve been DMing back and forth with Xzibit for the last couple of weeks, beyond excited,” Gibson shared. “This is a full circle moment for me that is so crazy. ... One of my childhood friends since I was eight years old, his name is Elijah Johnson, AKA EJ the DJ . When I first started realizing that singing is something that I want to do, EJ, at the same exact moment, decided he wants to be a DJ.” Related: Inside the ‘Fast and Furious’ Cast’s Relationship With Meadow Walker They don’t have friends, they have family. Since Paul Walker‘s 2013 death, his former Fast and Furious castmates have worked together to make sure his daughter, Meadow Walker, always has support. The California native welcomed Meadow in November 1998 with his ex-girlfriend Rebecca Soteros. Meadow was just a toddler when The Fast and the Furious [...] He explained that his pal has been working with Xzibit for several years and will hit the stage with the rapper at FuelFest. “This is a homecoming for us and it’s about to be special,” Gibson said. The California FuelFest event coincides with the release of Gibson’s album, Beautiful Pain, on May 31 via his website. “I just released a new single entitled ‘I Would Still Say I Do’ — even though I’ve been through a divorce,” he explained. “If the opportunity presented itself for me to do it again, I would still say I do, because I believe in love. Maybe I’m a sucker for love.” Thank You! You have successfully subscribed. Finding the light in the darkness is a concept Gibson knows well. Whether dealing with the death of loved ones or the end of a marriage (he and Samantha Lee divorced in 2020 after three years of marriage), he shared that he always tries to take away something meaningful from negative experiences. FuelFest “The title, Beautiful Pain — we’re all going to go through something, but I think the gift and the hope that we should all have is what beauty can I discover in my pain? Where did I grow? Where did I evolve? What did I mature? What did I learn?” Gibson told Us. “I don’t think anybody gets married anticipating that it’s going to end, but if you ever get a chance to do it again, are you a better husband to be or are you just going to let history repeat itself? So yeah, all of the happy songs on the album is about the beauty I’ve discovered in my pain, and all of the topics on the album about the divorce is unpacking it.” FuelFest tickets are available now. Kids under 12 attend free. Publisher",

        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks are one win away from the NBA Finals, and the Stars are still in the mix for the Stanley Cup. It's enough to push the Texas Rangers — the reigning World Series champions — onto the back burner in the Metroplex. Not that the Rangers have done much to compete for attention lately. In the middle of all that basketball and hockey hoopla, Texas hosts the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of the World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven't pitched at all this year, and Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas' starters have an ERA of 3.65, which is in the top half of baseball. The bullpen, however, has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09, with eight blown saves in 17 chances. Offensively, the Rangers were expected to receive a boost from top prospects Evan Carter and Wyatt Langford, but Carter is batting .188. Langford is at .224, and he's currently on the IL. The good news for Texas is that only Seattle (28-26) is above .500 in the AL West at the moment, and the Mariners lead the Rangers by just three games. The whole division is in negative territory in terms of run differential. Texas manager Bruce Bochy has shown time and time again that all you need to do is make the playoffs to have a shot at winning it all, and the Rangers have plenty of time left to turn their season around — and try to add to this impressive run for Dallas-area sports. Last year, 10 of the 12 teams that were in playoff position as of Memorial Day went on to make the postseason. The year before, it was eight out of 12. A fast start that's lasted this long is generally enough to put a team in very good shape. The postseason odds at FanGraphs already have the Dodgers (98.7%), Phillies (98.6%), Yankees (98.1%) and Braves (95.7%) as near-locks to make the playoffs. The Orioles (88.8%) aren't far behind. Of the teams not currently in playoff position, FanGraphs gives the Astros (53.1%) the best shot to get in. The last two times both defending league champions finished under .500 were in shortened seasons: It happened to the Astros (29-31) and Nationals (26-34) in 2020 and the Blue Jays (55-60) and Phillies (54-61) in 1994. When is the last time it happened in a full season? Baltimore's Kyle Bradish struck out 11 in seven no-hit innings as the Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox 4-1 on Sunday. Bradish left after 103 pitches and Danny Coulombe immediately allowed a home run to Danny Mendick, but that was the only hit of the game for Chicago. Pittsburgh trailed by four runs in the bottom of the ninth against San Francisco on Tuesday night before rallying to tie it. Nick Gonzales then hit an RBI single in the 10th to give the Pirates a 7-6 win. The Giants had a win probability of 99.4% in the ninth, according to Baseball Savant. That was the start of a wild week for San Francisco. The Giants overcame deficits of 5-0 and 6-2 to beat the Pirates in their next two games. Then they beat the Mets after being down 6-2 on Friday night and 2-1 in the ninth inning Saturday. New York finally returned the favor Sunday, scoring three runs in the ninth to beat San Francisco 4-3. The Royals beat the Cardinals in the 1985 World Series. In 1986, Kansas City went 76-86 and St. Louis was 79-82. This story has been corrected to show that the Texas Rangers are in the AL West, not AL East. AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea's state media said a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded in mid-air on Monday. State media said the explosion was possibly caused by engine failure. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: North Korea launched a rocket likely carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night, hours after its announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center in the northeast at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket” during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A North Korean rocket carrying its second spy satellite exploded midair on Monday, state media reported, after its neighbors strongly rebuked its planned launch. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket,” with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff later said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office earlier issued a missile alert for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch. The alert was lifted soon after. Japan’s NHK public television earlier reported that an image captured by a camera in northeastern China showed an orange light in the sky and then an apparent explosion a moment later. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. Monday's launch came hours after the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative military action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region.

        "description": "Former England captain Alan Shearer believes Kobbie Mainoo has made up Gareth Southgate's mind after watching the Manchester United midfielder in the FA Cup final ahead of Euro 2024",
        "content": "Alan Shearer believes that Kobbie Mainoo’s performance in the FA Cup final may even have landed him a spot in England's starting XI at Euro 2024. It has been a breakthrough season for Mainoo , who has been one of the consistent bright sparks for Erik ten Hag’s team throughout a tough season at Old Trafford. The 19-year-old capped off his impressive campaign by scoring a sumptuous team goal to help Manchester United win the FA Cup at the weekend. Earlier that week, Mainoo had been named in the 33-man training group ahead of Euro 2024. Despite possessing several world-class players, the setup of England’s midfield has been an ongoing concern. However, Newcastle United and England legend Shearer believes Mainoo’s display at Wembley may have been enough to convince Gareth Southgate he should start, despite only having two senior caps to date. “Not only has he played his way into the squad, he may have just played himself into the XI,” Shearer claimed on The Rest is Football podcast . “In front of Gareth at Wembley, against that top-quality Man City midfield, he was the outstanding player. He may have just played himself into the XI.” Erik ten Hag sacking verdict reached after Man Utd's FA Cup final victory Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer hit back over furious response to Erik ten Hag interview Southgate will be eager to find the ideal partner to slot alongside Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham in a midfield three. The dilemma stems from the possibility of deploying Phil Foden centrally in a more attacking lineup or using Mainoo in a pivot with Rice. The United midfielder was handed his England debut in March and quickly showed what he could add to the Three Lions this summer. Mainoo particularly caught the eye in his first start against Belgium, effortlessly linking up with Rice, Bellingham and Foden. Have your say! Should Kobbie Mainoo start for England at the Euros? Tell us in the comments section below Kobbie Mainoo impressed during his first England start against Belgium in March ( Image: Michael Regan - The FA/The FA via Getty Images) Discussing Mainoo’s rapid rise, Gary Lineker was more cautious about the youngster’s England prospects but spoke in glowing terms about the United academy graduate. “The sky’s the limit, I think,” he said. “I’m impressed with his remarkable maturity, his confidence. “I think he knows how good he is, he reminds me in that sense of Bellingham. I know that’s a big shout, but he’s two years younger. He’s remarkably talented. \"I think he’ll feature in the Euros. I don’t know where and when. Gareth was in the stand and everyone in the ground would have seen how good and confident he was. You can see he’s got almost an aura about him with the right sort of confidence.” Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "content": "Amakhosi ended a humiliating season in disappointing fashion with a shock 2-0 defeat to already relegated Cape Town Spurs at DHL Stadium on Saturday. | While they will be looking to rebuild and pick up the pieces in a new season come August, for the veteran goalkeeper, it might have been the final curtain call on his playing days in a Chiefs shirt. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Johnson revealed that he has been somewhat let down by the reception Khune has received. \"If you look at anywhere in the world, when a player has given 25 years to a particular club, and within that period, he won games, he won trophies, and saved their positions, then whatever he is getting now is not what have seen at other levels,\" said Johnson. \"At different levels, I’ve seen people stand up when they see a man like that. So, that’s the status I look for Itu to have in the future; when he walks into a stadium, people stand up to greet him. \"We don’t have that culture, unfortunately, in this country, but that makes you very proud to be a legend of the team you’ve given 25 years to.\" Khune was honoured by the club for his 25 years of service ahead of the 0-0 draw against Polokwane City in their penultimate match of the season. | The 36-year-old won three league titles with the Glamour Boys and told SuperSport TV recently that he still intends to meet with the club’s hierarchy to discuss the possibility of playing beyond the just-ended campaign.",

        "description": "Young Africans president Hersi Said has now had his say on Stephane Aziz Ki's future, amid reports linking the player with a move to South Africa.",
        "content": "In April, KickOff exclusively revealed that amid an impressive season in the colours of Yanga. The 28-year-old was instrumental in the Tanzanian outfit's run to the quarter-finals of the CAF Champions League, registering two goals and two assists in 12 matches. His disallowed goal against Mamelodi Sundowns in the second leg of their quarter-final drew widespread controversy, as his team would go one to lose the tie, prompting questions over the officiating of the match. The Burkina Faso international has since been the subject of increasing speculation, with the fact that his contract is set expire in June casting more questions about his future in Dar es Salaam. However, Yanga's president has now insisted that Aziz Ki, as well as other key players, will not be allowed to leave the club. \"There will be no exodus of star players,\" Said firmly announced, according to \"Our leadership is fully committed to retaining all of our talented players. We are actively seeking to bring in the best new talent as well, ensuring a strong squad for next season.\" This would likely be a big blow for Pirates and other clubs who were keen to sign the winger on a free transfer. Yanga were recently crowned Tanzanian Premier League champions, with Aziz Ki finishing as the league's top scorer with 18 goals this term. With the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on the horizon, Aziz Ki was named in the Burkina Faso squad that is set to take on Egypt and Sierra Leone on 6 and 10 June, respectively.

        "content": "In a landmark legal and political development, the Federal Government has filed a lawsuit against the 36 state governors of Nigeria at the Supreme Court, seeking to enforce full autonomy for local government councils as the third tier of government. The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Prince Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, initiated the suit, marked SC/CV/343/2024, in a bid to curtail what he describes as the unconstitutional interference by state governors in local government affairs. The AGF is requesting the Supreme Court to issue an order prohibiting state governors from the “ unilateral, arbitrary and unlawful dissolution of democratically elected local government councils. ” He argues that such actions contravene constitutional provisions that guarantee local government autonomy.

Join Tekedia Capital Syndicate and i nvest in Africa’s finest startups here . The suit also calls for an order mandating that funds allocated to local governments from the Federation Account be directly channeled to them, bypassing the controversial joint accounts managed by state governors. This direct funding is seen as crucial to ensuring the financial independence and effective functioning of local governments as envisaged by the 1999 Constitution. Additionally, the AGF seeks an order stopping governors from constituting caretaker committees to run the affairs of local governments, arguing that this practice violates the constitutionally recognized democratic councils. He also requests an injunction restraining the governors, their agents, and privies from receiving, spending, or tampering with funds released from the Federation Account for the benefit of local governments when no democratically elected local government councils are in place. The suit is predicated on 27 grounds, emphasizing that the Nigerian Federation, created by the 1999 Constitution, recognizes federal, state, and local governments as three tiers, each drawing funds for their operations from the Federation Account. The Constitution mandates a democratically elected local government system and does not provide for any other form of governance at this level. The AGF contends that state governors have failed to establish democratically elected local government systems, even where no state of emergency has been declared to justify the suspension of democratic institutions. “A ll efforts to make the governors comply with the dictates of the 1999 Constitution in terms of putting in place a democratically elected local government system have not yielded any result, ” the AGF stated. “ To continue to disburse funds from the Federation Account to governors for non-existing democratically elected local governments is to undermine the sanctity of the 1999 Constitution .” The AGF has asked the Supreme Court to invoke Sections 1, 4, 5, 7, and 14 of the Constitution to declare that state governors and state houses of assembly are obligated to ensure a democratic system at the local government level. He also seeks a declaration that governors cannot lawfully dissolve democratically elected local government councils. While the push for local government autonomy is viewed by some as a potential catalyst for good governance, it has also sparked concerns about the risk of increased corruption. Economist Kalu Ajah provided critical insight into the historical and practical challenges of local government administration in Nigeria. “L GAs were primarily created by the military as a way to get oil money, not to develop rural areas, ” Ajah explained. “ Oil cash in Nigeria is shared via LGAs, so if I want a state to get more oil money, I (as a General) arbitrarily increase the number of LGAs that state has .” He highlighted the disparity between Kano, which has 44 LGAs, and Lagos, with a larger population but only 20 LGAs. Ajah suggested that for local government autonomy to be effective , funding should be based on performance metrics rather than direct allocations. “L GAs should not receive direct FAAC funds but rather grants based on the actualization of HDI goals, ” he proposed. “ For example, the LGA gets a direct cash payment for every child who graduates from primary education. Same for immunization or reduction in waterborne illnesses .” He added: “ Simply paying cash to LGAs because they are LGAs is the most significant waste of wealth that has occurred in Nigeria. “Y ou can’t reform LGAs without reforming the premise of their creation .” The Supreme Court has scheduled the hearing of the suit for May 30, setting the stage for a landmark decision that could reshape the governance structure at the local level in Nigeria. The outcome of this legal battle will have far-reaching implications for the balance of power between the federal and state governments and the future of local governance. This legal confrontation, which highlights the ongoing faceoff between different tiers of government in Nigeria, raises critical questions about the best ways to achieve effective and accountable local governance in the country.",

        "content": "( WAVY ) — The final resting place for a U.S. Navy submarine that sank the most Japanese warships in World War II has been found more than 80 years after it was sunk. The USS Harder was found in the South China Sea, more than 3,000 feet below the surface off the coast of the Philippines’ northern island of Luzon, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. The sub, with its 79-man crew, was sunk during a 1944, battle. It was data collected and provided by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea and the Lost 52 Project, that helped find the sunken submarine. Previous submarines found by the Lost 52 Project include the USS Grayback, the USS Stickleback, USS R-12, USS S-26, USS S-28 and the USS Grunion. The first USS Harder was commissioned Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It now rests upright and is relatively intact. The NHHC said the excellent state of preservation of the site and the data it collected allowed it to confirm the wreck as the USS Harder. The first USS Harder (SS 257) was commissioned on Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It was lost at sea with 79 souls aboard on Aug. 24, 1944. “Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,” said NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, U.S. Navy rear admiral (retired). “We are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the ‘Hit ‘em Harder’ submarine that sank the most Japanese warships — in particularly audacious attacks — under her legendary skipper, Cmdr. Sam Dealey.” The Harder made six patrols before it was sunk, with its fifth being the most successful, according to the NHHC, sinking three Japanese destroyers and heavily damaging or destroying two more in four days. Its last known location was in the South China Sea off Luzon during its sixth and last war patrol. Japanese records later revealed Harder fired three torpedoes at its CD-22 vessel, the NHHC said. “The Japanese ship evaded the torpedoes and began a series of depth charge attacks, [with] the fifth depth charge attack sinking Harder and her crew,” the NHHC said. The USS Harder received the Presidential Unit Citation for her first five patrols, six battle stars for World War II service. Dealey was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor “for his outstanding contribution to the war effort on Harder’s fifth patrol.”",

        "content": "As Nepal gears up for the 2024 Waste Management and Climate Conference (WMCC) on June 5, excitement is building among environmental advocates, government officials, and business leaders. The landmark event, jointly organized by the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Khaalisisi, and the Coca Cola Foundation, with co-organisers Women for Human Rights and CNIYEF, aims to unite stakeholders to pioneer Nepal's waste management and climate future. , founder of Khaalisisi, shared with the conference's goals, key sessions, and what attendees can expect. The urgency behind the WMCC stems from critical environmental challenges plaguing Nepal and globally. Every day, a staggering 1.2 million kilos of waste are dumped into landfills just from Kathmandu, the valley's air quality ranks among the world's worst, posing significant health risks to its inhabitants. Furthermore, the alarming rate of Himalayan glacier melt, including the iconic Mount Everest, underscores the pressing need for immediate action. The WMCC serves as a vital platform to address these pressing issues, fostering collaboration among key stakeholders to seek innovative solutions and drive tangible change. At the heart of WMCC is the Mayor's Forum, a rare occasion bringing together mayors from various metropolitans and municipalities nationwide to engage in a public forum. In this pivotal 90-minute session, moderated by Dil Bhusan Pathak, host of TOUGH Talk, mayors will together explore innovative strategies and future outlooks, fostering collaboration and synergy among metropolitan and municipal bodies. 'Can garbage really make you rich?' This is the intriguing question at the heart of the session & 'Waste to Wealth' at WMCC. Despite the common perception that waste equals wealth, the reality is far more nuanced. While the potential for economic gain from waste management is evident, few startups have capitalized on this opportunity, and investments in the sector remain limited. In this session, we bring together investors, startups, and policymakers to explore the challenges and opportunities of the waste industry. Carbon and plastic credits are gaining traction globally, and while neighboring countries like India and China are experiencing a boom in this sector, Nepal has yet to see the industry formalize amidst regulatory complexities. At the conference, we'll explore this disparity and discuss strategies for Nepal to tap into the potential of carbon and plastic credits. We have a panel discussion on combating air pollution at WMCC, where sector experts, representatives from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) - recognizing air pollution as a human rights violation - members from the health sector, and policymakers will convene. This session serves as a pivotal opportunity to leverage the WMCC platform for formulating collaborative efforts to address Nepal's alarming air pollution crisis (one of the highest in the world). Climate change is a pressing issue, especially for regions like Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) particularly regarding the melting of glaciers, especially in regions like Sagarmatha. To address this pressing issue, we've convened a special panel featuring Dr. Popular Gentle, Environment & Climate Advisor to the Rt. Hon'ble Prime Minister of Nepal. Dr. Gentle will be joined by mountaineers and experts from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). This distinguished panel will provide insights, expertise, and firsthand experiences to deepen our understanding of the impact of climate change on vulnerable areas like Sagarmatha. At WMCC, we will shine a spotlight on Nepal's commitment to the Paris Agreement by featuring a paper presentation that outlines our progress and initiatives in aligning with its principles. This session will provide visibility on where we currently stand regarding our targets under the Paris Agreement, showcasing the initiatives we have undertaken and those currently in progress. Additionally, we will showcase success stories from both local and international waste management and climate initiatives, celebrating the progress made and inspiring further action in line with our climate commitments. Moreover, an awards ceremony will recognize outstanding contributions to waste management, underscoring our dedication to sustainable practices. Furthermore, to foster environmental activism among students, we will host a \"Green College Champion\" competition, aimed at engaging and encouraging young minds to contribute to our collective efforts towards environmental preservation. We are honored to have a diverse group of attendees, including government stakeholders, parliamentarians, corporate executives, delegates from UN missions, and representatives from various embassies. Their participation underscores the importance of the conference and the collective commitment to improving waste management and addressing climate change in Nepal. Indeed, WMCC holds immense promise for catalyzing transformative change. Among the many anticipated outcomes, we envision the creation of a comprehensive rapporteurs' report. This document will encapsulate key insights, recommendations, and action points generated throughout the conference and will be shared locally and internationally among concerned organizations, including the Government of Nepal. We anticipate heightened national and international awareness regarding waste management and climate issues, fostering collaborative efforts among stakeholders. Additionally, we hope to secure pledges from esteemed organizations, including the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), to support ongoing initiatives. Ultimately, we aim for collaborative actions among participants representing esteemed organizations to drive meaningful change in waste management practices and environmental sustainability efforts.",

Tourism Ireland aims to sustainably support local economies and communities and the relaunch of this service will deliver visitors right to the heart of the iconic Wild Atlantic Way, which marks its 10 th anniversary this year. “As an island destination, there’s a proven correlation between access and growth in visitor numbers. Tourism Ireland is committed to working with Delta, Shannon Airport and our other key partners, to drive demand for this transatlantic flight, and all other services to Ireland, helping to maintain our vital network of routes and services.” Delta started its new daily Shannon-JFK service last Saturday. Due to huge demand, the airline has moved to a larger Boeing 767-300 jet for the route, rather than a Boeing 757-300 as originally planned. © ITTN.ie",

        "content": "On May 27, Zihuny Rasheed, Deputy Managing Director of Maldives Marketing and PR Corporation (MMPRC/Visit Maldives), and Mr Etienne Ng, Weixin Pay's Country Manager, Singapore and Regional Director, Southeast Asia, WeChat Pay, signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) during ITB China 2024, pledging to support more Maldivian merchants to accept WeixinPay to provide Chinese tourists with a convenient payment experience. Visit Maldives is the Official Destination Partner for this year's edition of ITB China. “China is a key source of tourists for the Maldives, and we greatly value the experience of Chinese visitors,” said DMD Zihuny Rasheed. “We plan on promoting the acceptance of Weixin Pay throughout the country, offering Chinese tourists the payment option they are familiar with and prefer. I have used Weixin Pay during my visit to China via linking an international card, and I can attest to the convenience of the mobile payment option.\" Ibrahim Faisal, Minister of Tourism of the Maldives, expressed his support, “Excited that we're introducing Weixin Pay for Chinese visitors, which is another step in establishing Maldives as their top destination. Now, it's easier than ever for Chinese travellers to enjoy their stay, hassle-free. We look forward to further enhancing their experience,” he wrote. According to Mr Etienne Ng, Weixin Pay is currently being piloted at the country’s airport duty-free store, as well as in popular restaurants like Sala Thai and City Garden. Additionally, a range of hotels and resorts are participating including, JEN Maldives Malé by Shangri-La, Adaaran Select HudhuranFushi, Adaaran Club Rannalhi, Adaaran Prestige Vadoo, Adaaran Prestige Water Villas, Velaa Private Island, Cheval Blanc Randheli Private Island, Dhawa Ihuru Maldives, Ayada Maldives, Marriott Bonvoy, Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru, Conrad Maldives Rangali Island and Angsana Velavaru in Maldives with strong support from the Bank of Maldives and local merchants. Making smooth progress, the initiative is expected to have 8,000 merchants nationwide that integrate the payment option. “Weixin Pay is committed to providing users with safe and convenient payment services. Since the visa exemption policy was implemented, more and more Weixin Pay users have chosen to travel to the island country. Through our cooperation with Visit Maldives, we aim to provide Chinese users with the same convenient experience in the travel as they experience at home,\" he said. In February 2023, an Agreement on Mutual Exemption of Visa Requirements signed between the Maldives and China took effect as China expands its visa-free policy to benefit more countries. Consequently, the Maldives has consistently ranked among the top overseas destinations for Chinese tourists during popular travel periods such as the May Day and National Day holidays. According to data from Visit Maldives, the country welcomed over 1.8 million tourists in 2023, a new national record. The Chinese market has been a key source market for the Maldives. As of 11th May 2024, it is the number one source market with 91,073 tourist arrivals.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden delivered a Memorial Day address at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance.",
        "content": "ARLINGTON, Va. -- In observance of Memorial Day, hundreds gathered at the Arlington National Cemetery to pay their respects to those who fought for the United States. The ceremony began with the traditional wreath laying. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. For Biden, it marking a solemn occasion that is personal for the commander in chief. United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who served more than four decades, was among the speakers at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance. During Biden's remarks, he acknowledged how difficult it is to lose a child. The president said this week marked nine years since he lost his don Beau Biden to brain cancer. The ceremony continued as hundreds waved American Flags during an interpretation of \"God Bless America.\" The president on Monday morning also hosted a breakfast in honor of Memorial Day with administration officials, military leadership, veterans and Gold Star family members. The day is also personal for the president - Biden has frequently drawn on the death of his son, Beau Biden, from brain cancer that he believes was linked to the toxic burn pits Beau Biden was exposed to during his tour in Iraq. Thursday will mark the ninth anniversary of Beau Biden's death. In a personal and political win in 2022, Biden signed the bipartisan PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits to millions of veterans who were exposed to burn pits, which were used to burn waste - including trash, munitions, hazardous material and chemical compounds - at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan until about 2010. These massive open-air burn pits often operated at or near military bases and released dangerous toxins into the air that, upon exposure, may have caused short- and long-term health conditions, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The president's remarks come just two days after he delivered the commencement address at West Point, where he pointed to the United States' role \"as the indispensable nation, the world's only superpower, and the leading democracy in the world.\" \"From the very beginning, nothing is guaranteed about our democracy in America,\" Biden told the graduating cadets. \"Every generation has an obligation to defend it, to protect it, to preserve it, to choose it. Now, it's your turn.\" It also comes as Biden prepares to travel to Normandy, France, in two weeks, where he's slated to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. The speech comes at the beginning of what is expected to be a busy period of campaigning ahead of the November election. Biden's opponent in that race, former President Donald Trump, marked Memorial Day in a Truth Social post in which he attacked E. Jean Carroll and the judges who have presided over his defamation, civil fraud and criminal hush money trials. \"Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\" Trump said in the lengthy social media rant. The annual event is free and open to the public, according to the website. CNNW contributed to this post.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Farmers, livestock breeders, and aquaculture operators are required to register with the GeoAgro Registration System of the Agriculture and Food Security Ministry to receive diesel subsidy cash assistance through the Budi Agri-Commodity category under the Madani Subsidy Assistance programme. The ministry said that eligible farmers, breeders, and aquaculture operators could register with the GeoAgro Registration System at https://geoagroregister.kpkm.gov.my before applying on the Budi Madani portal at https://budimadani.gov.my. The statement also assured that existing subsidies and incentives for fishermen and padi farmers would continue. \"For fishermen, the government will maintain the diesel subsidy at RM1.65 per litre for owners of fishing vessels in zones A, B, and C, subject to the set quota. \"In addition, the government has agreed to increase the current rate for ploughing incentives from RM100 per hectare per season to RM160 per hectare per season and introduce a harvesting incentive at a rate of RM50 per hectare per season. \"With these increased rates, the padi farmers will receive ploughing and harvesting incentives totalling RM210 per hectare per season,” it said in a statement on Monday (May 27). In addition to cash assistance to agricultural sector entrepreneurs, it said the government, through the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry was also helping agricultural sector companies by providing subsidised diesel \"fleet cards\" to eligible transport vehicles under the Subsidised Diesel Control System (SKDS) 2.0. This includes rigid lorries for agricultural produce and livestock, with applications to be made via the MySubsidi Diesel System at https://mysubsidi.kpdn.gov.my/. Earlier on Monday, the Finance Ministry announced the implementation of Budi Madani following the national address by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim last week regarding the Cabinet's decision to implement targeted diesel subsidy in Peninsular Malaysia. To help stabilise the operational costs in the agricultural sector, the government agreed to provide monthly cash assistance of RM200 under the Budi Agri-Commodity initiative to eligible farmers, breeders, and aquaculture operators. Any queries regarding diesel subsidy cash assistance in the agricultural sector can be directed to the agriculture ministry operations room at 03-8870 1207 / 1147, from 8.30am to 5.30pm on weekdays or via email to geoagroadmin@kpkm.gov.my.

        "description": "In a recent landmark judgment on May 22, the Hon’ble Calcutta High Court delivered a meticulous analysis of the inclusion of 77 classes of Muslims as Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the state of West Bengal. The Court set aside the OBC classification of 37 communities under a 2012 law of which it struck down many provisions while scrapping all OBC certificates issued in the state after 2010. It also said that records in the public domain show that on or about February 8, 2010, all leading newspapers had carried the West Bengal government’s announcement of 10 per cent reservation for the Muslim community. Within six months of the announcement, the Commission recommended the inclusion of 42 classes into the state OBC list, of which 41 belonged to the Muslim community, and following the recommendation, the state immediately included the same in the list. Thereafter, through a memo dated May 11, 2012, the West Bengal government further included 35 classes in the state OBC list. “The court acted and stayed OBC certificates. Mamata Banerjee is giving reservations to Muslims for her vote bank politics. I welcome the high court order. I want to ask the people of West Bengal, can a constitutional head not obey the HC judgement? What kind of democratic mindset is West Bengal witnessing? Mamata Banerjee has looted reservations” — Amit Shah, Union Home Minister This judgment not only addresses the legal intricacies surrounding the matter but also delves into the broader implications of political manoeuvres in the realm of reservation policies. With thorough attention to detail and a steadfast commitment to upholding the principles of justice and fairness, the Hon’ble High Court’s decision stands as a testament to the judiciary’s role in safeguarding constitutional values. The genesis of this historic judgment lies in a series of writ petitions challenging the constitutionality of the inclusion of 77 classes of Muslims as OBCs under the West Bengal Backward Classes (Other Than Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) (Reservation Of Vacancies In Services And Posts) Act, 2012. These petitions raised fundamental questions regarding the legislative authority, procedural compliance, and the underlying motives behind the classification of these communities as backward. Congress’ Appeasement Manifesto Congress in its manifesto for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 has said, “We will ensure that the minorities receive their fair share of opportunities in education, healthcare, public employment, public works contracts, skill development, sports and cultural activities without discrimination.” “We will encourage and assist students and youth belonging to the minorities to take full advantage of the growing opportunities in education, employment, business, services, sports, arts and other fields,” says Congress in its manifesto. Here, it is worth mentioning that under the Congress-led UPA Government, the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) in 2011 granted minority institution status to Jamia Millia Islamia University. This allowed Jamia Millia — started in 1920 and declared a Central University by an Act of Parliament in 1988 — to reserve up to 50 per cent seats for Muslims. Also, the same Congress Government in 2005, approved 50 per cent reservation for Muslims in Aligarh Muslim University. One of the key arguments put forth in the petitions was the allegation that the inclusion of these Muslim communities as OBCs was driven by political considerations rather than genuine socio-economic backwardness. The petitioners contended that the hasty manner in which recommendations were made without proper inquiry and publication of notifications, indicated a clear motive of garnering electoral support from these communities. “The Commission and State acted in undue haste and with lightning speed in making recommendations for the classification of the 77 classes to make the public announcement of the then Chief Minister a reality,” the Court said “Not everyone in the courts is bad. I respect the judiciary. But the person who has given the order saying Muslims must be removed from OBC reservation, I don’t accept their judgment. I will not accept it. OBC reservation will continue. I will move the higher courts if needed” — Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister, West Bengal The Hon’ble High Court, in its exhaustive judgment, meticulously examined the provisions of the 2012 Act, the constitutional principles governing reservation policies, and the role of the State Government in determining backward classes. Justice Rajasekhar Mantha and Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty, in their respective opinions, provided a comprehensive analysis of the legal and factual aspects of the case, ultimately arriving at a unanimous conclusion. Andhra Pradesh: SC Status to Dalit Christians Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSR Congress government on March 24, 2023, passed a resolution that promises to provide Scheduled Caste (SC) status to Dalits who converted to Christianity. One of the most significant aspects of the judgment was the Court’s scrutiny of the legislative policy guiding the State Government’s authority to specify OBCs. The Court highlighted the lack of a clear policy framework guiding the inclusion of these Muslim communities and emphasised the importance of collecting quantifiable data to determine backwardness and inadequacy of representation. Highlights of Court Judgement “This Court is of the view that the selection of 77 classes of Muslims as Backward is an affront to the Muslim Community as a whole. This Court’s mind is not free from doubt that the said community has been treated as a commodity for political ends. This is clear from the chain of events that led to the classification of the 77 Classes as OBCs and their inclusion to be treated as a vote bank” “The services of citizens from the 77 classes and 37 classes (added in the exercise of Section 16) struck down above, who are already in the service of the State, or have already availed the benefit of reservation or have succeded in any selection process in the State, shall not be affected by the reason of this judgment” The Court found that the Commission had made recommendations for reservation based on “religion only”. Criticising the State Commission for its reports, the Court observed, “The real [...]",

The Court highlighted the lack of a clear policy framework guiding the inclusion of these Muslim communities and emphasised the importance of collecting quantifiable data to determine backwardness and inadequacy of representation. Moreover, the Court raised serious concerns regarding the procedural irregularities in the inclusion process, including the absence of proper publication of notifications and the lack of opportunity for public scrutiny and objections. These irregularities, coupled with the apparent haste in making recommendations, reinforced the Court’s apprehensions about the political motivations behind the classification. The judgment also underscored the broader implications of using reservation policies for electoral gains. By scrutinising the inclusion of these Muslim communities as OBCs, the Court shed light on the dangers of politicising social welfare measures and compromising the principles of equality and meritocracy. The judgment serves as a timely reminder of the judiciary’s role in safeguarding constitutional values and preventing the misuse of power for narrow political interests. The Hon’ble High Court’s judgment on the inclusion of 77 classes of Muslims as OBCs in West Bengal is a historic milestone in the annals of Indian jurisprudence. By upholding the principles of fairness, transparency, and constitutional morality, the Court has reaffirmed its commitment to justice and equity. The judgment not only sets a precedent for future cases involving reservation policies but also underscores the judiciary’s crucial role in upholding the democratic fabric of the nation. As citizens, it is imperative that we uphold the spirit of this judgment and remain vigilant against any attempts to undermine the principles of social justice and equality. Shortly after this groundbreaking Judgement was delivered, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee openly defied the Court’s ruling during an election rally, intensifying her call for the inclusion of Muslims in the OBC category. This act highlights a troubling pattern. By openly rejecting the authority of both the Constitution and the judiciary, Banerjee is establishing a dangerous precedent that undermines the rule of law. Her stance confirms her as a leader who disregards institutional norms for immediate political advantage, echoing the very tactics she criticizes in her opponents. Such behaviour not only erodes confidence in democratic institutions but also exacerbates social and political tensions. Furthermore, the attempt to shift reservation benefits from established OBC communities to Muslims, ostensibly in the name of social justice, widens societal divides and raises doubts about the true motives of the Opposition. This strategy appears to prioritise electoral considerations over genuine empowerment of marginalised groups, with far-reaching social and political consequences.",

        "content": "As we round into the middle parts of 2024, it looks like we may be on the cusp of the very first Chromebook Plus model to be put out to pasture. The ASUS Chromebook Plus CM34 has been with us for quite some time. Before it was an official Plus model, an identical version was launched in June of 2023 with the same name: minus the Plus. That puts us right at a year with this device around, and though that seems a bit short-lived for a Chromebook these days, ASUS’ attention has clearly moved elsewhere in the Chromebook Plus market. Earlier this year, they announced the ExpertBook CX54 Chromebook Plus and their all-white, clamshell CX34 has been the more popular Chromebook Plus model since the fall launches happened and now has a new version also available at Best Buy. advertisement A word about ‘Clearance’ listings Now, before we declare the CM34 Chromebook Plus as being done forever, a word of caution. We’ve seen listings like these go up and then get removed. To be fair, Best Buy is not usually an offender in this way (I’m looking at you, Lenovo), but if memory serves, there have been clearance sales on devices that stuck around for months after at Best Buy, too. However, from the looks of the listing as it stands today and the fact that the Chromebook Plus page on Best Buy’s website no longer lists this model, I’d say we might be on the cusp of waving goodbye to the ASUS Chromebook Plus CM34 very soon. advertisement But don’t let that clearance sticker bother you if you were thinking about picking one of these up. It still has an AUE (full OS and security updates schedule) of June 2033, so you have a solid 9 years of regular, monthly updates for nearly a decade even if you purchase one today. Buy the ASUS Chromebook Plus CM34 at Best Buy And in my time with this device, I’ve been nothing but pleased. While not the thinnest or lightest Chromebook out there, it is so good at so many parts of the overall Chromebook experience that you can easily forgive a bit more heft in the build. The 300 nits screen is fantastic, the backlit keyboard is super-comfy, the speakers are full, and the performance is right on par with what you expect in a Chromebook Plus. advertisement So, even though this one may be on the way out from store shelves, it’s still a fantastic device all around and one worth your consideration. And in the end, if we’re moving to the end of the CM34’s shelf life, that only means great deals on a great Chromebook that’ll last you 9 more years at this point. And that’s a win all around, right?

        "description": "I love the iPad, and I can't wait to upgrade my 2019 iPad for something newer. Only, there's a very big problem holding me back: Apple doesn't want me to.",
        "content": "Nadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends Want an iPad? Apple wants you to be paying attention to the new iPad Pro — and for good reason. It’s the thinnest product Apple has ever created, which is impressive considering it packs in a laptop-level M4 processor, a gorgeous display, and a number of new software tricks. But the announcement concealed something far more important: the dustbinning of the 9th-gen iPad . The last of the “retro” iPad designs, the 9th-gen is now finally retired from the stage, and for me, it means this is my last chance to grab a quick and reasonable upgrade for my 7th-gen iPad. Contents The basic iPad is all most people need Apple is testing me this time If I just spent $100 more... I figured I could grab the 9th-gen for a decent discount now that it’s on the way out — and to Apple’s credit, I absolutely could. But a realization began to sink in as I shopped, and I came away without making that final purchase. Recommended Videos There’s one thing holding me back from buying a new iPad, and it’s the feeling Apple wants me to buy something else. Related Apple’s next iPad mini could steal this iPad Pro feature I spent over $2,000 on the new iPad Pro. Here’s why I already love it Apple may release a completely new type of iPhone in 2025 The basic iPad is all most people need Adam Doud / Digital Trends The Apple iPad is my go-to recommendation for anyone looking for a tablet, and that applies doubly so if they’re looking for a cheap one, too. Frankly, Apple has perfected the tablet, and the entry-level iPad represents everything great about Apple’s design. It’s a phenomenal device, with enough power to keep games chugging and apps singing, battery life that’s strong enough to forget about charging it every day, and strong accessory support. All of this means I have a strong option where the iPad is concerned; the basic $329 iPad is all most people need. Apple doesn’t want to admit this, of course. It would much rather you bought an iPad Pro or the iPad Air . They have more powerful specs, an even broader range of accessories, and feature upgraded cameras. Joe Maring / Digital Trends But really, how many people actually need that? There’s a case the iPad Pro and Air are great for video editors and people who actually need that level of power, but if you’re just browsing the internet or playing a game every now and again, the basic iPad’s A-series processor is just fine. Support for the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil comes in handy for drawers and sketchers, but the 1st-gen Apple Pencil works well for everyone else. Most people simply won’t need the features of expensive iPads, and because of that, I will always argue the basic iPad is the best option for the majority. Of course, I’m not going to call the police on you if you buy a more expensive iPad and don’t really need it. You need to be happy with your purchase, and it’s your choice at the end of the day — but it’s clear to me that the basic iPad is all I, and probably you, will ever need from a tablet. That’s why it’s one of my strongest tenets that I will only buy the basic iPad — it gives me everything I need. But hoo boy, it’s become very clear to me that Apple does not want me to buy the basic iPad, and it means I’m not buying a new iPad at all. Apple is testing me this time Julian Chokkattu / Digital Trends My 7th-gen iPad needs an upgrade. It’s not because it’s lacking in power, battery life, or software updates. True to my word, all of this is fine. Excellent even. I’ve not come across a game it won’t play, and I love sitting down and smashing out a session of Civilization VI , or Rome: Total War . It even puts in strong shifts as toddler entertainment on long car trips. It’s a fantastic tablet, and I wouldn’t need to upgrade it, but for one small problem. The storage capacity. I bought my iPad in 2019, and 32GB, while not a lot even then, was OK . It wasn’t anything special, but heck, I wasn’t going to be doing that much on the iPad anyway. Fast forward five years, and a combination of iPadOS 17 and system data are taking up a grand total of 15.48GB . That’s almost half of my tablet’s storage space being taken up by, well, my tablet. I’m at the stage where I have to clear out downloaded games and videos just to update iPadOS. Mark Jansen / Digital Trends I need more storage, and that’s the major draw of a new iPad. Only, the 9th-gen doesn’t really offer that. Yes, the 9th-gen offers 64GB of storage as standard, and that’s double what I’m stuck with at the moment. But I view a tablet as a long-term purchase; will 64GB still be great in five years’ time? I very much doubt it. If I’m keeping it for as long as my last tablet, then 128GB is a must. So I’ll buy the 128GB version instead. It’s the obvious upgrade from 64GB; surely, it won’t cost much more. Well, it doesn’t cost much extra for the 128GB version because the 128GB version doesn’t exist. Your options are 64GB or ... 256GB? That’s a big leap — and not just in storage. The only upgrade for the basic iPad takes the very reasonable $329 price to a pretty staggering $449. And as much as I love the basic iPad, a hair’s width away from $500 is just too much. Joe Maring / Digital Trends Alright then, so what about going for the 10th-gen iPad instead? I’d been hoping to keep using my 7th-gen iPad accessories, but I’m willing to put that to one side if it means getting an iPad with decent storage that doesn’t cost $449. “Tough luck,” says Apple. “Same story here: 64GB or 256GB. And the price is now $499.” “Wh- but what do I do if I want a tablet with 128GB of storage?” “Ah,” Apple said, opening a voluminous coat. “Do I have the tablet for you...” If I just spent $100 more... Apple I’m still strong in my belief that a basic iPad is all the iPad I’ll ever need. But — and this is important — if you’re going to charge me $450 for an iPad with a four-year-old mobile processor, a Lightning port, and an outdated design, then my dedication is going to waver. Even the $500 10th-gen iPad offers a three-year-old mobile processor , and while you get a USB-C port, a more modern design, and more storage than you’re ever likely to need, it still doesn’t feel like value for money. Especially not when $100 shows you what else you could have. The iPad Air has a larger display in a smaller, thinner, lighter body, a much more powerful M2 processor, and twice the amount of RAM. And you get 128GB of storage. Which, I’ll grant you, is half the amount the $500 iPad offers, but frankly, I’m unlikely to ever need that much anyway, so the difference is negligible. Apple Yes, I don’t need the M2 processor, and 8GB of RAM is overkill for my needs. But when the iPad Air is so close in price to the upgraded iPad, it’s hard not to feel like you’re getting a really bad deal. And it works. I’m not buying the upgraded iPad because I’ll always feel like just $100 extra would have gotten me so much more. Has Apple won? No, because I haven’t bought a new iPad ... yet.

        "content": "An array of issues were addressed at the recent Bay Roberts town council meeting, which was held on May 14th. One of the most prevalent issues revolved around a specific address: 27 Goose Pond Road. The property was abandoned a number of years ago and is in poor condition. Attempts to contact the previous owner failed, and it was eventually confirmed that person is deceased. Council ordered demolition of the house back in 2022, but the order was never carried out. Residents are complaining the abandoned property is overrun with rodents, specifically rats. Chief Administrative Officer Nigel Black noted the garbage box on the abandoned property may have contributed to the rat problem. Whether demolishing the house will put an end to it is uncertain. “Certainly, demolishing the house is one piece of the puzzle, but I think there’s more to it,” said Black. A motion was carried to re-issue the demolition order. Another resident complaint discussed by council pertained to business appreciation, or rather the lack of it. A resident of Bay Roberts who is a small-business owner — specifically, the owner of a landscaping and excavation company — summarized his complaints in a letter to the council. “As a taxpayer and small-business owner I don’t feel like we’re getting support from our town,” said the resident, who was not identified at the meeting. It turned out, the Town has actually hired this particular business in the past. Council discussed how it might help local businesses by bringing more attention to them. “I agree we need to share the work,” said councillor Silas Badcock. “Not only here, but everywhere.” Ultimately, council agreed to move the issue to the committee of the whole where staff will be asked for their views on the writer’s complaints. Another issue council had to settle was the naming of the “old track,” which branches off Eric Dawe Drive. The name suggestions were: Eric Dawe Drive Extension; Track Road; or to submit the issue to the public and let residents offer their suggestions. A motion was initially made and seconded to name the road Eric Dawe Drive Extension, but councillor Dean Franey opposed the idea. “My issue with Eric Dawe Drive Extension is that it still leaves the possibility that deliveries could not make it if the ‘Extension’ were to get left off,” Franey explained. Evidently, there have been issues with the mail in the past as a result of road extensions — if the word “Extension” was left off the address, the mail would sometimes not reach the correct recipient. Franey suggested that, to avoid confusion, the Town stop using ‘Extensions’ altogether in street names. After considering Franey’s thoughts on the matter, council rescinded the original motion and a new one was proposed and carried to name the street Track Road. Finally, council also dealt with a request for aid in altering a property. A resident requested help moving a driveway as it is in the vicinity of a three-way stop located at the junction between Country Road and Sawdust Road. It was noted the residence has been there longer than the three-way stop, meaning the intersection was built despite its proximity to the property. “I know for me personally, when I first saw that house going there, going through the intersection, I’m like, ‘How did we allow that?’” councillor Badcock remarked. A motion was carried to get a report from the public works department on the situation for discussion at the committee of the whole.",

        "content": "Wondering why the monologue on seems dated this week? That's because CBS's late-night talk show is not airing new episodes for the week of May 27-31, opting for reruns each night at 11:35 pm ET/PT. But why? An official reason has not been given by CBS, but the most likely explanation is that Colbert and his staff are taking advantage of Monday, May 27 being the Memorial Day holiday and getting an early week of summer vacation in. is not the only late-night program doing this, as , and CBS's other late-night program, , are all expected to take at least some time off this week.

        "content": "( ) — The final resting place for a U.S. Navy submarine that sank the most Japanese warships in World War II has been found more than 80 years after it was sunk. The USS Harder was found in the South China Sea, more than 3,000 feet below the surface off the coast of the Philippines’ northern island of Luzon, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. The sub, with its 79-man crew, was sunk during a 1944, battle. It was data collected and provided by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea and the Lost 52 Project, that helped find the sunken submarine. Previous submarines found by the Lost 52 Project include the USS Grayback, the USS Stickleback, USS R-12, USS S-26, USS S-28 and the USS Grunion. The first USS Harder was commissioned Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It now rests upright and is relatively intact. The NHHC said the excellent state of preservation of the site and the data it collected allowed it to confirm the wreck as the USS Harder. The first USS Harder (SS 257) was commissioned on Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It was lost at sea with 79 souls aboard on Aug. 24, 1944. “Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,” said NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, U.S. Navy rear admiral (retired). “We are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the ‘Hit ‘em Harder’ submarine that sank the most Japanese warships — in particularly audacious attacks — under her legendary skipper, Cmdr. Sam Dealey.” The Harder made six patrols before it was sunk, with its fifth being the most successful, according to the NHHC, sinking three Japanese destroyers and heavily damaging or destroying two more in four days. Its last known location was in the South China Sea off Luzon during its sixth and last war patrol. Japanese records later revealed Harder fired three torpedoes at its CD-22 vessel, the NHHC said. “The Japanese ship evaded the torpedoes and began a series of depth charge attacks, [with] the fifth depth charge attack sinking Harder and her crew,” the NHHC said. The USS Harder received the Presidential Unit Citation for her first five patrols, six battle stars for World War II service. Dealey was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor “for his outstanding contribution to the war effort on Harder’s fifth patrol.”",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, and at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. “We know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting,” Beshear said. “And we ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them.” The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" More than 600,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday morning, including more than 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday. To follow the progress of the storm system, see The Associated Press Tornado Tracker . Schreiner reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, and at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. “We know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting,” Beshear said. “And we ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them.” The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" More than 600,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday morning, including more than 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday. To follow the progress of the storm system, see The Associated Press Tornado Tracker . Schreiner reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, and at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. “We know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting,” Beshear said. “And we ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them.” The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" More than 600,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday morning, including more than 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday. To follow the progress of the storm system, see The Associated Press Tornado Tracker . Schreiner reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

        "content": "Report Seven draws from seven for Leicestershire as Sam Northeast seals stalemate Slender prospect of result thwarted by Glamorgan's go-slow second innings ECB Reporters Network 27-May-2024 • 1 hr ago Sam Northeast dug in for Glamorgan in a final-day stalemate • Getty Images Leicestershire 343 for 9 dec (Handscomb 103, Hill 92, van der Gugten 5-65) drew with Glamorgan 387 (Byrom 86, Carlson 80, Northeast 61, Currie 5-64) and 157 for 4 (Northeast 41*) Leicestershire remain the only side in either division of the Vitality County Championship to neither win a match nor suffer a defeat after their match with Glamorgan at the Uptonsteel County Ground ended in an almost inevitable stalemate, with Glamorgan 157 for four in their second innings, 201 runs in front with Sam Northeast 41 not out. No team has been promoted with fewer than five wins since the two-division system was introduced in 2000, yet after seven of the 14 fixtures in this season's competition Leicestershire's unbeaten record has been enough to keep them in third place in the Division Two table, despite a zero in their wins column. The wet spring has led to a scarcity of positive results across the board and rain took its toll on this match, too, particularly on day three, although periods of stultifyingly low scoring on a slow pitch did not help. Five wickets each for Glamorgan's Timm van der Gugten and Leicestershire's Scott Currie and a century for Currie's team-mate Peter Handscomb were the highlights. Glamorgan's overnight lead of 58 with one wicket down did not look a particularly promising starting point if the match was to end in any result other than a draw and the slow progress of the opening hour did nothing to alter that perception. After a long wait for the day's first boundary, extended by a 20-minute interruption while a shower passed through, Marnus Labuschagne began to get things moving but a couple of wickets before lunch provided a semblance of encouragement for Leicestershire, whose ambition at this stage was to bowl Glamorgan out and hope there was still time to overhaul whatever lead they had managed to chisel out. Scott Currie, Leicestershire's stand-out bowler in this match, picked up a wicket that looked a tad fortunate as Eddie Byrom was given out leg before but there was no good fortune about Ben Mike's dismissal of Labuschagne, however, the right-armer bowling the Australian with his second ball, one that nipped back to pass between bat and pad and hit just below the top of off stump. Two overs after lunch, Mike removed Kiran Carlson too, the batter perhaps still mindful of the painful effects of being struck in the lower abdomen moments before when he went back in his crease to a delivery that also came back, this time hitting middle. At that point, Glamorgan were effectively 135 for four, with 62 overs left in the day. It opened up a small window of opportunity for the home side, although it had to be borne in mind that they were one seamer short with Tom Scriven injured on day one had no front line spinner anyway, and when Chris Cooke and Sam Northeast guided Glamorgan to 132 for four when more rain arrived before just before three o'clock, a lead of 176. Cooke and Northeast extended their partnership to 66 when play resumed after an early tea, at which point more gathering rain clouds and the very rare sighting of Australian opener Marcus Harris bowling in a first-class match signalled the direction in which the contest was drifting. Harris had bowled only 16 overs in his 13-year career and was left on 99 balls delivered in first-class cricket - still looking for his maiden wicket - when the skies opened again. The 31-year-old Western Australian can claim, though, that he always bowls against Glamorgan, having sent down one over against them last year for Gloucestershire, his only other over to date in the County Championship in his only other appearance against the Welsh county.

        "content": "A BMW driver with a replica assault rifle took police on a high speed chase through Angus and into Broughty Ferry. Officers had to abandon their chase multiple times after Christian Williams – earlier spotted slumped at the wheel of his private-plated car – hit speeds of 120mph. Even having three burst tyres was not enough to convince the 37-year-old to give up. Williams eventually tried to shunt his way past police cars which had cornered him. He vomited on the pavement but refused to give police a urine sample to confirm if he was intoxicated, blaming “stage fright”. From his car, police seized a CO2-powered replica assault rifle. Williams, from Mintlaw in Aberdeenshire, has now been disqualified from driving and will be sentenced later. Fiscal depute Christine Allan told Williams’ family contacted police with concerns on February 12 last year. Just before 2pm, a witness driving on the B9127 near spotted Williams inside his BMW, slumped over the wheel, and initially thought he might be dead. He also spotted the replica gun and phoned police. When officers arrived, Williams suddenly took off, hitting speeds of 95pmh as he tried to outrun police, who had to abandon their chase. They spotted him again on the A92 near where, heading towards Dundee, he hit 120mph. As he entered the 40mph zone, he was still travelling at double the speed limit and failed to stop at multiple red lights on his way into . Police deployed a stinger which destroyed three of Williams’ tyres, despite him desperately swerving to avoid it. Undeterred, he then sped through Broughty Ferry and the chase was again temporarily aborted for safety reasons. Eventually, , with police vehicles closing off both ends. However, he still drove back and forward, hitting squad cars as he tried to escape. He locked his door from inside but an officer was able to open the passenger side and seize the CO2 weapon. Williams eventually got out and threw up on the street. Police took him to Ninewells where, even after a jug of water and cup of tea, he was unable to provide a urine sample due to “stage fright”. Williams, of Burnside Drive, Mintlaw, pled guilty to driving dangerously on the , Claypotts Road, Brook Street, St Vincent Street, Beach Crescent, Fisher Street and Ambrose Street – all Broughty Ferry. Williams also pled guilty to possessing an imitation firearm – which was forfeited – and failing to provide a urine sample. The court heard he was previously convicted of careless driving in 2009. His solicitor David Duncan said the incident followed the collapse of a “significant domestic relationship”. He said: “It obviously follows a form of breakdown that Mr Williams was suffering. “He’s now residing with family.” Sheriff Alastair Carmichael banned Williams from driving, deferred sentencing until July 3 for reports and continued his bail.",

Known as \"rentvesting,\" the trend allows people to become homeowners and build equity while continuing to live in America's major employment centers. \"For younger residents of big cities where real estate is particularly pricey, buying an investment or vacation property in a nearby but much more affordable area can be a way to begin to build equity without sacrificing big-city living,\" said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist. Don't Miss: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible . Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Real estate technology company Mynd, which coined the term rentvesting, found in a 2022 study that 43% of millennials and Gen Z considered buying investment properties. Most thought it would be a smart financial move. Most of those surveyed — 72% — said they would invest in a property in a state other than where they live, largely because prices are cheaper. A recent Realtor.com housing trends report found that a typical New York City metro area house required an annual income higher than $200,000, to buy. \"Home prices in Buffalo and Rochester are considerably lower,\" Hae said. \"Purchasing a typical listing in these areas, which are less than six hours from the city, requires less than $100,000 in annual income.\" Trending: Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today? Rentvesting has a few advantages. A rental property brings in passive income and diversifies your portfolio. Plus, if you're renting out a home you purchased, someone else is paying the mortgage and maybe even covering part of your rent. \"Right now, we are seeing a lot more people buying properties specifically for short-term rentals like Airbnbs,\" said Seamus Nally, CEO of TurboTenant, a company based in Fort Collins, Colorado. Rentvesting also comes with challenges. You're paying for two residences, which can be challenging unless your property consistently generates a good profit. You also have to either hire a property manager or take responsibility yourself for screening tenants, collecting rent and making repairs.

        "content": "Truth could become indistinguishable from lies in 2.5 years, cyberattacks could disable critical infrastructure in four years, billionaires could be running the world in 4.5 years, and vital natural resources could run short in eight years, according to a federal panel tasked with imagining 35 “plausible” catastrophes. The list of threats was created by federal policy advisory body Policy Horizons Canada, which ranked the disasters by potential impact and timelines. Threats that made the top-10 ranking included ecosystem collapse, artificial intelligence run amok, health-care system collapse, a breakdown of democratic systems, overwhelmed emergency response, and widespread downward mobility. The panel interviewed experts, reviewed the literature on the various scenarios, conversed with policy makers, held workshops with forecasters, and analyzed ongoing changes in society to arrive at its 35 “plausible” disruptions to Canadian society. The researchers then gathered input from “around 500 stakeholders, colleagues, and foresight experts across the Government of Canada and beyond” to divide the threats by likelihood, potential impact, time horizon, and interconnections between the various scenarios. In the disruption considered most likely and most imminent, which the report said could hit Canada as early as late 2026, people would no longer be able to tell what’s true and what’s not due to the proliferation of artificial intelligence, in addition to dis- and mis-information. Under this scenario, “more people may live in separate realities shaped by their personalized media and information ecosystems,” the report said. “These realities could become hotbeds of disinformation, be characterized by incompatible and competing narratives, and form the basis of fault lines in society. Research and the creation of scientific evidence could become increasingly difficult. Public decision making could be compromised as institutions struggle to effectively communicate key messaging on education, public health, research, and government information.” However, the most damaging catastrophe, the panel said, is the potential outbreak of World War III, which could erupt as “tensions between the world’s powers escalate as new rivalries, alliances, and blocs emerge.” “Diminishing trust, the assertion of values, acts of interference, the battle for technological superiority, and the fight over natural resources and supply chains propel great powers into a world war, forcing other countries to pick sides,” said the report. The risk of billionaires running the world could become a reality as early as 2029, according to the report. Under this scenario, “billionaires could gain warfare capabilities and control over natural resources and strategic assets. Some might co-opt national foreign policy or take unilateral diplomatic or military action, destabilizing international relations. This may introduce new uncertainties for governance structures, as private individuals do not have the same decision-making constraints as diplomats, politicians, and military professionals.” Another catastrophe scenario the report highlighted was the loss of is the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem collapse. This scenario could become a reality as early as 2030, the panel concluded. “Society could become fragile as many people may be unable to meet their basic needs, let alone higher-order needs like a sense of belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization,” the report says. “With a heightened sense of insecurity over a lifetime, conflicts could become violent, and people could become more vulnerable to authoritarian and anti-establishment groups or leaders.” The panel also listed several “underanticipated disruptions,” which it recommended decision-makers consider more carefully. Some of these scenarios include Civil war in the U.S., antibiotics no longer work, biodata becomes widely monetized, and property becomes uninsurable.",

        "description": "The Senate passes the measure. Last year's attempt was vetoed by Gov. Newsom, who said the state's unemployment fund couldn't handle it.",
        "content": "A California bill to pay striking workers unemployment benefits has again passed the state’s Senate, despite being vetoed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year. Senate Bill 1116, authored by Sen. Anthony Portantino, a Democrat, passed the Senate May 21 along party lines. The bill now heads to the Assembly. Existing law currently prohibits striking workers from receiving unemployment benefits, which Mr. Portantino claims is a major obstacle for many striking workers. “Workers do not go on strike because they want to—they generally do it as a last resort,” Mr. Portantino said in a statement April 24 after the bill passed the Senate Labor, Public Employment, and Retirement Committee. New York and New Jersey allow striking workers to collect benefits and recently expanded eligibility, he added. If passed and signed by the governor this year, the legislation would allow striking workers in a labor dispute with an employer of any size to begin collecting unemployment benefits after two weeks. Workers who stop because of a lockout, which is a work stoppage initiated by a company’s management during a labor dispute, would also be eligible for the benefits. The bill is a repeat of last year’s Senate Bill 799, also authored by Mr. Portantino. Mr. Newsom vetoed that bill, he said at the time, because of the debt it would add to the state’s Unemployment Insurance Fund, which is currently overburdened by debt following the COVID-19 pandemic. The California Chamber of Commerce tagged the bill as a “job killer” in March, saying it would raise taxes on employers across California and put the state’s Unemployment Insurance program at risk of violating federal law. The bill would increase payments required of employers in the state but state officials don’t yet know how much more they would have to pay, according to an analysis of the bill. The state’s Employment Development Department, which oversees the unemployment fund, said the bill could indirectly impact the repayment of California’s outstanding $18 billion federal unemployment insurance loan received during the pandemic, according to the analysis. The measure is sponsored by the California Labor Federation and several labor unions, and co-authored by Sen. Maria Elena Durazo.",

Shady and even sus at worst. Almost as if this is some sort of vendetta against Trump, not justice Ahem. Julie Kelly of course has all the deets as USUAL. Truly, if you want to know what's happening in the world of lawfare, Julie is one of the best accounts to follow on Twitter/X. Take a look: Within the span of a half hour last week, one of Jack Smith's prosecutors in classified docs case called defense argument \"garbage,\" told Judge Cannon the proceeding \"is no way to run a railroad,\" and pounded on podium, clapped his hands in rage: https://t.co/m7oxCDKQoL Yikes. Again, we are hardly experts but this doesn't seem like good behavior when it comes to a prosecutor, especially a prosecutor working on a case as groundbreaking and even historic as this one against Trump.

During the August 2022 meeting, Bratt--according to a court filing by Woodward--brought up Woodward's pending judicial application before DC Superior Court. Bratt said something like, \"you don't want to do anything to mess that up.\" Meaning--get your client to cooperate. The meeting is a subject of a congressional inquiry, a DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility probe, and Nauta's motion to dismiss for vindictive prosecution.Cannon is considering the motion and Nauta's request for any discovery related to the meeting including correspondence. This is how one exchange went down Wednesday morning as Cannon pressed for details about Harbach's knowledge of records about the meeting--Harbach had just described Woodward's account of the August 2022 meeting a \"fantasy.\" Hrm. Bratt also allegedly said to Woodward something about \"we don't view you as a Trump lawyer.\" Cannon pushed Harbach to either confirm/deny that remark--you see here how he changed his tune: pic.twitter.com/Ryt6nsNZ1o Changed his tune. Of course. Bratt also allegedly warned that Nauta was going to lose his lifestyle of \"private planes and private golf clubs\" either way and it would behoove Nauta to cooperate for lesser punishment.

        "content": "After a lackluster month of May caused the Yankees to slide into second place, chasing the eternally-hated Boston Red Sox , the ‘99 Yanks had a prime opportunity to close the gap with a three-game set with their rivals in the Bronx. A loss in the first game and a win in the second, however, set the stage for a critical rubber match in which the Yankees could either cut their deficit to just half a game — or finish the series in a worse spot than they started. Fortunately for the Yankees, they had on the mound a pitcher who had troubled them for years while wearing a Boston jersey: Roger Clemens. While the Rocket had not been his old Cy Young self during the beginning of his pinstriped tenure, on that day, he reminded the world why he was a first-ballot Hall of Fame talent. May 27: Yankees 4, Red Sox 1 ( box score ) Record: 26-19 (2nd, 0.5 GB) On paper, the Yankees had the edge in the pitching matchup, and it wasn’t even close. They were sending out Clemens, a 16-year veteran, five-time Cy Young winner (including the previous two seasons), the 1986 AL MVP, and who entered the season with 233 wins and 44 shutouts to his name. The Red Sox, meanwhile, countered with Pat Rapp, a six-year veteran who was on the fourth team of his career and who entered the season with a career 4.52 ERA. And so, naturally, we ended up with a pitchers duel. Nobody reached scoring position until Scott Brosius doubled with two outs in the bottom of the third, and Rapp proceeded to get Derek Jeter to ground out to strand him there. Second base remained vacant for another two full innings, when Chili Davis stole second; this allowed him to come around and score the first run of the ballgame when Tony Tarasco* grounded a single up the middle two batters later, giving the Yankees a 1-0 lead. *Yes, this is the same Tony Tarasco who was once victimized by Derek Jeter and Jeffrey Maier in the 1996 ALCS. He signed with the Yankees late in spring training to add some Triple-A outfield depth, and this was the first hit of his 14-game cup of coffee with the ‘99 club. Heading into the top of the sixth, Clemens had absolutely stifled the Red Sox lineup, striking out six, walking one, and allowing only a single to John Valentin in the first. The Rocket began to misfire in the sixth, however. He sandwiched a Creighton Gubanich groundout (what a name) between a pair of walks to lead off the inning, and Valentin — the only batter who took anything resembling a good swing against him — drove a single. Tarasco delivered a one-hopper to Jorge Posada in an attempt to throw out Trot Nixon, but Posada whiffed on the tag and allowed the outfielder to score. While he retired the next two batters in short order, the game was tied. It was at this point, though, that the Yankees offense began to resemble the relentless version of itself that had dominated in 1998. Jeter grounded a single up the middle to lead off the bottom of the sixth, then proceeded to steal second and advance to third. Paul O’Neill flew out to left field, but the throw wasn’t deep enough for Jeter to tag up — and although left fielder Troy O’Leary overthrew home, the pitcher was backing him up and prevented Jeter from scoring. Bernie Williams grounded out to first base, once again stranding Jeter on third. Fortunately, Tino Martinez made sure the Yankees did not waste the scoring opportunity, lacing a single to right to bring the shortstop home from third and give the Yankees a 2-1 lead. The Yankees tacked on one run in each of the next two innings, with Posada leading off the seventh with a home run and Williams driving in Jeter with a single in the eighth. Meanwhile, Clemens turned the ball over to Mike Stanton, who got two outs in the eighth before handing it off to Jeff Nelson to retire Valentin. Mariano Rivera came out for the ninth, and in typical Mo fashion, retired the side in order to notch the save. Read the full 1999 Yankees Diary series here .",

        "content": "Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. ON Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.” Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. A DEADLY SERIES OF STORMS The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. HOMES DESTROYED, ROADS BLOCKED Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. MORE SEVERE WEATHER IN FORECAST The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "content": "Håfa Adai! Especially during this period of visitor industry recovery, it is incumbent upon anyone with a stake in our inter-island economy to practice, preserve, and promote our priceless CHamoru culture. Our very livelihoods depend upon it. Our 4,000-year-old language and way of life are not only Guam’s chief differentiators as a destination of choice, but “i kottura” is literally and figuratively the breadbasket of the whole Marianas archipelago and has always attracted visitors to Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. The ancient, adventurous, pioneering aspects of espiritun CHamoru have also drawn more outdoorsy types into the CNMI’s “Northern Islands” district, including the likes of Agrigan, Anatahan, and Pagan islands. These ancient haunts are either uninhabited or sparsely inhabited and largely untouched by human contact. Way up north is where CHamoru and Carolinian survival skills are taught in an atmosphere of “trial by fire” and put to the most demanding test! But nowhere is our CHamoru heritage more inviolably retained and ingrained than in i islan Luta, the island of Rota, the southernmost landfall of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. And to the Guam Visitors Bureau’s everlasting delight, Rota is the Northern Mariana Island that sits closest to the U.S. territory of Guam. We have good reason to be enamored by our neighbor to the north. Unblemished Rota, once known as “Zarpana,” is the trifocal glass through which we most profitably behold, filter, and practice the CHamoru arts. Above all other Mariana Islands, including Guam, in many ways Rota is the ultimate keeper of the CHamoru identity. This is true from the practical everyday rhythm, depth, and authenticity of its indigenous people’s spoken vernacular to their culturally intrinsic, sustainable use of the island’s unspoiled flora, fauna, land, and surrounding seascape. So, imagine our delight when Rota Mayor Aubry Hocog stopped by the GVB offices a little over a month ago, just to learn a few marketing and promotional ideas by picking up some collateral materials and asking our marketing division for tips. Are you kidding me? We should’ve been asking Mayor Hocog for advice on cultural authenticity! When I learned of her visit, I joined the meeting right away and was deeply moved by Mayor Hocog’s humility as well as her passion for breathing fresh new life into Rota’s economy. This soon led to our familiarization tour of the Friendly Island earlier this month. Local historian, guide, and cultural practitioner Ben “Guelo” Rosario led the tours, along with his brother, Antonelli “Ton” Rosario from the Historic Preservation Office, and David Santos, an accomplished Rota native who works for the CNMI’s Governor’s Office. All three of these capable gentlemen were magnanimous, knowledgeable, kind, and hospitable. Mayor Hocog’s right hand, Dina Songao, also made sure we were all taken care of and performed an abundance of legwork and logistics for our itinerary. The Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services even accompanied us on every outing to make sure we were safe. We thank everyone for an insightful, hazard-free, enjoyable trip! Our Guam contingent toured Rota’s historical and natural hotspots, including the scenic I’Chenchon Park Bird Sanctuary and Alaguan Bay, the ancient Mochong latte stone village, the coastal Agusan Swimming Hole, and the largest banyan tree in the Marianas. We experienced nighttime crab catching and deer hunting and took in traditional customs, cuisine, artwork, music, and dance. Sustainable “spot-only” fruit bat hunting and catch-and-release coconut crab hunting are promising pastimes in Rota, since there are plenty of local experts who can monetize these activities for visitors. Imagine how rejuvenated a city-weary Japanese couple would feel setting ponne or tåhu coconut baits, then returning with flashlights to pick up crabs before midnight, or walking the reef flats looking for lobsters under cover of darkness. This is eco-tourism at its most basic level. It’s exhilarating, cost effective, sustainable, and lucrative. These kinds of activities could grow into a cottage industry for families in Rota. Southern Guamanians take note! We received red carpet treatment and first class hospitality every step of the way from the neighborly Rota community, inclusive of many businesses operating there. Star Marianas Air, TJ Enterprises, Kin & Rit, Inc., Tan Holdings Corporation, PJM Enterprises, As Paris Restaurant, Puesto Grill, Tokyo En Restaurant, Calvo Enterprises, Inc., Blue Palms Dive Service, and Rota Cave Museum all treated us as welcome guests. Although the island features a few small hotels and a handful of restaurants, some guest amenities are closed indefinitely due to the economic hardship of late. Be that as it may, home-owning locals are more habituated to growing, preparing, and consuming fresh “whole food” delicacies and traditional living in Rota, anyway. What’s more, Friendly Islanders are delighted to share the fruits of their bounty with visitors who discover the calming allures of Rota’s Sinapalo and Songsong villages, the verdant magnificence of its Wedding Cake Mountain (Mt. Taipingot), or the mystery of the “never excavated” largest capstones ever discovered in the Marianas, at As Nieves Latte Stone Quarry. GVB sends its sincerest gratitude to the people of Rota for hosting us and showing us the incredible natural beauty of their glorious island and all the special ways i taotao ginen Luta take care of it. Extra shout-outs to Mayor Hocog’s staff, Sen. Donald Manglona, the Rota Municipal Council, Rota Chamber of Commerce, Marianas Visitors Authority, CNMI Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, and the CNMI Department of Land and Natural Resources. As many of you know, I am a born-and-bred “wartime Guam” CHamoru who grew up learning the rich Marianas traditions of hunting, fishing, farming, ranching, cooking, and social gathering from elders who knew our way of life before the three-year Imperial Japanese occupation and Battle of Guam. Our forebears trebled their survival instincts and traditional methods of living with the innate CHamoru trait of adaptability, so their children could thrive on the other side of war without forgetting their roots. Although Rota was occupied, farmed, and excavated by Imperial Japanese interests mostly during the last few seasons of the Land of the Rising Sun’s 30-year reign over the Northern Marianas, the island itself was not a major WWII battleground. Nor was it a primary launching pad for U.S. military maneuvers that turned the Pacific Theater to America’s advantage. Rather, Hispanicized CHamoru prewar life was arguably less disturbed during and after “war and occupation,” due to limited battle-era engagement. And this is an abundant blessing to Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. For it is my humble but informed opinion that Rota soon became the living, breathing institution of our least-touched “CHamoru culture intact,” and remains precisely that to this very day. Therefore, Rota deserves special attention among our most ardent efforts to carry on the traditions of yore through every modern or ancient means within our grasp. With each of us, let the renaissance begin – whether it be in the simple act of smiling and waving at more of our fellow guests and passers by, just like Friendly Islanders are famous for doing, or devoting more of our time to language learning and cultural immersion. In fact, certain leaders from Rota have expressed a heartfelt desire to formalize culture camps to teach Guamanians more about the prewar ways that have endured on that 1,800-person island in spite of the modernization that has swept over all of Micronesia since the Second World War. And bula taotao ginen Luta (many people from Rota) are eager for their island to become an optional tour for Guam’s growing number of visitors. I say, “na’i animu!” What blesses one, blesses all. GVB welcomes the challenge. The traditional prewar arts of talåya fishing, hunting, gathering, palm frond weaving, “hotnu” oven baking, animal husbandry, and preserving the CHamoru cookbook are worth every effort to practice and perfect. We should also continue to do our utmost to retain and preserve artifacts, even if doing so sometimes entails the reclamation and return of treasures lost to outside interests. GVB’s familiarization tour of the “Friendly Island” of Rota served as a stark reminder of how critical the rapidly evolving “One Marianas” mission must remain in the months and years ahead. It was a wakeup call for Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guam – the permanently inhabited islands of the Marianas archipelago that depend on a thriving visitor industry to keep standing on our own feet – that we must rely on one another for solutions and support in the development of new air routes, refurbished attractions, and reopened guest quarters. Fascinating as our Friendly Island exchange was for everyone involved, it was also a subtle admonition that the consistent practice, preservation, promotion, and presentation of our generous CHamoru folkways must be the glue that holds us together as a people. The shocking reality of U.S. armed forces and military contractors hardening defenses across the Marianas and Micronesia is necessary for the protection of our shared liberty. It is also a cultural invasion that comes at a steep price. And it will be up to island people to ensure that our cultures stay intact.",

        "content": "When asked what Memorial Day means to him, Korean War veteran J.D. Scott squinted and thought before responding. “It just means freedom,” Scott, 94, said. J.D. Scott, right, talks with his wife, Charlene, and Nick and Gloria Bellomo. The Hickory American Legion Post 48 held a ceremony Monday morning to honor and remember military members who died in service to the country. Members of Hickory American Legion Post 48's honor guard prepare for a three-volley salute and the playing of taps. “There’s some confusion about the difference between Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Armistice Day and others,” Keith Covill, historian for the post, said. “Today is remembrance of those who died in protection of our country and other countries. We’re looking at our predecessors in service that did not return, and there’s been a lot.” Zayne Price, from Alexander County, served in the Army from 1964 to 1966. He has been a member of the American Legion for over 40 years. Zayne Price, an army veteran, attended the Memorial Day ceremony in Hickory. He also had the opportunity to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. \"It was like walking on sacred ground,\" Price said. “I’m glad a lot of people besides vets like to observe this day because a lot of people had family and friends they lost in war,” Price said. “A lot of people don’t know what happened to loved ones.\" Army veteran and Republican candidate for Congress Pat Harrigan was the guest speaker for the event. “Every service member throughout every American generation, when they volunteer to serve, they write a blank check to the United States of America,” Harrigan said during his speech. “And for those who we mourn today, those who we celebrate and remember, that check was cashed and, indeed, as we all know, that check was payable in blood.” Pat Harrigan speaks to those gathered at Hickory American Legion Post 48 on Monday morning. In addition to the event Monday, members of American Legion Post 544 handed out poppies at the Downtown Hickory Farmers Market on Saturday. The group said the poppy is handed out, “as a symbol of the lives sacrificed in war and the hope that none died in vain.” Boy Scouts with the Lakeland District Scouts also placed American flags on the headstones of veterans on Saturday morning. “Value and sacrifice is not derived from sacrifice itself,” Harrigan said. “It is derived from superior outcomes for the United States of America through preservation and defense of values and principles that are far more important than one’s own life. Memorial Day is an opportunity for us to honor our hallowed dead and commit to the continual process of earning their sacrifice.” Patricia Leonard hands a poppy out at the Downtown Hickory Farmers Market on Saturday.

        "content": "Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles, his family said Sunday. The shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, told ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. A mask-wearing suspect opened fire, his mother said. Three suspects drove away from the scene, police said. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. There were no arrests as of late Sunday. Wactor’s agent, David Shaul, said the actor was “a real moral example to everyone who knew him.” “In the highs and lows of a challenging profession he always kept his chin up and kept striving for the best he could be,” Shaul said in a statement Sunday. “Our time with Johnny was a privilege we would wish on everyone. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. After over a decade together, he will leave a hole in our hearts forever.” Wactor portrayed Brando Corbin on the ABC soap opera from 2020 to 2022. He also appeared in a variety of films and TV series, including “Station 19,” “NCIS,” “Westworld” and the video game “Call of Duty: Vanguard.” The Associated Press Dialogue and debate are integral to a free society and we welcome and encourage you to share your views on the issues of the day.

        "content": "Q: Please introduce yourself. Who is Diego? Diego: I am a 20-year-old professional boxer born in Mallorca – in Palma - to Bulgarian parents. I have been boxing for about 10 years, I started very young. I was with the Spanish National Team for a while and then we decided to go professional. Q: How and why did you get into the sport? Diego: Honestly, there was no specific reason why I started boxing. I never did well at school, so eventually I dropped out. I always liked fighting... A boxing gym was near my house, and after checking it out, I knew it was where I wanted to be. Boxing was what I wanted to do. Q: What is your typical day like? How much time does it take to train professionally? Diego: If I am in camp (preparing for a fight) I have a strict routine; I get up early, train, eat a pre-planned meal, have a nap, train some more and eat again. My training varies between 10k runs, strength and conditioning training, sprints, bike and cardio, and of course boxing. There is no time for private life while I am in camp. My full focus is on preparing for the fight. When I am out of camp my days are a bit more relaxed than that. Q: Who are the people around you that help it all happen? Diego: My family supports me. My team includes my head coach Paul Hamilton, strength coach Danny Garcia, nutritionist Peter Bell from the UK and manager Oscar Zandian. Amanda Berggren takes all my photos and videos and my social media is managed by Zed Tosti. Q: What have been your biggest achievements so far? Diego: I have had three professional fights so far. I won all of them, with three knockouts. Paul: All three people that Diego knocked out were never knocked out before. Diego is the first Spanish boxer to be sponsored by Sports Direct UK and Everlast [the biggest name in the boxing industry] with a proper contract. That speaks volumes in terms of recognition of his talent. He got this as they see him as a massive up and coming talent from Spain. Normally, Everlast only sponsors champions, but they sponsored him straight away! Q: Tell me about this upcoming fight? Diego: It is on June 7, at 7pm, at Palau d’Esports Melani Costa in Calvia. The tickets are now on sale from Fit Club, my trainer Paul and me. More selling points will be announced shortly. Paul: Due to technical reasons, tickets for this fight are not sold online, but we are working on enabling that for future fights in Mallorca. Q: How are you preparing for the fight? Diego: I am currently in camp, following a program of training and nutrition designed by my team that I talked about earlier. It will be the first time that I will be fighting eight rounds rather than six. That’s another step up that I am getting ready for. Q: What do you expect on the day? Diego: I expect... to knock him out! [laughs] What else? Paul: The opponent is a good fighter. He's coming “to spoil the party” and it’s Diego’s job to stop him. He is much taller than Diego; he has a lot more experience, so it is going to be a tough fight, it won ́t be a “walk over”. We are stepping up the level, not just on the rounds, but on the opponents. It is all about learning. Diego is “working on the job”. I teach to go forward, not to go back. If we go back, we’re making mistakes. I don’t make mistakes. And that’s not being over confident. I just like winning. I bring the British way of training to Diego. When he is “in camp” he trains twice a day, he sticks to the diet. He doesn’t get to go out. He doesn’t drink. Being a boxer is very unsociable. You work unsociable hours and have no time for social life. Q: What are your plans for the future? You win this – then what? Paul: We’ll take that when it comes. One fight at the time. Diego: My plan is to keep winning! And when something else comes, we’ll take it. I have only been fighting in Spain so far. The idea is to go to England soon... then America... Q: Do you have any comments on training professionally in Mallorca? Are you happy with the facilities? Diego: I think that Mallorca is a very good place to train. Paul: Mallorca is amazing; I don’t know why more sports people are not using it. The weather is perfect. In our sport, there are a lot of problems. For sparring partners we’ve had to fly people in from the mainland. I get a lot of high level people coming to train here from England and I get them to spar with Diego. I think that Mallorca has better sporting facilities than England. Soon enough, it should work a lot better here. Diego: In Fact Mallorca has both very good things and very bad things. You got all the distractions here. It’s a party island, so for a young man, if you are not sure what you want, you get carried away. It happens often. Q: Is there government help for talented sports men and women? Diego: Not really. I’m sponsored by private companies such as Sports Direct UK and Everlast that we already talked about. Others include: Fit Club, Mansion, Med54, Bruno restaurant, Ryze and Skyda. Paul: There is no government help when you are a professional. Then it’s a job. Diego’s job is a boxer; he gets paid to do that. Diego: My job is punching people’s faces! [laughs] Q: Diego, what is your message for the kids looking up to you? Diego: It’s a very good sport. I would recommend boxing to everyone, not just kids. It’s very beneficial for your mental health as well as physical. It helps you build confidence and a lot of other things. I don’t have much free time, but I am always happy to give advice to the kids starting up in this sport. They can feel free to approach me. Q: Brilliant! Any final messages for our readers? Paul: I personally need people to get behind Diego. Boxing is a business, it’s about bums on seats. Without the support of the public Diego will struggle to accomplish his dreams. As we go further up the ladder, the fights get more expensive. Sooner or later, if we keep what we are doing, we will be filling up sports centres, arenas, to be able to pay for the fights that we want to have. The only way to be able to do that is by getting people to support us! Bulgarian, Spanish, English or whatever... Come to the fight on June 7 and cheer for Diego! He is talented and he will win! It will be a night to remember! Thank you both for your time. Come on! Vamos! Давай!",

        "content": "Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles, his family said Sunday. The shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, told that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. A mask-wearing suspect opened fire, his mother said. Three suspects drove away from the scene, police said. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. There were no arrests as of late Sunday. Wactor’s agent, David Shaul, said the actor was “a real moral example to everyone who knew him.” “In the highs and lows of a challenging profession he always kept his chin up and kept striving for the best he could be,” Shaul said in a statement Sunday. “Our time with Johnny was a privilege we would wish on everyone. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. After over a decade together, he will leave a hole in our hearts forever.” Wactor portrayed Brando Corbin on the ABC soap opera from 2020 to 2022. He also appeared in a variety of films and TV series, including “Station 19,” “NCIS,” “Westworld” and the video game “Call of Duty: Vanguard.” The Associated Press",

        "content": "A campaign was launched after Leeds City Council launched a review of Little Owls nurseries as part of cost-saving measures. Three of the centres – Kentmere, Chapel Allerton and Gipton North – were confirmed as at risk of closure. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital Subscription to Yorkshire Evening Post, you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. Alternative providers could be found for another 12 of the nurseries as part of the review. The review is set to be discussed by the council’s executive board on June 19. But parents said any decision should be delayed until after the July 4 general election because a change of government could alter the council’s financial situation. Get the latest on all of the news from across Leeds sent directly to your inbox with our free daily newsletter Advertisement Advertisement A spokesperson for Stop the Closure of Little Owls said: “Now the general election has been called July 4, the economic outlook for Leeds City Council may be in flux in the coming months. “We call on Leeds City Council to hold off any firm decision on Little Owls nursery until after the general election. “Closing or privatising nurseries is not the solution to the childcare crisis and it is not in line with the council’s stated desire to make Leeds a child-friendly city.” Leeds City Council already delayed the possible closure of the three nurseries until August at the earliest in response to feedback from parents. Advertisement Advertisement A council spokesperson said: “As we have previously stated, we understand the concerns of parents, carers, staff and communities which could be affected by the proposals. “These are proposals at this stage and we are continuing to engage with parents, carers and other stakeholders before any final decisions are made.” Comments on the future of Little Owls, which runs 24 nurseries in the city, can be submitted to [email protected]",

With shock and fury evident among fans, the ICT Supporters’ Trust will host up to three times its usual turn-out for meetings at the Caley Social Club on Greig Street. The Caley Thistle board provoked an extraordinary backlash from supporters on Friday after announcing they planned to adopt Kelty Hearts’ New Central Park ground in Fife as a first team base from this summer. The plan has also been widely condemned and ridiculed by past players and national media outlets. Local politicians including Drew Hendry MP and Emma Roddick MSP have also called for a rethink, the latter seeking support and advice from the Scottish Government. Accused of betraying their community roots, the club has claimed that significant sums could be saved by the move following relegation from the Championship to League One. They hope to subsidise the first team squad by removing the need to pay for rehousing of central belt-based signings in the Highlands. But the specially convened Trust meeting will hear heated demands for a U-turn by the under-fire board. “Anger, disbelief and a sense of betrayal,” was how Trust spokesman George Moodie summed up the mood among furious supporters contacting him. Mr Moodie said: “I genuinely feel that way myself. “Disbelief that the leadership of this club could do what they have done to our club. They are ripping the heart and soul of the club away from our community. “It’s an insult to Inverness and the Highlands that we are told we need to do this.” The Trust has resisted the temptation to move the emergency meeting to a larger venue given huge interest in the event and an incredible recent surge in their own membership. Contrary to speculation, the meeting will not be livestreamed on social media. Numbers pledging themselves to Trust membership have soared by 90 per cent in less than two weeks and by 173 per cent in the three months since February’s fans’ meeting. Mr Moodie said: “Pledges to attend the meeting have risen to up to 150. That’s pushing double to treble what we would normally have. “You get a sense of the incredible strength of feeling against what the board is doing. “The rise in membership has been absolutely fantastic. We have surpassed all expectations and it is growing daily. “We’re very grateful to the supporters and we would encourage those who haven’t yet joined to please do so - friends, family, kids, mum and dad. “The more members we have, the more it increases the fans’ voice. “It highlights the appreciation and love there is for our football club and adds strength to our aspirations to facilitate change at the club.” Other items on the agenda will include an update on moves by the Trust to gain a seat for supporters on the Caley Thistle board. Mr Moodie continued: “We will update the fans on our recent communications with the club, so they are fully up to speed with where the Trust is. “We’ve always listened to and always acted upon the advice and desires of the support, being that conduit for conversations with the club. “We will take forward suggestions, but we will also share what we believe should be the next steps.” Reacting to the Caley Thistle announcement of the Kelty deal on Friday, late that night the Trust issued a powerfully-worded condemnation of the training ground plan. Calling for a “change of leadership”, but avoiding a call for the board to resign, ICT Supporters’ Trust described the decision to relocate first team training to Kelty Hearts’ ground “bizarre” and said the team would now be “completely disconnected” from the local community. The statement said: “(This) rips the soul of the club out of the community. “Hundreds of fans and numerous ex-players want to see the club re-engage with the local community, supporters, and businesses. “The club’s answer to that is to move the whole footballing department’s training base 140 miles away.” The supporters’ trust also wants answers on the future of the club’s youth academy, which is remaining in Inverness, and how young local players will be able to retain a pathway to the first team. The Courier understands a senior coach will remain mainly Inverness-based to act as a bridge between the academy and the first team. The Trust statement added: “We reiterate our demands for change that allows for fresh leadership of our football club, with supporters at the centre of the club’s decision-making.” Announcing the plan as part of a “radical restructuring”, a Caley Thistle statement read: “The last few years have seen the geographic challenges in getting players to move to the Highlands become ever harder for a number of reasons “Caledonian Stadium will always be our home, but other factors in Scottish football have changed. “Where we train should not be an impediment to the quality of the players we can attract to Caley Thistle, or to our potential to progress.” The club blamed “the commercial success of the city of Inverness” for high property prices, with limited housing stock “a huge factor working against us”. But it added: “For the avoidance of any doubt, we absolutely intend to continue to develop our own homegrown Highland boys.”",

        "content": "Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. ON Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.” Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. A DEADLY SERIES OF STORMS The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. HOMES DESTROYED, ROADS BLOCKED Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. MORE SEVERE WEATHER IN FORECAST The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "content": "DEAR READERS: Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for honoring and mourning the U.S. military personnel who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. “Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night” by Walt Whitman “Vigil strange I kept on the field one night; / When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day, / One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I shall never forget, / One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the ground, / Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle, / Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my way, / Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) / Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate night-wind, / Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading, / Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night, / But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed, / Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands, / Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade -- not a tear, not a word, / Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier, / As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole, / Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death, / I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,) / Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear’d, / My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form, / Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet, / And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited, / Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim, / Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) / Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten’d, / I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket, / And buried him where he fell.” “The Fallen” by Randall W. West, courtesy of Family Friend Poems “Fragile is a single life the brave so freely give. / Bound for immortality, their souls will surely live. / Death, don’t be proud for what you took, they freely gave away. / Their quest for freedom far outweighed the fear that you convey. / They joined the ranks of warriors, staying vigil day and night. / They often skipped a meal or two, but they never missed a fight. / God bless the men and women whose fighting days are done. / Say a special prayer at night for each and every one. / Rest assured that you will find throughout the coming years / These fallen warriors will return in the hearts of all their peers! / If we forget their sacrifice, their deaths will be in vain. / Let’s stand beside their loved ones as we sing their last refrain: / You’ve come upon our heaven’s gate / You surely won’t have long to wait. / The saints will take good care of you, / But there is still a lot to do. / You’ve joined the ranks of everyone / Who fought so freedom could be won. / Although your job on earth is done, / Your work in heaven’s just begun.” Send your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com .

        "description": "‘Sometimes the standard gets changed a little bit’: Knoblauch",
        "content": "Connor McDavid didn’t have an answer. His head coach, meanwhile, took a long, deliberate pause to ponder the same question — why haven’t the Oilers been able to draw penalties against the Dallas Stars in the NHL’s Western Conference final? “I’ve heard a lot about the past, being a spectator, not a part of the NHL, not as a coach ... sometimes the standard gets changed a little bit,” Edmonton bench boss Kris Knoblauch said of playoff officiating. “(Referees) would definitely want to make sure it’s a penalty, when in the regular season, maybe some things get let go. “That’s obviously unfortunate for us.” The Oilers and Stars sit tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series with a berth in the Stanley Cup final on the line following a 3-1 Dallas victory on Saturday. Edmonton took Thursday’s opener 3-2 in double overtime despite going on the man advantage once — a call for too many men on the ice — compared to 10 minutes of power-play time for the home side. The Oilers and Stars got one power play each through the first 58 minutes of Game 2 before a couple of late calls either way with the result all but decided. It’s stark contrast compared to Edmonton’s two previous series. The club scored six times off 18 man-advantage chances in the second round against the Vancouver Canucks after opening the playoffs 9-for-25 versus the Los Angeles Kings. The Oilers, who had the league’s fourth-best power play in the regular season, have dipped to a still-impressive 34.9 per cent success rate thanks to a 1-for-13 run dating back to Game 5 against Vancouver, but have only had those three opportunities in just over seven periods of conference final action. “We’ve got a very good power play and we win a lot of games on the power play,” Knoblauch continued in his measured answer. “It’s unfortunate for us that it’s tougher to draw penalties in the playoffs than it is the regular season.” Edmonton averaged four minutes 26 seconds of power-play time across 82 games in 2023-24, but have earned a total of just 4:42 in this series. “The standard’s the same for both teams,” Knoblauch added of the Stars matchup. “I’m not saying it’s unfair for us, but we would like the same standard (as the regular season).” Oilers defenceman Mattias Ekholm was less diplomatic when queried on the same topic in the visitors locker room at American Airlines Center late Saturday. “Great question,” he said. “I have no idea. I looked at (Edmonton defenceman Darnell Nurse’s) penalty, and then five minutes later I get cross-checked right in the same spot. It’s hard. It’s physical. It’s playoff hockey. “We need to work harder to draw more penalties.” Oilers forward Connor Brown pointed to the Stars’ discipline — Dallas has averaged a playoff-low three minutes short-handed per game this spring — as part of the equation. “They check with their feet,” he said. “But I think we can do a better job of holding onto the puck and creating some momentum so they’ve got to chase us around a little bit. “That’s usually when you get your calls.” The Stars have also largely done a good job at even strength against McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who sit 1-2 in post-season scoring. McDavid snagged Thursday’s double OT winner and Draisaitl had a goal and an assist, but both were held off the scoresheet in Game 2 — a first for the Oilers in these playoffs. Despite plenty of attention being paid to his two stars, Knoblauch pointed to the looks Edmonton’s dynamic duo are still getting on Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger. “I’d be a little bit alarmed if they weren’t getting their scoring chances,” he said. “But we’ll look at that. We had enough opportunities to score more than we did (in Game 2). “There’s going to be some tweaks we can make.” McDavid, Draisaitl and Co. will have to find a way through — especially if the referees continue to keep the whistles largely silent.

        "content": "Very close race for the top three Halla Hrund Logadóttir, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, and Halla Tómasdóttir are neck and neck at the top in the presidential run. Composite image According to the latest poll from Prósenta, the Icelandic Centre for Social Research, three presidential candidates share the top spot. Halla Hrund Logadóttir, Halla Tómasdóttir, and Katrín Jakobsdóttir all share a margin of between 20.1% and 21.0%, which is far from statistically significant, with a margin of between 18.1% and 23.2%. Exciting election ahead Given that, it seems safe to assume that next weekend will be the nation’s most exciting presidential election in the history of the Republic, where a few votes could be the decisive factor in who will be Iceland’s next president. According to the poll, Halla Hrund Logadóttir has the highest approval rating (21.0%). Still, as before, it’s so slightly higher than the next two candidates, that it’s impossible to state that she’s leading in the poll, which began last Tuesday and lasted until yesterday morning. However, there is even a smaller difference between the two, with Halla Tómasdóttir having a 0.1% higher approval rating than Katrín Jakobsdóttir. That difference was in two more answers for Halla Tómasdóttir, which isn’t enough to draw any conclusions from. Baldur Þórhallsson has a 16.9% approval rating, which is significantly less than Logadóttir’s, but his upper margin of approval slightly overlaps with Halla Tómasdóttir and Jakobsdóttir’s lower margin of approval. He has therefore a good chance of getting involved in the fight in the final round. However, Jón Gnarr’s support continued to decline, so it’s unlikely that he will be able to make it into the top fight. To do so, he would have to double his support this week. According to this poll, Arnar Þór Jónsson has increased his support somewhat and now has 6.4%, but he would have to more than triple that to close the top row. However, it is still interesting to consider which candidate respondents consider most likely to win, regardless of who they would rather win. To some extent, these answers reflect the results of other surveys, but they also tend to highlight hidden support or misguided beliefs. Katrín Jakobsdóttir has taken a decisive lead over all other candidates, with nearly 45% of respondents saying she will be Iceland’s next president. Jakobsdóttir is getting more than twice as many votes as the next candidate, and more than twice as many registered voters in the poll. Halla Hrund Logadóttir is next in line with her followers but Baldur Þórhallsson’s followers seem to have become less optimistic about his victory, and not all of Halla Tómasdóttir’s followers are convinced of her victory either.",

        "description": "Why every CEO needs to put succession planning at the top of their list.",
        "content": "Succession planning has always been important, but not critical. Now, in 2024, it has evolved from \"should do\" and \"must-do\" to \"cannot wait.\" Many external factors make it increasingly pertinent for organizations and leaders to identify their next-in-line . First, we are entering an unprecedented era of retirements, with 4.1 million Americans poised to leave the workforce yearly until 2027. Second, there's a growth cycle on the horizon, subsequently, we can expect an uptick in workforce velocity. When the job market picks back up, workers of all levels will have options for better opportunities in greater quantities--C-Suite included. And third, on the other side of the upcoming growth cycle, economists predict the emergence of a multi-year economic downturn starting in 2030. Ahead of this projected slump, many CEOs are considering their five-year strategy , which may include a merger, acquisition, and/or exit . With a potential increase in CEO movement, it is vital organizations have a continuity plan in place to ensure they will continue to perform through change. In today's always-on world, you cannot afford to fall behind or lose traction due to a leadership departure. As the collective responsibility of both the current CEO and board, strong succession plans encompass the following three scenarios: Operational focuses on having a plan in place to maintain business continuity rather than reacting at the moment when unexpected leadership changes occur. This essential part of your strategic plan ensures no interruptions to business, protecting your customers, employees, and profits. And it applies to organizations of every size because, at any point in time, anyone could resign or have unexpected health reasons that require them to step away. This scenario requires leaders to have a strategic vision for the company's next three to five years and assess whether they have the right team to help get there. Building the leadership team of the future means identifying gaps and hiring for those skills or developing those skills within your existing team. According to the Q1 2024 Vistage CEO Confidence Index, nearly three in five CEOs are investing in leadership development to prepare their future leaders. Transactional scenario planning refers to the literal transaction of the business, due to buying and/or selling. 27 percent of CEOs surveyed in the Q3 2023 Vistage CEO Confidence Index said they are planning an acquisition. Further, 22 percent of CEOs said they plan to sell their business within the next 5 years, and 30 percent said they are approached with offers to buy their company every week , according to the Q1 2024 Vistage CEO Confidence Index. This type of scenario planning is perhaps the most complex, as it can be broken down into two distinct aspects--the ownership change and the leadership change. Before the transaction involving an ownership change, you should establish a valuation and know which levers to pull to improve it. The other aspect is a leadership change. Whether it is the forced or planned departure of a CEO, retirement or moving on, succession planning helps the company prepare. Each of the three scenarios--operational, aspirational, and transactional--has unique considerations. For example, a CFO who is retiring or planning to step down as part of an acquisition will be able to ramp up their successor over an extended period, while a CIO who decides to leave for another role may only have a short window. Peeking around corners and compiling solutions for all three scenarios ensures a seamless transition. Despite how important succession plans are, the Q1 2024 Vistage CEO Confidence Index revealed more than a quarter of CEOs do not currently have one in place, and only a fifth have identified successors for their leadership team. When leaders fail to plan, it can be truly devastating to organizations, leaving company cultures decimated and having negative impacts on customers or end-users due to interruptions in service. The good news is the current economic landscape lends itself perfectly to working through these scenarios. While we're in a relative economic lull before the next growth cycle picks up, CEOs can sit down to map out their plans for potential operational, aspirational, and transactional leadership changes. The leaders who take the time to thoughtfully plot out the future success of their company will leave a lasting legacy, and help to lock-in the organization's long-term success.",

        "content": "Dana Erlich said she had heard of Israelis requesting to be relocated elsewhere or asking to return home Simon Harris condemns “horrific” missile strike on refugees in Rafah Micheál Martin said EU foreign ministers have discussed the prospect of sanctions against Israel if it doesn’t comply with ICJ ruling Statehood recognition to be formalised tomorrow by Ireland, Norway and Spain Simon Harris dismisses economic threats from recalled Israeli Ambassador to Ireland as ‘a distraction’ The Taoiseach has dismissed a warning from the Israeli ambassador about the potential economic impact Ireland’s plan to recognise Palestine could have on our tech sector as “a distraction”. Speaking in Jerusalem, Dana Erlich said that a crisis in bilateral ties over Ireland's plan to recognise the Palestinian state tomorrow sends the wrong message about Ireland as a tech hub and is worrying Israeli investors in the Irish IT services sector. “I think it's a distraction quite frankly,” Mr Harris said in response today at a Fine Gael election launch. Asked if he believed Ms Erlich was threatening Ireland with economic retaliation for his decision to recognise Palestine through her remarks, Mr Harris responded: “The ambassador can say what the ambassador wishes to say. “This is a country that complies with diplomatic norms, and treats ambassadors with respect. “It certainly doesn't parade ambassadors in front of television cameras where videos are played with horrific films. We will continue to treat all ambassadors with respect.” Simon Harris made reference a missile attack on Rafah in which dozens of people were killed at a camp for displaced people. It followed a Hamas rocket attack on Tel Aviv in which no injuries were reported. “I was very clear last week when we announced with Norway and Spain that we had decided to recognise the state of Palestine because we believe in a two state solution,” he said. “We believe in the state of Israel and in the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and stability. And we believe it at a time when others are seeking to bomb that hope to oblivion,” he continued. “And quite frankly, I think many people in Israel, many people in Palestine and many the world over are able to differentiate between the people of Israel and the Netanyahu government. I, certainly, am able to differentiate between the two, just like we can we can differentiate between right and wrong.” Rather than anybody seeking to distract, he said: “I think what should concern the entire world today are the barbaric, horrific scenes that we saw last night in Rafah, where a displaced persons centre was attacked. Imagine a place where parents bring their children for safety and security, a place that is meant to be to some degree of refuge and safety. At this most horrific time it was attacked and bombed and 45 people are dead. “That is the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding in the Middle East. I don't think anybody fully comprehends the scale of this.” Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said EU foreign ministers have for the first time discussed the prospect of sanctions against Israel if it does not comply with an order from the International Court of Justice. He suggested Ireland would support such an approach. \"Certainly, if compliance [with Friday's ICJ ruling] isn't forthcoming, then we have to consider all options,\" he said. The Taoiseach also said sanctions against Israel are not “off the table”. He told Ireland AM: “In relation to sanctions, I don’t think anything can be off the table when it comes to Israel, particularly with what we’re seeing currently happening in Rafah now, when we’re seeing the international community being ignored, when we’re seeing international courts being ignored.” Last week, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah. Ireland, Norway and Spain will formally recognise Palestinian statehood on Tuesday. Speaking at a joint press conference in Brussels today, Micheál Martin said the move was in search of a “fundamental paradigm shift” between a peaceful two-state solution to the conflict. He added: “Some have framed our decision to recognise the state of Palestine as a move to impose an outcome on the parties or as somehow a reward for terror. “Nothing could be further from the truth. We have recognised both the State of Israel and the state of Palestine precisely because we want to see a future of normalised relations between the two peoples.” Mr Martin said there can be no military solution to the conflict as he criticised any group using violence or terrorism to eliminate the state of Israel or Palestine. He said: “I condemn the violence of yesterday. The rockets that were struck at Tel Aviv and the heinous attack on the Rafah tent refugee camp where innocent children and civilians were killed.” He added: “What we witnessed last night is barbaric. Gaza is a very small enclave, densely populated conurbation. “One cannot bomb an area like that without shocking consequences in terms of innocent children and civilians.” Mr Martin called for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages. Speaking in Jerusalem earlier, where she has held foreign ministry consultations after being recalled in protest, Dana Erlich said she hopes to return to Ireland, though she saw the Irish Government as siding with the Palestinians against Israel. The statehood recognition is due to be formalised tomorrow in conjunction with Spain and Norway. The United States and some other European countries favour reviving negotiations on resolving the conflict first. The move by Ireland, Spain and Norway was denounced as a “reward for terrorism” by Israel, which is waging a devastating war in Gaza with knock-on fighting on other fronts in response to the October 7 cross-border rampage by Hamas. Ireland recognises the state of Palestine Ms Erlich said all aspects of Israeli-Irish ties were under review but stopped short of predicting further action by her government, which has continued sparring with Madrid. “Ireland is not neutral or an honest broker in this case, because they are very supportive of the Palestinians. But what we are saying (is): this is not the time for such announcement on recognition,” said Ms Erlich. The Irish Government says recognition of Palestinian statehood may benefit Israel by reviving stalled peace negotiations. Ms Erlich said many Irish people sympathise with Israel “behind the scenes”. She added: “I think there is a lot of potential in our bilateral relations, if it's cybersecurity or health care, climate change. I hope to be given that opportunity to continue that.” But she said a public mood of hostility is making Israelis question their place in Ireland – a threat to tech services that account for the lion's share of around €5bn in annual trade between the countries. “We are getting more and more phone calls and hearing conversations of concerned people - if it's Israelis who invest in Ireland and are concerned about their investment, if it's Israelis who have relocated to Ireland into different tech companies and either are requesting to be relocated somewhere else or asking to return to Israel,” said Ms Erlich. Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, southern Gaza. Health workers said at least 35 people were killed in the area. Photo: AP “I think it sends the wrong message about the location and the centrality of Ireland as a tech hub when there are more and more people who are concerned about moving to Ireland. I don't think this is the message that Ireland wants to send to the world and this is not what we want to see.” The business connection has already been hit by the decision announced on February 5 by Israel's national carrier, El Al, not to renew direct flights to Dublin that were launched last year, citing changes in customer demands since the Gaza war. The Government has rejected calls by pro-Palestinian activists to impose sanctions or an economic boycott on Israel. But on April 5, Ireland said its €15bn sovereign investment fund would divest from six Israeli companies, including some of its largest banks, over their activities in the occupied Palestinian territories. The Gaza war broke out a month after Ms Erlich arrived in Dublin, plunging her into 24/7 crisis-management. “There are many similarities between Ireland and Israel that I'm curious to learn more about – if it's a reviving of an ancient language, if it's the diaspora, if it's the different scenic options,\" she said. “And I hope to be given that opportunity to continue exploring Ireland. But right now, we need to address our concerns.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news",

The unique initiative is driven by one important mission: to ensure special-needs adults who have completed high school continue to grow in a way that maximizes their potential. The name Breaking Away reflects the wish that these adults will have the opportunity to break away from others’s perceptions of their limitations. “As a non-profit program, we are very grateful to those who have supported us through sponsorships,” shared director Tiffany Daniels. “We’ve had fundraising events in the past to support the program; this is something we are working toward planning in the near future.” The grassroots idea was launched by a few determined families and has expanded to become an invaluable resource. Debra Tonon’s daughter Danielle has been a student for many years. “Danielle looks forward to her days with her friends doing what she loves to do,\" she says. \"It’s very meaningful.” “She continues to learn life skills that have given her some independence. They share their experiences and are actively involved in planning the weeks ahead,” describes Tonon. Breaking Away offers more than just respite services. The program is challenging, goal-oriented and uses individualized learning plans to bring out the best in participants. The program operates every weekday (noon–5 p.m.) at the Mount St. Joseph Learning Centre. Students should be independent, over 18, ready, willing and able to be part of a group and be supported by their families. Activities include shopping, visiting the library, swimming, yoga, gymnastics, field trips and preparing and eating meals. These activities help to develop friendships and interpersonal skills all while creating meaning for the students. “I have witnessed firsthand the amazing opportunities the program provides the students, ranging from friendships to learning valuable life skills,” says Daniels. “Breaking Away is truly an incredible program that I’m proud to be a part of.” If you would like to find out more about Breaking Away, how you can get involved, or make a donation, visit breakingawayssm.com .

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, and at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. “We know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting,” Beshear said. “And we ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them.” The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" More than 600,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday morning, including more than 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday.

        "content": "Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. ON Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.” Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. A DEADLY SERIES OF STORMS The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. HOMES DESTROYED, ROADS BLOCKED Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. MORE SEVERE WEATHER IN FORECAST The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "description": "‘Sometimes the standard gets changed a little bit’: Knoblauch",
        "content": "Connor McDavid didn’t have an answer. His head coach, meanwhile, took a long, deliberate pause to ponder the same question — why haven’t the Oilers been able to draw penalties against the Dallas Stars in the NHL’s Western Conference final? “I’ve heard a lot about the past, being a spectator, not a part of the NHL, not as a coach ... sometimes the standard gets changed a little bit,” Edmonton bench boss Kris Knoblauch said of playoff officiating. “(Referees) would definitely want to make sure it’s a penalty, when in the regular season, maybe some things get let go. “That’s obviously unfortunate for us.” The Oilers and Stars sit tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series with a berth in the Stanley Cup final on the line following a 3-1 Dallas victory on Saturday. Edmonton took Thursday’s opener 3-2 in double overtime despite going on the man advantage once — a call for too many men on the ice — compared to 10 minutes of power-play time for the home side. The Oilers and Stars got one power play each through the first 58 minutes of Game 2 before a couple of late calls either way with the result all but decided. It’s stark contrast compared to Edmonton’s two previous series. The club scored six times off 18 man-advantage chances in the second round against the Vancouver Canucks after opening the playoffs 9-for-25 versus the Los Angeles Kings. The Oilers, who had the league’s fourth-best power play in the regular season, have dipped to a still-impressive 34.9 per cent success rate thanks to a 1-for-13 run dating back to Game 5 against Vancouver, but have only had those three opportunities in just over seven periods of conference final action. “We’ve got a very good power play and we win a lot of games on the power play,” Knoblauch continued in his measured answer. “It’s unfortunate for us that it’s tougher to draw penalties in the playoffs than it is the regular season.” Edmonton averaged four minutes 26 seconds of power-play time across 82 games in 2023-24, but have earned a total of just 4:42 in this series. “The standard’s the same for both teams,” Knoblauch added of the Stars matchup. “I’m not saying it’s unfair for us, but we would like the same standard (as the regular season).” Oilers defenceman Mattias Ekholm was less diplomatic when queried on the same topic in the visitors locker room at American Airlines Center late Saturday. “Great question,” he said. “I have no idea. I looked at (Edmonton defenceman Darnell Nurse’s) penalty, and then five minutes later I get cross-checked right in the same spot. It’s hard. It’s physical. It’s playoff hockey. “We need to work harder to draw more penalties.” Oilers forward Connor Brown pointed to the Stars’ discipline — Dallas has averaged a playoff-low three minutes short-handed per game this spring — as part of the equation. “They check with their feet,” he said. “But I think we can do a better job of holding onto the puck and creating some momentum so they’ve got to chase us around a little bit. “That’s usually when you get your calls.” The Stars have also largely done a good job at even strength against McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who sit 1-2 in post-season scoring. McDavid snagged Thursday’s double OT winner and Draisaitl had a goal and an assist, but both were held off the scoresheet in Game 2 — a first for the Oilers in these playoffs. Despite plenty of attention being paid to his two stars, Knoblauch pointed to the looks Edmonton’s dynamic duo are still getting on Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger. “I’d be a little bit alarmed if they weren’t getting their scoring chances,” he said. “But we’ll look at that. We had enough opportunities to score more than we did (in Game 2). “There’s going to be some tweaks we can make.” McDavid, Draisaitl and Co. will have to find a way through — especially if the referees continue to keep the whistles largely silent.

        "content": "Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. ON Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph (217 kph), officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.” Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. A DEADLY SERIES OF STORMS The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. HOMES DESTROYED, ROADS BLOCKED Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. MORE SEVERE WEATHER IN FORECAST The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "content": "Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles, his family said Sunday. The shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, told that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. A mask-wearing suspect opened fire, his mother said. Three suspects drove away from the scene, police said. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. There were no arrests as of late Sunday. Wactor’s agent, David Shaul, said the actor was “a real moral example to everyone who knew him.” “In the highs and lows of a challenging profession he always kept his chin up and kept striving for the best he could be,” Shaul said in a statement Sunday. “Our time with Johnny was a privilege we would wish on everyone. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. After over a decade together, he will leave a hole in our hearts forever.” Wactor portrayed Brando Corbin on the ABC soap opera from 2020 to 2022. He also appeared in a variety of films and TV series, including “Station 19,” “NCIS,” “Westworld” and the video game “Call of Duty: Vanguard.” The Associated Press",

        "description": "‘Sometimes the standard gets changed a little bit’: Knoblauch",
        "content": "Connor McDavid didn’t have an answer. His head coach, meanwhile, took a long, deliberate pause to ponder the same question — why haven’t the Oilers been able to draw penalties against the Dallas Stars in the NHL’s Western Conference final? “I’ve heard a lot about the past, being a spectator, not a part of the NHL, not as a coach ... sometimes the standard gets changed a little bit,” Edmonton bench boss Kris Knoblauch said of playoff officiating. “(Referees) would definitely want to make sure it’s a penalty, when in the regular season, maybe some things get let go. “That’s obviously unfortunate for us.” The Oilers and Stars sit tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series with a berth in the Stanley Cup final on the line following a 3-1 Dallas victory on Saturday. Edmonton took Thursday’s opener 3-2 in double overtime despite going on the man advantage once — a call for too many men on the ice — compared to 10 minutes of power-play time for the home side. The Oilers and Stars got one power play each through the first 58 minutes of Game 2 before a couple of late calls either way with the result all but decided. It’s stark contrast compared to Edmonton’s two previous series. The club scored six times off 18 man-advantage chances in the second round against the Vancouver Canucks after opening the playoffs 9-for-25 versus the Los Angeles Kings. The Oilers, who had the league’s fourth-best power play in the regular season, have dipped to a still-impressive 34.9 per cent success rate thanks to a 1-for-13 run dating back to Game 5 against Vancouver, but have only had those three opportunities in just over seven periods of conference final action. “We’ve got a very good power play and we win a lot of games on the power play,” Knoblauch continued in his measured answer. “It’s unfortunate for us that it’s tougher to draw penalties in the playoffs than it is the regular season.” Edmonton averaged four minutes 26 seconds of power-play time across 82 games in 2023-24, but have earned a total of just 4:42 in this series. “The standard’s the same for both teams,” Knoblauch added of the Stars matchup. “I’m not saying it’s unfair for us, but we would like the same standard (as the regular season).” Oilers defenceman Mattias Ekholm was less diplomatic when queried on the same topic in the visitors locker room at American Airlines Center late Saturday. “Great question,” he said. “I have no idea. I looked at (Edmonton defenceman Darnell Nurse’s) penalty, and then five minutes later I get cross-checked right in the same spot. It’s hard. It’s physical. It’s playoff hockey. “We need to work harder to draw more penalties.” Oilers forward Connor Brown pointed to the Stars’ discipline — Dallas has averaged a playoff-low three minutes short-handed per game this spring — as part of the equation. “They check with their feet,” he said. “But I think we can do a better job of holding onto the puck and creating some momentum so they’ve got to chase us around a little bit. “That’s usually when you get your calls.” The Stars have also largely done a good job at even strength against McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who sit 1-2 in post-season scoring. McDavid snagged Thursday’s double OT winner and Draisaitl had a goal and an assist, but both were held off the scoresheet in Game 2 — a first for the Oilers in these playoffs. Despite plenty of attention being paid to his two stars, Knoblauch pointed to the looks Edmonton’s dynamic duo are still getting on Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger. “I’d be a little bit alarmed if they weren’t getting their scoring chances,” he said. “But we’ll look at that. We had enough opportunities to score more than we did (in Game 2). “There’s going to be some tweaks we can make.” McDavid, Draisaitl and Co. will have to find a way through — especially if the referees continue to keep the whistles largely silent.

        "content": "Charles Leclerc is among the household names on the current F1 grid. However, making it into the top 20 drivers is a mountainous task. Speaking on it, the Monegasque driver reveals he would have become an architect if the motorsport route wasn’t successful. “Probably an architect,” when Jay Shetty asked Leclerc what if he had not been an F1 driver. “I love design in general, I wouldn’t have been a good enough artist. But definitely an architect, I love architecture, it’s another passion of mine.” Leclerc came from a humble background even though he was born in Monaco. He managed to continue with his motorsport aspirations when Nicolas Todt took him under his wing upon Jules Bianchi’s recommendation. Fortunately, Leclerc’s performances from karting to every Formula series had been outstanding, which gave him a quick rise. Therefore, his probable backup plan in architecture became redundant. In the interview, Leclerc further reveals that he left school early to focus on his racing career. And surely all the gamble for the same worked, with him becoming a Ferrari F1 driver. Although, the Monegasque still had a close connection to architecture in his personal life. Charles Leclerc’s ex-girlfriend is an architect From 2019 to 2022, Charles Leclerc dated Charlotte Sine, who was also from Monaco. In the beginning days of their relationship, Sine was an architecture student. Her LinkedIn profile claims that she has continued with the profession. So, probably it was a mutual interest between the two back then. Meanwhile, there is no clear reason why the couple got separated but Sine still seems to be a Ferrari supporter. Last Sunday, when Leclerc registered his win in Monaco, Sine was there to witness it, and subtly even celebrated the Ferrari win . Nevertheless, the win was indeed special for Leclerc who had a tough spell in Monaco in all these years with Ferrari. To celebrate his win, Leclerc dived into the sea and also pushed his team principal Fred Vasseur. The win surely would have boosted Ferrari’s confidence as they aim to challenge Red Bull’s ongoing reign.",

        "content": "The La Liga outfit will once again have to sell players to add to their squad during the upcoming transfer window and will do most of their business in the free agent market. Raphinha was one name Barca were believed to be open to selling given the rise of Lamine Yamal this season but it is now being reported by that the Spanish giants do not want to part ways with the Brazilian as they will struggle to find a replacement with the same quality. The report says that Barcelona rejected a €60m offer from an unknown Premier League club in January for the winger, while €80m offers from Saudi Arabian clubs were also turned down. Aston Villa and Chelsea are named as two clubs interested in bringing Raphinha back to the Premier League and a deal could be struck if an offer of over €60m arrives this summer. However, incoming Barca boss Hansi Flick will want to keep the 27-year-old, unless he is presented with the opportunity to sign a better player. Barcelona cannot afford to let Raphinha leave Despite the emergence of Lamine Yamal on the right wing at Barcelona, the Catalan club cannot afford to let top talents such as Raphinha leave given their financial situation heading into the summer transfer window. The Brazilian was a key member of Xavi’s squad towards the end of the campaign, producing plenty of goals and assists. The former Leeds star finished the campaign with 10 goals and 13 assists across 37 matches, with his ability to play on both flanks also being a big help to the La Liga giants. Keeping Raphinha is the right decision for Barca to make but can a club such as Chelsea tempt the Spanish outfit into selling with a large offer over the coming months?",

        "content": "MONTREAL — A Quebec judge is authorizing a class action from shareholders against Bombardier Inc. over claims that the plane maker presented a false picture of its financial situation in 2018, a turbulent year that saw its share price tank. The lawsuit alleges that Bombardier, then-CEO Alain Bellemare and then-chief financial officer John Di Bert failed to make timely disclosures of key facts around the company’s financial forecast. Filed in Quebec Superior Court by shareholder Denis Gauthier in 2019, the class action concerns investors who bought company stock between Aug. 2 and Nov. 8, 2018. In the months leading up to Nov. 8, the Montreal-based company said it was on track to achieve financial goals linked to its restructuring. But in its third-quarter results in November 2018, Bombardier announced it would cut 5,000 jobs and sell off two units, and reported free cash flow that sat “well below” expectations of breaking even without falling back on proceeds from a recent factory sale, according to one analyst at the time. Stock at Bombardier tumbled 23 per cent on that November day in 2018. Bombardier, which has since reinvented itself as a pure-play business jet manufacturer, says it may appeal the authorization by the court, which has not yet heard or ruled on the allegations.

The 22-year-old Italian centre back was one of the revelations of the season in Serie A, proving himself to be one of the most exciting defenders in the league as he helped the Emilia-Romagna outfit qualify for the Champions League. Calafiori is expected to be one of the hottest topics in the upcoming summer transfer window, attracting serious attention from Juventus director Cristiano Giuntoli. In the meantime, his coach Thiago Motta seems set to make the jump to the , ready to start a new project. Page 15 of today’s details how Bologna are hoping for around €25-30m for Calafiori, prompting Juventus to study ways to lower the overall costs of the deal. Their hope is to find an agreement soon to beat out competition from around Europe. The Old Lady are thinking about including two players as part of a player exchange, with Hans Nicolussi Caviglia and Tommaso Barbieri the candidates. Fabio Miretti, who is wanted by Monza, is also an idea.",

        "content": "PARIS, May 27 — This simple 10-minute test aims to measure the impact of digital media, of all kinds, on your mental health. Developed by a world-renowned American psychiatrist, this short test could help you limit your exposure to some of these media, including social networks, which are often singled out for their harmful effects on well-being. To what extent can social networks affect people’s mental health? This question is increasingly being addressed by the scientific community, which has been carrying out a growing amount of research on the subject over the past few years. In fact, users themselves believe that social media can influence their well-being, as revealed by several surveys conducted around the world. As part of a campaign to raise awareness of these harmful effects, the Dove brand, in collaboration with Mental Health Europe and the e-Enfance association, published the findings of a survey on the subject in April 2023. The study showed that almost one in two French teenagers aged 10 to 17 (45 per cent) was negatively affected by social media. Whether it’s stress, anxiety or lower self-esteem and self-confidence, many users are aware of these harmful effects, but are unable to give up social media. And while certain tools now make it easier to better control your exposure to digital media — notably by measuring the time spent each day on these platforms — it remains difficult to assess their real impact on well-being, and more broadly, on mental health. Robert Waldinger, a doctor of psychiatry and professor at Harvard University, intends to overcome this obstacle with a quick and simple test that’s available to all. After helming the longest scientific study ever carried out on happiness (over 85 years), the results of which are published in the book The Good Life , the American psychiatrist posted on his Instagram page , on May 10, inviting people to take 10 minutes to evaluate their relationship with social networks. It involves an easy-to-perform test that the specialist says can help you determine whether digital media are making you happy or, on the contrary, dragging you down. A post shared by Robert J Waldinger (@robert.waldinger) Professor Robert Waldinger invites those who wish to do so to engage in their usual activity on online platforms for 10 minutes. Once this initial step has been completed, the next step is to answer two questions: Do I have more or less energy than when I started this activity? Am I more open to the world and to others, or am I more inclined to withdraw into myself? The American psychiatrist explains that if you feel more energetic and open, then the activity in question is healthy for you. If not, he advises you to step back from it, or even drastically limit this type of digital activity. The specialist claims to have applied this method to himself in regard to the news. He explains that he always wants to know what’s going on around the world, but sinks into a state of depression when exposed to too much news. As a result, he now aims to limit such exposure. The test can be applied to traditional media, social networks and online games, among other forms of digital media. — ETX Studio",

        "content": "To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video A British tourist is said to be in a coma fighting for his life after a security guard at a bar in Thailand kicked him in the head. Video shared online shows the brutal attack, which happened on Friday evening at Helicopters Bar in the red light district of Pattaya following a dispute over a drinks bill. The bouncer, who has apologised for his actions, was working alongside two others when an argument broke out between the bar’s hostess and three British men. The hostess said the men insulted her when she told them some of their bill hadn’t been paid and refused to hand over any money, saying they were being scammed. She called security and CCTV shows the tourists settled their bill, but one of them then pushed one of the bouncers, causing a brawl to break out in the street. Footage shows three bouncers knocking two of the British men to the ground. One of the tourists is seen lying on the ground while raising his hands pleading for them to stop. A guard then takes a run-up and kicks the man in the head at full force. The Metro has decided not to show the part where he makes impact. The victim is seen lifeless on the ground for several minutes and witnesses claimed he was now in a coma in intensive care. Police said the guards had been warned about their conduct but not arrested as no one had filed a complaint. Sergeant Major Arthon from the Pattaya City police station said: ‘There’s no case open until they complain. We’ve had a look around but can’t find them. ‘Yes, we’re still checking CCTV to see what happened to them. There are rumours that he is in intensive care but we haven’t heard anything from hospitals.’ The bouncer who kicked the man in the head spoke on video saying: ‘We did not know the amount of the bill that the tourists did not pay. We arrived after being called by a cashier to protect her because she was afraid. ‘I want to apologise to society and Pattaya authorities for overdoing it by continuing to attack the tourists when they were down. I acted out of temper after being attacked first. ‘We work as part of a group of security guards. There are five of us and we are hired by 28 bars on the road.’ Bar hostess Samorn said that the three men had paid two sex workers to drink with them. She added: ‘Two of the tourists had paid their bills, but another had not and changed his seat several times. ‘I asked them to pay the bill, but the tourist in the white shirt argued that he had already paid. I explained that the money was the payment of someone who had not paid and not his own bill. ‘They insulted me and said the bar was trying to scam them, so I called the security over and told them the tourist would not pay his bill.’ Police Colonel Nawin Thirawit, superintendent of Pattaya Police Station, said that the bouncers’ actions had tarnished the image of Pattaya. They were invited to the police station and apologised for ‘damaging the image of the country’. The policeman said: ‘The security guards should have prevented the incident and reported it to the police.

Pattaya – once a quiet fishing village – is now known for its resorts, 24-hour clubs and red-light district. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk .

        "content": "Continuing the party’s attack on the government over the Agnipath scheme, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Monday said that it is against the interests of the country’s security and the future of the youth. He alleged that the scheme has compromised India’s defence capabilities against China. In a video statement released on X, Jairam Ramesh said that the scheme is “a compromise with the country’s security”. He said after the scheme was implemented by the Modi government, the number of youth being taken into armed forces has reduced to about a fourth of nearly 75,000 recruited earlier. He said the youth taken through the scheme are given training for six months and are sent to the borders. He claimed that the service chiefs had opposed the Agnipath scheme. Jairam Ramesh also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks at an all-party meeting in 2020 following border tensions with China and said these remarks had weakened India’s negotiating position. He said the “outgoing PM” will have to answer for the scheme after results of Lok Sabha polls on June 4. In the post on X accompanying his video statement, Jairam Rames alleged that the Agnipath scheme had been brought by the Prime Minister without any consultations. “It has compromised our capabilities against China,” he said. Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi have been raking up Agniveer scheme in their poll rallies. The Agnipath scheme was announced by the Centre in June 2022. It provides for recruiting soldiers for four years, with a provision to retain 25 per cent of them in regular service. Those recruited under the scheme are called ‘Agniveers’. The government has said there will be several job and other avenues open for the youth who are not retained in the defence forces after four years. Congress has said in its manifesto for Lok Sabha polls that it will “scrap the Agnipath Scheme and return to the normal recruitment processes followed by the Army, Navy and Air Force that will guarantee economic and social security for our soldiers”.

        "content": "PETALING JAYA, May 27 — Despite being beset by a series of injuries to key players, Harimau Malaya head coach Kim Pan Gon remains optimistic about fielding a quality lineup for the remaining two matches of Group D in the second round of the 2026 World Cup/2027 Asian Cup Qualifiers against Kyrgyzstan and Taiwan next month. Pan Gon said that he does not want to overly dwell on the injuries but instead prefers to focus on selecting other players capable of taking on the challenge of advancing the national team to the next stage of the competition. The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) previously announced a list of 23 players for the centralised training camp starting today, noting that key players like wingers Arif Aiman Mohd Hanapi and Mohamad Faisal Abdul Halim, as well as forward Romel Morales, have been sidelined due to injuries. “It’s a tough situation with Faisal Halim’s case, Arif Aiman’s injury, Morales’ ankle injury. Our attacking power has got problems and this is what we have at the moment but we still have other manpower. “I still believe all the other players have equal quality, maybe they have more motivation and this their time to prove it. However we will try to find the best fit and composition to prepare for the matches,” the South Korean coach said when met at the centralised training camp at Wisma FAM, Kelana Jaya here today. Star winger Faisal Halim was injured in an attack attack at a shopping mall in Petaling Jaya earlier this month and sufferred fourth-degree burns. He has undergone four surgeries and was recently discharged from a private hospital and is currently recuperating at home. The injury issue continued as another key player, Syafiq Ahmad, had to be dropped from the squad due to injury, as informed by FAM. Pan Gon, however, called up Kuala Lumpur City FC player Zhafri Yahya to fill the vacancy left by the Kedah Darul Aman FC player. After four matches, Malaysia, who are in third place in Group D with six points, will face Kyrgyzstan at Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, Bishkek, on June 6, before meeting Taiwan in the final match at the National Stadium, Bukit Jalil, here on June 11. Kyrgyzstan currently lead Group D, followed by Oman in second place, both with nine points a piece but the former with a superior goal difference. Both teams will meet in the final group match on June 11, while Taiwan are at the bottom without any points. Malaysia need three points in both of the remaining matches while hoping Oman defeat Kyrgyzstan to brighten their chances of making history by qualifying for the third round of the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers and securing an early spot in the 2027 Asian Cup. — Bernama",

        "content": "The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Monday, upheld the election that produced Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State. A three-man panel led by Justice Adekunle Adeleye dismissed the petition filed by the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Timipre Sylva, and the party for lacking in merit. In a unanimous decision, the tribunal held that the petitioners failed to prove any credible evidence to back up any of the allegations they raised against the re-election victory of Diri. It held that the prayers of the petitioners were contradictory, adding that Sylva and APC did not tender any electoral material to show that any irregularity occurred during the election. The tribunal also held that the petitioners were unable to discharge the burden of proof that was placed on them by the law. The panel said the petitioners failed to show, “polling units by polling units evidence of the non-compliance submitted and how it substantially affected the outcome of the election” The tribunal struck out as incompetent, all the additional proof of evidence as well as statements on oath of some of the witnesses that testified for the petitioners. The tribunal held that the law expressly states that “an election petition must be filed not later than 21 days after the result of an election has been declared”. It also stated that such a petition must be accompanied by written statements of all the intended witnesses at the time it was filed. The tribunal also held that some of the allegations in the petition contained elements of criminality that should be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The tribunal also upheld preliminary objections filed by the Respondents challenging the competence of the election. For the deputy governor, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, whom APC and Sylva claimed presented forged University degree certificates to the Independent National Electoral Commission, to enable him to qualify to run in the elections, the tribunal dismissed their claims. The tribunal held that the deputy governor’s educational qualification had already been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. It stated, “took judicial notice of the fact that the 3rd Respondent, Ewhrudjakpo, is a legal practitioner and for this reason, the tribunal is satisfied that he was eminently qualified to contest the election.” The tribunal held that Sylva and his party filed their additional proof of evidence and statement on oath of witnesses, long after they had filed the petition. Justice Adeleye held that this is “tantamount to a surreptitious attempt to amend the case of the petitioners.” He stated that Sylva and his party prayed it to declare that they were the valid winners of the governorship election meanwhile, they equally applied for the said election to be declared invalid. The tribunal concluded the delivery by dismissing the petitioners’ petition. The panel held that it found no reason to throw out the result of the election as announced by INEC. The tribunal said it was satisfied with evidence from INEC that the election did not hold in the disputed LGAs. It held that the petitioners did not tender any Voters Register, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, machine, or call witnesses to establish that results from the said LGAs were excluded during the collation process. “The result declared by INEC enjoys presumption of regularity and a party desirous to challenge the result must do so with convincing and credible evidence. None presentations of BVAS machines and Voters Register used for accreditation in the election proved fatal to the case of the petitioners. “I hold that the onus of proof of the positive assertion that valid election took place in the disputed 184 polling units in 57 wards, rests on the petitioners. I also hold that the margin of lead principle is not applicable in this case as the petitioners made contradictory prayers. “The petitioners, having failed to establish all the pleaded facts, I hold that this petition failed on all the three grounds that it was predicated upon. I hereby dismiss the petition as lacking in merit. Parties are to bear their respective costs,” the tribunal held,” the tribunal stated. Recall that INEC announced Diri of the PDP as the winner of Bayelsa gubernatorial elections with a total of 175,196 votes to defeat his closest rival, Sylva of the APC who scored 110,108 votes. Dissatisfied with the election result, Sylva approached the tribunal, to challenge the scores alleging irregularities. He claimed three Local Government Areas weren’t included by INEC, insisting that the governor and his deputy were not qualified at the time the election was held. He also said APC and the governor, did not secure the highest number of valid votes cast at the election. He contended that the election was invalid because of non-compliance with provisions of the Electoral Act, urging the tribunal to invalidate the Certificate of Return that was issued to Diri.",

        "description": "Cumberbatch said acting out 'every parent's worst nightmare' helped him work through the fear",
        "content": "A new psychological thriller starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a puppeteer exploring his son’s disappearance will land on Netflix this week. Eric has its backdrop in the chaos of 1980s New York, and follows Vincent, the creator of a popular children’s TV programme. Slowly, Vincent descends into a state of frenzied obsession after his son, Edgar, goes missing on the way to school, in what Cumberbatch told Metro is “every parent’s worst nightmare”. Vincent alienates those around him. He focuses on his creation, the eponymous Eric, a 7-foot-tall blue puppet whom he banks his hopes on bringing his son home, convinced if Eric makes an appearance on TV, he will be reunited with Edgar. Cumberbatch said the story, created by by Bafta and Emmy Award winner Abi Morgan ( The Hour , The Iron Lady , The Split ) is “about people finding their home”. “Whether it’s a child, a homeless person, a gay Black cop, a wife in an unhappy marriage, or even Eric on the show, it’s all about finding a place,” Cumberbatch said. Who is in the Eric cast? This isn’t Cumberbatch’s first mystery-solving rodeo, having starred in the hit series Sherlock as Arthur Conan Doyle’s household name detective. Leaving the Marvel Cinematic Universe and his lead role in Doctor Strange , Cumberbatch returns to the small screen as Victor, also executive producing the series. He described his character’s journey as a “huge odyssey to go on in six episodes”. “ He starts to bring home his vanity, his idiosyncrasies, his ego, and all kinds of toxic behaviour, which affects how he overlooks his kid and how abrasive he is in a marriage which has [already] had 10 years of pretty tumultuous moments of infidelity, arguing, and disconnection,” Cumberbatch said. Known for his starring role as Samuel Diggs in PBS series Mercy Street , Belcher also appeared in the Oscar-winning Marriage Story. DC Ledrroit seeks to hide his queerness with his long-term lover as he heads up the NYPD Missing Persons Department. Belcher said his character reckons with “challenging the norm and holding the NYPD, the system, and the people at large to a higher standard”. He added: “There’s a whole lot of power in deciding to act, standing on your own two feet and saying ‘No’.” Best known for the iconic rom-com Sleepless in Seattle , alongside Tom Hanks, Hoffman started out as a child actor back in the 1980s with Uncle Buck. Wife to Vincent, and mother to Edgar, Cassie is victim to an abrasive marriage with a man loosing control. Hoffman said Cassie is in a moment of “desperation”. She added: “Where I understand Cassie to be when we first meet her is somebody who has let herself become trapped in a life that is ultimately not serving her because she thinks it’s what’s best for her son. “It’s terrifying to leave a marriage and a nuclear family life, but she is screaming to get out of it.” Cumberbatch said he grew very fond of his on-screen son, saying: “I felt protective towards him, loving towards him, but also marvelled at how the camera just ate up how natural he was and how effective he was.” Howe plays Edgar, a boy who is quiet and deeply withdrawn from the world around him, and becomes the centre of the story as the other characters grapple with his disappearance. Other cast members include... Where was Eric filmed? The majority of Eric ‘s scenes are filmed in Manhattan, New York City. However, there were some additional filming locations in Budapest, Hungary. How many episodes are there? This series has been announced as a limited six-episode run, meaning there are currently no plans for a second season. The series will premiere on Thursday, 30 May, with each episode available and ready to watch on Netflix at launch.",

        "description": "Christian Karembeu who grew up on the island of Lifou in New Caledonia, moved to France as a teenager and went on to win two Champions League titles with Real Madrid as a midfielder.",
        "content": "Former football player Christian Karembeu, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, says two of his relatives have been killed during the unrest in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia that has left seven people dead. Speaking during an interview with radio on Monday, the former Real Madrid midfielder said his two relatives were shot in the head by snipers. “I’ve lost family members, that’s why I’ve kept quiet,” Karembeu said. “Because I’m in mourning.” Asked if these were assassinations, Karembeu replied, “I didn’t want to, because the word is strong, but ... it’s true that, yes, it’s an assassination and we hope that there will be inquiries and investigations into these murders.” French President Emmanuel Macron decided on Monday to lift the state of emergency that was imposed earlier this month. Deadly violence erupted in the French Pacific territory after protests kicked off against the French government’s attempts to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia, where pro-independence Indigenous Kanaks have long pushed to be free of France, amid sharp economic disparities. Karembeu, who is Kanak, grew up on the island of Lifou in New Caledonia. After moving to France as a teenager, he went on to win two Champions League titles with Madrid as a midfielder. He started for France in the 1998 World Cup final and was also part of the team that won the 2000 European Championship. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon’s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Karembeu’s great-grandparents were shipped to Paris in 1931 from the French Pacific territory and exhibited as “cannibals.” Comments Related stories Related Topics",

SVB Capital, which was not included in the sale of SVB’s lending and wealth management units to North Carolina-based First Citizens Bank, has continued to manage approximately $9.8 billion in assets for its limited partners under its parent company. Now, it is in the final stages of being purchased by a new entity backed by Brookfield and Sequoia Heritage. This deal, however, is still subject to bankruptcy court approval. Don't Miss: A startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban and opens a round for regular investors at $250. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible . Court documents filed on May 2 indicate that the sale will be executed for an upfront cash price of $340 million and a termination fee of $15 million. The transaction marks a significant step in the aftermath of SVB’s collapse, potentially providing a stable future for SVB Capital and its stakeholders. Earlier in January of this year, the company announced that retaining the SVB Capital business as a part of SVB Financial Group would result in superior value-creation opportunities. \"We believe that retaining SVB Capital under a reorganized company is the best path forward to maximize its value in the current environment,\" said William Kosturos, Chief Restructuring Officer of SVB Financial Group. \"SVB Financial Group and its creditors recognize the strong foundation on which SVB Capital has been built, thanks largely to Aaron, Sulu and Beau’s outstanding leadership and partnership, with the significant support and contributions of the entire SVB Capital team. Trending: Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today? Aaron, Sulu and Beau’s vision for the future of this business is closely aligned with our creditor group, and all parties are focused on preserving the value of the business, meeting obligations to partners and positioning the platform to capitalize on future opportunities.\" However, it is now evident that the company believes that selling the fund is a better way forward. SVB Capital invests in fund managers and private technology and life science companies throughout the innovation economy worldwide. The successful sale of SVB Capital will ensure a more secure and prosperous future for its investment operations and the broader financial community. SVB’s downfall a year ago sent shock waves through the financial community, highlighting the vulnerabilities in the banking sector’s exposure to interest rate risks. Since its acquisition, the company has recovered and continues working with startups to regain its trust.

        "content": "Chelsea are holding talks to make Leicester’s Enzo Maresca their new head coach, according to British media reports. The Italian, who until last year was Pep Guardiola’s assistant at English champions Manchester City, has overseen an immediate return to the Premier League for the Foxes following their relegation 12 months ago. His style of football is also said to have impressed Chelsea chiefs, with Sky Sports reporting Monday the Blues had asked Leicester for permission to speak directly to Maresca, whom they added was the London club’s preferred choice. READ ALSO: Pochettino Leaves Chelsea After Just One Season In Charge Chelsea are on the hunt for a new manager after parting company with Mauricio Pochettino. He spent just one season in charge at Stamford Bridge, with Brentford’s Thomas Frank and Kieran McKenna, who led Ipswich to top-flight promotion behind Leicester, also linked with the vacancy. Pochettino left after a late surge resulted in Chelsea finishing sixth in the Premier League — qualifying for the Europa Conference League — but missed out on Champions League qualification and a trophy. Chelsea lost the League Cup final 1-0 to Liverpool after extra-time and pushed Manchester City all the way before losing in the FA Cup semi-finals by the same score. But there had been signs former Tottenham manager Pochettino’s project was coming together during a run of five consecutive wins to end the campaign that ensured Chelsea will be involved in European competition next season.

        "content": "King Charles, who's performing his royal duties efficiently while receiving cancer treatment, has expressed his shock and sadness in new heart-wrenching statement. The 75-year-old, who's already in tense about his tow sons' ongoing feud, has deeply felt the pain of survivors and the families who lost their loved ones in the devastating landslide in Papua New Guinea. The royal family's social media accounts shared the King's heartfelt statement with the caption: \"A message from The King.\" The King wrote: \"My wife and I was deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the devastating landslide in Enga, and the tragic loss of so many lives, homes and food gardens.\" King Charles stated: \"I have witnessed at first hand and have great admiration for the extraordinary resilience of the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands. Prince William and Harry's father added: \"I have faith that your communities will come together to support the survivors and the recovery in these heartbreaking circumstances. \"My Wife joins me in sending our most heartfelt condolences to the families and communities who have suffered so much as a result of this appallingly traumatic event.\" The King's message comes amid reports of Harry and William's ongoing feud - which, according to some royals experts and insiders, deepens as the two royal brothers are not ready to bury the hatchet.",

The delivery vans are also stocked with non-perishable food. As it's able, CAA Atlantic hopes to expand this initiative to other deserving food banks across Atlantic Canada. CAA Atlantic purchased its first EV in the spring of 2019 and since then, with the help of partner Next Ride from the Clean Foundation, CAA Atlantic has offered test drives and education for those considering transitioning to an EV. \"It's not a matter of if our members go electric, it's when,\" says Dalley. \"We will be there for them when they make that transition.\" CAA Atlantic's light service fleet is almost 100% hybrid or electric, which only one vehicle left to transition in 2025.

        "content": "MADRID (Reuters) -A Spanish judge ordered soccer ruling bodies FIFA and UEFA to halt their opposition to a parallel European competition known as the European Super League (ESL), ruling they were practising anticompetitive behaviour and abusing their dominant position. Judge Sofia Gil Garcia ruled that the governing bodies violated European Union law by banning clubs from participating in a proposed new professional soccer championship, a court statement said on Monday. In the ruling, Gil Garcia also ordered FIFA and UEFA to immediately reverse any anticompetitive actions committed in the past. The case was brought by A22 Sports Management, the sports development company behind the plan to create the ESL, against the Spanish Soccer Federation, Spain's LaLiga, UEFA and FIFA, who had blocked the ESL. \"The era of the monopoly is now definitively over,\" A22 CEO Bernd Reichart said in a statement after the ruling, calling it \"an important step towards a truly competitive and sustainable club football landscape in Europe\". Reichart added that UEFA had stifled innovation for decades and clubs \"should not have to fear threats of sanctions simply for having ideas and conversations\". Gil Garcia's ruling followed a similar decision by the European Court of Justice in December. Both La Liga and UEFA insisted the ruling did not explicitly support the creation of the Super League. \"The judgment does not give third parties the right to develop competitions without authorisation and does not concern any future project or indeed any modified version of an existing project,\" UEFA said in a statement. The proposal in 2021 of a breakaway league by Europe's 12 leading clubs sparked widespread protests among fans and threats of sanctions by UEFA, leading nine of them to pull out. A22 had said UEFA and FIFA held a monopolistic position that breached the EU's Competition and Free Movement Law. The ECJ ruled against UEFA and FIFA, though it did not comment specifically on whether the ESL could go ahead. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and nine other top European clubs announced the plan in April, 2021. The move collapsed within 48 hours, however, after a public outcry that forced Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid to withdraw.

Qatar warned that the strikes could jeopardize renewed mediation efforts for a truce and a hostage release deal. Catherine Russell , executive director of UNICEF, expressed profound shock at the images of burned children and families emerging from bombed tents in Rafah. In her remarks on social media, she described the reported killing of children sheltering in makeshift tents as “unconscionable” and called for “an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and an end to the senseless killing of children.” So far, there have been no reactions from top U.S. officials, including President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken . Israel stated that the airstrike targeted a Hamas compound, eliminating two commanders. However, Israel's top military lawyer, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer Yerushalmi, called the airstrike “very grave” and confirmed an ongoing investigation. Border Shooting Incident Raises Israel-Egypt Tension: The Israeli military confirmed a “shooting incident on the Egyptian border” earlier today.

        "content": "In an effort to curtail unemployment and crime rates due to joblessness among the youths, a cleric and the founder of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Grace of Mercy Prayer Mountain International Ministry, also known as Adamimogo Global Outreach, Prophet Sam Olu-Alo, has expressed his determination to facilitate numerous investment opportunities to enable the youths in Ekiti State and the country at large to be meaningfully engaged for a better future. This is as he declared that the provision of job opportunities for the Youth cannot be left in the hands of the government alone, hence the need for philanthropists to step up and make contributions for the benefit of the nation and humanity at large. The Cleric gave the assurance that he would always complement government efforts in providing job opportunities for the teeming youths in the society. He however expressed dissatisfaction over what he described as unpatriotic acts of some politicians and wealthy Nigerians on failure to assist unemployed youths and poor masses. He specifically accused the power brokers of uncomplimentary attitudes to the nation’s development. The Cleric spoke at the weekend in his country home Ido-Ekiti Ido- Osi local government area of Ekiti state at the official commissioning of Adamimogo 107.7 FM. The Prophet who said he was not privileged to go to school, said he had once spent three months at the Prayer Mountain in Erio-Ekiti without having the opportunity to change the only clothes he was wearing on the mountain, but now he is an employer of labour. He explained the reason behind the establishment of the new radio station, Adamimogo FM in Ekiti “As of last year October, I didn’t have the plan of building this radio station. Since, the monarch, Olojudo said he wanted a similar thing done in Ido-Ekiti, I didn’t hesitate because I so much love the town, and that’s where the vision of Adamimogo 107.7 FM Ido-Ekiti started”. Olu-Alo stated that the land on which the structure was erected was allocated to him by the monarch and his wife, the foundation was laid on 5th December 2023 and launched in May 2024 which signified the radio station was built within just six months. “With the number of people working in all the Adamimogo establishments, I know my life has impacted many people positively. Having the station in Ido-Ekiti will also boost the economy of the town and also more talents will be discovered.” In addition, Prophet Sam Olu-Alo promised to establish a modern piggery where at least twenty thousand pigs would be exported from Ekiti. He’s also proposing to have Palm tree plantations where about two hundred people will be working. He therefore sought for 300 hectares of farmlands from three different towns, at least one hundred hectares from each town for rearing different animals and other plantations which will no doubt improve the Internally Generated Revenue, IGR and bring more development to the state. He declared he wouldn’t mind if a town is ready to release the 300 hectares of land for the purpose. He said, “Kidnapping cases are very rampant in Nigeria because the bushes that ought to have been cleared and cultivated have remained thick forests. They are just there useless without yielding any profit to the country. That’s why everyone is hungry. Maize and cassava will also be planted in those farmlands for the benefit of the people. The prophet charged the present politicians with patriotism and to also emulate the antecedents of the past leaders. “People like the Late Awolowo is a Hero. The impacts he made are what today’s politicians are building upon. Many of our Southwest Politicians extraction of today are only professing to follow his footsteps but their lifestyles do not reflect what he did while he was alive. Awolowo’s contributions such as the University structures he built are still standing without falling or showing any cracks in the walls unlike the projects we see our politicians being executed today” He added that “there is a wide difference between the rich and a hero. He described a hero as someone who always does things that will last and speak even after his or her death”. He berated the attitude of the Nigerian politicians and wealthy people on selfishness without showing any gesture to assist the poor masses and the unemployed youths in the society. He stressed that the rich people in Nigeria have failed the country. “Our money which has been stuck abroad is too much. If such money is used to establish businesses in the Country, life would have been easier for the people”. He advised President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, not to take the support of Nigerians for granted as people battle tough economic hardship He also urged the President to appoint patriotic people as aides and do away with the unpatriotic ones, adding that the President should prioritize unity rather than religion or tribe with prayers for a successful administration. The State Commissioner for Information, Chief Taiwo Olatunbosun, represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Pastor Sesan Alabi noted that Ido-Ekiti is the second town in the State with a radio station aside from the State capital, Ado-Ekiti. The Commissioner said that the establishment of the radio station is part of the fulfilment of Ekiti State Governor, Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji’s shared prosperity agenda. “Can you imagine the number of people that will be employed in this station? The bricklayers, the carpenters, the people who fixed windows and the people who fixed the lights. All of them got the job because this station is here.” While assuring the station of government cooperation like all other stations in the State, the Commissioner said whatever the government can do to provide security and an enabling environment for the station shall be done, not only to the electronic media but also all other media in the State. “Ekiti State subscribes to freedom of information, freedom of speech. We have never gagged any press. We allow every station to follow their own agenda and we cooperate with them. “Rather than sanction any untoward news, we counter with our beautiful news. Gagging the press is not part of the Ekiti State government’s agenda. We shall continue to partner with all the stations towards proper information management ” Earlier, the Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in Ekiti, Kayode Babatuyi expressed great delight over the establishment of the new radio station in the State considering the high rate of unemployment in Nigeria. According to him, “Today, we are gradually having vacancies in the media sector because of people like Prophet Sam Olu-Alo. I am happy to appreciate our daddy because I have a lot of my members who have been employed by the Prophet and today, they are doing well. “Not just because they have been given employment alone but because they have also been given a better welfare package that is not comparable anywhere in Nigeria. The event was attended by religious leaders, royal fathers, media practitioners, friends/ family of the founder, Prophet Sam Olu-Alo and people from all walks of life.",

        "content": "Domino’s is now injecting pineapple and mozzarella right into your pizza crust for those who like a Hawaiian pie. Those who want to try this bizarre creation will have to travel to do so though, because, for the moment, it’s only available in Japan for a limited time. has weighed in on the age-old debate that has divided people for decades – Does pineapple belong on pizza? It seems that Domino’s has chosen a side in this debate, because their new pineapple crust is filled with cheese and pineapple sauce. They have also launched a faux-election, in which fans can vote on this topic once and for all, and to celebrate, they’ve also launched two pineapple-heavy pizzas. pairs the pineapple crust with the following four pizza combinations: Tropical, spicy, garlic master, Korean short ribs. is aimed at die-hard pineapple lovers, as it contains the following four pizza combos: Ham and pineapple, ham, pineapple, and jalapeño, beef short ribs and pineapple, and pineapple, smoked bacon and BBQ sauce. If you still can’t decide on what side of the debate you stand, you can also get tropical cheese twist bread that comes with a pineapple dipping sauce. And to quench that all down, go for the premium tropical coconut shake that tastes like a piña colada. This pizza crust was teased in Canada on April Fools’ Day, but the caption read – “Available for a limited time, like, very, very limited...like, never.” Japan is taking this well past the prank stage though, and their pineapple stuffed crust also contains coconut shavings.... Coconut on pizza has the potential to cause an even bigger debate than the pineapple one, but Domino’s says it was included during the testing phase of this menu to get the pineapple flavour just right. Whether you love pineapple or not, it’s definitely a bold new product that’s set to cause debate. If you really want to weigh-in, you can even vote at voting booths in Domino’s stores in Tokyo.

        "description": "Starmer won't win by behaving like a grumpy fellow on an allotment site, pointing at problems",
        "content": "Another day, another speech from Keir Starmer about his father being a toolmaker . It’s almost as if the Labour leader thinks that no one has been paying attention to him up to this point and that now, with an election campaign properly under way, he needs to introduce himself to the British public. Anyone who has been around Westminster for the past few years could have written Starmer’s speech today themselves: pebbledash semi, working class parents and so on. But anyone who has been around Westminster is, quite frankly, not at all normal. The Labour leader has a 21-point lead in the polls , but has spent months warning colleagues that this could evaporate in a campaign. He also knows from polling that this lead is currently driven by a desire to boot out the Tories, not excitement about Labour. One recent poll commissioned by Charlesbye Strategy found that 51 per cent of those intending to back Labour agreed the most with the statement that “I will be voting to get rid of a Conservative government”, with just 28 per cent agreeing that Labour has “the best vision for the country”. Starmer wanted to use his address in Lancing to reassure voters firstly that he understands what it is to be normal and to worry about bills and the future. He did so by talking about his background, about how his parents had chosen which bill to pay on time when money was tight, and let their phone line be cut off instead. Though he did not do this today, Labour will make a number of personal attacks on Rishi Sunak’s private wealth during the campaign. It needs to scotch the (still quite pernicious) belief cropping up in focus groups that “Sir” Keir Starmer holds his knighthood because he was posh (hence the pebbledash semi). Read Next I completely underestimated Keir Starmer Starmer also explained that Labour’s priorities are “economic security, border security, national security”. None of these are an exciting and unusual vision for the country, but they are the basics that, if missing, can lose an election. Labour knows that painfully well, given it lost the 2015 election because voters didn’t believe it would provide economic security, and 2017 and 2019 because of fears about national security. The 2019 Labour campaign was exciting and the manifesto the political equivalent of Toys “R” Us, groaning under endless retail pledges. The Labourites who are still fighting that war continue to argue that their policies were popular with the public, without acknowledging that voters nevertheless didn’t believe the party could deliver on all these promises. The party hadn’t sorted the boring details that would earn it a hearing from voters. Starmer is getting that boring bit sorted now, launching his campaign with his focus on security. But at some stage, he will need to offer some sense of excitement so that voters bother turning out for Labour, and that the Tories and other parties don’t squeeze his poll lead. So far, the Conservatives seem more surprised that there is an election campaign than Labour does, but the chaos in the other party can’t be the main driver of support for Labour. Voters need to want to support the party as much as they feel they have to reject the Tories. Starmer’s comfort zone is pointing out the way in which the Tories have messed things up. He has had ample opportunity to do that over the past four years of his leadership. He has barely had to lift a finger to look for messes. His allies still say that he just needs to be better than Sunak, not a total rockstar politician. That’s not quite right: Labour needs a huge swing to win a majority. It won’t happen just as a result of voters feeling comfortable that the party won’t shaft them on the big things. It won’t happen just because Starmer is good at pointing at problems and explaining how he’d have fixed them properly, like a grumpy fellow on an allotment site. The vision bit is still lacking, and because Starmer has had to U-turn on some of his own policy offers such as free tuition fees, he has ended up sounding very cautious indeed. Voters are only just tuning in. Many of them won’t pay attention for another few weeks, and they need primary colours from the parties, not detailed biographies of life in Oxted. By the time the electorate is listening, Starmer needs to be right in the middle of painting out the thing that he spoke about today, “the basic ordinary hope that Britain will be better for your children”. He can let the Tories carry on messing up all the way to polling day: the problem that he now needs to fix is his own one.",

The Classic is my go-to for most sleepers because it's well-built, customizable, and relatively affordable for a luxury mattress. Right now a queen Saatva Classic is $1,695 at Saatva , down from $2,095. That's $100 cheaper than you'd pay in Saatva's general Memorial Day mattress sale and a good price for a handcrafted hotel-quality mattress. The Saatva Classic comes in three comfort levels (Plush Soft, Luxury Firm, or Firm) and two height options (11.5\" or 14.5\"), and is the best mattress of the year for most sleepers. Saatva Classic Mattress at Saatva Was: From $1,395 Now: From $995 Savings: $400 off all sizes at Saatva Summary: The all-rounder Saatva Classic is my most recommended mattress because you can customize it to be as firm or tall as you want it. While variable firmness is a fairly standard perk among even boxed mattresses, it's less common to find a bed with multiple height choices. Being able to choose the height of your mattress can be helpful if you're a shorter (or taller) individual and/or struggle with mobility issues due to injury. (By the way, the Saatva Classic has fantastic edge support, as well.) Since it's primarily made of coils, the Saatva Classic won't retain as much heat, either, making it a great pick for anyone prone to sleeping hot. My only word of caution would be to expect some motion transfer as there isn't much foam to help offset that. The chiropractor-approved design features specialized lumbar support, which also earns it a spot among our best mattresses for back pain . And if you're wondering how well it withstands daily use, we slept on the Luxury Firm version for one year in our Saatva Classic mattress review . Price history: While this isn't the lowest price we've seen for the Saatva Classic, it's still a good deal and less than you'd pay during the general Saatva mattress sale going on right now. For Black Friday 2023, a queen Saatva Classic dipped to $1,595 after a $400 discount due to a lower MSRP. While we could see a return to that lower price in the lead-up to Black Friday 2024, there's no need to sit this deal out if you need a new mattress ASAP. Benefits: 365-night trial | Lifetime warranty | Free White Glove Delivery with mattress and foundation removal Saatva offers a generous 365-night sleep trial so you can try your mattress out at home for a full year. (You do have to pay $99 to send it back, though.) However, if you're like most shoppers, you'll want to look at a mattress up close before you decide to buy. If you're fortunate to live near one of the 18 Saatva Viewing Room locations across the US, you can do just that. When I visited the Saatva Viewing Room in Philadelphia , I was able to try every Saatva mattress available, including the Saatva Classic. Saatva Viewing Rooms are largely self-guided, with informational kiosks at every mattress display. However, Saatva Sleep Guides are on the premises to answer any questions you may have. There's no pressure, though – Saatva Sleep Guides don't work on commission.",

        "content": "High River, Alberta, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — With care at the core of everything it does at Western Financial Group, this year’s National Walk saw nearly 90% of its team members across Canada donning their Western Communities Foundation t-shirts, getting together with colleagues, partners and community members to walk to raise funds and awareness for local charities. “Western has a history of taking care of our people, and the people who live and work in the communities we serve,” said Kenny Nicholls, Western Financial Group’s President and CEO. “We’re there to help pick up the pieces when things go wrong, and we want to share in the joy when things go right. We share this philosophy with our team members, who use it as a foundation of service with our customers. It only makes sense for us to extend those values to our wider communities.” For every team member who participates in the 5km walk, Western Financial Group makes a $50 donation to support the charities that matter to our people. To honour Western’s people-first culture and understand that staff have different scheduling needs, this year’s National Walk was held over a week (May 20-24) rather than one dedicated day. This allowed Canada’s insurance broker to give greater flexibility for more people to participate. Teams walked together from their local branch, remote individuals walked in their own neighbourhoods, or even staff on holiday took the time to put in 5kms in new surroundings. The ultimate goal was to make the walk as easy, accessible and flexible as possible to encourage participation. “It’s incredible to see the spirit of giving back and the passion our people have for taking care of our communities,” said Michelle Mak, Director, Western Communities Foundation. “Western has held this annual walk since 2005. It’s become a company mainstay; team members are excited to take part and they’re really passionate about the charities we’re supporting.” Employees from coast to coast took to social media with photos of their walk experiences. From scenic trails to city streets, Western’s team showcased their spirit and dedication. Check out Western’s and pages for more. Headquartered in High River, Alberta, Western Financial Group is a diversified insurance services company focused on creating security and peace of mind and has provided over one million Canadians with the proper protection for over 100 years. Western is committed to community service, customer service, innovation, growth, and people while providing personal and business insurance through our engaged team of over 2,000 people in over 200 locations, affiliates, and various connected channels. Since the very beginning, supporting our local communities has guided everything we do – it’s who we are. In 2001, the Western Financial Group Communities Foundation (our non-profit charity) was created as a way for our team members to give back and positively impact the people and pride in the places where we live, work and play – to date we have invested over $9 million back into our communities. Western Financial Group is a subsidiary of Trimont Financial Ltd., a subsidiary of The Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company. Founded in 2001, the Western Financial Group Communities Foundation serves to give back to the communities where Western employees live and work and play, and foster employee pride and engagement. The Foundation’s core donation programs include community Infrastructure Grants, the Western Inspirational Awards for graduating high school students, and the Matching Grants Program. Since its inception, the Western Communities Foundation has given back more than $9 million to support local communities.",

        "content": "Pilots of the “Sharp Kartuza” division of FPV kamikaze drones prepare drones for a combat flight on May 16, 2024 in the Kharkiv region, 8 km from the border with Russia. Libkos | Getty Images News | Getty Images Six NATO countries neighboring Russia are joining forces to build a “drone wall” to protect their borders, Lithuania’s interior minister announced on Friday. “This is a completely new thing, a drone wall stretching from Norway to Poland, and the goal is to use drones and other technologies to protect our borders,” Lithuanian Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite said in an interview with local news agency BNS. “Not only with physical infrastructure, surveillance systems, but also with drones and other technologies, which would allow us to protect against provocations from unfriendly countries and to prevent smuggling,” she said. The other states taking part are Lithuania’s Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia, as well as Poland, Finland, and Norway. Details such as funding, timeline and technical aspects of the project were not provided, but Bilotaite said EU funds could play a role and that each country had to do its “homework.” In an interview with Finnish television channel Yle, cited by the Financial Times, Finland’s Interior Minister Mari Rantanen said that the drone wall plan would “improve in time.” Finland, which joined NATO in 2023, shares an 832-mile border with Russia. The interior ministers of the six countries taking part in the drone wall project met in the Latvian capital of Riga on May 23 and 24. They discussed security threats as well as the issue of non-military tactics such as “instrumentalized migration”, citing past instances where Russia or Belarus sent masses of undocumented asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East over their borders. “Our goal is to ensure that Finland has effective means to tackle situations where instrumentalized migration is used to put pressure on Finland,” Rantanen said in a statement during the event. “The phenomenon of instrumentalized migration on the EU’s external borders is a common challenge for our countries. Finland also aims to find EU-level solutions to combat this phenomenon.”",

        "content": "Thousands of anti-tourism protesters paraded through Majorca’s streets this weekend, jeering at foreign visitors in what is just the first of many planned demonstrations by activist groups. An estimated 15,000 locals joined the protest that wound through the capital, Palma, eventually reaching Weyler Square, where tourists were enjoying dinner and drinks. Marchers chanted “Tourists go home” and carried banners with messages like “Salvem Mallorca, guiris arruix,” which means “Let’s save Majorca, foreigners out” in Catalan. The protest was organized by Banc del Temps, a group from Sencelles, which is upset about locals struggling to afford homes due to high prices driven by holiday rentals. After the protest, Banc del Temps spokesman Javier Barbero warned that this was just the beginning and that they would continue protesting until action is taken. Another campaign group praised the protest organizers as heroes and demanded urgent government action. They called for a meeting with Balearic Islands’ government president Marga Prohens to present their demands. These include a proposal that only people who have lived in the Balearic Islands for five years should be able to buy property. Mother-of-three Patri Vecina shared her story of being forced to move out of her rented home after the landlord decided to sell the property to foreigners. She highlighted the difficulties locals face in affording homes due to the high prices driven by tourism. The spike in property prices has been attributed to foreign investors turning family homes into holiday rentals. Laura Lau from Banc del Temps emphasized the need for awareness and government regulation to address the housing crisis in Majorca. Teacher Marga Gari expressed concerns about the high cost of living driven by tourism, making it difficult for her children to afford their own homes. She called for limits on the number of planes, cruise ships, and rental cars to reduce the impact of tourism on local life. This weekend’s protest in Majorca was the largest since last month’s demonstrations in the Canary Islands. In Ibiza, around 1,000 protesters gathered to express their frustration with mass tourism and its effects on the island. Anti-tourist graffiti has appeared in both Majorca and Tenerife. Some foreign holidaymakers have shown support for the issues raised by campaigners, while others accuse them of biting the hand that feeds them. Campaign groups are planning more radical protests, including potential mass gatherings outside hotels or at iconic beaches. There is also talk of an airport protest to disrupt tourism during the peak season.",

        "content": "One game was the difference-maker for the top spot in this week's ESPN WNBA Power Rankings. And for the first time in over 650 days, a team other than the or is No. 1. The beat the 83-82 in overtime Tuesday. Combined with the Aces' loss to the , Connecticut -- the lone unbeaten team in the WNBA -- moves to the No. 1 spot. The top two teams in our preseason rankings -- the 2023 champion Aces and runner-up Liberty -- have lost home games already, which few would have predicted. Chelsea Gray's absence (foot injury) is one of the things that has kept the Aces from being their best, while the Liberty have looked really good at times -- and really out of sync other times. The Sun have proved they don't have to be atop any particular statistical category to top the WNBA standings. But the categories they lead -- free throws made (20.6 per game) and attempted (24.6) -- illustrate how aggressive the Sun are. The Lynx, meanwhile, have won every other game this season. Minnesota leads the league in field goals made (33.0), field goal percentage (47.0), 3-point percentage (38.6), assists (24.4) and steals (11.8). And that helps make Wednesday's Lynx-Aces matchup in Minneapolis one of the most anticipated games of this week. Las Vegas or New York ranked first every week of ESPN's 2023 Power Rankings. Up until this week, the are the most recent team outside of the Aces or Liberty to lead the rankings, in August 2022, the final week of that regular season. | 3 vs. PHO (May 28), vs. DAL (May 31), @ ATL (June 2) Nothing stopped the Sun last week. They held off upset-minded Indiana by four points, beat surging Minnesota by one in overtime and then got past Chicago on the road by four, despite star being ejected in the third quarter after a hard foul on Sky rookie . led Connecticut with a combined 61 points in the three victories, which included the winning free throws in the OT victory. 4 vs. LV (May 29), vs. PHO (May 31), vs. DAL (June 2) It's not too late to play!

The Lynx were a basket away from the top spot in the Power Rankings, but they suffered a tough 83-82 overtime loss at Connecticut on Thursday. But despite that defeat and the indefinite loss of second-year player (knee injury), Minnesota's top draft pick last season, the Lynx got back-to-back wins Saturday (New York) and Sunday (Atlanta). had a big day Sunday with 31 points, making her first nine shots from the field. joined the Lynx after finishing her overseas season; she had eight points and eight rebounds in the weekend games. This week brings a big three-game homestand. 1 at MIN (May 29), at ATL (May 31) The Aces lost just one regular-season home game last year, plus the Commissioner's Cup final. Both of those were in August. So we weren't expecting an Aces loss in Las Vegas so early in the 2024 season. But the Aces' defense let them down in Tuesday's 98-88 loss to Phoenix. Coach Becky Hammon said it would be a good wake-up call for the two-time defending champions, and they responded Saturday with a blowout win over Indiana. After starting with four consecutive home games, the Aces play four of their next five on the road. Check out the top fantasy players in the WNBA on Saturday, including big performances from A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and Arike Ogunbowale. 9 @ CON (May 31), @ MIN (June 2) Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers. • • • The Wings made a big jump in the Power Rankings by winning two of three on the road last week. They started with a loss at Atlanta on Tuesday but bounced back with weekend victories at Phoenix and Los Angeles. Guard scored 24, 40 and 20 points in the three games. Her 19-point fourth quarter against the Mercury is the highest-scoring quarter this season by a WNBA player. Second-year pro also had her two best back-to-back games: vs. the Mercury (22 points, 9 rebounds) and Sparks (15 points, 8 rebounds). And is making the Sparks regret waiving her just before the start of the season. She had 18 points, 12 rebounds and 4 assists against Los Angeles and is averaging 15.3 PPG and 8.5 RPG. 5 @ CON (May 28), @ NY (May 29), @ MIN (May 31), vs. LA (June 2) Tuesday's victory at Las Vegas was the Mercury's highlight last week. The biggest frustration? Giving up 107 points at home in Saturday's loss to Dallas. Kahleah Copper leads the WNBA at 29.2 PPG, and seems to have turned back the clock a bit as she's at 19.0 PPG. The Mercury eagerly await the return of center from a toe injury, but overall, they've had a good start without her. 2 vs. PHO (May 29), vs. WAS (May 31), vs. IND (June 2) After a 4-0 start to the season, the Liberty had a rough week. They lost at home to Chicago and at Minnesota. New York was outrebounded in both games, while was held to single-digit scoring in each while shooting 38.5% overall. For as good as the Liberty have looked at some points this season, they really don't seem in sync at others. Maybe three games at home this week will help. Check out the top performers in fantasy WNBA on Thursday, including big performances from Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart and Angel Reese. 7 @ CHI (May 28), @ IND (May 30) The Storm beat two teams they were \"supposed\" to beat last week -- Indiana and Washington at home -- but wins are wins, especially for a team trying to build chemistry with the additions of and . was key in the Storm's tight 85-83 victory against the Fever, with 32 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists. In a 32-point blowout of the Mystics, five Storm players scored in double figures as Seattle shot 61.7% from the field. Diggins-Smith (16 points) had a season-high nine assists. 8 vs. SEA (May 28), vs. LA (May 30), at IND (June 1) First-year coach Teresa Weatherspoon's Sky are off to a much better start than most were predicting. Their victories were on the road against 2023 playoff teams (Dallas in week 1 and New York this past week) and both losses were by single digits against playoff teams (Dallas, Connecticut). Guard leads the way with 19.3 PPG, 7.0 RPG and 5.5 APG. Rookie is the Sky's top rebounder (7.3 RPG) and second-leading scorer (12.3). She took a hard foul from Connecticut's (who was ejected) on Saturday and got right back up. Reese wants to improve her shooting percentage (35.7) but overall is doing well. Angel Reese scores 13 points and grabs nine boards in the Chicago Sky's 90-81 victory over New York Liberty. 6 @ WAS (May 29), vs. LA (May 31), vs. CON (June 1) The Dream went 1-1 last week -- they beat Dallas and lost to Minnesota -- and just got passed by other teams to drop three spots in the Power Rankings. That happens a lot over the course of the season as teams with similar talent jockey for position in the standings. (2022 No. 1 pick) is off to a strong start, leading Atlanta in scoring (21.0) and steals (2.8). Vets , and are also averaging in double figures. 12 vs. LA (May 28), vs. SEA (May 30), vs. CHI (June 1) The Fever got their first win (78-73 at Los Angeles on Friday) and their first look at the two-time defending champion Aces (99-80 loss in Las Vegas on Saturday). They have played the most games of any WNBA team and looked weary at Vegas. It's another busy week for the Fever, but all three games are at home. leads in points (15.4), assists (6.3) and steals (1.1); she and fellow guard (14.0 PPG) are starting to jell. Veteran center -- whose energy has been a lift to the Fever -- moved into the starting lineup at Vegas. And had her best game of the season at Los Angeles. Check out the top performers in fantasy WNBA on Friday, including big performances from Caitlin Clark, Dearica Hamby and Temi Fagbenle. 10 @ IND (May 28), @ CHI (May 30), @ PHO (June 2) The Sparks have just the one victory -- last Tuesday vs. Washington -- but three of their losses are by single digits. So there are positive things for Los Angeles to look at despite the record. Over the weekend at home, the Sparks lost to Indiana by five points and Dallas by one. Rookie had a combined 36 points in those games and leads the WNBA in blocked shots (3.2 BPG). She and teammate will face two other high-profile rookies this week in Clark (for the second time) and Reese. 11 vs. ATL (May 29), @ NY (May 31) There was little doubt this could be a challenging season for the Mystics, with Elena Delle Donne not playing and leaving as a free agent for Phoenix. Things got worse with the May 17 injury to guard (ankle). And in Saturday's 32-point loss at Seattle, the Mystics also were without center (not with team, personal reasons). This is Washington's worst start since losing its first eight games in the 2007 season. It's not all gloom: The Mystics' first five losses were all by single digits, and they've played four of their first six games on the road.",

The former boxer is believed to have become nauseous and dizzy on board the flight because of an ulcer flare up. Paramedics rushed to the plane to provide medical assistance to Tyson while an announcement calling for a doctor was made in the plane, according to an eyewitness. A member of Tyson's team provided an update revealing he was \"doing great\". They told the New York Post : \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” An eyewitness said: \"He was in first class, but we were an exit row,' the eyewitness added. \"They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, 'He's a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he's OK.' I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words 'Mike Tyson' and she nodded her head yes.\" Tyson, 57, is just weeks away from his blockbuster fight with Jake Paul . The former world champion has impressed with his speed and power during sparring but has also suffered with his health in recent years. Tyson suffers from sciatica which has left him unable to talk and walk in the past. He said of his condition: “I have sciatica every now and then, it flares up. When it flares up, I can’t even talk! Thank God it’s the only health problem I have. I’m splendid now. “Everybody in my house is truly blessed and we’re all very grateful for whatever we have.” Sciatica is a condition that causes nerve irritation and has affected Tyson's back previously, leaving him requiring a wheelchair on one occasion.",

        "content": "MIKE TYSON suffered a medical emergency when flying from Miami to LA. The former boxer is believed to have become nauseous and dizzy on board the flight because of an ulcer flare up. Paramedics rushed to the plane to provide medical assistance to Tyson while an announcement calling for a doctor was made in the plane, according to an eyewitness. A member of Tyson's team provided an update revealing he was \"doing great\". They told the New York Post : \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” An eyewitness said: \"He was in first class, but we were an exit row,' the eyewitness added. \"They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, 'He's a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he's OK.' I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words 'Mike Tyson' and she nodded her head yes.\" Tyson, 57, is just weeks away from his blockbuster fight with Jake Paul . The former world champion has impressed with his speed and power during sparring but has also suffered with his health in recent years. Tyson suffers from sciatica which has left him unable to talk and walk in the past. He said of his condition: “I have sciatica every now and then, it flares up. When it flares up, I can’t even talk! Thank God it’s the only health problem I have. I’m splendid now. “Everybody in my house is truly blessed and we’re all very grateful for whatever we have.” Sciatica is a condition that causes nerve irritation and has affected Tyson's back previously, leaving him requiring a wheelchair on one occasion.",

        "description": "Diablo 4's newest season introduced a whole heap of exciting changes, but there's one seemingly small adjustment that keeps causing some confusion online: the armor cap. In seasons past, the armor system would continuously scale with enemies of increasing level, even beyond 100, within Nightmare Dungeons. But now, a much lower hard cap has been introduced, so we're going to take a look at the number to hit and how to do it. What is the armor cap in Diablo 4?The new armor cap is 9,230 Armor - once you reach this value, any more armor is a wasted stat. This value will provide 85% physical damage resistance against monsters of level 100 and beyond. Reaching this value isn't too difficult, at least not compared to juggling the various resistances in the game. If you're in the process of leveling, you can check if you're \"keeping up\" with the armor cap by hovering over the armor on your character screen. This will tell you how much physical resistance you're currently being granted. Below, you can see my unoptimized in-progress Barbarian overshooting the armor cap by a troublesome amount: Screenshot by Destructoid.How to reach armor cap in Diablo 4Reaching this cap, as mentioned, isn't too difficult. It used to be suggested to take the Legendary Aspect Juggernaut to reach the old, higher cap, but that's no longer strictly necessary (the Barbarian shown above has it, and it's nearly a wasted Aspect slot). Instead, you should focus on getting two or three high armor aspects on your gear. A Greater Affix for armor would put you very near the cap if you're decked out in 925 item level armor, but two or three \"normal\" bonuses to armor such as flat +X Armor or multiplicative +% Armor should push you over the threshold quite easily. There are also sources of armor in the Paragon Board, or you can give it a slight boost by slotting skull gems into your jewelry.

        "content": "Chelsea is set to appoint Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca as its new head coach, according to multiple media reports from England. The Italian, who worked as Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Manchester City until last season, has helped the Foxes to an immediate return to the Premier League following their relegation 12 months ago. His style of football is also said to have impressed Chelsea chiefs, with reporting Monday the Blues had asked Leicester for permission to speak directly to Maresca, whom they added was the London club’s preferred choice. He will replace Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge, who was sacked after just one season in charge, after he failed to win a trophy of secure Champions League football next season. However, the Blues did earn an European spot, playing in the UEFA Europa Conference League next season. Comments Related Topics",

        "content": "We ran into Verge Motorcycles at CES 2024 and what we saw was pretty fantastic. The company’s bikes just look outstanding and now they are starting to come to the United States. Verge Motorcycles will open its first U.S. stores in Los Angeles and San Jose, California. The company believes California is the perfect place in North America to launch the rollout of its new direct to consumer retail format. Estimated reading time: 4 minutes The first Verge Motorcycles store will open at Westfield Century City Shopping Center in Los Angeles on June 1st. Verge’s second store will open at Westfield Valley Fair Mall in San Jose on June 6th. Verge Motorcycles’ international retail strategy is being driven by technology visionary George Blankenship, who was instrumental in developing Apple and Tesla’s highly successful, ground-breaking showrooms. Blankenship’s excellent retail networks and industry experience will play an important role as the electric motorcycle pioneer opens its first U.S. stores. Here’s what the press release had to say. Verge Motorcycles believes the West Coast exhibits all the right conditions to successfully launch its U.S. business. Motorcycling is popular in the region, and residents there have always been early adopters of innovative technologies. California also has the most extensive electric vehicle charging network in the country. In June of last year, Verge confirmed its plan to utilize Tesla’s NACS charging connector which means all bikes from day-one will be able to utilize the expansive Tesla Supercharger network. “The United States is already seen as one of our most important markets. Many of the pre-orders for our bikes have come from the western region of the U.S. and California consumers in particular are widely known for appreciating and adopting new innovations. Our new stores in Los Angeles and San Jose will begin the rollout of our Verge experience to as many American motorcycle enthusiasts as possible,” said Pekka Parnanen, Chief Operating Officer of Verge USA. Verge Motorcycles is known for its futuristic design, class-leading performance and unique in-wheel motor powertrain, but the company has also shaken up the entire motorcycle industry with its most recent technology releases. In November, at the LA Auto Show, Verge launched its’ new Starmatter platform, which brings software updates, sensor technology, artificial intelligence and an advanced user interface to motorcycling for the first time. At CES in Las Vegas, Verge announced an update to its flagship model with Starmatter Vision features, including multiple cameras and high-resolution radar, making Verge TS Ultra the first motorcycle equipped with the sense of sight.

The new law being introduced means that all pet cats in England must be microchipped by June 10. The new compulsory law gives you 21 days after the deadline to have your cat microchipped otherwise you could be hit with the £500 fine. The microchip, which is about the same size as a grain of rice, is inserted under your cat's skin and contains a unique code that can identify the cat on a database. Microchips mean that it is much easier to be reunited with your pet if it ends up lost or stolen. A vet can scan a lost cat's microchip and see on the database the owner's details. READ MORE: Gardening expert shares 'cheap' homemade spray to keep cats from pooing It usually costs between £20 and £30 to get your pet microchipped and it must be done by a trained professional such as your vet. It is said that microchipping is like an injection and should not be that painful for your feline. The microchips will not affect your cat in any way either meaning that it won't even know it is there and it will not be shaved for the insertion either. From June 10, your cat will need to be microchipped and registered on a database by the time they turn 20 weeks old, with there being no minimum age to have them chipped. You are responsible for updating the database if any of your details change. Cats Protection help to reunite countless owners with their pets each year and a spokesperson said in most cases this is only possible thanks to the cat being microchipped. They added: \"No matter how far from home a cat is found, or how long they have been missing, having your cat microchipped gives them the best chance of being returned home safely to you.\" Keeping your details up to date is really important. Unfortunately, many cats can't be reunited with their owners due to contact details being out of date. Updating your cat's microchip details is an easy process. Get your cat’s microchip number. Keep your cat’s microchip number stored away so you can have it to hand. Not sure what it might be? Call your vet to see if they have it in their records, or take your cat to the vet to have them scanned. Confirm your cat's microchip database. Lost your original paperwork? You may be able to check which database your cat is registered with by entering their microchip number into the identi look-up tool . Update your details. Now that you have your cat’s number and contact information of the database, call them or go to their website to change your address or phone number. Many kittens are microchipped at the same time as being neutered (spayed or castrated), when they are already under general anaesthetic. It is recommended that your cat is microchipped before they go outside for the first time. The possible ongoing charge in relation to microchipping occurs if you change your contact details because this can something sometimes mean paying a fee on the database. Depending on the database, this might be a one-off fee for the lifetime of your cat, or a cost every time you update. f you’ve adopted a cat from Cats Protection or another animal welfare organisation, there is every chance your cat may already have a microchip. Cats Protection will update your cat’s details when you formally adopt them. If you’re getting your cat from elsewhere, you’ll need to ask for further information about the microchip and see if you can access the cat's original paperwork. You’ll be given the paperwork once you have officially adopted your cat, which will include your cat's unique microchip number. If you have had your cat microchipped by a vet or organisation, they’ll let you know how to register your details online. You’ll usually be sent registration documents following the procedure, within a couple of weeks. If you don’t receive anything, check with the person or organisation that microchipped your cat. Remember to keep your registration documents and cat’s microchip number safe. Want more from MyLondon? Sign up to our daily newsletters for all the latest and greatest from across London here.",

        "content": "SAMSUNG customers were left shocked by a surprise alert on their refrigerators. An out-of-the-blue message appeared on the screens of smart refrigerators across the United States last week. The alert warned Samsung refrigerator owners that they'd soon lose access to Samsung TV Plus. That's Samsung's free TV streaming service that offers up live channels and on-demand content – all supported by ads. It's a key perk on Samsung's smart refrigerators because it lets you watch live TV channels in your kitchen without needing a dedicated television . Samsung has now backtracked on the pop-up and says it was sent in error. The message that popped up on screens read: \"Thank for for using Samsung TV Plus service. \"After the SW update scheduled for June 2024, Samsung TV Plus will only be available within Mexican territories. \"Please note that this is Samsung TV Plus' policy, and use of the service may be restricted if you wish to use it outside of Mexican territories. Thank you.\" Users were left shocked and confused by the message. A thread on the official Samsung forums has dozens of replies. One wrote: \"This fridge and the S23 Ultra will probably be my last Samsung products if they don't revert their decision.\" Another said: \"My husband wanted it for the TV part. I admit I used it for my granddaughter to watch TV while I was in the kitchen. This makes me want a refund on this fridge.\" Disappointed Samsung fans also flocked to Reddit, where a post on the alert received dozens of upvotes. A worried Samsung fan said: \"I'm so upset about this. It's one of the main reasons why I bought this fridge. I watch it while I'm cooking .\" One added: \"This has to be wrong.\" Another wrote: \"This is BS as it was a main selling point of this 'smart' fridge.\" And one noted: \"We just bought this fridge. I may see if it’s too late to return it. We liked this feature.\" Samsung was quick to shut down the erroneous alert. Here's what you need to know... Samsung TV Plus is a FAST – or \"free ad-supported streaming television\" – service. It's available on a host of Samsung devices, including smartphones, TVs, and Family Hub refrigerators. You can access Samsung TV Plus is at least 24 countries. It offers over 200 live channels across a range of genres including entertainment, news, sports, music, and movies. The service also offers a selection of on-demand content. It launched in August 2015 and is now of of the most popular streaming apps on Samsung TVs. In a post to X, formerly Twitter , Samsung's TV Plus account wrote: \"Oops! You can disregard that Family Hub notification. This was an error – we're not going anywhere!\" A second notice was also sent out to Samsung Family Hub refrigerator owners about the mistake. It read: \"Please disregard the prior notification regarding Samsung TV Plus. \"Samsung TV Plus service will continue to be available in the US on both Family Hub and Smart TVs. We apologize for the confusion. \"However, since Samsung TV Plus is a country-based service, please note that if you are using the Family Hub SW for the US, use of the Samsung TV Plus service outside of US territories may be restricted after the SW update scheduled for June 2024. \"We apologize for the confusion. Thank you.\" The U.S. Sun has asked Samsung for comment and will update this story with any response.",

        "content": "Landing Paul George remains the top priority for the Philadelphia 76ers this offseason, according to The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor . \"They're looking for another star, but they also need players who can fill various roles,\" O'Connor reported Sunday. \"PG-13 is both, which is why sources familiar with Philly's strategy say he is the team's plan A in free agency.\" In addition, he pointed back to previous reporting that Philly is believed to have a \"real chance\" of signing George. The nine-time All-Star could choose to stay in Southern California, with the Los Angeles Clippers so far having failed to win the championship they coveted from the moment they added he and Kawhi Leonard. However, there appears to be a very real divide between the two parties over money. Leonard already pledged his future to the franchise with a three-year, $149.7 million extension, which was significantly lower than he could've earned on a full max ($223 million over four years). The deal was also notable in what it might mean for George. \"Rival teams and agents are conducting business, sources said, under the impression the Clippers aren't keen on committing to guaranteed money beyond the three-year window of Leonard's deal that runs through 2026-27,\" Yahoo Sports' Jake Fischer reported last Thursday. Spotrac projects the Sixers to have $55.5 million in practical salary cap space and they could have as much as $72.8 million to spend. Philly can sign George or another marquee free agent outright. The 34-year-old is not only one of the best players on the board but also somebody who should fit nicely alongside Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. His versatility extends to where he can play on the floor because he can be a No. 1 scorer, a playmaker or a more complementary off-ball shooter depending on what the circumstances dictate. For his career, George is averaging 20.8 points and 3.7 assists and he's a 38.5 percent three-point shooter. No deal of this magnitude is without risk, and in the case of George, his durability has been a persistent concern. He only missed eight games in 2023-24 but failed to hit 60 games played in any of the four preceding campaigns. But it's hard to picture a better upgrade for the Sixers that's realistically possible this offseason.",

The party slammed the Congress-led government in the State for putting lives of people at stake for the financial gain of the ruling party and its leaders. Addressing a press conference at Telangana Bhavan here on Monday, BRS leader Krishank Manne said Som Distilleries had a dark history of illicit liquor sales which led to the death of 65 persons in Madhya Pradesh following which the officials seized their manufacturing units in the State. “Today, the Congress government in Telangana gave permissions to Som Distilleries, despite their involvement in numerous cases of selling illicit liquor. This same company has also donated money to the Congress party, as mentioned on the Election Commission website,” he said. Also Read ‘Fraudulent companies heading to TS, thanks to Revanth Reddy’, says Krishank Krishank said the Congress government, particularly Excise Minister Jupally Krishna Rao, was being dishonest about the approvals for sale of new liquor brands in the State. “Just four days ago, the Minister claimed that no new liquor brands were permitted, which has turned out to be an utter lie. He even threatened a Rs 100 crore defamation suit against a media house which reported about the State government approving sale of new liquor brands in the State,” he added. Sharing the details released by the company to the National Stock Exchange, the BRS leader said Som Distilleries was planning to launch new beer brands in Telangana, a move facilitated by alleged corruption involving Congress leaders. He said the company was permitted to sell its brands in exchange for its financial support given to the Congress and its leaders. “In 2019, Som Distilleries donated Rs 1.31 crore to the Congress Party, and Rs 25 lakh in 2013-14. While the previous BRS regime strictly prohibited such liquor brands, the Congress reopened the doors to them,” he stated. Highlighting the company’s troubled history, Krishank pointed out that Som Distilleries was implicated in the deaths of 65 people in Madhya Pradesh and faced multiple raids and seizures there. He questioned whether Jupally Krishna Rao and Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy were aware of the company’s tarnished reputation and still chose to permit its operations in Telangana.

As a member of ZDNET, I only write about deals myself or a team member would want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. I looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. I also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals I recommend. These recommendations may also be based on my own testing (or testing by another ZDNET expert) -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter. When will these deals expire? Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we're constantly finding new chances to save and sharing them with you at . When is Memorial Day? Memorial Day always falls on the last Monday of May. This year, it is on Monday, May 27, 2024. However, you'll find that retailers will have sales all weekend long, and even days ahead of the holiday.",

        "content": "A woman who claimed to be the personal doctor of Kenya's opposition leader Raila Odinga has been charged with a Ksh25 million scandal entailing a fake KEMSA tender. Faith Mwikali Ndiwa, who appeared before Milimani Chief Magistrate Susan Shitubi on Monday, May 27, 2024, denied eight charges of forgery and obtaining Ksh25 million from a Nigerian national, Jude Olabayo Veracruz, by pretending that she had won a tender from KEMSA for the supply of insecticidal nets. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (ODPP) informed the court that Mwikali used her two companies, Ashley Dylan Limited and Faizel Limited, to secure tender number IFT NO GF ATM MAL NFM-19/20-OIT-004 to supply KEMSA with Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs), which she used to deceive the foreigner into investing in the said tender. The court heard that Mwikali allegedly used her two companies to deceive Veracruz, convincing him that he would earn a profit after paying the Ksh25 million to complete his part of the bargain. She is accused of obtaining the said money on various dates between June and December 2022 in Nairobi County. Mwikali also faced several other counts of making false documents. On March 7, 2022, at an unknown place within the country, with the intent to defraud, she allegedly forged a framework contract number IFT NO GF ATM MAL NFM-19/20-OIT-004 between KEMSA and Ashley Dylan Limited for the supply of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets, purporting it to be a genuine agreement issued by the medical supplies authority. She was further charged with presenting the said contract between her company and KEMSA to the foreign investor Veracruz, purporting it to be a genuine agreement for the supply of insecticidal nets. The businesswoman also denied another charge of forging an amendment to the agreement of the framework contract between her company and KEMSA. In June 2022, she was accused of fraudulently presenting the said amendment agreement to Veracruz, pretending it to be a genuine agreement. After denying the eight counts of forgery, uttering false documents, and obtaining money through pretences, the prosecution opposed the release of Mwikali on bond, saying the police needed to file an affidavit articulating reasons to deny the accused bond. Mwikali's defence lawyers applied to have the accused freed on bond, arguing that it was her constitutional right and that she was not a flight risk. \"Your honour, I plead with this court to release the accused on bond since it is her right,\" the lawyer prayed. State prosecutor Naomi Wanjiru opposed the application by the defence to free the accused on bond, stating that some issues need to be presented before the court through an affidavit by the investigating officer, Eunice Njue. \"Your honour, I oppose the release of the accused on a bond to give the investigating officer time to file an affidavit opposing the same,\" Naomi said. In her ruling, the magistrate allowed the plea by the prosecution to detain the accused until Tuesday, May 28, 2024, to allow the investigating officer to file a formal affidavit opposing her release on bond. \"I have considered the prayers by the prosecution to hold the accused for the investigating officer to have time to file an affidavit before the court,\" the magistrate ruled. Shitubi directed that the accused person be detained in Langata Prison until Tuesday morning when she will be presented in court for a bail hearing.",

        "content": "In the realm of electric vehicles, excitement is bubbling as car manufacturers race to electrify their popular models. The Hyundai Creta is about to join this eco-friendly revolution, with its Electric Vehicle (EV) variant expected to launch in September. Hyundai recently unveiled its new Creta and Creta N Line models in India. These SUVs have swiftly climbed the sales charts, now regularly featuring in the top 10 best-selling cars list. Following this success, the company is gearing up to introduce an electric version of the widely loved SUV. The Hyundai Creta EV, anticipated to feature a 45 kWh battery pack, promises an impressive range close to 450 kilometers on a full charge. The electric variant is expected to deliver 138 horsepower and 255 Nm of torque, making it a compelling choice for eco-conscious consumers. The Creta EV is set to come packed with advanced safety features, including Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), a 10.25-inch touchscreen system, a 360-degree camera, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and an 8-speaker sound system. Enhanced safety measures include 6 airbags, ABS with EBD, and ventilated seats. Additionally, the new model will provide amenities like a dashcam, climate control, wireless charging pad, Type C charging ports, and electronic parking brakes, ensuring a luxurious and high-tech driving experience. The new Creta EV is reportedly based on the current Creta platform, offering dimensions that include a length of 4330 mm, width of 1790 mm, height of 1635 mm, and a wheelbase of 2610 mm. It also offers a spacious 433-liter boot and 17-inch tires, maintaining the practicality that the Creta is known for. Hyundai’s entry into the electric SUV segment with the Creta EV signals an exciting time for electric vehicle enthusiasts. Alongside Hyundai, Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors are also set to launch new electric vehicles in India soon. Expectedly, these models will be priced between 20 to 25 lakh rupees. Despite the influx of new models, Mahindra’s XUV400 remains the most affordable, priced between 15.49 to 17.49 lakh rupees. Meanwhile, MG ZS EV is priced between 18.98 to 24.98 lakh rupees.

        "content": "My Bloody Valentine is getting the remake treatment, but horror fans think the franchise is best left in the past. Released in 1981, the iconic slasher film directed by George Mihalka tells the story of a group of friends throwing a Valentine’s Day party, only to find themselves picked off one by one by a maniacal killer in mining gear. Starring Paul Kelman, Lori Hallier, and Neil Affleck, My Bloody Valentine became notorious for its sheer level of gore and violence. It was so gory, that awhole nine minutes had to be cut by the Motion Picture Association of America ahead of its cinema run. Fans eventually got three minutes of this additional footage restored in 2009, as well as a remake from Lionsgate to boot. It was previously reported that a sequel was in the works from writer Todd Farmer and director Patrick Lussier – but the rumours never came to fruition. Now, fresh from remaking the likes of Halloween , The Exorcist , and, bizarrely, Speak No Evil , Blumhouse is set to bring a new My Bloody Valentine film to our screens, with cast, crew, and release details yet to be announced. Bloody Disgusting first announced the news, but fans were less than impressed with many asking Blumhouse to ‘leave these franchises alone.’ MDK17011 posted on X: ‘Blumhouse gonna ruin another one’, with Coolguyleftist agreeing: ‘My excitement died as soon as I read Blumhouse.’ Boezerek added: ‘As much as I love the first movie and have cheesy fun with the remake...I don’t see much else that can be done with this concept. Maybe I’m wrong, but seeing that Blumhouse is involved...I’m weary.’ Be_nicetopeople asked: ‘Why? The original is fun, the remake is cool, we are done here.’ Other fans were more optimistic, with many hoping that Jensen Ackles, who appeared in 2009’s My Bloody Valentine 3D as Tom Hanninger, would return for the latest outing. My Bloody Valentine 3D brought in a whopping $100million (£78million) at the worldwide box office, and yet never received a sequel. 'I was one of the most recognisable 80s child stars - now I'm finally making a comeback' The top critically acclaimed films you didn't realise were on Netflix now 7 sex scenes and filthy innuendos in Disney films you know you didn't imagine Michael Jackson’s son's odd balcony behaviour 22 years after he was dangled from window Blumhouse have also announced a remake of another classic 90s horror film – The Blair Witch Project . The movie marks a ‘new vision for Blair Witch, that will reintroduce this horror classic for a new generation’, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group’s Adam Fogelson revealed. The film announcement was met with a mixed reception, and even enraged former star Joshua Leonard , who claimed he did not know it was happening. The production company is also behind the controversial remake of 2022’s feel-bad hit Speak No Evil, which became a word-of-mouth success after being released on Shudder. Got a story?

        "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "Israel must respect international law and stop its military operation in Rafah, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday, following a deadly airstrike on the city in southern Gaza. According to the latest update from Gaza’s health ministry, the death toll from the overnight bombardment of Rafah’s Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood has reached 45 people, including many children, with 294 others wounded. Rafah hosts hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the Israel-Hamas war. “Outraged by the Israeli strikes that have killed many displaced persons in Rafah,” Macron wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday. Israeli military operations in the area “must stop” because there are “no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians... I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” the French president stated. Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed that Ankara will do everything in its power to ensure the “barbarians” who carried out the attack on Rafah are brought to justice. In a speech on Monday, Erdogan again compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, claiming that he is “imitating” the Nazi German dictator. Netanyahu and his “murderous network” are trying to “extend their grip on power by massacring people as they fail to defeat Palestinian resistance,” he said. The Turkish leader claimed Israel has shown itself to be a “terror state” by striking a Palestinian refugee camp, just days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered it to halt its military actions in Rafah. The IDF insists that the strike on Rafah was “carried out against legitimate targets under international law, using precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence.” According to the Israeli military, “significant Hamas terrorists were operating” in the Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood. However, the military said it was reviewing the incident, following reports of civilian deaths and a blaze at the camp. The attack on Rafah followed rocket strikes on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv on Sunday, which the IDF said came from the Rafah area. At least, 36,000 people have been killed and more than 81,000 others wounded in Israeli airstrikes and the ground offensive in Gaza, according to the Palestinian enclave’s health ministry. Israel launched its operation in response to a cross-border incursion by Hamas last October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.",

        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Destiny 2 Bungie has one job right now, get people excited to play Destiny 2’s final Light and Darkness expansion, The Final Shape, out in just over a week from now. It appears they have accomplished that mission. Right now, Destiny 2 has attracted an hugely healthy playerbase in the run-up to the launch of the expansion, and is selling content well enough to top Steam charts. Destiny 2 has now become a fixture inside Steam’s Top 10 most played games , often putting up 100,000 plus concurrents a night, despite the fact that the launch of its current season, Season of the Wish, was back in November of 2023. Deserving credit, of course, is Bungie’s midseason “Into the Light” update, which among other things brought in the horde mode Onslaught activity and the ultra-endgame challenge Pantheon. It also reprised two of Destiny 2’s best vaulted exotic missions and introduced three new Crucible maps. As such, the playercount increase and subsequent retention have been remarkable. With the launch of Into the Light, Destiny 2’s playercount more than doubled on Steam overnight, and over the last two months has only crept higher overall, rather than decreasing after an initial surge. The game now seems poised to eclipse Lightfall’s all-time concurrent record of 316,750 players when The Final Shape launches if we’re already doing 100,000 evenings right now. Destiny 2 Best Nintendo Switch Games: It’s Mario’s World, We’re Just Visiting Then there are sales, where Destiny 2, technically a “free” offering on Steam, is the best-selling game on the service in terms of revenue with only CS2 occasionally beating it, but that’s a game with a massive internal cosmetics/skin economy. And Destiny 2 is even topping it some days. Given that Destiny 2 itself is free (“free”), those sales are mainly reflective of The Final Shape pre-orders really ramping up now. Previously, months ago, it was said that internally Bungie was worried about low Final Shape preorders. Now, you have devs publicly celebrating these increases on the timeline. It’s quite the mood shift. There’s a narrative that Bungie performs best when “its backs are against the wall” which may sound heroic, but it’s kind of brutal, as it comes after the layoff of 100+ employees and it’s well known internal Bungie leadership is poor, and all those leaders are still there, meaning I’m not sure what working conditions there have been like recently. But in general, the on-the-ground Bungie employees emphatically repeat they are the most proud of this out of anything they’ve made, and they can’t wait for people to play. It's been a perfect storm of good content and good marketing producing good vibes. The Final Shape still has to be enormously successful, not just “solid,” for the health of Bungie, and the game can’t lose too many players right after. But for now, things are on a very good track, that much is clear. Follow me on Twitter , Threads , YouTube , and Instagram . Pick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy .

        "description": "The independent candidate received just 2 percent of the votes and was kicked out in the first round.",
        "content": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was swiftly eliminated from the Libertarian Party’s presidential nominee race in the first round, thus putting to rest expectations that the candidate would be backed by a major party. The Libertarians had put up multiple candidates as potential nominees, including Mr. Kennedy and political activist Chase Oliver. After the results were published, RFK Jr. said he appreciated the party’s considering him. “I would have accepted the nomination if offered because independents and third parties need to unite right now to reclaim our country from the corrupt two-party system.” The candidate claimed that both he and the party were “natural allies” due to the “core values of peace, free speech, and civil liberties.” “Together we will break the stranglehold of the Uniparty,” he said. The term Uniparty suggests that Democrats and Republicans, despite being in opposition, actually collude to work for a single establishment. The candidate said he would pardon prominent document leakers Julian Assange and Edward Snowden as well as dismantle wasteful and abusive bureaucracies while restoring the authority of the Bill of Rights if elected president. In his speech at the convention, Mr. Kennedy attacked President Trump and President Biden for not respecting the U.S. Constitution when the country faced the COVID-19 pandemic. “I don’t recall any part of the United States Constitution where there’s an exemption for pandemics,” he said while noting that even though President Trump was reluctant to impose lockdowns early in the pandemic, he eventually capitulated, due to which “many of our most fundamental rights disappeared practically overnight.” He criticized President Trump for allowing health regulators to impose social distancing norms, thus violating the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly. The lockdowns were imposed without any due process, no notice, and no public hearings, RFK Jr. noted. After President Biden took office, the “assault on the Constitution intensified,” he said, citing multiple censorship cases. President Trump spoke at the convention on May 25. However, he did not submit paperwork for the party’s nomination. Mr. Kennedy “has more energy than Joe Biden and more maturity than Donald Trump,” stated Party Convention Secretary Richard Kasa. “The Reform Party aligns with him better on the issues than we do with the establishment politicians. We are sure that he will be the next president of the United States.” The party said Mr. Kennedy sought their nomination in a bid to gain ballot access in all 50 American states. They claimed that polls show RFK Jr. would “beat both Trump and Biden in head-to-head races.” “They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win. Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy,” he said in a May 15 X post. “Forty-three percent of Americans identify as independents. If Americans are ever going to escape the hammerlock of the two-party system, now is the time to do it. These are the two most unpopular candidates in living memory.” A third candidate opens up the possibility of “transcending polarized views and hateful divisions,” he stated.",

        "content": "SAN MARCOS, Texas ( KXAN ) — At 104 years old, Ernie Columbus could be called a thrill seeker — especially after his latest adventure taking to the skies. We found the WWII veteran in San Marcos, Texas, as he geared up for his second-ever skydiving trip. “I don’t remember doing this the last time,” Ernie said as the instructor strapped on some new devices. Ernie served in the Army during WWII. After the war, he moved over to the Air Force to serve out the remainder of his 26-year military career. In that time, he never skydived, but now he said he’s hooked. “I just decided I was going to jump, and that was it,” Ernie said. Ernie was paired with instructor Victor Krusi for the jump, who says tandem jumping gives almost anyone the opportunity to go skydiving. “It is much easier now with tandem skydiving,” Krusi said. “We just strap you to someone who is very, very, very experienced.” Ernie says he enjoyed every second of the free fall, but especially the view from so high up. “I could see everything around, and the guy back there was talking to me and I was all tied up to him,” Ernie said. Nexstar’s KXAN asked Ernie if he would be jumping again anytime soon. “Someone asked me if I was going to do it again and I said, ‘I don’t know,’ but I think if the opportunity comes up, I may just do it,” said Ernie. Ernie says if he does jump again, he would like to do it on his 107th birthday.",

        "content": "On an island separated from China by a narrow strip of sea, oyster farmer Li Kai-chen collects mollusks on a shore known for its bloody battle over control of Taiwan. While the 66-year-old has worked to keep tradition alive in Kinmen, the island administered by Taiwan has found itself on the frontline of Chinese war games. “These centuries-old oyster beds not only produce food, they represent a culture and a history,” he told AFP. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te vowed to defend democracy during his inauguration last week. China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, launched military drills on Thursday to encircle Taiwan and its outlying islands. China deployed warplanes, naval vessels and coast guard ships in the latest show of force since several drills in 2022 and 2023. Kinmen’s oyster farmers said they were accustomed to the shows of Chinese might and would focus instead on collecting as many mollusks as they could. “I’m more afraid of the tide than of China,” said a woman also surnamed Li, who declined to provide her full name. “Kinmen is very safe,” said the 64-year-old. Their historic oyster farm stands less than five kilometers (three miles) from Xiamen, a Chinese megacity filled with imposing skyscrapers. Li Kai-chen stood among rows of granite blocks brought from China more than 400 years ago where the oysters grow. He used a metal staff to scrape them off - a farming method unique from shuckers typically taken off reef rocks. Fortress island The blocks are also embedded on the site of the defining clashes decades ago, when the nationalist army of Chiang Kai-shek after his forces fled to Taiwan in 1949. Known as the Battle of Guningtou, they fended off the communist troops under Mao Zedong on those beaches, successfully retaining Kinmen under the nationalists’ control. “During the war, people fled to survive and the oyster beds were abandoned,” said Li, who is also head of Guningtou village on Kinmen. At the time, “the soldiers had to take stones (from oyster beds) near the shore to build shelters,” he said. Until 1979, Kinmen faced regular bombardment from the Chinese military, and it was massively fortified by Chiang’s troops. Taiwan has transformed over the decades into a vibrant democracy, but Chinese President Xi Jinping has upped the rhetoric in recent years and vows that Taiwan’s “unification” with China is “inevitable”. Kinmen is geographically closer to China than Taiwan’s main island, which is located about 200 kilometers away. Today, anti-landing spikes dot the island’s beaches, while abandoned bunkers can be seen along its coast. A loudspeaker the size of a building, historically used by the military to broadcast propaganda messages to the communist troops on the other side, is now a tourist attraction. Down on the shore, Li lamented that their farming method is at risk largely because “young people don’t want to work in this industry”. He used a puddle of seawater to clean the shells, which are smaller than those farmed industrially in China. Kinmen oysters are also distinguished by their light, melt-in-the-mouth texture due to exposure to the wind and sun at low tide on the granite blocks. They are typically prepared in omelets slathered with a viscous sauce - a Kinmen delicacy that Taiwanese tourists often seek out when visiting the island. But with only a few elderly farmers working on the beaches, not all the mollusks are harvested in time. Nowadays, Li entertains tourists mostly from Taiwan’s main island, teaching them how to harvest and shuck the oysters. But Taiwan’s plummeting relations with China have meant that Chinese travelers are no longer among Kinmen’s visitors - something Li hopes will change in the new administration. “I hope there will be more (Chinese) tourists coming so we will have business,” Li said. “Then our lives will be improved.” — AFP",

        "content": "BANGKOK — Canadian boxer Terris Smith defeated Bulgaria’s Aslahan Mehmedova 3-0 on points in their round-of-16 bout Monday to advance at a last-ditch Olympic qualifying tournament. The 31-year-old from Victoria moves on in the women’s 60-kilogram division at the Haumark Stadium. Also Monday, Montreal’s Keven Beausejour, 24, lost 3-2 to Japan’s Go Wakaya in round-of-16 action in the men’s 80-kilogram class. On Sunday, Junior Petanqui defeated Shain Boniface from the Seychelles in a round-of-32 bout in the men’s 71-kilogram division. The 25-year-old from Montreal earned a 5-0 decision in his round-of-32 bout. Canada coach Samir (Sammy) El Mais called it “a great performance for his first bout.” “His jab couldn’t miss all fight,” he said in a statement. “He used his range, his experience and out classed his opponent winning unanimously.” On Tuesday, Petanqui faces Armenia’s Gurgen Madoyan and Scarlett Delgado, a 28-year-old from Brampton, Ont., meets Kenya’s Amina Faki in round-of-16 action in the women’s 54-kilogram class. Canadian Victor Tremblay lost via walkover Friday after failing to make weight for his first fight in the 57-kilogram bracket. “Victor has demonstrated incredible dedication and commitment to representing our nation on the international stage,” El Mais said. “However, ensuring the safety and well-being of our athletes always takes precedence. It was a tough decision, but ultimately, it was the right one.” The 19-year-old from Montreal is remaining with the team. “While I am disappointed that I won’t be able to compete, I understand the importance of maintaining my health and safety,” Tremblay said in a statement. “I will continue to train hard and support my teammates in any way I can.” Nine Canadians entered the Bangkok tournament trying to fight their way into this summer’s Olympic field Canada has already qualified two boxers for Paris, which features 13 weight classes — seven for men and six for women. The number of Olympic boxing divisions for men has gone down by one while the women’s competition has added one since Tokyo. But there will parity in total numbers of athletes with 124 men and 124 women. Middleweight Tammara Thibeault (75 kilograms) and welterweight Wyatt Sanford (63.5 kilograms) secured their Olympic berths via gold-medal performances at year’s Pan American Games. Both were members of Canada’s five-boxer team for the Tokyo Olympics. The Bangkok qualifier, which runs through June 3, will determine the final 51 quota places (23 for women and 28 for men) for the Paris Games. Olympic boxing qualification comes in the form of several steps. The first were five continental qualifiers, with the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, covering the Americas. A first World Qualification Tournament was then held in Busto Arzizio, Italy, from Feb. 29 to March 12. Competitors essentially had to finish in the top four in Italy to secure Olympic qualification, although that figure varied in some weight classes. Canada had two athletes finish in the top eight _ Delgado and super-heavyweight Alexis Barriere, who subsequently opted to focus on a pro career. Just making the Olympic field is an accomplishment, given the sport’s popularity around the world and the fact each country can have no more than one competitor in a weight class. More than 75 countries took part in boxing at the Tokyo Games. Competitors will again need to crack the top four in Bangkok to punch their ticket to Paris. That measuring stick can change, however, given host France is guaranteed a maximum of six quota places (three for women and three for men) so can claim a spot in a weight class even if it doesn’t qualify a fighter. That means some weight classes may require a top-three finish for Olympic qualification. It could also become top five if an already qualified competitor is injured or suspended. There will be no title bouts at the Bangkok event, with action in each weight class coming to a halt when the final Olympic berths are determined. Canada has won 17 Olympic boxing medals (three gold, seven silver and seven bronze), but none since 1996 when heavyweight David Defiagbon won silver in Atlanta. The Paris boxing competition runs July 27 to Aug. 1 in the North Paris Arena and Roland-Garros Stadium. The Olympic qualifying events were organized under the authority of the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU), an ad-hoc group created by the International Olympic Committee’s executive board. The PBU was tasked with overseeing qualifying and running the boxing competition at the games following the IOC’s suspension and the subsequent withdrawal of recognition of the International Boxing Association (IBA). — This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 Check out our sports section for the latest news and analysis.",

        "description": "He was just signed three days ago to serve as a depth infielder for the club.",
        "content": "The Braves announced a series of roster moves Monday, reinstating catcher Sean Murphy from the injured list and recalling outfielder J.P. Martínez . In corresponding moves, outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. was placed on the 10-day injured list and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Wendle, 34, was just signed three days ago to serve as a depth infielder for the club. However, Atlanta was delivered a devastating blow yesterday when Acuña tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He will undergo surgery and miss the remainder of the 2024 season. With Acuña out of the picture, Atlanta was left with just Michael Harris II , Jarred Kelenic and Adam Duvall for the outfield. They have recalled Martínez today to give them a fourth outfielder, which quickly nudged Wendle off the roster shortly after being added. Atlanta will now have a week to trade Wendle or pass him through waivers. The Mets are on the hook for the majority of his $2M salary since they released him last week. That means any club that brings him aboard would only have to pay the prorated league minimum for any time spent on the roster, with that amount subtracted from what the Mets pay. Wendle has had some good years as a solid bat who can competently play multiple positions, but he’s been in a rough skid at the plate for a while now. He hit just .259/.297/.360 in 2022 for a wRC+ of 84 and has been even worse since then. Dating back to the start of 2023, he’s hit .213/.247/.300 for a wRC+ of just 47. But he’s still capable of bouncing around the diamond, with experience at the three infield positions to the left of first base and the outfield corners. Even without much offensive output, he’s capable of being a glove-first bench piece. He also hit .275/.330/.416 from 2017 to 2021, 106 wRC+, which could lend some hope to a bounceback at the plate. For the moment, Atlanta’s roster depth is tenuous, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if further moves were coming. Murphy’s activation gives the club three catchers, alongside Travis d’Arnaud and Chadwick Tromp . The club could have optioned Tromp to the minors but perhaps felt that would have left them thin behind the plate. Murphy is just returned from missing around two months due to an oblique strain while d’Arnaud missed some time this week after taking a foul ball to the mask and experiencing some dizziness. Perhaps the Braves opted to keep Tromp around while they make sure both Murphy and d’Arnaud are healthy enough to play regularly. In the meantime, that leaves them with no real backup infielder. Austin Riley hasn’t played in about two weeks due to some side soreness, but the club hasn’t placed him on the injured list. That has forced Zack Short to step in as the regular third baseman. As of now, Atlanta’s bench consists of Riley, two catchers and one outfielder, at least until Riley is able to return. Perhaps Tromp will be optioned out for another infielder shortly, or Riley will return to the lineup and nudge Short back to the bench. How the club decides to play the outfield will also be interesting to monitor. Kelenic and Duvall have been in a platoon this year, since Kelenic is a lefty who hits better against righties and Duvall is the opposite. Kelenic has hit .220/.298/.401 against righties in his career but just .189/.254/.309 against lefties, leading to respective wRC+ numbers of 96 and 60. Duvall has hit .235/.307/.474 against southpaws and .230/.285/.468 otherwise, producing respective wRC+ tallies of 104 and 95. With Acuña’s injury, they will likely give regular playing time to those two, with Martínez in the fourth outfielder role. The 28-year-old Martínez was acquired from the Rangers in January. He has a line of .265/.337/.394 in Triple-A this year, 90 wRC+, stealing 14 bases in 20 tries. Double-digit steal totals have been a regular feature for him for a long time, including 41 in the minors last year. He also hit .298/.418/.543 in Triple-A last year, for a 133 wRC+, but hasn’t maintained that here in 2024. Like Kelenic, Martínez hits from the left side and has been better against righties this year. He has a .260/.348/.415 line against righties and .277/.306/.340 against southpaws this season.

At around 1:40 a.m. today, police responded to a report of an impaired driver in St. John's, and located a 23-year-old man at a parking lot in the city centre. He was charged for driving with a blood-alcohol level above the legal limit and for having open alcohol in a vehicle, and his vehicle was impounded. A few hours later police received a disturbance call at a home in the city's west end and found the same man, who had driven a different vehicle to the residence. He was arrested for impaired driving for a second time and was also charged with criminal harassment. He was kept in custody in St. John's overnight.

Activate your Online Access Now Article content Meanwhile, Michael Peres, a 16-year-old who lives in Kanata, had not heard of the show. The Holy Trinity Catholic High School student was too busy focusing on soccer, which he has been playing since he was five or six. Both teenagers wound up among the cast of athletes appearing in the sixth and latest season of All-Round Champions, which launches Wednesday at 5 p.m. Ariana says she was in disbelief when she learned last year that her application to appear on the show had been accepted. She is this season’s beach volleyball expert. Michael was essentially recruited for the show, but not as a soccer star. He quickly became an expert in Teqball, a sport that’s a cross between soccer and table tennis. The teenagers spent all of last fall making the show, based in Hamilton and Toronto, continuing their schooling online while undergoing their athletic odyssey. Nine other athletes from as far as Kamloops, B.C., Texas and England were part of the show. Between them, the young athletes covered beach volleyball, teqball, pickleball, roller derby, cricket, synchronized diving, mixed martial arts, canoe sprint, cheer, ice dance and breaking.

Article content Michael says taking part in the show was right up his alley. “I’m really competitive. I like stepping out of my comfort zone... Some of the sports I’ve never heard of before,” he says. “There’s not much we could prepare for this. We didn’t. It was kind of like a leap of faith,” he continues. “Some sports were extremely fun to compete in and some were extremely not fun to compete in.” Ariana recalls being very nervous and excited when the show began shooting. But the young athletes “clicked instantly,” she says. “We lived in a really big house together. We all became best friends really quickly,” she says. “I was surprised at how much I wasn’t homesick. I felt the three months flew by.” The show is hosted by Canadian Olympian and world-champion hurdler Perdida Felicien, who mentors the young athletes, as do a roster of other sports stars. Both teenagers plan to take their passion for sports as far as they can. Ariana says she would like to pursue volleyball at the NCAA level and even represent Canada at the Olympics.

        "description": "North Korea fired the projectile on a southern path off its west coast at around 10:44pm, the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, hours after Pyongyang said it would be launching a satellite some time before June 4.",
        "content": "North Korea said its attempt to launch a new military reconnaissance satellite ended in failure on Monday when a newly developed rocket engine exploded in flight. The attempt came just hours after Pyongyang issued a warning that it would try to launch a satellite by June 4, in what would have been its second spy satellite in orbit. Instead, the launch became the nuclear-armed North’s latest failure, following two other fiery crashes last year. It successfully placed its first spy satellite in orbit in November. “The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage,” the deputy director general of North Korea’s National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a report carried by state media. An initial analysis suggested that the cause was a newly developed liquid fuel rocket motor, but other possible causes were being investigated, the report said. Officials in South Korea and Japan had earlier reported that the launch seemed to have failed. North Korea fired the projectile on a southern path off its west coast at around 10:44pm, the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. JCS said it had detected a large amount of debris from the rocket in the sea just two minutes after launch, however. The object launched by North Korea disappeared over the Yellow Sea, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding the government presumes nothing had entered the space. “These launches are in violation of relevant security council resolutions and are a serious matter concerning the safety of our people,” Hayashi said. Japanese public broadcaster NHK showed video of what appeared to be an orange dot flying into the night sky and then bursting into flames in an area close to the border between China and North Korea. A Japanese defence ministry official told reporters that the colour of the flames in the footage suggests that liquid fuel may be burning, but details are currently being analysed, NHK reported. The launch appeared to originate from Dongchang-ri, a northwestern area of the country where North Korea’s main space flight centre is based, JCS said. The Japanese government issued an emergency warning on Monday for residents in the south to take cover from the possible threat of a North Korean missile, before lifting the warning and saying it was not expected to fly over Japanese territory. Japan said over its J-Alert broadcasting system that North Korea appeared to have fired a missile, sending out the warning to residents in the southern prefecture of Okinawa. The launch would be the nuclear-armed North’s attempt to place a second spy satellite into orbit. After several failed attempts that ended when the rockets crashed, North Korea successfully placed its first such satellite in orbit in November. The North’s first bid to launch the new Chollima-1 satellite rocket, on May 31 last year, ended after a failure in the second stage. State media blamed the setback on an unstable and unreliable new engine system and fuel. After the May launch attempt, South Korea retrieved the wreckage of the satellite from the sea and said an analysis showed it had no meaningful use as a reconnaissance platform. Another attempt in August also ended in failure, with stages of the rocket boosters experiencing problems, resulting in the payloads crashing into the sea. North Korea’s space authorities had described the August failure after the rocket booster experienced a problem with its third stage as “not a big issue” in terms of the rocket system’s overall reliability. 02:01 North Korea’s Kim Jong-un guides country’s 1st ‘nuclear trigger’ simulation drills In February, US space experts said North Korea’s first spy satellite, dubbed the Malligyong-1, was “alive”, after detecting changes in its orbit that suggested Pyongyang was successfully controlling the spacecraft – although its capabilities remain unknown. North Korean state media reported that the satellite had transmitted photos of the Pentagon and White House, among other areas, but has not released any of the images. The successful November launch was the first after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a rare trip abroad in September and toured Russia’s most modern space launch centre, where President Vladimir Putin promised to help Pyongyang build satellites. Neither country has elaborated on the extent of that future aid, which could violate United Nations Security Council resolutions against North Korea. Russian experts have visited North Korea to help with the satellite and space rocket programme, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported, citing an unnamed South Korean senior defence official. Pyongyang has said it needs a military reconnaissance satellite to boost monitoring of US and South Korean military activities.",

The club were last in the top flight in 2002. Meanwhile, Leicester boss Enzo Maresca looks set to be named as the new manager of Chelsea following talks between the clubs.

        "content": "Sweden midfielder Kristoffer Olsson is hoping to make a full return to elite-level football as he continues to recover from an acute brain condition that kept him in a hospital for a month. Olsson, who was hospitalised in February after suddenly losing consciousness at home, is still living at a neurological rehabilitation centre but made his first public appearance since the illness when he attended his Danish club Midtjylland’s game on Sunday as it won the domestic league title. After the game, Olsson was driven around the field in a cart while holding the trophy as he was applauded by fans. In an interview with Swedish newspaper on Monday, Olsson said he is confident of making a full recovery and is “dreaming of being back with the team and training again.” The 28-year-old Olsson was diagnosed with several small blood clots in the brain as a result of an extremely rare blood-vessel inflammation. He was placed on a ventilator at the hospital and said he has no memories of a three-week period when “I was basically dying.” He said he is now making steady progress in his recovery and has already started kicking a ball around at the rehab centre. “I played a bit of football here the other day, with a member of staff,” Olsson was quoted as saying. “She was in goal.” It’s still unclear, however, when Olsson can even return home and resume a normal life, much less resume playing professional sports. “Of course, you want to return as quickly as possible and fight to get there,” he said. “But I’m not stressing over that, it will take the time it takes. But I can move well, I can run, and my memory is good. I’m getting better with each day.” Olsson has played 47 times for Sweden, most recently against Estonia in November. He joined Midtjylland in 2022 for a second spell, having previously played for Anderlecht in Belgium, Krasnodar in Russia, AIK in Sweden and in the youth teams at English club Arsenal. He said being back inside the stadium for Midtjylland’s title celebrations was a great feeling — but also quite tiring. “That was a vibe that I’ve missed, to watch some live football and see my team and everyone I know so well,” he said. “And then to hear the supporters sing about me and the team ... it was fantastic to be there. But it was also a lot to take in, so I got tired pretty quickly.” Comments Related Topics",

        "description": "An Israeli airstrike in Rafah has sparked a fire that has killed 45 people in a tent camp.",
        "content": "An Israeli airstrike has triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials have said, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt the assault. or signup to continue reading In scenes grimly familiar from a war in its eighth month, Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after the strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel's military said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against Hamas commanders in Rafah had caused the fire. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit. \"We were praying ... and we were getting our children's beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,\" said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. \"All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.\" The attack took place in the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on \"precise intelligence\", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\" over Israel's latest attacks. \"These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,\" he said on X. Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. \"International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,\" Baerbock said. By daylight, the camp was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah's western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. \"The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,\" he said. \"What have they done to deserve this? Their children have been orphaned.\" Hospitals in Rafah, including the International Committee of the Red Cross field hospital, were unable to handle all the wounded, so some were moved to hospitals in Khan Younis further north in Gaza for treatment, medics said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned \"the heinous massacre.\" Israeli tanks continued to bombard eastern and central areas of the city in southern Gaza on Monday, killing eight, local health officials said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives.

        "content": "Eight of the wild birds seen forging a devastating trail of wanton destruction in Snettisham (Picture: SWNS) Life in a quiet Norfolk village has been turned upside down by an invasion of feral chickens – or at least that’s how some locals describe the situation. Around 100 of the wildfowl have colonised a lane in Snettisham, where one resident says life is now ‘hell’. The winged terrors allegedly begin clucking at 4am and have no qualms breaking into people’s gardens and pecking through flowers and vegetable patches in search of food. Tensions have flared between locals and outsiders who have been stopping to feed the chickens, attracting ‘sizeable’ rats and causing litter to pile up – with one repeat offender attracting verbal abuse in the street. Rod Mackenzie, a parish councillor who lives on the road, said: ‘They’re a pain in the butt. If they come into your garden they dig everything up. ‘It’s not just food for the chickens, it’s every bit of detritus they can find and that brings rats. ‘What was it someone left the other week? A quart of pink prawns. The rats are quite sizeable around here and they breed like hell.’ One such cockerel brazenly strutting about like he owns the place (Picture: SWNS) The birds, which descend from escaped domesticated chickens, are thought to have lived in a woodland bordering the village for many years before recently expanding their territory. Company director Ben King, 48, who also lives on the lane where the birds nest, said he has to wear earplugs to sleep at night. He said: ‘They’re out of control now, there’s not just one or two. They’ve started coming into gardens and you get rats as well. ‘If someone came and moved them, I’d buy them a big beer.’ There are also divisions between those who want rid of the birds and others who say they add to Snettisham’s charm. Graeme McQuade, 43, who has lived on the lane for 18 months after moving from Cambridge, said: ‘I have no issues with the chickens whatsoever. Two chickens seen plotting to antagonise yet another hapless denizen of Snettisham (Picture: SWNS) ‘Before we moved here, we didn’t know chickens get up at 4am, but it gives character to the place.’ Another dissenter, who did not wish to be named, suggested the issue was a classic case of NIMBYism fuelled by new-build owners. ‘People in the new houses are moaning about them but they’ve been here such a long time and there’s more important things going on in the world than a few chickens,’ the individual said. ‘They should get a life.’ ‘Two of them have been in my garden since they were babies and they don’t bother me. ‘There’s a lady from Heacham that comes and feeds them and she’s had abuse.’ Some residents actually quite like the birds (Picture: SWNS) The matter was raised before Snettisham Parish Council, who were told there was ‘uncertainty’ over the ownership of the land where most of the chickens are nesting. The minutes of its latest meeting state: ‘Councillors noted the concerns of residents local to the area with people dumping food waste for the chickens. ‘This was leaving foul-smelling waste and encouraging rats to the area,’ the minutes continue, adding that there was a potential ‘heath hazard’. The powers-that-be decreed that warning signs shall be put up asking people not to feed the birds. Specialists shall also be contacted for advice, presenting the opportunity of a lifetime for any experts on the behaviour of feral chickens in the British Isles should they be able to squeeze it into their presumably packed schedules. Enquiries will be made as to vacancies at a chicken rehoming charity. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page .

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition.

        "content": "This news has been read 117 times! Kuwait City, May 27: Zain, a leading provider of innovative technologies and digital lifestyle communications operating in seven markets across the Middle East and Africa, continues to be recognized for its leadership endeavors in the areas of Sustainability and Gender Diversity, in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Zain was presented with the Leadership in SDGs Award 2023; and Championship Award in Women Empowerment 2024 at the 9th Annual Global Good Governance Awards organized by Cambridge IFA, a UK-based think tank. The Awards celebrate individuals, governments, public and private sector institutions, and NGOs that exhibit governance and sustainability as their strategic priority. Zain remains one of the most active organizations in the region with respect to delivering meaningful connectivity that leads to equitable systemic change through its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives, with the company playing a crucial role in empowering the markets in which it operates to reap the benefits of digital transformation for the benefit of the communities it serves and beyond. The recognition of these prestigious awards is testament not only to how much Zain believes in its purpose, but how relentless the company is ensuring its operations are a positive, inclusive force for good, with a commitment to continuing to instill these principles at the heart of the organization. SUSTAINABILITY Zain Group’s 2023 Sustainability Report (SR), marking its 13th annual sustainability report entitled ‘The Pathway to Value Creation’ reflects the company’s progress and efforts to address deficits and challenges across its footprint while providing Meaningful Connectivity that leads to Equitable Systemic Change through the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The report demonstrates how the company addresses its social, economic, environmental, and human rights related impacts and how Zain continues to execute on its five-year, 2025 corporate sustainability strategy aiming to deliver meaningful and sustainable value across Zain’s operating companies and beyond. In 2023, Zain joined the United Nations (UN) Global Compact initiative, a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices as well as committing to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) emission. Notably, the A- score that Zain maintained in the latest ‘CDP Score Report–Climate Change 2023’, positioned the company first in the region and among leaders globally with respect to climate action initiatives. Gender Diversity (WE) Zain has been actively working on narrowing the gender divide in leadership roles at the company. Under its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion women empowerment (WE) pillar, Zain Group has been a pioneering force for women empowerment regionally since 2017. This gender diversity initiative was created at a time when only 14.5% of Zain’s leadership comprised of women, and a target was set to increase this percentage of women leadership to 25% by 2025. Three Zain operations have already achieved their WE leadership targets in 2023, Zain Jordan at 27.3%, UAE based ZainTECH at 27.0%, and Zain Kuwait at 26.9%. For some time now, women have represented the higher proportion of university graduates in the region, yet this does not translate into positions within the workforce, let alone senior positions. Hence, the issue of women’s empowerment is an important topic for Zain, which has embedded this issue into the DNA and heart of the company’s corporate strategy. During 2023, women made up over 33% of Zain’s total recruitment, and the company recently revolutionized its staff-friendly Family Leave Policy clauses, reinforcing its position as one of the most impactful DEI organizations in the region, if not the world.

        "content": "Of course two of the Connecticut city’s favorite visitor destinations got prime mention. For Hartford, that means the Mark Twain House and Museum and Harriet Beecher Stowe Center. After all, both of those people were famous Hartford residents whose names live on due to their literary genius. But those are just two places that help Hartford make the list by U.S. News and World Report of the “Best Places to Live.” We suspect Nutmeggers won’t take too kindly to Hartford only coming in at No. 148 on the list, as the city is the seat of state government, has sports team, an immense amount of things to do, and lots of famous businesses. But yes, the competition on this list was tough. And Hartford also weighed in at a higher No. 56 on the list of “Best Places to Retire.” In terms of so-called “best places” competition, Naples, Florida came in first, with U.S. News noting it’s “nestled between the edges of the Everglades and the shores of the Gulf of Mexico sits Collier County, home to Naples, Immokalee and Marco Island, as well as a range of distinctly Florida flavors.” But Connecticut wins too, according to the ranking, “Even as one of the oldest cities in America, Hartford, Connecticut, has a lot to offer, both old and new. “Located in the Connecticut River Valley, Hartford has many cultural gems hidden amid rolling hills and wooded neighborhoods. In the centuries since its founding, Hartford has been home to several notable historical figures, including renowned authors Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe, (yes, we all knew that already.) Now, “ Hartford’s central business district is home to several historic attractions and entertainment venues, along with nearby vineyards, state parks and ski slopes, which provide plenty of recreational opportunities throughout the year,” according to the new ranking.

(Courant file photo) And, the ranking notes, “Hartford attracts people from all walks of life, and its population is fairly diverse. The surrounding suburbs are great alternatives to urban living for families who can afford them.” But there are many people who are seeking to live in Hartford, and clearly relish the idea of city life. And amid things to do in the city? The list is nearly endless. Think sports? There is a lot off opportunity for sports fans here. And education? Yes, there’s that too. Room for growth? In many ways, that is what Hartford is all about these days. Great food choices? An abundance in the city and close by. So even though Hartford came in at No. 148 on a list of 150 places, there are plenty of reasons the city is really is the top of the best places. Of note. U.S. News said, “To make the top of the list, a place had to have good value, be a desirable place to live, have a strong job market and a high quality of life.” For more information on how we rank, read the Best Places to Live methodology.",

        "content": "Each year the NFL world witnesses several players raising their game to new heights. While most of these talents were already well known and regarded around the league for the contributions they've made early in their careers, they become the class of their respective positions by taking necessary steps such as putting in extra work in training camp, adding new skills to their repertoire or capitalizing on an improved roster surrounding them. There's plenty of room for new players to follow this path and make an All-Pro leap of their own in 2024. With the retirement of several well-established superstars such as Aaron Donald and Jason Kelce, there are spots openly available for the next generation to step up and take.. With that in mind, here's a look at six players primed to make their initial appearance on the All-Pro first team next season Brocky Purdy has experienced a meteoric rise from being the Mr.Irrelevant selection of the 2022 draft to becoming an MVP finalist in just his first full season as a starter. At the age of 24, the rising SanFrancisco 49ers star is already a Pro Bowler and experienced playoff signal-caller who is only scratching the surface of his potential. Purdy should soontake another leap towards greatness. While his rapid development had some luck involved since he was fortunate enough to land with an elite team and injuries helped him ascend the depth chart, it was sheer talent that allowed him to put a stranglehold on the job once he secured it. After winning his first five regular season starts and two playoff games as a rookie, it took a serious injury in that year's NFC Championship Game to slow Purdy. San Francisco's brass clearly saw enough by then to commit to him and proved that by trading away Trey Lance, ending any chance of a quarterback controversy in the Bay Area. Purdy healed in time for the 2023 campaign and took advantage of the clearpath towards superstardom. His stellar campaign now hashim set up to be San Francisco's top signal-caller for years to come. While Purdy's chances of earning an MVP award in 2023 were derailed with some uncharacteristic turnovers and middling play late in the year, he still completed 69.4 percent of his throws for 4,280 yards and 31 touchdowns. His output dipped with the competition ratcheting up in the playoffs, but Purdy still led his side back from a huge deficit in the NFC Championship Game and went all the way to overtime in the Super Bowl before coming up just short of his first Lombardi Trophy. That likely won't be the last glimpse of Purdy on the league's biggest stage. With San Francisco returning most of the key talent from last year's squad and augmenting it with several key free-agent and draft acquisitions, the Niners' quarterback will be better than ever in 2024 following his first healthy offseason as the team's QB1. Despite playing in one of the league's most inept offenses for the entirety of his two-year career, George Pickens has still managed to put up some respectable numbers while positioning himself to soon emerge as one of the NFL's next great wideouts. The 23-year-old put himself on the map as a rookie when hecaught 52 passes for 801 yards and four scores and further elevated his game duringa 63-catch, 1,140-yard, five-touchdown sophomore campaign in 2023. Pickens accomplished these impressive numbers while working within the constraints of former offensive coordinator Matt Canada's scheme, a limited system primarily orchestrated by quarterback Kenny Pickett, who failed to develop into the franchise signal-caller the Steelers were hoping he'd become. With Arthur Smith taking over as Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator and nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson ready to revitalize his career with the club, it should come as little surprise if and when Pickens makes a herculean leap in Year 3. There's no shortage of motivation for Pickens to improve his game. He's already publicly griped about being denied a Pro Bowl invite during his rookie year and again came up short of that stated goal despite the increase in production last season. According to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , the wideout admitted he hasn't even been sleeping some nights while thinking about football. He also stated that he has plenty of untapped potential, a ceiling that Wilson should be able to help him reach in 2024: When asked by Mackey to put a percentage on the talent he's shown so far in the NFL, Pickens responded: \"I'd probably say 80%. I can only go off of how the quarterback plays. I can thrive more...The yardage showed it. I should have made the Pro Bowl.\" If the already ultra-talented wideout gets 20 percent better this season, opposing defenses are going to have a hard time stopping Pickens. He's already set for a noticeable increase in production with Diontae Johnson out of the picture, but Pickens will become a legitimate All-Pro superstar should he raise his game while garnering more targets. The Dallas Cowboys proved they made the right decision in letting incumbent No. 1 tight end Dalton Schultz walk in free agency last year. The replacement, Jake Ferguson, not only matched his predecessor's impressive contributions, but surpassed them in his first year as a starter. Ferguson, a fourth-round pick in the 2022 draft, quickly became an impact talent at a position that can often take multiple seasons to meaningfully contribute at after being drafted. While he hadjust 19 catches for 174 yards and two scores as a rookie working behindSchultz, he stepped into the spotlight in 2023 and finished the year with 761yards and five scores on 71 receptions. That output helped earn Ferguson his first Pro Bowl nod—something Schultz never accomplished—and there appears to be plenty more accolades in his future. In an interview with ESPN's Todd Archer , the 25-year-old admitted his game is far from complete and spoke about his plans to improve this offseason. Jason Witten, the gold standard for a Cowboys tight end, believes Ferguson is a worthy heir to his throne and believes he'll continue to develop further in 2024 (per Archer): \"I think he can do it all,\" Witten said, \"He'sa willing blocker. He can bend. ... Looks like he's smart. He's got greatchemistry with Dak. Good charisma. He can run. He understands separation. So Ithink now seeing himself do it, here's where the growth comes.\" If Ferguson rounds out his game and becomes an even bigger part of Dallas' offensive plans this coming season, he'll be right in the mix for All-Pro honors. The Philadelphia Eagles have been reaping the rewards of the NFL's International Pathway Program. The club took a chance on former Australian rugby player Jordan Mailata, who came up through the program, late in the 2018 draft and rapidly molded his raw, inexperienced talent into one of the league's top left tackles. Mailata had the unteachable size and athleticism to dominate at that position, but it took tutelage from the club's coaching staff to turn the 6'8\", 365-pounder into a premium NFL player. Now that he's entering his seventh campaign—and fifth as a starter—Mailata looks ready to make a leap into the top-tier of his profession. Despite signing a four-year, $64 million contract in 2021and re-upping on a pricy three-year, $66 million extension back in April,Mailata has yet to earn any Pro Bowl or All-Pro distinctions. Pro Football Focus has taken note of his contributions, however, as the site has consistently dishedout stellar grades to the Sydney native. Mailata earned a strong PFF grade of 84.1 in 2023 after he gave up just three sacks across 1,147 offensive snaps. He was named to PFF's second-team All-Pro squad at the left tackle position, trailing only a generational star in Trent Williams. It was the second time in the last three years that Mailata finished as a runner-up to Williams and he will have an opportunity to finally surpass Williams in 2024. Although he now has plenty of reps under his belt, Mailata is only 27 years old and still honing his craft after getting such a late start playing football. The Philadelphia standout is on the cusp of finally putting it all together and will become a fixture on the All-Pro team once he does. Maxx Crosby has established himself as a true force on the edge, but he's still lacking the hardware to prove he's the premiere talent at his premium position. While he's garnered three consecutive Pro Bowl nods and made the second All-Pro team in two of the last three years, he's yet to make a first-team leap. Expect that to change in 2024 as Crosby prepares to take his game to the next level. During an appearance on the The NFL Report with Steve Wyche, Brian Baldinger, and James Palmer, Crosby said he's made major strides this offseason: \"I pride myself on being the best in every category, and I know I'm getting close to that every single day, So, it's been an incredible offseason, I feel great, my knee is feeling great, my hand as well. So, yeah, I've got the best team around me.\" Opposing quarterbacks should fear an even more dangerous Crosby, as he's been consistently contributing since placing second in the Defensive Rookie of the Year race back in 2019. The Eastern Michigan product has tallied 52 sacks—including a career-best 14.5 last year—and 202 pressures . He's also established himself as a true three-down defensive end who has logged a considerable 4,746 defensive snaps since entering the league. The Raiders clearly expect more from Crosby in 2024 too as the club raised his pay to be more commensurate with his contributions. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter , the pass rusher had an additional $6 million tacked onto the four-year, $95 million contract extension he signed in 2022 without any years being added to the deal. With more financial security and a strong offseason underhis belt, Crosby will be in the running to lead the league in sacks and finally breakthrough as a first-team All-Pro superstar. The Chicago Bears made plenty of headlines this offseason for their marquee draft selections and free-agent signings, but the long-term extension they hammered out with a homegrown talent was arguably one of their mostimpactful moves. By locking down rising star corner Jaylon Johnson through the 2027 season, the Bears shored up the cornerback position for the foreseeablefuture Johnson had a career year, earning his firstPro Bowl nod and securing second-team All-Pro honors to prove it. Although he's been a fixture in the starting lineup since the club selected him in the second round of the 2020 draft, Johnson elevated his game to another level. He secured a career-high four interceptions—including one returned for a touchdown—and only allowed a personal-best completion rate of 55.2 percent while giving up just two touchdowns across the 58 targets he faced in 2023. Johnson scored a phenomenal 90.8 Pro Football Focus grade and landed a spot on the site's first-team All-Pro squad . PFF noted that he allowed a mere 195 yards on plays in which he was the primary coverage defender—the fewest of any corner to log at least 250 coverage snaps this past season. Chicago rewarded Johnson by giving him a four-year, $76million contract just days after hitting the cornerback with the franchise tag. Only 25 years old and barely scratching the surface of his immense potential, Johnson will play a critical role over the next few years for a Bears squad seeking to exit its rebuild and become a contender. If Johnson develops into a regular on the All-Pro first team—a real possibility based on his rare mix of proven production and vast potential—Chicago will be a nightmare matchup for opposing quarterbacks.",

        "content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said the Modi government has reshaped the Union budget in the last 10 years from a mere record of expenditure to a strategic blueprint for equitable distribution, and stressed that the pace of reforms will continue to make India a developed nation. Sitharaman said the government will continue to maximise the value and impact of hard-earned taxpayer money, ensuring it is put to the best possible use for the benefit of all. The minister said the Modi government has prioritised transparency in its budgeting practices and numbers. Countries with transparent budgets are often viewed favourably by international bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank. This can lead to improved global trust. “This starkly contrasts the @INCIndia-led UPA government’s repetitive practice of hiding the deficits through off-budget borrowings and issuance of ‘Oil Bonds’, which somewhat covertly shifted the fiscal burden to future generations. Under UPA, standard fiscal practices were routinely changed to make Budget numbers look favourable,” Sitharaman said in a post on X. She said the last decade has witnessed a substantial improvement in the sanctity and credibility of the Union Budget, leaving past constraints and archaic practices behind. “Our government has reshaped the budget from a mere record of expenditures into a strategic blueprint for equitable development. We make judicious & efficient use of every rupee collected from our taxpayers and give them a transparent picture of public finances,” Sitharaman said. The minister said the government has taken various reforms to strengthen and bring transparency to the budgetary process and practices. Since FY 2017-18, the budget presentation has been shifted to 1st February instead of the last working day in February. It effectively advanced the expenditure cycle by two months, she said. Sitharaman further said reform in government expenditure by bringing in Treasury Single Account (TSA) for the ‘just-in-time’ release of funds to autonomous bodies has lowered the borrowing costs for the Centre. “TSA has resulted in savings of more than Rs 15,000 crores to date,” she said. Sitharaman said the Union government administers 108 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) through state and UT governments, with a budget of approximately Rs 5.01 lakh crore for FY 2024-25 and Rs. 4.76 lakh crore for FY 2023-24. Previously, it was challenging to ascertain the timeliness and amount of funds released to the implementing agencies under a CSS and to determine whether the funds were from the Centre or the state. However, with the implementation of Single Nodal Agency (SNA), under which each state has to identify and designate a Single Nodal Agency (SNA) for every CSS, there have been savings of about Rs 10,592 crore from 2021-22 to date. Sitharaman said the Union budgets under the Modi government are characterised by fiscal prudence, transparency, and inclusiveness, ensuring investments in social development and infrastructure. The Modi government, the minister said, is committed to harnessing cutting-edge technology, enhancing transparency, and pursuing ongoing reforms to lay a strong foundation for a Viksit Bharat. “We will continue to maximise the value and impact of hard-earned taxpayer money, ensuring it is put to the best possible use for the benefit of all,” she said.",

        "content": "Best News Website or Mobile Service WAN-IFRA Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Best News Website or Mobile Service Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 MADRID :A Spanish judge ordered soccer ruling bodies FIFA and UEFA to halt their opposition to a parallel European competition known as the European Super League (ESL), ruling they were practising anticompetitive behaviour and abusing their dominant position. Judge Sofia Gil Garcia ruled that the governing bodies violated European Union law by banning clubs from participating in a proposed new professional soccer championship, a court statement said on Monday. In the ruling, Gil Garcia also ordered FIFA and UEFA to immediately reverse any anticompetitive actions committed in the past. The case was brought by A22 Sports Management, the sports development company behind the plan to create the ESL, against the Spanish Soccer Federation, Spain's LaLiga, UEFA and FIFA, who had blocked the ESL. \"The era of the monopoly is now definitively over,\" A22 CEO Bernd Reichart said in a statement after the ruling, calling it \"an important step towards a truly competitive and sustainable club football landscape in Europe\". Reichart added that UEFA had stifled innovation for decades and clubs \"should not have to fear threats of sanctions simply for having ideas and conversations\". Gil Garcia's ruling followed a similar decision by the European Court of Justice in December. In a Monday statement, La Liga insisted the ruling does not explicitly support the creation of the Super League. The proposal in 2021 of a breakaway league by Europe's 12 leading clubs sparked widespread protests among fans and threats of sanctions by UEFA, leading nine of them to pull out. A22 had said UEFA and FIFA held a monopolistic position that breached the EU's Competition and Free Movement Law. The ECJ ruled against UEFA and FIFA, though it did not comment specifically on whether the ESL could go ahead. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and nine other top European clubs announced the plan in April, 2021. The move collapsed within 48 hours, however, after a public outcry that forced Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid to withdraw.",

        "description": "One passenger recalled the terrifying moment the Singapore Airlines flight plunged 6,000ft and said 'there was no time for a pilot message, the seatbelt sign was off'",
        "content": "41 people are still being treated in hospitals across Bangkok after a horror turbulence-hit Singapore Airlines flight left one British tourist dead. Officials believe the turbulence started during meal service, when many passengers were not wearing seat belts, as one passenger recalled how the plane suddenly plunged 6,000ft and \"there was no time for a pilot message, the seatbelt sign was off\". Samitivej Hospital, where the majority of the 104 injured individuals were treated, confirmed 41 people were still receiving treatment across three hospitals in Bangkok. The injuries ranged from spinal and spinal cord damage to skull or brain injuries, as well as harm to bones or internal organs. As of Sunday, 33 individuals, including nine Brits - one in intensive care and eight in the inpatient department - are being cared for. The plane, which was carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members - including 47 UK passengers and four Irish nationals - made a sharp descent of 6,000ft in about three minutes before diverting to Thailand. Iago Peteiro Pereda and his wife Estrella from Vigo, Spain, the only Spanish nationals on flight SQ321, were en route to Singapore to kick off their global honeymoon trip. They told how their holiday plans quickly went awry. Flight SQ321 was approximately 11 hours into its 13-hour journey. Most of the window shades were drawn, and passengers were waking up after mostly sleeping through the flight. The plane made a sharp descent of 6,000ft in about three minutes ( Image: ViralPress) Iago said: \"I was stretching my legs, it was the start of the breakfast service, so some people were in the toilet, some were stretching, the crew was with the breakfast. We were both in our seats.\" Estrella added: \"When the turbulence started, I put my belt on. He was putting his belt on.\" But, without any warning, the aircraft suddenly dropped, catapulting Iago and other passengers into the air, the Daily Express reports. \"I remember a couple of moments of turbulence, then a huge drop. I hit the ceiling and I landed on the armrest, sitting down, in a vertical position. It was very rough. I didn't have time to have my belt on, it was very quick... a matter of seconds. There was no time for a pilot message, the seatbelt sign was off. A couple minutes later, it was complete chaos.\" If Iago had fastened his seatbelt just a few moments earlier, he might have avoided injury. Estrella said she escaped serious harm because she was buckled up. \"Everything was a nightmare. People were flying, hitting, blood, things flying around, everything broken,\" Iago said. Since the incident, doctors have diagnosed Iago with a fracture in his vertebrae. He is currently wearing a neck brace, but thankfully, his injury is not life-threatening. \"It's not critical. Maybe for a couple of weeks I'll have this neck brace on. We were really lucky,\" he said. The Spanish newlyweds are currently residing in Bangkok, planning to return home to Vigo thereafter. Their global honeymoon itinerary included New Zealand, Hawaii, and Los Angeles before this catastrophic incident occurred. Singapore Airlines reassured that several existing measures would ensure safety during adverse weather conditions; crew members have been instructed to secure loose objects within the cabin and galley areas, reducing potential injuries arising from turbulence. A closer eye will also be kept on individuals who may need additional help, like those using the toilet. 41 people are still being treated in hospitals across Bangkok ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) A local publication, The Singapore Straits Times, reported that there have been six turbulence-induced incidents with Singapore Airlines flights in the last 20 years. These have led to the injuries of some passengers and crew members, with Tuesday's event being the only one where a fatality was recorded. 73-year-old Geoff Kitchen from Thornbury, Gloucestershire, tragically passed away after allegedly suffering a heart attack onboard the SQ321 flight. His spouse, Linda, is currently receiving medical attention in Bangkok. A South London broker, Josh Silverstone, who was also a passenger on the fateful flight, said: \"I woke up on the floor, I didn't realise what happened - I must have hit my head somewhere. I thought I was going to die. I bought some airplane WIFI, and text my mum, trying not to scare her, and just saying 'I love you'. It was pretty scary.\" Mr Silverstone, aged 24, has been released from the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The cause of Tuesday's severe turbulence remains unknown but is suspected to be clear air turbulence - known as the most treacherous type that often hits without any visible signs in the sky. Wind shear - which can transpire within thin cirrus clouds or even in clear patches near thunderstorms due to variances in temperature and pressure causing hefty currents of rapidly moving air - has been suggested as a possible source. Singapore Airlines formally apologised for the chaotic incident. CEO Goh Choon Phong has promised the airline will fully cooperate with all areas of the investigation and extended his support by visiting those who are currently hospitalised. In the wake of one fatality and several injuries aboard, the airline said it would suspend meal services and ensure all cabin crew were secured when planes encounter turbulence, for a \"more cautious approach to managing turbulence in-flight\". The airline said in a statement: \"In addition to the suspension of hot beverage service when the seat belt sign is on, the meal service will also be suspended. Crew members will also return to their seats and secure their seat belts when the seat belt sign is on.”",

        "description": "Closing arguments in the former president's hush money trial are scheduled to start Tuesday.",
        "content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING Former President Donald Trump spent the weekend attacking Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Judge Juan Merchan as his New York hush money trial enters its final stages. The defense rested its case last week without Trump taking the stand. Closing arguments are now scheduled to start Tuesday. Merchan will then give the 12 jurors instructions, which are expected to last an hour, before they can proceed with closed-door deliberations to reach a verdict in the case. Advertisement In a series of posts on his Truth Social platform, the former president once again complained about the charges leveled against him, claiming the entire case is led by his main rival in the 2024 race, President Joe Biden , in order to damage his chances in November. “There is NO CASE, just a Democrat Persecutor controlled by Crooked Joe Biden’s White House, a Democrat Judge, and a biased venue,” Trump wrote Sunday . “This is nothing but an Election Interfering Witch Hunt, and the American People know it! MAGA2024.” Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records over a hush money payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to all charges. On Saturday, the former president also blasted special counsel Jack Smith for seeking a gag order for him in the classified documents case over his latest false allegations that FBI agents were prepared to shoot him during the 2022 raid on his Mar-a-Lago property. Advertisement “I guess they’re hoping they can silence me from telling the TRUTH like the Corrupt and Highly Conflicted Judge in New York City has done,” Trump wrote . Prosecutors said Trump’s comments have “endangered law enforcement officers involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case and threatened the integrity of these proceedings.” Trump has been charged with 40 felony counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice, over his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House in January 2021. He has denied wrongdoing. Smith is also prosecuting a second case against Trump over the former president’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump spent the weekend attacking Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Judge Juan Merchan as his New York hush money trial enters its final stages. The defense rested its case last week without Trump taking the stand. Closing arguments are now to start Tuesday. Merchan will then give the 12 jurors instructions, which are expected to last an hour, before they can proceed with closed-door deliberations to reach a verdict in the case. In a series of posts on his Truth Social platform, the former president once again complained about the charges leveled against him, claiming the entire case is led by his main rival in the 2024 race, President Joe Biden, in order to damage his chances in November. “There is NO CASE, just a Democrat Persecutor controlled by Crooked Joe Biden’s White House, a Democrat Judge, and a biased venue,” Trump . “This is nothing but an Election Interfering Witch Hunt, and the American People know it! MAGA2024.” Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records over a hush money payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to all charges. On Saturday, the former president also blasted special counsel Jack Smith for for him in the classified documents case over his latest that FBI agents were prepared to shoot him during the 2022 raid on his Mar-a-Lago property. “I guess they’re hoping they can silence me from telling the TRUTH like the Corrupt and Highly Conflicted Judge in New York City has done,” Trump . Prosecutors said Trump’s comments have “endangered law enforcement officers involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case and threatened the integrity of these proceedings.” Trump has been charged with 40 felony counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice, over his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House in January 2021. He has denied wrongdoing. Smith is also prosecuting a second case against Trump over the former president’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.",

BANGKOK – Canadian boxer Terris Smith defeated Bulgaria’s Aslahan Mehmedova 3-0 on points in their round-of-16 bout Monday to advance at a last-ditch Olympic qualifying tournament. The 31-year-old from Victoria moves on in the women’s 60-kilogram division at the Haumark Stadium. Also Monday, Montreal’s Keven Beausejour, 24, lost 3-2 to Japan’s Go Wakaya in round-of-16 action in the men’s 80-kilogram class. On Sunday, Junior Petanqui defeated Shain Boniface from the Seychelles in a round-of-32 bout in the men’s 71-kilogram division. The 25-year-old from Montreal earned a 5-0 decision in his round-of-32 bout. Canada coach Samir (Sammy) El Mais called it “a great performance for his first bout.” “His jab couldn’t miss all fight,” he said in a statement. “He used his range, his experience and out classed his opponent winning unanimously.” On Tuesday, Petanqui faces Armenia’s Gurgen Madoyan and Scarlett Delgado, a 28-year-old from Brampton, Ont., meets Kenya’s Amina Faki in round-of-16 action in the women’s 54-kilogram class. Canadian Victor Tremblay lost via walkover Friday after failing to make weight for his first fight in the 57-kilogram bracket. “Victor has demonstrated incredible dedication and commitment to representing our nation on the international stage,” El Mais said. “However, ensuring the safety and well-being of our athletes always takes precedence. It was a tough decision, but ultimately, it was the right one.” The 19-year-old from Montreal is remaining with the team. “While I am disappointed that I won’t be able to compete, I understand the importance of maintaining my health and safety,” Tremblay said in a statement. “I will continue to train hard and support my teammates in any way I can.” Nine Canadians entered the Bangkok tournament trying to fight their way into this summer’s Olympic field Canada has already qualified two boxers for Paris, which features 13 weight classes — seven for men and six for women. The number of Olympic boxing divisions for men has gone down by one while the women’s competition has added one since Tokyo. But there will parity in total numbers of athletes with 124 men and 124 women. Middleweight Tammara Thibeault (75 kilograms) and welterweight Wyatt Sanford (63.5 kilograms) secured their Olympic berths via gold-medal performances at year’s Pan American Games. Both were members of Canada’s five-boxer team for the Tokyo Olympics. The Bangkok qualifier, which runs through June 3, will determine the final 51 quota places (23 for women and 28 for men) for the Paris Games. Olympic boxing qualification comes in the form of several steps. The first were five continental qualifiers, with the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, covering the Americas. A first World Qualification Tournament was then held in Busto Arzizio, Italy, from Feb. 29 to March 12. Competitors essentially had to finish in the top four in Italy to secure Olympic qualification, although that figure varied in some weight classes. Canada had two athletes finish in the top eight — Delgado and super-heavyweight Alexis Barriere, who subsequently opted to focus on a pro career. Just making the Olympic field is an accomplishment, given the sport’s popularity around the world and the fact each country can have no more than one competitor in a weight class. More than 75 countries took part in boxing at the Tokyo Games. Competitors will again need to crack the top four in Bangkok to punch their ticket to Paris. That measuring stick can change, however, given host France is guaranteed a maximum of six quota places (three for women and three for men) so can claim a spot in a weight class even if it doesn’t qualify a fighter. That means some weight classes may require a top-three finish for Olympic qualification. It could also become top five if an already qualified competitor is injured or suspended. There will be no title bouts at the Bangkok event, with action in each weight class coming to a halt when the final Olympic berths are determined. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Canada has won 17 Olympic boxing medals (three gold, seven silver and seven bronze), but none since 1996 when heavyweight David Defiagbon won silver in Atlanta. The Paris boxing competition runs July 27 to Aug. 1 in the North Paris Arena and Roland-Garros Stadium. The Olympic qualifying events were organized under the authority of the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU), an ad-hoc group created by the International Olympic Committee’s executive board. The PBU was tasked with overseeing qualifying and running the boxing competition at the games following the IOC’s suspension and the subsequent withdrawal of recognition of the International Boxing Association (IBA). — This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 Advertisement Advertisement",

To honour Western's people-first culture and understand that staff have different scheduling needs, this year's National Walk was held over a week (May 20-24) rather than one dedicated day. This allowed Canada's insurance broker to give greater flexibility for more people to participate. Teams walked together from their local branch, remote individuals walked in their own neighbourhoods, or even staff on holiday took the time to put in 5kms in new surroundings. The ultimate goal was to make the walk as easy, accessible and flexible as possible to encourage participation. \"It's incredible to see the spirit of giving back and the passion our people have for taking care of our communities,\" said Michelle Mak, Director, Western Communities Foundation. \"Western has held this annual walk since 2005. It's become a company mainstay; team members are excited to take part and they're really passionate about the charities we're supporting.\" Employees from coast to coast took to social media with photos of their walk experiences. From scenic trails to city streets, Western's team showcased their spirit and dedication. Check out Western's Facebook and LinkedIn pages for more. Western Financial Group Inc.

        "content": "BANGKOK — Canadian boxer Terris Smith defeated Bulgaria's Aslahan Mehmedova 3-0 on points in their round-of-16 bout Monday to advance at a last-ditch Olympic qualifying tournament.

The number of Olympic boxing divisions for men has gone down by one while the women's competition has added one since Tokyo. But there will parity in total numbers of athletes with 124 men and 124 women. Middleweight Tammara Thibeault (75 kilograms) and welterweight Wyatt Sanford (63.5 kilograms) secured their Olympic berths via gold-medal performances at year's Pan American Games. Both were members of Canada's five-boxer team for the Tokyo Olympics. The Bangkok qualifier, which runs through June 3, will determine the final 51 quota places (23 for women and 28 for men) for the Paris Games. Olympic boxing qualification comes in the form of several steps. The first were five continental qualifiers, with the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, covering the Americas. A first World Qualification Tournament was then held in Busto Arzizio, Italy, from Feb. 29 to March 12. Competitors essentially had to finish in the top four in Italy to secure Olympic qualification, although that figure varied in some weight classes. Canada had two athletes finish in the top eight — Delgado and super-heavyweight Alexis Barriere, who subsequently opted to focus on a pro career. Just making the Olympic field is an accomplishment, given the sport's popularity around the world and the fact each country can have no more than one competitor in a weight class. More than 75 countries took part in boxing at the Tokyo Games. Competitors will again need to crack the top four in Bangkok to punch their ticket to Paris. That measuring stick can change, however, given host France is guaranteed a maximum of six quota places (three for women and three for men) so can claim a spot in a weight class even if it doesn't qualify a fighter. That means some weight classes may require a top-three finish for Olympic qualification. It could also become top five if an already qualified competitor is injured or suspended. There will be no title bouts at the Bangkok event, with action in each weight class coming to a halt when the final Olympic berths are determined. Canada has won 17 Olympic boxing medals (three gold, seven silver and seven bronze), but none since 1996 when heavyweight David Defiagbon won silver in Atlanta.

        "content": "Nick Carter's ex Kaya Jones reveals she believed 'something horrific' happened to his rape accuser Melissa Schuman in explosive new docuseries By Deirdre Durkan-simonds For Dailymail.com Published: 16:24, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:41, 27 May 2024 e-mail 7 shares View comments Pussycat Dolls ' Kaya Jones revealed that she believed 'something horrific' happened to Nick Carter 's ex-girlfriend Melissa Schuman, who accused him of raping her . In a preview for Investigation Discovery's docuseries, Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter , Jones, who dated the former Backstreet Boy between 2004 to 2005, recalled reaching out to his rape accuser in 2017 through a direct message on X (previously known as Twitter ). 'Nick Carter was my boyfriend when I was in the Pussycat Dolls, and I saw the very detailed allegation about Nick and the response,' Jones, 39, said in the clip. 'It bothered me. Because it was discrediting this girl [Schuman]. So I wanted to hear what Melissa had to say.' After jumping on the phone with Jones, Schuman recalled that 'Kaya was so kind to' her. Pussycat Dolls' Kaya Jones revealed that she believed 'something horrific' happened to Nick Carter's ex-girlfriend Melissa Schuman, who accused him of rape 'I think we must’ve spoken for hours. I needed someone to tell me that my life wasn’t over,' the He Loves U Not hitmaker said. Jones recalled that after Schuman came forward, she saw a 'young woman trying to speak and someone who thought he had more power and authority to try to shut her up.' This led her to tweet a message to Nick, warning him that she was 'no longer keeping' his secrets and not to 'push it.' 'Because he knows what I know he knows,' she told the cameras. 'He knows why I left him, and, so do I believe that something horrific happened to that girl? Yes, yes, I do.' Schuman, 39, best known for being a member of the American girl group Dream, claims Carter raped her in his Santa Monica apartment back in 2003. She alleged, at the time, she was just 18-year-old, and a virgin. Nick has previously denied her accusation, and insisted their sexual encounter was consensual. The docuseries will feature on-camera interviews with both Jones and Schuman as well as third accuser, named Ashley Repp, who has also accused Nick of sexual misconduct. In a preview for Investigation Discovery's docuseries, Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter, Jones, who dated the former Backstreet Boy between 2004 to 2005, recalled reaching out to his rape accuser in 2017 through a direct message on X (previously known as Twitter); Nick Carter seen last year In an earlier trailer, released last month, Jones said she knew things that could 'burn' Nick's 'house down.' 'Nick looks like a perfect, pretty Ken doll,' she said. 'But I know who evil he can be.' Last year, following the most recent accusation from Repp — who was referred to only by her initials at the time — Carter's attorney Dale Hayes Jr. told DailyMail.com that Nick denies her claims, while describing the three lawsuits as 'malicious schemes.' In February 2024, Carter named Schuman in a $2.3 million suit against another accuser, named Shannon Ruth, who has also accused Carter of sexual assault, TMZ reported. In the suit filed by Carter, the boy band alum said Schuman coached Ruth in an extortion attempt he says has cost him millions in lost wages. 'Nick Carter was my boyfriend when I was in the Pussycat Dolls, and I saw the very detailed allegation about Nick and the response,' Jones, 39, said in the clip. 'It bothered me. Because it was discrediting this girl [Schuman]. So I wanted to hear what Melissa had to say' Schuman, 39, (seen above in 2018), best known for being a member of the American girl group Dream, claims Carter raped her in his Santa Monica apartment back in 2003. His lawyer, Liane K. Wakayama, told TMZ in a statement: 'Melissa Schuman has been peddling this tale for many years, but her allegation was false when she first made it back in 2017 - and it still is.' Wakayama told the outlet that 'a judge in Nevada recently ruled, after reviewing the extensive evidence we laid out, that there are strong grounds for Nick Carter to proceed with his lawsuit against Ms. Schuman for plotting to damage, defame and extort Nick, his associates, his friends and his family.' Carter's lawyer went on to call Schuman's latest filing a 'PR stunt' and vowed that it won't distract the singer 'from his determination to hold Ms. Schuman and her co-conspirators to account for the immeasurable pain and suffering their extortionate conduct has caused.' Fallen Idols: Nick And Aaron Carter premieres on ID and Max on May 7. and on discovery+ in the UK.

        "content": "The St. Ann police are reporting that a man listed as a person of interest in connection with the shooting death of a woman in St. Ann, who was shot and killed while returning from church in Helicon district last Sunday, has been taken into custody. The person of interest, identified as Randy Taile, is said to be the baby father of the deceased, 46-year-old Nadia Binns. Reports indicate that around 2:00 p.m., Binns had just returned home from church and was entering her one-room dwelling when she was ambushed and shot multiple times by armed men. The police were summoned, and upon arrival, they discovered Binns lying in a pool of blood with multiple gunshot wounds. She was transported to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Following her death, Taile was listed as a person of interest. He was apprehended during a special operation carried out in Discovery Bay, St. Ann, on Friday.",

        "content": "BANGKOK - Canadian boxer Terris Smith defeated Bulgaria’s Aslahan Mehmedova 3-0 on points in their round-of-16 bout Monday to advance at a last-ditch Olympic qualifying tournament. The 31-year-old from Victoria moves on in the women’s 60-kilogram division at the Haumark Stadium. Also Monday, Montreal’s Keven Beausejour, 24, lost 3-2 to Japan’s Go Wakaya in round-of-16 action in the men’s 80-kilogram class. On Sunday, Junior Petanqui defeated Shain Boniface from the Seychelles in a round-of-32 bout in the men’s 71-kilogram division. The 25-year-old from Montreal earned a 5-0 decision in his round-of-32 bout. Canada coach Samir (Sammy) El Mais called it “a great performance for his first bout.” “His jab couldn’t miss all fight,” he said in a statement. “He used his range, his experience and out classed his opponent winning unanimously.” On Tuesday, Petanqui faces Armenia’s Gurgen Madoyan and Scarlett Delgado, a 28-year-old from Brampton, Ont., meets Kenya’s Amina Faki in round-of-16 action in the women’s 54-kilogram class. Canadian Victor Tremblay lost via walkover Friday after failing to make weight for his first fight in the 57-kilogram bracket. “Victor has demonstrated incredible dedication and commitment to representing our nation on the international stage,” El Mais said. “However, ensuring the safety and well-being of our athletes always takes precedence. It was a tough decision, but ultimately, it was the right one.” The 19-year-old from Montreal is remaining with the team. “While I am disappointed that I won’t be able to compete, I understand the importance of maintaining my health and safety,” Tremblay said in a statement. “I will continue to train hard and support my teammates in any way I can.” Nine Canadians entered the Bangkok tournament trying to fight their way into this summer’s Olympic field Canada has already qualified two boxers for Paris, which features 13 weight classes — seven for men and six for women. The number of Olympic boxing divisions for men has gone down by one while the women’s competition has added one since Tokyo. But there will parity in total numbers of athletes with 124 men and 124 women. Middleweight Tammara Thibeault (75 kilograms) and welterweight Wyatt Sanford (63.5 kilograms) secured their Olympic berths via gold-medal performances at year’s Pan American Games. Both were members of Canada’s five-boxer team for the Tokyo Olympics. The Bangkok qualifier, which runs through June 3, will determine the final 51 quota places (23 for women and 28 for men) for the Paris Games. Olympic boxing qualification comes in the form of several steps. The first were five continental qualifiers, with the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, covering the Americas. A first World Qualification Tournament was then held in Busto Arzizio, Italy, from Feb. 29 to March 12. Competitors essentially had to finish in the top four in Italy to secure Olympic qualification, although that figure varied in some weight classes. Canada had two athletes finish in the top eight — Delgado and super-heavyweight Alexis Barriere, who subsequently opted to focus on a pro career. Just making the Olympic field is an accomplishment, given the sport’s popularity around the world and the fact each country can have no more than one competitor in a weight class. More than 75 countries took part in boxing at the Tokyo Games. Competitors will again need to crack the top four in Bangkok to punch their ticket to Paris. That measuring stick can change, however, given host France is guaranteed a maximum of six quota places (three for women and three for men) so can claim a spot in a weight class even if it doesn’t qualify a fighter. That means some weight classes may require a top-three finish for Olympic qualification. It could also become top five if an already qualified competitor is injured or suspended. There will be no title bouts at the Bangkok event, with action in each weight class coming to a halt when the final Olympic berths are determined. Canada has won 17 Olympic boxing medals (three gold, seven silver and seven bronze), but none since 1996 when heavyweight David Defiagbon won silver in Atlanta. The Paris boxing competition runs July 27 to Aug. 1 in the North Paris Arena and Roland-Garros Stadium. The Olympic qualifying events were organized under the authority of the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU), an ad-hoc group created by the International Olympic Committee’s executive board. The PBU was tasked with overseeing qualifying and running the boxing competition at the games following the IOC’s suspension and the subsequent withdrawal of recognition of the International Boxing Association (IBA). —- This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024",

        "description": "The people of Snettisham, Norfolk, say the descendants of escaped farmbirds have shattered their idyllic lives.",
        "content": "Life in a quiet Norfolk village has been turned upside down by an invasion of feral chickens – or at least that’s how some locals describe the situation. Around 100 of the wildfowl have colonised a lane in Snettisham, where one resident says life is now ‘hell’. The winged terrors allegedly begin clucking at 4am and have no qualms breaking into people’s gardens and pecking through flowers and vegetable patches in search of food. Tensions have flared between locals and outsiders who have been stopping to feed the chickens, attracting ‘sizeable’ rats and causing litter to pile up – with one repeat offender attracting verbal abuse in the street. Rod Mackenzie, a parish councillor who lives on the road, said: ‘They’re a pain in the butt. If they come into your garden they dig everything up. ‘It’s not just food for the chickens, it’s every bit of detritus they can find and that brings rats. ‘What was it someone left the other week? A quart of pink prawns. The rats are quite sizeable around here and they breed like hell.’ The birds, which descend from escaped domesticated chickens, are thought to have lived in a woodland bordering the village for many years before recently expanding their territory. Company director Ben King, 48, who also lives on the lane where the birds nest, said he has to wear earplugs to sleep at night. He said: ‘They’re out of control now, there’s not just one or two. They’ve started coming into gardens and you get rats as well. ‘If someone came and moved them, I’d buy them a big beer.’ There are also divisions between those who want rid of the birds and others who say they add to Snettisham’s charm. Graeme McQuade, 43, who has lived on the lane for 18 months after moving from Cambridge, said: ‘I have no issues with the chickens whatsoever. ‘Before we moved here, we didn’t know chickens get up at 4am, but it gives character to the place.’ Another dissenter, who did not wish to be named, suggested the issue was a classic case of NIMBYism fuelled by new-build owners. ‘People in the new houses are moaning about them but they’ve been here such a long time and there’s more important things going on in the world than a few chickens,’ the individual said. ‘They should get a life.’ ‘Two of them have been in my garden since they were babies and they don’t bother me. ‘There’s a lady from Heacham that comes and feeds them and she’s had abuse.’ The matter was raised before Snettisham Parish Council, who were told there was ‘uncertainty’ over the ownership of the land where most of the chickens are nesting. The minutes of its latest meeting state: ‘Councillors noted the concerns of residents local to the area with people dumping food waste for the chickens.

        "content": "High River, Alberta, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With care at the core of everything it does at Western Financial Group, this year’s National Walk saw nearly 90% of its team members across Canada donning their Western Communities Foundation t-shirts, getting together with colleagues, partners and community members to walk to raise funds and awareness for local charities. “Western has a history of taking care of our people, and the people who live and work in the communities we serve,” said Kenny Nicholls, Western Financial Group’s President and CEO. “We’re there to help pick up the pieces when things go wrong, and we want to share in the joy when things go right. We share this philosophy with our team members, who use it as a foundation of service with our customers. It only makes sense for us to extend those values to our wider communities.” For every team member who participates in the 5km walk, Western Financial Group makes a $50 donation to support the charities that matter to our people. To honour Western’s people-first culture and understand that staff have different scheduling needs, this year’s National Walk was held over a week (May 20-24) rather than one dedicated day. This allowed Canada’s insurance broker to give greater flexibility for more people to participate. Teams walked together from their local branch, remote individuals walked in their own neighbourhoods, or even staff on holiday took the time to put in 5kms in new surroundings. The ultimate goal was to make the walk as easy, accessible and flexible as possible to encourage participation. “It’s incredible to see the spirit of giving back and the passion our people have for taking care of our communities,” said Michelle Mak, Director, Western Communities Foundation. “Western has held this annual walk since 2005. It’s become a company mainstay; team members are excited to take part and they’re really passionate about the charities we’re supporting.” Employees from coast to coast took to social media with photos of their walk experiences. From scenic trails to city streets, Western’s team showcased their spirit and dedication. Check out Western’s Facebook and LinkedIn pages for more. Western Financial Group Inc.

        "content": "Festus Keyamo Festus Keyamo, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, on Monday, announced that cargo flights between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia will resume soon. This announcement was made during a ministerial press briefing in Abuja, held to mark President Bola Tinubu’s first year in office. According to Keyamo, this decision was finalized during a recent visit to Saudi Arabia, where he met with his counterpart. “I have good news for you from Saudi Arabia. I met my counterpart in Saudi Arabia and we have agreed to resume cargo flights, ” Keyamo stated. He highlighted that these flights had been suspended for an extended period, but with the new agreement, cargo services are set to be restored, boosting trade and logistical connections between the two nations. Keyamo also addressed another critical issue on Monday concerning the clearance of foreign airlines’ cash that had been trapped in Nigeria. This resolution has paved the way for the return of Emirates Airlines to Nigerian skies. Emirates had previously announced on May 16, 2024, its plans to recommence flights to Nigerian airports starting from October 1, 2024, after a two-year break from operations in the country. The service, operated by a Boeing 777-300ER, will see flights departing Dubai and arriving in Lagos, with return journeys following suit.",

In a statement to commemorate the 2024 Children’s Day, the Commission’s Executive Secretary, Tony Ojukwu, said the disturbing trend requires an urgent need for a renewed commitment from all facets of the society to protect and guarantee the fundamental rights of children. The statement was signed by Obinna Nwakonye, Director Corporate Affairs and External at the NHRC. Ojukwu said children represent the most vulnerable population and the consistent increase in reported violations of their rights is a stark reminder of the challenges they face daily. “These violations not only threaten their immediate well-being but also compromise their future potentials and the overall health and security of our society. It is therefore imperative that we act decisively and with urgency to address this menace,” he said. According to him, though the Child Right Act has been passed by several states in Nigeria, there is a need for the various state governments to strengthen its implementation in order to protect children from all forms of abuse, exploitation and neglect. He, therefore, called on the government to develop a comprehensive support system for children in distress, and create accessible and well-resourced child protection services, helplines, and shelters that will alleviate the suffering of the victims. The NHRC boss noted that it is imperative to train professionals in children centered education, social welfare, healthcare, and law enforcement to enable them to identify and respond to child right violations and other social problems effectively. He noted that education is key to raising awareness about children’s rights among parents, caregivers, educators, and children themselves. “This will empower children to understand and assert their rights,” he said. Ojukwu harped on the need to establish a robust mechanism for monitoring, reporting, and addressing violations of children’s rights. He said, “This will ensure that there is accountability at all levels, and that perpetrators of violations are brought to justice.” Ojukwu further noted that the protection of children’s rights is not merely a legal obligation but a moral imperative which will secure the future of the country. “As we celebrate Children’s Day 2024, let us reaffirm our commitment to creating a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment for every child,” he added.

The driver, a 17-year-old boy, was driving the luxury car without having a driving licence on a busy road in India’s Mumbai while carrying a man on the bonnet, an Indian media outlet reported. The viral video soon triggered a police action and the driver’s father and the man on the bonnet were arrested. The man seen in the video lying on the bonnet was identified as Subham Matalia. Onlookers were seen shocked and in disbelief seeing the stunt as Matalia sat on the bonnet with his legs spread out.

        "content": "In south Fresno, where industrial job centers butt up against residential neighborhoods, the city has a map outlining large swaths of land limiting the trucks that residents say all too often zoom down school roads and pollute the air. On Wednesday, May 22, Fresno City Council authorized spending another $52,670 on a $302,670 contract to market the city’s AB 617 Community Truck Reroute Study. Fresno leaders have for more than two years hoped the study outlining what roads heavy trucks can drive on in south Fresno could be one solution in the ongoing fight between environmental groups and industrial interests. What is now before the public is a document many are unclear about. Fresno City Councilmember Miguel Arias said he expected a street-by-street breakdown of what roads can be accessed by trucks. Business owners say they were once again left out of the conversation that affects the land on which they do business. And without clarity, the lack of clear terms and engagement further jeopardizes the city’s “economic engine.” “They want to limit the transportation coming in there,” said Joe Kalpakoff, CEO of Mid-Valley Disposal. “It’s very concerning as a business owner. It’s concerning that we weren’t contacted to provide comment early on when the project was getting off the ground.” City Wants to Keep Unnecessary Truck Trips Out The map is now being circulated for public comment. The $50,000 authorized three additional workshops and marketing materials. They plan to have the map out by August, said Jill Gormley, assistant director of Traffic and Engineering Services with the city. The goal for the city with its Community Truck Reroute Study was to limit health impacts of trucks in south Fresno and comply with Assembly Bill 617, Gormley said. In the city council meeting, Arias said the expectation for the plan was to clearly define what roads are authorized. “My presumption when we undertook this truck study is that we were going to identify roads that should not be truck routes, for example, Cherry Avenue in front of Orange Elementary,” Arias said. City staff said during the meeting the goal is to minimize unnecessary truck trips. The city has a map outlining what roads heavy trucks can drive on, dating back to 2005. The city’s updated map proposes large “regulated areas” dictating that if trucks have no business in the area, that they shouldn’t be there. That means eliminating “shortcuts” a truck might take, Gormley said. Those regulated areas blanket major industrial zones. “You can still use the regulated areas if you’re a truck, if you have business in that area, but we don’t want people or the trucks going from point A to point B to get from one point to the other,” she said. Elm Avenue Set for Another Change One of the areas that falls within the restricted area is the much-contested Elm Avenue business park. The owners of the industrial businesses and warehouses lining Elm Avenue understand that the “restricted” designation only limits unnecessary truck trips, according to a letter submitted Wednesday by attorney John Kinsey. He represents landlords and business owners in the area. But they fear in the future that it could be used as a tool against development. “My clients are concerned that the lack of a Truck Route adjacent to or near their properties and their location in a Truck Regulated Area will be used in the future by project opponents, the City, and other public agencies to assert that affected landowners and businesses should be denied discretionary approvals,” Kinsey said. In 2018, Fresno City Council approved the . It changed the zoning of the ground beneath the 800,000 square feet of businesses already operating there from industrial to a more retail-focused use. While businesses there were grandfathered in, property owners said the new rules put a clock on how long they had to get a new tenant. They also feared it would jeopardize securing loans on out-of-compliance buildings. The city developed their strategy using community input from outreach events and stakeholder meetings, according to the study. But businesses say they were left out of the discussion. Kalpakoff, whose business is among those on Elm Avenue, said he was never consulted about the truck route study. Kinsey said none of the landowners he represents there were, either. “I was firstly surprised that we weren’t contacted for any comment or questions on it, and so to see that they want to move trucks around an area that’s currently designated for trucks is concerning,” said Joe Kalpakoff, CEO of Mid-Valley Disposal located along Elm Avenue. Enforcement Levels Undecided One of the challenges for the city is deciding to what degree the rules will be enforced. With the map now available for public comment, one thing they hope to get is a sense of how far they should take monitoring whether a truck should be on a road or not. Without many resources, Gormley said education may be the best solution. “That’s education on the part of maybe businesses and truck drivers on what our new map looks like to try to keep them on the designated route so they’re not going through the neighborhoods,” Gormley said. Ivanka Saunders, regional policy director for , one of the advocacy groups pushing for an updated map, said enforcement is key. “We do want to see that the recommendations include enforcement, education, health impacts, and better land use ordinances,” Saunders said. Environmental Groups Want to Kill Major Freeway On-Ramp Upgrade The plan eliminates Central Avenue near Highway 41 as an accepted truck route. Instead, trucks would have to detour onto the freeway using North Avenue. Sources say this would bottleneck the already impacted onramp. Caltrans wants to upgrade two onramps, one at North Avenue, the other at American Avenue. Leadership Council for Justice & Accountability has an active lawsuit against Caltrans for the construction of a new onramp at North Avenue, saying the $105 million project would encourage more truck traffic in a pollution-burdened area. Related Story: Businesses Say They Are Already Adapting for Other Truck GHG Rules Ethan Smith, chairman of business-advocacy group INVEST Fresno, said South Central Fresno is the city’s economic engine. A study commissioned by the group showed the area generating $13 billion in economic activity and $100 million in tax revenue. Smith said the group has concerns the truck route study could negatively impact the area that relies on truck activity. “With Fresno facing a $47 million budget deficit this year and potential deficits in the future, it is crucial to avoid policies that hinder businesses in the area’s ability to efficiently access their facilities, add potentially costly monitoring programs, and open the door to more onerous restrictions,” Smith said. Other state laws have businesses upgrading their fleets to cleaner vehicles, Kalpakoff said. Kalpakoff said the changes remind him of the Southwest Fresno Specific Plan when changes were made and business owners were informed later. “It’s concerning that one group got together and decided where they want to change the regulations and implement these restrictions, and it seems like it’s self-serving for one group at this point,” Kalpakoff said.",

Dear Care and Feeding, I loved being a mom and have always looked forward to being a grandmother. For years, I've told my kids, who are now in their 30s, that I can't wait, and that once they have kids I'd be happy to help with child care. My son and his wife had a son four months ago and asked me to do bridge care between her maternity leave and her summer vacation (she's a teacher). But she is incredibly particular about her son's care, and as a first-time mom she's way too anxious about the small stuff. She's too hard to work with, and my own daughter and son also sided with her about all kinds of parenting decisions—and my daughter doesn't even have kids! Now that summer vacation is here, I have put a blanket ban on all grandma childcare. My daughter, who just announced her pregnancy, is furious. My son is mad because he and his wife apparently had been planning for once-weekly daycare with me without ever having asked! How do I get everyone to calm down? —Grandma, Not Personalized Nanny Dear Grandma, A student of mine, in a long-ago undergraduate creative writing workshop, used to say, \"This is a WW moment\"—her own coinage, which I never forgot and made liberal use of myself in the years following. WW stands for \"Wait—what?\" and it's invoked whenever a character in a story says or does something that contradicts what's been established by the writer. That's what I thought when I read your question. Wait—what? You told your kids for years that they could count on you for child care—that you were so looking forward to grandparenthood, you couldn't wait!—and now that the grandchildren have started appearing, you've announced that you have no intention on following through.

        "content": "When I think back to the seven summers I spent at sleepaway camp in Maine, I have mostly sense memories: the sound of screen doors slamming, joyous singing in the dining hall, the scent of pine needles on the path to the (always too cold) lake. Those summers feel dreamy and expansive, full of togetherness and growth. For kids who go to overnight camp for several weeks or more, it's a multi-summer experience that typically culminates in a final teenage summer or two—often, the summer after ninth grade or 10th grade—full of special privileges, capstone projects, and sought-after leadership roles. To skip that summer, for Camp People, is to miss the cherry on top, the End of the Era, the coda to the camp experience. But more and more families today, with college on the brain earlier than ever, are looking at those early teenage summers and reevaluating. The singing, the swimming, the sitting around the campfire may not be enough. \"They are thinking [about] 'how that looks' on some future college application down the road,\" says Corey Dockswell, the director of Camp Wicosuta, a sleepaway camp in New Hampshire, who has been noticing families reconsidering their young teenage kids' final summers for a number of years.

        "content": "On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that in addition to the upside-down American flag Justice Samuel Alito and his wife displayed outside of their home in suburban Virginia after the 2020 election, there was yet another provocative and highly political flag flown at an Alito household—this one hoisted on a flag pole outside of their vacation home in New Jersey in 2023. This second flag, white with green pine tree, bears the words \"An Appeal to Heaven.\" Among certain circles, it has a very clear meaning: that the faithful should appeal to the forces of heaven to elect and seat Donald Trump as president. If you look at the images from the Jan. 6 insurrection, Appeal to Heaven flags were everywhere. That the Alitos chose to display one outside of their home—in 2023!—cannot be separated from the flag's ubiquity at the Capitol riots. But in reality, the flag's meaning is more complicated than just its association with Jan. 6—and in some ways, more ominous. Related From Slate What These Stories About Samuel Alito's Absurd \"Provocative\" Flags Are Really About Read More The Appeal to Heaven Flag is an old symbol from the American Revolution that was resurrected—and reinterpreted—around 2013 by a charismatic religious leader called Dutch Sheets. Sheets is associated with a network known as the New Apostolic Reformation that was started in the 1990s and is characterized in part by religious leaders and churches who are inspired to wage \"spiritual warfare\" against their enemies through the act of targeted prayer. NAR also preaches political organizing in the earthly realm, to conquer different facets of society for God.

        "content": "I recently found myself thinking about the dogs I know. More specifically, about their names: Among the dogs in my inner circle, there is a Murphy, a Norman, a Gus, a Gary, and a Gracie. The common factor? These could all be names of people. Not being a dog owner myself, I wondered if this trend existed more widely, and, if so, what had caused it. How did we get from naming our Labradors and Pomeranians things like Fluffy and Toto to christening them with names like Jake? Data on dog names reveals some interesting patterns. The top dog names in 2023 were Charlie and Max for boys, and Luna and Bella for girls. These names were also among the top 200 names for babies in 2022. This shouldn't be surprising, as dogs today are treated essentially like children—not left alone for too long, given puzzles and entertainment to make sure they are stimulated, and even written into their owners' prenups. The most-cited data on the history of dog naming comes from Hartsdale Pet Cemetery—purportedly the oldest pet cemetery in the U.S.—established in 1896 in Westchester County, New York. It's the final resting place of more than 80,000 pets, ranging from your average dog, cat, bird, and rabbit, to a lion cub that once lived at the Plaza Hotel and a Bengal tiger. In 2021, there was a study of data from Hartsdale looking at 25,000 names of cats and dogs from 1905 on. They determined the most popular dog name for each decade, which progressed from Queenie in the 1930s to Lady in the 1960s, to Max, which was the most popular dog name from the 1980s–2000s. Like Bella and Charlie, Max is also a popular baby name, and has stayed in the top 250 names since 1986.

        "content": "Last March, a female Asiatic cheetah, dubbed Majrad by scientists, was killed by a car in Iran's Semnan province. This wasn't unusual in itself: One 2017 study noted that cars pose \"the most serious threat\" to the subspecies of endangered cats, fewer than 50 of whom survive in the wild. Yet Majrad's death was especially devastating, conservationist Raza Kazmi reported: When researchers performed a necropsy, they found she'd been pregnant with triplets. Majrad could have been the Asiatic cheetah's salvation; instead, her demise may signal its doom. Majrad's fate was a tragic example of an all-too-common phenomenon. Alongside washed-up Coke bottles and cigarette butts, the Anthropocene's most ubiquitous emblem might be roadkill. The demolished deer, the obliterated opossum, the wrecked raccoon: This is the detritus of our human-dominated age. Every day in the U.S. alone, more than a million vertebrate animals meet their end on the asphalt, among them rarities like Florida panthers and ocelots. One 2020 study found that mammals are four times likelier to die on roads these days than they were in the 1960s. In the Sixth Extinction, the asteroid is an F-150. We humans are similarly plagued by our automotive society. In the U.S., car crash rates and pedestrian fatalities have recently erupted; potential culprits include \"car bloat,\" smartphones, COVID-related anomie, and the automatic transmission, which frees up motorists' hands to, say, use TikTok. Like an urban squirrel or skunk, you are, alarmingly often, in danger of having your body shattered by a two-ton machine hurtling through space at 70 miles per hour. In a sense, roads are the ultimate expression of One Health, the concept that our own well-being is intimately linked to the planet's. Roads simultaneously degrade nature and jeopardize human well-being: The same dirt highways that have carved up the Amazon also facilitate the spread of malaria; the same Los Angeles freeways pulverizing mountain lions are...

        "description": "Ticket fees are the least of why Ticketmaster and Live Nation are finally getting sued by the U.S. - slate.com",
        "content": "The waters were chummed. Thanks to a fiasco around Taylor Swift ticket sales in late 2022, few companies have seen their predatory business practices get as bright a limelight as the one that has shone on Ticketmaster and its parent, Live Nation Entertainment. Swift's fans had a disastrous couple of days trying to buy tickets to the Eras Tour, and the relatively few who succeeded paid exorbitant, ticky-tack fees. A congressional hearing followed. Senators from both parties gave Live Nation the Big Tobacco hearing treatment. One of Ticketmaster's biggest rivals told lawmakers to break the giant up. We'll never know if Thursday's 124-page Justice Department lawsuit against Live Nation, alleging all manner of antitrust violations, would have come about now if not for the Swift mess. We'll especially not know if 30 state attorneys general, including a handful of Republicans, would've joined the suit if countless pop music fans in their states weren't driven to rage by a high-profile moment of ticketing incompetence. But one of the striking things about the lawsuit, which calls explicitly for the breakup of Live Nation and separation of its Ticketmaster business from its other revenue lines, is that a CTRL-F through the document says nothing about the Taylor moment. The feds' case against Live Nation isn't really about all the bullshit that Ticketmaster puts fans through when they want to take in a concert. To be clear, it has plenty of time for that. But this lawsuit fits with a recent Justice Department tradition of not just going after anti-competitive businesses but doing so on behalf of a much more sprawling group of stakeholders than just consumers. The message of the lawsuit is that, yes, music fans get a bad deal because of Ticketmaster's dominance in the ticketing space, but Live Nation's most corrosive impact is on the events world as a whole, poison not just to fans but to venues, artists, and promoters too. And the only tonic, according to the feds, is to... Alex Kirshner",

        "content": "Last March, a female Asiatic cheetah, dubbed Majrad by scientists, was killed by a car in Iran's Semnan province. This wasn't unusual in itself: One 2017 study noted that cars pose \"the most serious threat\" to the subspecies of endangered cats, fewer than 50 of whom survive in the wild. Yet Majrad's death was especially devastating, conservationist Raza Kazmi reported: When researchers performed a necropsy, they found she'd been pregnant with triplets. Majrad could have been the Asiatic cheetah's salvation; instead, her demise may signal its doom. Majrad's fate was a tragic example of an all-too-common phenomenon. Alongside washed-up Coke bottles and cigarette butts, the Anthropocene's most ubiquitous emblem might be roadkill. The demolished deer, the obliterated opossum, the wrecked raccoon: This is the detritus of our human-dominated age. Every day in the U.S. alone, more than a million vertebrate animals meet their end on the asphalt, among them rarities like Florida panthers and ocelots. One 2020 study found that mammals are four times likelier to die on roads these days than they were in the 1960s. In the Sixth Extinction, the asteroid is an F-150. We humans are similarly plagued by our automotive society. In the U.S., car crash rates and pedestrian fatalities have recently erupted; potential culprits include \"car bloat,\" smartphones, COVID-related anomie, and the automatic transmission, which frees up motorists' hands to, say, use TikTok. Like an urban squirrel or skunk, you are, alarmingly often, in danger of having your body shattered by a two-ton machine hurtling through space at 70 miles per hour. In a sense, roads are the ultimate expression of One Health, the concept that our own well-being is intimately linked to the planet's. Roads simultaneously degrade nature and jeopardize human well-being: The same dirt highways that have carved up the Amazon also facilitate the spread of malaria; the same Los Angeles freeways pulverizing mountain lions are...

Dahlia Lithwick takes us through a whirlwind of Supreme Court decisions and controversies, expertly assisted by Professor Steve Vladeck (whose New York Times bestseller The Shadow Docket came out in paperback this week) and Mark Joseph Stern in untangling the complex web of legal, political, and personal dramas enveloping the...",

        "content": "On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that in addition to the upside-down American flag Justice Samuel Alito and his wife displayed outside of their home in suburban Virginia after the 2020 election, there was yet another provocative and highly political flag flown at an Alito household—this one hoisted on a flag pole outside of their vacation home in New Jersey in 2023. This second flag, white with green pine tree, bears the words \"An Appeal to Heaven.\" Among certain circles, it has a very clear meaning: that the faithful should appeal to the forces of heaven to elect and seat Donald Trump as president. If you look at the images from the Jan. 6 insurrection, Appeal to Heaven flags were everywhere. That the Alitos chose to display one outside of their home—in 2023!—cannot be separated from the flag's ubiquity at the Capitol riots. But in reality, the flag's meaning is more complicated than just its association with Jan. 6—and in some ways, more ominous. Related From Slate What These Stories About Samuel Alito's Absurd \"Provocative\" Flags Are Really About Read More The Appeal to Heaven Flag is an old symbol from the American Revolution that was resurrected—and reinterpreted—around 2013 by a charismatic religious leader called Dutch Sheets. Sheets is associated with a network known as the New Apostolic Reformation that was started in the 1990s and is characterized in part by religious leaders and churches who are inspired to wage \"spiritual warfare\" against their enemies through the act of targeted prayer. NAR also preaches political organizing in the earthly realm, to conquer different facets of society for God.

        "content": "Given that HBO's The Jinx was one of the progenitors of the true-crime boom, it's not surprising that director Andrew Jarecki would want to reap some of the rewards of the cultural phenomenon he helped create. But The Jinx Part Two, whose six-episode run wrapped up this evening, was less a successor to the 2015 HBO series than an extended postscript, one that, in underlining the accomplishments of the original, also threw into stark relief its own lack of a compelling reason to exist. The Jinx contributed heavily, even primarily, to the arrest of a wealthy sociopath who had escaped justice for more than three decades, climaxing with the real estate heir Robert Durst's hot-mic confession to triple homicide and his arrest on the eve of its final episode. Part Two follows his trial and eventual conviction for the murder of his friend Susan Berman, but it's also obsessed with crowing over how much Part One accomplished, constantly underlining how Durst might have remained at large if it weren't for Jarecki and crew. If The Jinx's first part was a whodunit, the second is a wedidit. The season, and presumably series, finale, \"It Takes a Village,\" takes a different and more fruitful tack, a development that's both welcome and frustrating. Beginning with Durst's death in January 2022, less than three months after his conviction for Berman's murder, the episode shifts focus from Durst to his enablers: the friends, family members, and paid employees who turned a blind eye to the warning signs and kept him beyond the law's reach when his violent tendencies turned criminal. Mark Windham, the judge who presided over Durst's case and handed down the sentence of life without parole, tells Jarecki that \"for the society to heal, there must be some process of assigning accountability.\" But the...

        "content": "The Sympathizer, HBO's series adaptation of Viet Thanh Nguyen's eponymous Pulitzer Prize-winning 2015 novel, came to a close with its seventh episode tonight. The show—co-created by Don McKellar and famed South Korean director Park Chan-wook—has been following an unnamed narrator, the Captain (Hoa Xuande), as he struggles with identity and morality as a communist mole for North Vietnam planted among South Vietnamese officials that have fled to America during the Vietnam War. The series has been well-praised, not only for its deft handling of source material full of non-stop narration and symbolism, but also for its (classic Park Chan-wook) relentless style. Robert Downey, Jr. plays a number of different American roles to impart how America's power players are all in collusion, from Hollywood bigwigs to esteemed professors and politicians; characters, once dead, forma Greek chorus of ghosts; shadows meaningfully shroud characters who are hiding their identity; and a rotary phone morph into a spinning tire in one of many visually playful crossfades. The final hour, aptly titled \"Endings Are Hard, Aren't They?\" (after a line spoken in the episode), has to prove itself wrong. Not only does the episode complicate our understanding of the previous six, once the narrator is found to be unreliable; it also must stick a difficult technical landing. Ahead of the finale, I spoke to co-showrunner Don McKellar about sewing together a handful of slippery conclusions on morality and the point of life, unifying a story that has always been about duality, and finding meaning in nothingness. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Advertisement Slate: I want to start with the title, because endings are hard, aren't they? This one in particular is no small feat: It has to bring many different themes together and nail down a fairly intangible moral lesson. What was the biggest challenge in making this finale?

        "content": "Given that HBO's The Jinx was one of the progenitors of the true-crime boom, it's not surprising that director Andrew Jarecki would want to reap some of the rewards of the cultural phenomenon he helped create. But The Jinx Part Two, whose six-episode run wrapped up this evening, was less a successor to the 2015 HBO series than an extended postscript, one that, in underlining the accomplishments of the original, also threw into stark relief its own lack of a compelling reason to exist. The Jinx contributed heavily, even primarily, to the arrest of a wealthy sociopath who had escaped justice for more than three decades, climaxing with the real estate heir Robert Durst's hot-mic confession to triple homicide and his arrest on the eve of its final episode. Part Two follows his trial and eventual conviction for the murder of his friend Susan Berman, but it's also obsessed with crowing over how much Part One accomplished, constantly underlining how Durst might have remained at large if it weren't for Jarecki and crew. If The Jinx's first part was a whodunit, the second is a wedidit. The season, and presumably series, finale, \"It Takes a Village,\" takes a different and more fruitful tack, a development that's both welcome and frustrating. Beginning with Durst's death in January 2022, less than three months after his conviction for Berman's murder, the episode shifts focus from Durst to his enablers: the friends, family members, and paid employees who turned a blind eye to the warning signs and kept him beyond the law's reach when his violent tendencies turned criminal. Mark Windham, the judge who presided over Durst's case and handed down the sentence of life without parole, tells Jarecki that \"for the society to heal, there must be some process of assigning accountability.\" But the...

        "content": "The waters were chummed. Thanks to a fiasco around Taylor Swift ticket sales in late 2022, few companies have seen their predatory business practices get as bright a limelight as the one that has shone on Ticketmaster and its parent, Live Nation Entertainment. Swift's fans had a disastrous couple of days trying to buy tickets to the Eras Tour, and the relatively few who succeeded paid exorbitant, ticky-tack fees. A congressional hearing followed. Senators from both parties gave Live Nation the Big Tobacco hearing treatment. One of Ticketmaster's biggest rivals told lawmakers to break the giant up. We'll never know if Thursday's 124-page Justice Department lawsuit against Live Nation, alleging all manner of antitrust violations, would have come about now if not for the Swift mess. We'll especially not know if 30 state attorneys general, including a handful of Republicans, would've joined the suit if countless pop music fans in their states weren't driven to rage by a high-profile moment of ticketing incompetence. But one of the striking things about the lawsuit, which calls explicitly for the breakup of Live Nation and separation of its Ticketmaster business from its other revenue lines, is that a CTRL-F through the document says nothing about the Taylor moment. The feds' case against Live Nation isn't really about all the bullshit that Ticketmaster puts fans through when they want to take in a concert. To be clear, it has plenty of time for that. But this lawsuit fits with a recent Justice Department tradition of not just going after anti-competitive businesses but doing so on behalf of a much more sprawling group of stakeholders than just consumers. The message of the lawsuit is that, yes, music fans get a bad deal because of Ticketmaster's dominance in the ticketing space, but Live Nation's most corrosive impact is on the events world as a whole, poison not just to fans but to venues, artists, and promoters too. And the only tonic, according to the feds, is to... Alex Kirshner",

        "content": "The Sympathizer, HBO's series adaptation of Viet Thanh Nguyen's eponymous Pulitzer Prize-winning 2015 novel, came to a close with its seventh episode tonight. The show—co-created by Don McKellar and famed South Korean director Park Chan-wook—has been following an unnamed narrator, the Captain (Hoa Xuande), as he struggles with identity and morality as a communist mole for North Vietnam planted among South Vietnamese officials that have fled to America during the Vietnam War. The series has been well-praised, not only for its deft handling of source material full of non-stop narration and symbolism, but also for its (classic Park Chan-wook) relentless style. Robert Downey, Jr. plays a number of different American roles to impart how America's power players are all in collusion, from Hollywood bigwigs to esteemed professors and politicians; characters, once dead, forma Greek chorus of ghosts; shadows meaningfully shroud characters who are hiding their identity; and a rotary phone morph into a spinning tire in one of many visually playful crossfades. The final hour, aptly titled \"Endings Are Hard, Aren't They?\" (after a line spoken in the episode), has to prove itself wrong. Not only does the episode complicate our understanding of the previous six, once the narrator is found to be unreliable; it also must stick a difficult technical landing. Ahead of the finale, I spoke to co-showrunner Don McKellar about sewing together a handful of slippery conclusions on morality and the point of life, unifying a story that has always been about duality, and finding meaning in nothingness. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Advertisement Slate: I want to start with the title, because endings are hard, aren't they? This one in particular is no small feat: It has to bring many different themes together and nail down a fairly intangible moral lesson. What was the biggest challenge in making this finale?

If you're a doctor with a six-month waitlist and just 15 minutes to see each sweaty patient, you might measure their sweat levels, diagnose them with an overactive gland disorder, and prescribe a pill that blocks their brain's sweat signals. If you're a wellness influencer, you might create a catchy reel that both validates their suffering (\"It's OK to sweat ... I sweat, too!\") and offers self-cooling hacks and a sponsored link to buy a handheld fan. But say you're an alien descending to Earth for the first time, untainted by the usual rigmarole of health care and self-care. You might come to a simpler conclusion: Maybe the room is too hot. Instead of diagnosing and treating or validating and commodifying each individual's sweat excess, you might see, first, if you can cool the room down. Replace \"sweating\" with \"struggling mentally,\" and the same points hold: Recent estimates suggest 50 percent of the world's population will develop a mental health disorder in their lifetime, with a particular increase since COVID. Because it can be difficult to get an appointment with a therapist, primary care doctors often prescribe medication, typically antidepressants, which may or may not help. And to cope with these health care shortcomings, more people are turning to influencers, who tend to promote nonpharmaceutical products and practices of their own: fidget toys, gratitude journals, ice baths, and the like. Advertisement Let me be clear: Like sweat, the symptoms of our mental health struggles are real and painful. And just as the sweat-blocking pill and the handheld fan would genuinely help someone who is sweating feel better, our typical tools—medication, therapy, and self-care products—can help relieve our mental struggles, too.

        "content": "Let's imagine there are 10 people in a room and five of them are profusely, uncomfortably sweating. If your goal were to help them feel better, what would you do? If you're a doctor with a six-month waitlist and just 15 minutes to see each sweaty patient, you might measure their sweat levels, diagnose them with an overactive gland disorder, and prescribe a pill that blocks their brain's sweat signals. If you're a wellness influencer, you might create a catchy reel that both validates their suffering (\"It's OK to sweat ... I sweat, too!\") and offers self-cooling hacks and a sponsored link to buy a handheld fan. But say you're an alien descending to Earth for the first time, untainted by the usual rigmarole of health care and self-care. You might come to a simpler conclusion: Maybe the room is too hot. Instead of diagnosing and treating or validating and commodifying each individual's sweat excess, you might see, first, if you can cool the room down. Replace \"sweating\" with \"struggling mentally,\" and the same points hold: Recent estimates suggest 50 percent of the world's population will develop a mental health disorder in their lifetime, with a particular increase since COVID. Because it can be difficult to get an appointment with a therapist, primary care doctors often prescribe medication, typically antidepressants, which may or may not help. And to cope with these health care shortcomings, more people are turning to influencers, who tend to promote nonpharmaceutical products and practices of their own: fidget toys, gratitude journals, ice baths, and the like. Advertisement Let me be clear: Like sweat, the symptoms of our mental health struggles are real and painful. And just as the sweat-blocking pill and the handheld fan would genuinely help someone who is sweating feel better, our typical tools—medication, therapy, and self-care products—can help relieve our mental struggles, too.

Dear Care and Feeding, I loved being a mom and have always looked forward to being a grandmother. For years, I've told my kids, who are now in their 30s, that I can't wait, and that once they have kids I'd be happy to help with child care. My son and his wife had a son four months ago and asked me to do bridge care between her maternity leave and her summer vacation (she's a teacher). But she is incredibly particular about her son's care, and as a first-time mom she's way too anxious about the small stuff. She's too hard to work with, and my own daughter and son also sided with her about all kinds of parenting decisions—and my daughter doesn't even have kids! Now that summer vacation is here, I have put a blanket ban on all grandma childcare. My daughter, who just announced her pregnancy, is furious. My son is mad because he and his wife apparently had been planning for once-weekly daycare with me without ever having asked! How do I get everyone to calm down? —Grandma, Not Personalized Nanny Dear Grandma, A student of mine, in a long-ago undergraduate creative writing workshop, used to say, \"This is a WW moment\"—her own coinage, which I never forgot and made liberal use of myself in the years following. WW stands for \"Wait—what?\" and it's invoked whenever a character in a story says or does something that contradicts what's been established by the writer. That's what I thought when I read your question. Wait—what? You told your kids for years that they could count on you for child care—that you were so looking forward to grandparenthood, you couldn't wait!—and now that the grandchildren have started appearing, you've announced that you have no intention on following through.

Peter Obi having a study time with Nigerian Children on Children’s Day Obi, in a statement highlighted, @PeterObi “On this day, we celebrate Children’s Day, I rejoice with all the Nigerian children, for whose sake, we remain firmly committed in our struggle for a New Nigeria. “This day which is set aside to celebrate the Nigerian child, presents us the opportunity to focus on our children – the future leaders of our nation, and also reminds us of the need to invest in their growth; and support and nurture their dreams. Peter Obi on Children’s Day outing “Every Nigerian child deserves access to quality education, healthcare, and a safe and secure environment to live and thrive. We must, therefore invest in these key areas of development for their sake and the future of our society. “Sadly, the challenges of child labour persists in our Nigerian society today. A National Bureau of Statistics report states that 39.2 per cent of our children are in child labour and 22.9 per cent of children are involved in hazardous work. “The reports further assert that four out of every ten children in Nigeria are trapped in child labour, therefore, putting the children and the future of society at risk. Peter Obi marking 2024 Children’s Day with Persons with disabilities “In tackling the challenges of child labour, we must focus on pulling more Nigerians out of poverty and ensuring the respect of the rights of every Nigerian child. “While encouraging the parents, guardians, teachers and benefactors who see to the training of our children, I urge them to continue to give their best to raise responsible citizens in our nation. “To the children, I encourage them to take seriously their moral and educational formation. We restate our commitment to building a safe, secure and productive nation for our children to live in, fully and freely explore their potentials – the New Nigeria we are working towards. “It is possible. -PO”",

        "content": "Tshegofatso Mabasa’s contribution consisted of more than just his goals, Orlando Pirates coach Jose Riveiro said after his big striker clinched the DStv Premiership’s top scorer position at the weekend. Mabasa, in excellent form with 10 goals in 13 league games in the second half of the season after his return from loan with Moroka Swallows (where he scored six in 13 in the first half) in January, produced another crucial strike for Bucs in their 1-1 draw against SuperSport United in Saturday’s final round. The goal at Orlando Stadium kept Mabasa’s nose ahead of Stellenbosch FC’s Iqraam Rayners (15 goals) as the Bucs man ended on 16 and Pirates (50 points) earned the runners-up position on goal difference from Stellies. Rayners also scored on the final day but that could not prevent Stellenbosch sinking to a 2-1 defeat to Richards Bay FC. “Mabasa means much more than the goals. He has a good effect in the group, a contribution in every moment of the game, defending, attacking, set pieces,” Riveiro said. “He was an important player for us in the second part of the season, always available for selection and he’s been getting the reward now for the hard work he was putting in during the other half of the season at Swallows. “Overall, a really good season for him and hopefully he can replicate the performance in the future for us here at Pirates.” Mabasa, 27, was not included in Bafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos’ 36-player provisional squad for next month’s huge 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Nigeria away and Zimbabwe in Bloemfontein. He will hope to sneak into Broos' final squad when the coach names that combination on Thursday. Rayners was named in the provisional squad. Pirates ended 23 points behind seventh time successive Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns (73 points). The Buccaneers end their season with the Nedbank Cup final against Sundowns at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (3pm).

        "content": "Princess Charlene of Monaco cuts a glamorous figure at the principality's Formula 1 Grand Prix on Sunday Princess Charlene opted for a stylish, double-breasted jumpsuit by Louis Vuitton READ MORE: Princess Charlene risks awkward run-in with Prince Albert's ex-mistress Nicole Coste at Grand Prix after posting solo picture with Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella to mark Monaco Mother's Day By Monique Rubins For Mailonline Published: 10:23 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 12:00 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 7 shares 39 View comments Looking statuesque in a designer jumpsuit with her cropped hair impeccably style Princess Charlene of Monaco displayed the same elegance and poise her late mother-in-law Grace Kelly was known for, as she attended the Formula 1 Grand Prix of Monaco on Sunday. It's quite the turnaround for the mother-of-two, 46, who attended with her husband Prince Albert of Monaco , 66, who in recent years has been notably absent from public life for significant swathes of time. In 2021, she alarmed fans by spending most of the year in her native South Africa , posting a series of photos on social media where she looked worryingly frail. But yesterday, in a smart navy blue jumpsuit by Louis Vuitton and a pair of large black sunglasses by the same French designer, elegant Charlene was every inch the glamorous and confident European royal. Princess Charlene of Monaco (pictured) cut an elegant figure in a navy blue jumpsuit by Louis Vuitton on Sunday The royal, 46, sported a pair of Louis Vuitton sunglasses, only adding to the glamourous look Princess Charlene smiled as she embraced the winner, Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc (left) With a double-breasted blazer and wide-leg trousers, the jumpsuit was a stylish alternative to the more feminine dresses that other guests chose to wear. Charlene, a lover of fashion, completed her outfit with a pair of £890 Louis Vuitton slingback pumps in black and beige and the designer's Ombre Blossom extra-large hoops in pink gold and diamonds. With her short blond hair brushed to one side and only subtle make-up, the smiling mother-of-twins looked fresh-faced at the event, which saw her embrace the winner, Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc , as he took to the podium to claim his trophy. Prince Albert, meanwhile, looked typically smart in a navy blazer and a pair of cream trousers. Charlene is in her native South Africa in 2021. She infamously shaved her head in the style of a punk rocker and appeared notably frail in social media snaps Charlene sparked concern in October 2021 when she was pictured looking frail during an extended stay in her native South Africa To protect himself from the sun, he sported an event cap along with a pair of dark sunglasses, both of which he removed when it came to congratulate Leclerc. Sources have previously claimed that Charlene's transformation is down to her increasing devotion to her Catholic faith, as well as the close proximity of her parents Lynette and Mike who have joined her brother in the principality from their native South Africa to support the Princess. The couple have moved more than 8000 miles from their home in the suburbs of Johannesburg, to live permanently in the Monaco area. So as to be as close to their daughter as possible, they have moved into an imposing property in La Turbie, a French village next door to the tax haven principality where their daughter lives in regal splendour between a range of properties. 'It has made the world of difference,' said a palace source in Monte Carlo who has known Albert and Charlene since before their wedding. 'The Wittstocks have moved into a house that's just a few minutes' drive away from Charlene, and they meet all the time. 'They make her feel safe and secure, and remind her of the far more carefree life she enjoyed in South Africa before becoming a Monaco princess.' Charlene's brother, Gareth Wittstock, 42, first moved to Monaco to 'make sure his sister was being looked after' a decade ago, and her second brother, 40-year-old Sean Wittstock, is 'on the phone every day from South Africa,' said the source. Yesterday's outing was a further sign that the former Olympic swimmer, has well and truly put her health woes behind her after she spent almost a year away from the Mediterranean principality in her native South Africa, undergoing treatment for an unspecified condition. Princess Charlene and Prince Albert stand behind winner Leclerc of Monaco (front, second from right) and Ferrari, Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren (front, second from left), who came in second, and Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari (front, right), who scored third place in the race.

She wasn't pictured in Monaco from January 2021 until March 2022, citing a sinus issue which stopped her from flying. She missed the seventh birthday of her twins Gabriella and Jacques and her tenth wedding anniversary with Albert. In interviews at the time, Albert explained he had stepped up to play a bigger role in his children's lives as the family coped with Charlene's ongoing health issues.

Speaking to People magazine at the time, Albert said the family reunion in Monaco initially went 'pretty well' in the first few hours, but it then became 'pretty evident' that Charlene was 'unwell.' He said the former Olympian 'realised she needed help', adding: 'She was overwhelmed and couldn't face official duties, life in general or even family life.' The Monegasque royals appeared to be enjoying the event together, with Charlene putting her arm around her husband at one point and leaning in towards him as he was speaking. Whilst she was able to mask any awkwardness, Charlene may well have been anxious about bumping into Prince Albert's former mistress, who was also in attendance on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Nicole Coste - who dated Albert in secret for seven years and shares a son with the royal - posted on her Instagram that she would be attending the event. The fashion designer, who met the royal while working as a flight attendant in 1997, shared a photo of herself dressed in a white trench coat and admiring the view from the venue. Aligning herself with the Ferrari team, Nicole gushed: 'We are waiting for the victory of Charles Leclerc the the country’s child. Loving this jacket!' The Monegasque royals appeared to be enjoying the event together with Charlene putting her arm around her husband at one point Charlene beamed as she embraced Leclerc as he took to the podium to claim his trophy Prince Albert, 66, looked on as his stunning wife, a former Olympian swimmer, posed for the cameras Prince Albert prepared to open a huge bottle of champagne to congratulate Leclerc Both Princess Charlene and Prince Albert were beaming as Leclerc sprayed his teammates with the champagne Later, Carlos Sainz, the Spanish Ferarri driver who came in third place, sprayed his teammate, winner Leclerc, with champagne The smiling Monegasque royals shared a sweet moment when Prince Albert held onto his wife's wrist With her cropped hair impeccably styled for the event, Princess Charlene looked every inch the glamorous royal in her large Louis Vuitton sunglasses Albert and Nicole's liaison became the best-kept secret in Monaco society. Although they both attended red carpet events and mixed with socialites and celebrities, the majority of Albert's subjects knew nothing of the relationship. Ahead of her 2011 wedding to Prince Albert, Charlene reportedly fell out with Nicole after she put her step-son Alexandre up in the Palace's staff wing. While she has previously had a frosty relationship with Albert too - claiming he 'doesn't want to see his son' - she has recently lavished praise on the monarch. On his birthday, Nicole shared a photo with him. The caption read: 'Happy birthday Albert. The world will recognise you as The Loyal, the Dignity, the KING'. In November 2022, she shared another shot of Albert with Alexandre and Jazmin in New York, New York, with the cheeky caption: ' Paternally king'. The Monaco royals were further rattled earlier this year when Prince Albert's former accountant made a string of allegations about their finances. He claimed that Princess Charlene hired illegal immigrants on less than £90-a-day while her personal spending allowance rocketed to more than £1million-a-year. Charlene leaned in as her husband, who sported dark sunglasses and an event cap, was speaking Princess Charlene has shared a sweet photo with her twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella to mark Monaco's Mother's Day Claude Palmero, 67, was in charge of palace finances for more than two decades but stepped down in July 2023 after he was targeted by an anti-corruption website. His 'secret notebooks' detailing the spending of the Monaco royal family have now been shared with French newspaper Le Monde, and it was the 'illegal migrants' who made up much of Charlene's full-time personal staff of eight that Mr Palmero was particularly worried about. 'Her Serene Highness the Princess makes people work for her who are not compliant,' Mr Palmero warned Prince Albert, also referring to 'a moonlighting Filipino woman who ties up dogs in the shower.' In a letter written in January 2017, he said another employee from the Philippines had been 'illegal for five years', despite solely being on a one-month tourist visa.

        "description": "The partnership aims to enhance the lives of Ghananians by digitalization in education, healthcare, and payment transactions",
        "content": "By BL Mumbai Bureau Comments READ LATER Reliance backed Radisys has formed a consortium called Next-Gen Infra Co (NGIC) which will set up a 4G and 5G network for the Government of Ghana in collaboration with Nokia, Mahindra Tech, Ascend Digital, K-NET and Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), AT Ghana and Telecel Ghana. “The creation of a shared NGIC is critical for developing affordable, high-speed data access for the people of Ghana and help achieve their dream of 100 per cent Digital Ghana by 2030. We are inspired by India’s digital infrastructure and low-cost mobile data usage and keen to replicate it with Ghana.” said Ursula Owusu-Ekufuk, Minister for Communications and Digitalization for the Republic of Ghana. NGIC will work with MNO partners to launch affordable 4G/5G- enabled smartphones in Ghana by the end of this year. The partnership aims to enhance the lives of Ghananians by digitalization in education, healthcare, and payment transactions. This is to reduce digital divide and help the entirety of Africa seeking inspiration from Ghana. As part of the Reliance Industries family, Radisys, enables service providers to become digital experience providers through open platforms and solutions, offering digital endpoints, access and core solutions, and applications, supported by expert lifecycle services for scalable, high-performance networks, a company statement said. Several players like Tech Mahindra and TCS are trying to set up indigenous networks using open ran tech. Open Radio Access Networks (RAN) offer a new method for building mobile networks that connect smartphones and devices to the internet and users. Unlike traditional RAN, which requires telecom providers to work with a single supplier, Open RAN allows more flexibility, enabling smaller providers to enter the market without needing extensive resources to manage the entire RAN ecosystem. “The creation of a shared NGIC is critical for developing affordable, high-speed data access for the people of Ghana and help achieve their dream of 100 per cent Digital Ghana by 2030. We are inspired by India’s digital infrastructure and low-cost mobile data usage and keen to replicate it with Ghana.” comments Ursula Owusu-Ekufuk, Minister for Communications and Digitalization for the Republic of Ghana. Mohammad Ghaddar, COO, Telecel Ghana, said, “Network as a service model will create a diverse network options for all telecom operators in Ghana. The implementation of NGIC with the right partners, will enable Telecel to leverage their infrastructure to deliver enhanced connectivity, better coverage, and innovative services to our customers.” This collaboration with the Government of Ghana, promotes the Indian companies to set up an indigenous network, where they are openly working as the first Public Private ownership for the nation. Tech Mahindra aims to bring cost efficiency to the telecom market in Ghana and they are going to do so by building a Cloud Native Core Network and OEM platforms. According to NGIC Executive Director Harkirit Singh, the organisation intends to spend $145 million on infrastructure development in Ghana over the course of the following three years. Reliance has no ownership stake in NGIC. If the Indian giant is willing to accept equity rather than cash as payment in the future, NGIC is reportedly willing to grant Reliance shares. Comments",

        "content": "Tina Knowles couldn’t be prouder of her three daughters, Beyoncé, Solange, and Kelly Rowland. In a recent interview with Vogue , the 70-yearold businesswoman looked back on her fondest memories of her “three girls” while they were growing up. About her oldest, 42-year-old Beyoncé, Tina revealed that she was a quiet kid with a lion’s heart. “Beyoncé, she was very shy and she got bullied a bit...” Tina recalled, further revealing that the soon-to-be superstar “The day that she stood up for someone – she didn’t stand up for herself, she stood up for them – I’m getting emotional talking about it. I was just, I couldn’t have been more proud of her,” Tina said. About Solange – whom is the second child she shares with ex-husband Matthew Knowles – Tina said that her fondest memory was “her signing a petition in school, she was only in like fifth grade and she was out getting petitions signed.” “So she’s always been an activist,” she added. Tina also couldn’t help but gush over Rowland, who is not her biological daughter but came under her care at the age of 11. “Kelly was always this kid that just tried to protect everybody. I have a memory of her with her best friend Barbara and her being a mediator and just being this little peacemaker,” Tina shared.",

By Hope Abah Emmanuel The Benue State House of Assembly on Monday repealed the law for lifetime maintenance of former elected governors and their deputies in the state. Our correspondent reports that the the 9th Assembly had in May 2023, few days to their exit, passed the controversial pension bill to extend benefits to ex-elected governors and their deputies from 1999. But, the present 10th Assembly during plenary on Monday repealed the bill passed into law by their predecessors on account that it was not done in good faith. The lawmakers said the law was anti-people and they were unanimous in support of the repeal after several contributions from members of the House. Dump IMF policies now, ex-AD secretary tells Tinubu No effort will be spared in securing children’s future –Tinubu Speaker of the House, Aondona Dajoh, therefore ruled in favour of the unanimous resolution of the House to repeal the “Bill for a law to repeal provision for the maintenance of former elected governors of the state and their deputies and for other matters connected thereto 2024.” Recall that the former Speaker of the 9th Assembly Engr. Titus Uba, had led the plenary which earlier passed the bill to law after it was presented on the floor by the then chairman, House Committee on Business and Rules, Hon. Geoffrey Agbatse. The bill had stipulated conditions of the law to include, payment of monthly stipend as basic pensions for former governors and their deputies, equivalent to the current salaries of the serving governor, from the consolidated revenue of the state. “A monthly stipend equivalent to the Basic salary of a serving/incumbent Governor in the State for life and which shall be a charge on the Consolidated Revenue Funds of the State “The Deputy Governor shall enjoy a monthly stipend equivalent to the Basic salary of an incumbent Deputy Governor for life and shall be charge on the Consolidated Revenue Funds of the State. “A maintenance allowance of N25,000,000.00 (Twentyfive Million Naira) for the former Governor and the Deputy Governor N15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Naira) every four (4) years.” It also offers the procurement of two official SUVs of the status of the former governor and one official car for the deputy governor while the state government is mandated to avail a former governor with six personal staff, one personal assistant, two drivers, two cleaners and one cook.” A former deputy governor, according to the law, will enjoy three personal staff, one personal assistant, one driver and one cleaner. There will also be provision of security, yearly medical expenses, replacement of vehicles every four years with new ones of same quality and status.

        "content": "Ever since securing his second and final term, in the hotly disputed and internationally condemned August 2023 elections, talk of Mnangagwa not planning to leave office in 2028 has been topical. However, one of the biggest obstacles standing in his way is the country’s supreme law itself, which limits him to only two five-year terms [section 91(2) and 95 (2)(b)] – the second having started in August 2023. Even in the event of an amendment to the Constitution, in order to extend or remove term limits, according to section 328 (7), the incumbent, or someone who held that particular office in the past, can not benefit. In other words, Mnangagwa can not expect to go beyond 2028 as President of the Republic of Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, there is also talk of him planning to amend the Constitution so as to lengthen the presidential term to seven years – thereby, enabling him to remain in office till 2030 without technically changing the provision on term limits. In all this plotting and scheming, there are two or three things I am failing to wrap my head around. Firstly, Mnangagwa appears determined to rule – we all know he does not lead – Zimbabwe till, at least, 2030. What is it about this particular year that he regards so special? We are even hearing these calls within the ruling ZANU PF party itself, particularly through Midlands Province Minister of State Owen Ncube, with his “Mnangagwa will still be in power in 2030” slogan. Why does Mnangagwa believe he has to be in power, specifically in 2030? I seriously doubt this has anything to do with his so-called ‘Vision 2030’, as I am convinced, deep down, he knows (as every other Zimbabwean) that his mantra is pure political gibberish and nonsense. With only six years to this envisioned ‘upper middle-income economy’ – where every Zimbabwean will be living in relative prosperity – we are nowhere near even one percent of achieving that goal. This is a country in which an estimated 49 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty — earning, according to the 2023 UN classification, less than US$2,57 a day, which is the international poverty line. I actually believe that those falling in this category in Zimbabwe are far more than the 49 percent official figure since this was for 2020 when the economy was faring relatively better than it is today. Furthermore, everything else – such as water and electricity supply, major infrastructure, and our health delivery system – lay in total shambles. Are we supposed to believe that a miracle will take place within the next six years, whereby we will find the majority of the population living prosperous lives in a well-developed functional country? I seriously doubt that – what with all the grand looting of our national resources by those in power. So, why really does Mnangagwa want to reach 2030 still in office? Only he knows the answer! The second thing that boggles my mind as why an individual who is already 81 years only would be expending so much energy, time, and resources on seeking to rule beyond 2028? He will be 86 by the time his current term expires, and if his dream of another five-year term is fulfilled, that will see him reach 2033 at 91 years old. Is it only me, or do others also find this extremely strange? For the information of those who may not know this, Mnangagwa is already the ninth oldest national leader in the world – according to the Pew Research Centre analysis of sitting leaders in 187 UN member states. He shares this unenviable title with US President Joe Biden, who is also 81 years old. It will be interesting to note that, in the US, only 21 percent of registered voters are confident of Biden’s mental fitness and 15 percent his physical fitness to be president. This speaks volumes about how the electorate views such leaders of Mnangagwa’s age. In fact, Mnangagwa and his US counterpart fall in a bracket of only 5 percent of global leaders who are in their 80s. 34 percent of world leaders are in their 60s, 22 percent in their 50s, 19 percent in the 70s, and 16 percent in the 40s. The youngest leaders in the world are Burkina Faso’s Ibrahim Traoré, Ecuadorian Daniel Noboa, and Montenegrin Milojko Spajiĉ – who are interestingly all 36 years old. The oldest is Paul Biya of Cameroon, who is 91 – the only one in the nonagenarian group. As a matter of fact, should Mnangagwa succeed in not only securing his desired third term and actually reaching that age, he will be the oldest leader in the world! I seriously doubt Biya will still be around at that time. Therefore, I ask: Why would someone already 81 years old be so obsessed about getting a third term, to the extent of planning to possibly violate the country’s Constitution? What even makes him so sure that he will still be alive to reach that ripe old age? Should Mnangagwa not be more preoccupied with uplifting the lives of millions of Zimbabweans who are currently languishing in abject poverty? Why not spend sleepless nights planning and formulating strategies that will take the country out of the economic mess it has been in for the past two and a half decades? Surely, would it not have made more sense than spending all that time plotting and scheming on how to rule until the age of 91 years old? In all this, he will still be hoping to be alive by that time! It is better to be in power for only one term – as we witnessed with South Africa’s first black president Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela – and living a lasting indelible legacy. Than ruling for 15 years and still be reviled by one’s own citizens and recorded in history as the man who destroyed our dreams and ruined our lives.",

We have more newsletters Get the latest Rangers news from Record Sport with our daily newsletter. We have more newsletters Forward Fabio Silva looks to have been caught out by Celtic fans as he appeared to sign off his Rangers career - as an unseen clip of him greeting the Hoops' support was caught by punters at Hampden. The arrival of the Portugal U21 international from Wolves in January caught the eye - but the 21-year-old failed to match the billing as he made little impact on the Light Blues search for silverware in the second half of the campaign. Silva netted just six goals during his six-month loan spell as Rangers fell away in the Premiership title battle with Celtic - before Brendan Rodgers' side saw off their rivals on Saturday to claim the Scottish Cup. And it was after the 1-0 defeat to the Hoops at Hampden that Celtic fans appeared to catch out Silva. The attacker was preparing to trek the steps at the national stadium to collect his runners-up medal after Adam Idah 's late strike decided the Old Firm final - with Parkhead supporters in the stands ironically cheering the Rangers players and waving at the disappointed stars. While his teammates kept their heads down to quickly collect the consolation prize, Silva was snapped waving at the punters and smiling. Before waving once more midway up the Hampden steps, he appears to realise that it is the Hoops' fans that are attempting to wind him up. One Celtic fan on X said: \"Love the way Fabio Silva waves back to the fans as if he didn't realise what they were doing.\" Another stuck the boot into Silva branding him a \"clown\" after falling for the taunt. Silva may have been hoping to wave farewell to the Rangers fans with a permanent deal appearing unlikely. Extending his stay from the English Premier League next season always appeared unlikely - given Wolves forked out a whopping £35million to sign him from Porto - but the forward appears to have all-but confirmed he won't be back on Instagram. Following the full-time whistle, eagle-eyed fans have spotted that Silva quickly changed his profile picture from one wearing a Rangers kit.",

        "description": "Fans have slammed the show for casting 'carbon copies' year after year.",
        "content": "The line-up for Love Island 2024 has been revealed and it seems the show is already catching heat before it’s even launched. With Maya Jama returning as host, the ITV dating show is back on TV screens from June 3, which will be music to the ears of long-time fans. Alas, not everyone is so pumped, having slammed this year’s batch of Islanders for lack of diversity. This is nothing new, as Love Island famously attracts criticism year after year for a ‘samey’ line-up with contestants who all appear to be carbon copies of one another. But it seems now that people have had enough. The cast for this series includes a professional footballer, a dancer, and a nurse. Girls looking to find their soulmate on the ITV reality series include make-up artist Samatha Kenny, mental health nurse Mimii Ngulube, shop manager Jessica White, investment worker Patsy Field, professional dancer Harri Blackmore, and account manager Nicole Samuel. Meanwhile, the boys include surveyor and rugby union player Ciaran Davies, businessman Sean Stone, hairdresser Sam Taylor, recruitment manager Munveer Jabbal, and footballers Aye Odukoya and Ronnie Vint. Taking to social media after the cast announcement, fans have begged for better representation from a show with such massive reach. X user kesiahdelali slammed: ‘they’re all conventionally attractive, but it’s so boring. The casting director needs to be fired sorry. Why won’t they just change things up a bit? It’s just giving Love Island factory’. ‘This gotta be the worse lineup yet. All the girls look the exact same. Same hair colour. Same face. No diversity at all’, wrote 6thumbs. Blasting the show for mainly casting white hopefuls, thejrmbeng wrote: ‘Is there just not enough diversity for y’all to pick from or what? Only thing whiter is an A4 piece of paper.’ ‘Love island doesn’t feel like love island anymore’, added a disheartened Dan2063559Dan, while XOforevaaa is praying for things to improve later in the season: ‘Y’all better have diversity in the bombshells because it’s lacking in this lineup ummm’. Also raging was itsbbplus, who penned: ‘It baffles me that 11 seasons in, and they still don’t understand the importance in diverse casting. You’re STILL only casting ONE black woman & ONE black man in the original cast? Do better. It’s not hard.’ It’s not just the physical appearance of each Islander that folk have a problem with – it’s also what they stand for. Speaking in a pre-launch interview, the Islanders were quizzed on what they’re looking for in a potential partner, and their own best qualities. While MUA Samatha, 26, from Liverpool, claims she will be bringing ‘some fire’ to the villa, Mimii, 24, believes being a ‘girl’s girl’ and her sense of humour will win her a man on the show. However, 27-year-old Ronnie, who plays for Lewes FC, didn’t seem to have super in-depth requirements for a possible suitor. In fact, he was looking for ‘blondes with nice boobs’. Oh, but he did also emphasise that he wanted someone who was ‘family orientated, caring and career-minded’, which is something... For all you Love Island fanatics out there, don’t fret, because it’s not all doom and gloom – the show has received praise too. For example, Patsy Field, 29, an office administrator from Orpington, has Erb’s Palsy, which is paralysis of the arm caused by injury to the upper group of the arm’s main nerves resulting from a difficult birth. Proud to be representing her community, she said her disability is the one quality she would like her other Islanders to know about her. She said: ‘I’ve got something very special about me which is my disability, it’s a condition I was born with called Erb’s Palsy. ‘It doesn’t define who I am, but it makes me a little different, although I’ve learnt to get on with it and it’s never held me back.’ She added: ‘My friends would say that I’m the loudest person in the group, I’m the one who’s always up for doing a dare, they’d say I was the life and soul of the party. ‘My family would say that I’m bossy and that it’s always my way or the highway, they’d say I rule the roost.’ As mentioned, Love Island’s casting is a topic of conversation every year, but that doesn’t mean to say it’s always been dull. Kai Fagan and Sanam Harrinanan – who are now engaged – won the last Winter Love Island series, while finalists in the summer of 2023 included Tyrique Hyde, Ella Thomas, and Whitney Adebayo, the latter of whom was widely tipped to win. Amber Rose Gill won series 5 in 2019 too. Molly-Mae Hague sends clear message with birthday celebrations after split rumours Love Island star 'now in the running' for James Bond role The Wagatha Christie operation behind Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu and James Argent romance revealed Love Island and Towie stars charged and could face up to 2 years in jail Also in terms of disability diversity, ITV points out that Tasha Ghouri, who is deaf, was a runner-up in the 2022 series, and Ron Hall, who lost sight in one eye as a child, made the final in 2023. The broadcaster notes that host Maya is an East African woman of Somali heritage, having become one of ITV’s most popular and in-demand talents in recent years. With Love Island’s viewing figures dwindling series after series – last summer’s final was watched by 1.3million viewers on ITV2, down one million from the year before and down two million from the launch four years ago – it remains to be seen whether this is the year it can redeem itself. What I Own: My partner and I bought our own home before we were 30 — through a loophole I pay £395 a month to live in an underground doomsday bunker 'Magical' town with two castles named best place to live in the South West What I Rent: 'I pay £1,925 for a one bed flat but it revived my social life after divorce' Someone is literally renting out their garden shed – for £1,300 per month Love Island returns to screens on Monday, June 3 at 9pm. The first episode will be simulcast across ITV1, ITV2, ITVX, and STV. Got a story?

        "content": "An Israeli air strike killed at least 35 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, medics said, drawing condemnation from European leaders on Monday who urged implementation of a World Court ruling to halt Israel's offensive. In scenes grimly familiar from a war in its eighth month, Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after the strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety shelters ablaze. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. “The whole world is witnessing Rafah getting burnt up by Israel and no-one is doing anything to stop it,” Bassam, a Rafah resident, said via a chat app, of the strike in an area of western Rafah that had been designated a safe zone. Despite a global outcry at the toll on civilians, Israeli tanks continued to bombard eastern and central areas of the city on Monday, killing eight, local health officials said. Israel's military said Sunday's air attack, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated militant group Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind attacks on Israelis. Earlier on Sunday, it had said eight rockets were intercepted after being fired from the Rafah area. A minister said that showed the need for continued operations against Hamas. Israel's top military prosecutor, however, called the air strike “very grave” and said an investigation was under way. “The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) regrets any harm to non-combatants during the war,” Major-General Yifat Tomer Yerushalmi said at a conference on Monday. The attack took place in the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. Many of the dead were women and children, the health officials said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise as some were in critical condition with severe burns. Israel has kept up attacks on Rafah despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,” Baerbock said. NO SAFE ZONE By daylight, the camp was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah's western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. “What have they done to deserve this? Their children have been orphaned.” Hospitals in Rafah, including the International Committee of the Red Cross field hospital, were unable to handle all the wounded, so some were moved to hospitals in Khan Younis further north in Gaza for treatment, medics said. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said the situation was horrifying. “Gaza is hell on earth. Images from last night are yet another testament to that,” UNRWA wrote on X. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces an international outcry. “On top of the hunger, on top of the starvation, the refusal to allow aid in sufficient volumes, what we witnessed last night is barbaric,” Ireland's Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said. Egypt condemned the Israeli military's “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. Saudi Arabia also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Israeli tanks have probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, since May 6 and have entered some of its eastern districts. Reuters",

        "description": "Giovanni Pernice put on a united front with Anton Du Beke as the pair continued to promote their shows together in the wake of the Strictly Come Dancing fall out",
        "content": "Giovanni Pernice isn’t letting the Strictly Come Dancing fall out get him down as he continued to promote his new show with pal Anton Du Beke . The Italian pro dancer, who is facing ‘abusive behaviour’ allegations from previous celebrity dance partners including Amanda Abbington, took to Instagram to share a video with Strictly judge Anton as the pair gear up to go on tour together this summer. Promoting their new stage show, called Anton & Giovanni Together: The Live Tour, the dancing duo filmed a sweet message for fans as they wrote in the caption: “TOGETHER Again!!! NOT TO BE MISSED!! @mrantondubeke @giovannipernice.” In the clip, 57-year-old Anton said: “First day of rehearsals. Always my favourite day. Second day, less so.” Giovanni, 33, goes in for a hug as he tells fans: “We are back on tour! It feels nice, it’s lovely. We can’t wait to see all of you!” Anton continued: “We open on the 14th of June and then we’re out on the road until the end of July. Very, very exciting, It’s going to be a great show, we’ve got the most amazing cast. Our dancers and singers are remarkable.” Agreeing, Giovanni says: “Unbelievable.” Putting on a united front, they end the video with a hug as Giovanni adds: “The show is called Together, as you know. And whatever we do, we’re going to get through it together.” Full timeline of Giovanni Pernice fallout - first Amanda row to 'quitting' and BBC probe Gio and Anton share a laugh as they promoted their new stage show ( Image: Instagram) Putting on a united front, Gio said 'whatever we do, we do it together' ( Image: Instagram) Fans were quick to comment underneath posting messages of support. It comes after Giovanni sensationally quit Strictly after nine years earlier this month. One fan wrote: “Stay strong Giovanni and so glad you have the wonderful Anton by your side.” Another said: “It’s lovely to see Gio looking so happy.” A third posted: “Look after Gio Anton... and can’t wait to see you both x.” A fourth said: “Soooo glad you’ve got each other!!!” As a fifth added: “Sending love and support x.” Giovanni’s shock announcement came weeks after his most recent celebrity dance partner, Sherlock and Mr Selfridge star Amanda Abbington , claimed she quit the show after getting mild PTSD from his strict training methods and has brought a civil claim against him. Other former celebrity dance partners have made further claims about his treatment of them, all of which he denies, and the BBC is said to be investigating. In the wake of the \"abusive behaviour\" allegations, Giovanni issued a statement on Instagram refuting any suggestion of \"abusive or threatening behaviour\". He wrote: \"To my dear fans, you will be as surprised as I am that allegations have been made about my dance teaching methods in the media this week. Of course, I reject any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour, and I look forward to clearing my name. \"Those who have followed my journey on Strictly Come Dancing over the last decade will know that I am passionate and competitive. No-one is more ambitious for my dance partners than me. I have always striven to help them be the very best dancers they can be. This has always come from a place of love and wanting to win - for me and my dance partners. Thank you all once again for your continued love and support! Giovanni.\" Giovanni is said to have instructed Joelle Rich, a partner in London-based law firm Schillings who represented Johnny Depp during his 2020 libel battle against The Sun and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , to represent him. The law firm will go head to head with Carter Ruck, the law firm acting for Amanda and two other women.

        "description": "NHL: San Jose Sharks are searching to replace David Quinn, who was fired April 24.",
        "content": "SAN JOSE – At least two candidates, Ryan Warsofsky and Jeff Blashill, have had or will have second interviews for the San Jose Sharks’ head coaching job, according to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman. Another candidate, Marco Sturm, also recently interviewed for the position, Friedman said on his “32 Thoughts” podcast published Monday morning. The Sharks recently received permission from the Los Angeles Kings to speak with the former NHL winger about the opening. Sturm has coached the Kings’ AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign, for the past two seasons. Friedman said Blashill was “due” for a second interview and was told Warsofsky has had two interviews. Warsofsky, 36, was on former coach David Quinn’s staff for the past two years and coordinated the team’s penalty kill and defense. Quinn was fired by Sharks general manager on April 24 after two seasons and a 41-98-25 record. Grier said on May 7, after the Sharks won the NHL draft lottery, that he had already spoken with prospective candidates. Before coming to San Jose, Warsofsky had been an AHL head coach for four years, including from 2020 to 2022 with the Chicago Wolves. In 2021-2022, Warsofsky became the youngest coach to win the Calder Cup since Peter Laviolette in 1999, as the Wolves finished the regular season with a 50-16-10 record and went 14-4 in the playoffs. Warsofsky began coaching in 2012 as an assistant at Curry College in his native Massachusetts. He then became an assistant coach for the ECHL’s South Carolina Stingrays. After three years, he was promoted to head coach and led the team to the Kelly Cup Finals in his first year. Warsofsky then spent two years, from 2018 to 2020, with Charlotte of the AHL, the first as an assistant when the Checkers won the Calder Cup and the second as the team’s head coach. Blashill, 50, has been an NHL head or assistant coach for 10 years. He was a Detroit Red Wings assistant during the 2011-2012 season, then was the team’s head coach for seven seasons from 2015 to 2022. The rebuilding Red Wings missed the playoffs in each of Blashill’s final six seasons and had a 204-261-72 record during his tenure. Blashill has been an assistant on Jon Cooper’s staff with the Tampa Bay Lightning for the past two seasons. Sturm’s Reign teams were a combined 76-55-13 over the past two years, and Ontario just finished a season in which it went 42-23-7 and reached the Pacific Division final. Sturm was a first-round draft pick by the Sharks in 1996 and played seven-plus seasons with the team from 1997 to 2005 before he was traded to the Boston Bruins as part of the deal that brought Joe Thornton to San Jose.",

        "description": "NHL: San Jose Sharks are searching to replace David Quinn, who was fired April 24.",
        "content": "SAN JOSE – At least two candidates, Ryan Warsofsky and Jeff Blashill, have had or will have second interviews for the San Jose Sharks’ head coaching job, according to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman. Another candidate, Marco Sturm, also recently interviewed for the position, Friedman published Monday morning. The Sharks recently received permission from the Los Angeles Kings to speak with the former NHL winger about the opening. Sturm has coached the Kings’ AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign, for the past two seasons. Friedman said Blashill was “due” for a second interview and was told Warsofsky has had two interviews. Warsofsky, 36, was on former coach David Quinn’s staff for the past two years and coordinated the team’s penalty kill and defense. Quinn was fired by Sharks general manager on April 24 after two seasons and a 41-98-25 record. Grier said on May 7, after the Sharks won the NHL draft lottery, that he had already spoken with prospective candidates. Before coming to San Jose, Warsofsky had been an AHL head coach for four years, including from 2020 to 2022 with the Chicago Wolves. In 2021-2022, Warsofsky became the youngest coach to win the Calder Cup since Peter Laviolette in 1999, as the Wolves finished the regular season with a 50-16-10 record and went 14-4 in the playoffs. Warsofsky began coaching in 2012 as an assistant at Curry College in his native Massachusetts. He then became an assistant coach for the ECHL’s South Carolina Stingrays. After three years, he was promoted to head coach and led the team to the Kelly Cup Finals in his first year. Warsofsky then spent two years, from 2018 to 2020, with Charlotte of the AHL, the first as an assistant when the Checkers won the Calder Cup and the second as the team’s head coach. Blashill, 50, has been an NHL head or assistant coach for 10 years. He was a Detroit Red Wings assistant during the 2011-2012 season, then was the team’s head coach for seven seasons from 2015 to 2022. The rebuilding Red Wings missed the playoffs in each of Blashill’s final six seasons and had a 204-261-72 record during his tenure. Blashill has been an assistant on Jon Cooper’s staff with the Tampa Bay Lightning for the past two seasons. Sturm’s Reign teams were a combined 76-55-13 over the past two years, and Ontario just finished a season in which it went 42-23-7 and reached the Pacific Division final. Sturm was a first-round draft pick by the Sharks in 1996 and played seven-plus seasons with the team from 1997 to 2005 before he was traded to the Boston Bruins as part of the deal that brought Joe Thornton to San Jose.",

        "content": "Crabomination is quickly turning out to be a fan-favorite star of the MTG Modern Horizons 3 set, thanks to its design and the unlikely type pairing of Crab and Demon. Crabomination brings back the Emerge mechanic that first debuted in the set. Modern Horizons 3 has brought many niche, enjoyable mechanics like Eternalize and Afterlife back to the forefront, and Emerge is the latest to reclaim the spotlight. This card has an alternative casting cost of Emerge from Artifact 5BB. This ability allows you to sacrifice any and reduce the 5BB cost by an amount of generic mana equal to the Artifact’s mana value. Emerge is a unique way to cut down on a card’s cost, and is well worth considering as a way to cheaply bring the hard-hitting, Crabomination out onto the field. As well as being a hefty 5/5 Creature, when Crabomination enters the battlefield, an opponent of your choice is forced to exile the top card of their library, as well as one random card from both their grave and their hand. As well as depleting opponents’ resources, this effect is useful for . When the exile effect takes place, you can choose one of the exiled cards and cast it for free, doubling up on the value provided by this crustacean Creature. MTG players don’t just love this card based on the fun factor, Crabomination is also winning fans over thanks to taking its abilities in an interesting new direction. As pointed out by one Reddit user: “Emerge from Artifact is AWESOME rules text. I think this is the first non-Creature Emerge, unless there was another one spoiled/leaked that I missed!” Crabomination is a worthy MTG return for a beloved mechanic, another for Modern Horizons 3 ahead of its June 14 launch.",

Mr Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor US and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. Monday’s launch came hours after the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years.

        "content": "The African Development Bank Group said it has invested $1.44 billion to support the development of energy and power, transport, water, and sanitation infrastructure in Nigeria. According to the Group’s President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, to help address this problem, the AfDB “is supporting the federal and state governments to improve the national and states’ infrastructure.” A statement by the group quoted Adesina as saying that “as of April 2024, 31 percent of the bank’s active portfolio, valued at $1.44 billion, is supporting infrastructure development in Nigeria.” Adesina, who was represented by AfDB’s Nigeria Country Department, Director General Lamin Barrow, at the Nasarawa Investment Summit 2024, held from May 15 and 16 in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, acknowledged the resonance of the Summit theme against the backdrop of turbulence in the global economy. He told participants that the state, and indeed Nigeria, face a huge infrastructure deficit which is inhibiting the country’s efforts to diversify its non-oil production and achieve international competitiveness for exports. According to the 2020 National Integrated Infrastructure Master Plan, Nigeria requires, between 2020 and 2043, total infrastructure investments estimated at $2.3 trillion, to raise its infrastructure stock to the international benchmark of 70 per cent of GDP. The energy sector alone will require $759 billion, while the transport sector needs $575 billion. To achieve industrial renaissance, he stressed that Nasarawa State and Nigeria must accelerate domestic resource mobilization; boost agriculture sector productivity; develop value chains and supportive infrastructure; enhance de-risk investments; prioritize natural resource value addition and beneficiation; strengthen institutional capacity and bridge the skills mismatch to enhance youth employability. “Nasarawa is known for its huge potential in agriculture, particularly its organized commodity aggregation system, which ensures the marketability and traceability of produce. It is reassuring to note that Nasarawa is prioritizing the development of agricultural value chains for key commodities such as sesame, rice, and ginger,“ he stressed. Also speaking at the event, Dr. Doris Nkiruka Uzoka-Anite, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, who represented Nigeria’s President, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, while opening the summit said the country was proud of Nasarawa State, particularly for the positive strides it had made in the mining sector. “Nasarawa State has shown great vision in ensuring that their vast lithium deposits are developed and processed, ensuring that raw materials are not exported out of this country without any value addition, in line with the renewed hope agenda,” she said. Welcoming all to the event, the Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, appreciated the AfDB for its continued support for the industrial and sustainable economic development of the state. The African Development Bank, the statement recalled, for example, has financed the construction of the Keffi and Akwanga water supply schemes in Nasarawa, comprising intake works, pumping stations, a 62,850 m3/d treatment plant, 19.9 km of transmission pipes and 42 km of distribution pipes, as well as service reservoirs, drainage, and buildings. The state is currently under consideration for participation in Phase II of the Special Agriculture Processing Zone (SAPZ) program in Nigeria.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal has won three Grand Slam matches after being down two-sets-to-love with the latest being the final of Australian Open 2022 where he beat Daniil Medvedev in a five-hour thriller.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal is a 22-time Major champion. Ever since the Spaniard won his first Grand Slam at Roland Garris in 2005, he has been one of the players to watch out at the biggest stage every year. When it comes to number of matches at Majors, Nadal has played 357 of them and won 314 times. Many a times, he has come back from really dire situations to end up on the winning side. Three of those happened when he was on the verge of elimination after losing the first two sets. Nadal in action against USA’s Robert Kendrick during Wimbledon Tennis Championships on June 29, 2006.| Photo Credit:AFP The first time Nadal lost the opening two sets in a Grand Slam match was against USA’s Robert Kendrick in the second round of Wimbledon in 2006. World No. 237 Kendrick was on his way to defeating then then World No. 2 Nadal after leading 7-6(4), 6-3 but the Spaniard clinched the third set in the tiebreak and completed the comeback by winning the next two 7-5 and 6-4. Nadal eventually lost to Roger Federer in the final of that edition. Nadal returns the ball to Russian Mikhail Youzhny during the 4th round at Wimbledon on July 5, 2007.| Photo Credit:ADRIAN DENNIS A year after a scare against Kendrick, Nadal again trailed by two-sets-to-love at the grass Major - this time against Russia’s Mikhail Youzhny, the then World No. 13, in the fourth round. However, unlike the match against the American, Nadal won the final three sets fairly easily. Like 2006, Nadal yet again lost to Federer in the summit clash. Nadal’s third and most recent comeback from two-sets-to-love down came in the final of the Australian Open in 2022. The Spaniard, who had sat out the second half of the previous season with a foot injury, went on an incredible run to reach the summit clash in Melbourne. It was turning out to be anything but a fairytale when he lost the opening two sets against Daniil Medvedev. He even fell 0-40 down while serving at 2-3 in the third set. The miracle in Melbourne 💙 However, the Spaniard fought back incredibly to take the third and fourth sets with an identical score of 6-4. Nadal served for the title at 5-4 in the fifth but the Russian broke back. Nadal recovered from that blip and restored his advantage by breaking Medvedev in the very next game and this time, served for the title successfully. Comments Related Topics",

Itt a legmagasabb nyugdíjakkal rendelkező országok listája Havran Kati2024. 05. 27., h - 17:21 Aki több ezer eurót akar az államtól, annak a rangsor élét vezető országokban van esélye ilyenre. Szlovákia szomszédai is az első helyezettek között vannak. Sok olyan ország van, amelyre a szlovák nyugdíjasok irigykedve nézhetnek. A TREND tíz olyan országot rangsorolt, amelyek Szlovákiához képest dupla, háromszoros vagy egy esetben akár négyszeres öregségi nyugdíjat kínálnak polgáraiknak.A nyugdíjak nemzetközi összehasonlítása meglehetősen bonyolult, mert a különböző országoknak más-más nyugdíjrendszerük van. Némelyikükben csak az első pillérben van állami nyugdíj, míg mások ugyanezen a pilléren belül más rendszerekre is kiterjesztik, és van, ahol az állami nyugdíj kifejezés mást jelent.A rangsort a Picodi portál elemzése ihlette, amely a világ 44 országában térképezte fel 2022-ben az átlagnyugdíjat az adók utáni nettó összeg alapján, és az állami nyugdíjra összpontosított, amelyet Szlovákiában és más országokban az első pillérből finanszíroznak. A TREND egy olyan ország hármasát is jelölte saját számításai alapján, amely nem szerepelt az eredeti elemzésben. Az összegek dollárról euróra történő hozzávetőleges átváltása az aktuális árfolyamok figyelembevételével történt.10. HollandiaÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 1 244 euróA Mercer Intézet szerint Hollandia régóta a világ legjobb nyugdíjrendszerével rendelkező országai közé tartozik. Az első pillért állami nyugdíjként a kormány fizeti, és átlagosan több mint 1 200 eurós nettó nyugdíjat biztosít.Ugyanakkor azt is el kell mondani, hogy az országnak van egy nagyon hatékony második pillére, amely szektorok és szakmák szerint fogja össze a munkavállalókat. A hollandok többsége rendelkezik vele, az úgynevezett foglalkoztatói nyugdíjban takarékoskodik. Ez akár kétezer euróval is növelheti az ezt igénybe vevők reálnyugdíját.9. SpanyolországÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 1 290 euróAz állami nyugdíj összege Spanyolországban hasonló a hollandiaihoz. Az első pillérben a nyugdíjakat a még aktív munkaerőpiacon lévő munkavállalók finanszírozzák. Ők mindannyian egyetlen alapba fizetnek be, amelyből az állami nyugdíjat folyósítják.A második pillér, ahol a munkavállalók saját maguk takarékoskodnak, nem annyira elterjedt az országban, mint Hollandiában, bár a helyzet itt is fokozatosan változik. A Picodi elemzőinek számításai szerint a spanyol nyugdíjasok nyugdíjuk több mint 18 százalékát költik élelmiszerre, ami az alacsonyabb nyugdíjakkal rendelkező országokhoz képest egyáltalán nem sok.8. FranciaországÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 1 439 euróMíg egy spanyol nyugdíjasnak a nyugdíjának 18 százalékát kell élelmiszerre költenie, addig egy francia nyugdíjasnak csak 14 százalékra van szüksége. Franciaországban az átlagos állami nyugdíj mintegy 150 euróval magasabb, mint nyugati szomszédjánál.Az első pillér két rendszerre oszlik - az egyik a magánszektorban, a másik a közszférában dolgozók számára. Ezek számos szabályban és juttatásban különböznek egymástól. A második pillér szintén kötelező, és finanszírozása ugyanúgy történik, mint az első pilléré - a munkavállalók és a munkáltatók befizetéseiből.6. FinnországÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 1 507 euróA finn első pillér két részből áll - egy nemzeti nyugdíjból és egy keresethez kötött nyugdíjból. A nemzeti nyugdíj célja, hogy alapjövedelmet biztosítson azok számára is, akik túl keveset kerestek. Mindenkinek jár, aki a tizenhatodik életévének betöltése után legalább három évig Finnországban élt.A második pillér elvileg kötelező Finnországban. Többnyire csoportos nyugdíjbiztosításon keresztül valósul meg, amely a munkáltatóval kötött megállapodás eredménye.5. USAÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 1 531 euróAz USA nyugdíjrendszere az első pilléren, más néven Social Securityn alapul, amely 1935-ig nyúlik vissza. A rendszert a munkavállalók bérét terhelő adókból finanszírozzák. Érdekes jellemzője az állami nyugdíjra alkalmazott progresszív elv - a kevesebbet keresők a bérük nagyobb százalékát kapják, mint a többet keresők.A második pillérben két modell létezik. Az első, amelyhez elsősorban a munkaadók járultak hozzá, fokozatosan átadja helyét a másodiknak, amelyhez a munkaadók mellett a munkavállalók is nagyobb mértékben járulnak hozzá.4. DániaÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 1 630 euróDánia esetében az állami nyugdíj nem egyenlő automatikusan az első pillérrel. Az első pillér egy állami alapnyugdíjból áll, amely mindazok számára nyitva áll, akik 15 éves koruk után legalább három évig Dániában éltek, valamint egy kötelező nyugdíjrendszerből, amelybe a munkáltatók és a munkavállalók egyaránt befizetnek. Az átlagos dán első pilléres nyugdíj száz euróval meghaladja az amerikai nyugdíjat.A második pillér a legtöbb munkavállaló számára kötelező, és kollektív szerződések szabályozzák.3. SvájcÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 1762 euróA svájci állami nyugdíj megközelíti az 1800 eurót. Másrészt viszont ennek akár egyötödét is felemésztik az élelmiszer-kiadások, ami több, mint a rangsorban szereplő néhány más országé, ahol alacsonyabbak a nyugdíjak. A munkavállalók, a munkaadók, a kormány és a kantonok mind hozzájárulnak az első pillérhez. Az állami nyugdíj biztosításon alapul - minden állampolgárnak 20 éves korától, illetve 17 éves korától, ha korábban dolgozik, biztosítva kell lennie.A második pillér csak egy bizonyos kereseti szinttől kötelező, ami évi 20 ezer euró körül van. A munkáltatók hozzájárulásának ehhez a pillérhez legalább akkorának kell lennie, mint a munkavállalókénak.2. NorvégiaÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 1 897 euróA norvég nyugdíjasoknak az állami nyugdíjuk alig több mint 13 százalékát kell élelmiszerre költeniük, ami százalékban kifejezve egyharmaddal kevesebb, mint amit a svájci nyugdíjasoknak költeniük kell. A norvég alapnyugdíj átlagosan majdnem 1 900 euró. Ezt a nemzeti biztosítási rendszerből fizetik ki, amely adókból, többek között a bérjárulékokból kap pénzt. Egy garantált nyugdíjból áll, amely önmagában körülbelül nettó 1 200 eurót tesz ki, valamint egy keresethez kötött nyugdíjból.2006 óta egy második pillér is kötelező, amelyhez a munkavállalók és a munkáltatók egyaránt hozzájárulnak. A hozzájárulás összegének a fizetés legalább két százalékát kell elérnie, és a munkavállalók választhatják meg, hogy milyen befektetési lehetőséget kívánnak igénybe venni.1. LuxemburgÁtlagos nettó nyugdíj: 2 011 euróLuxemburg vezeti a rangsort. A Benelux államok legkisebb országa a legtöbb életszínvonalra vonatkozó rangsorban magasan szerepel. A nyugdíjak mellett például a fizetések tekintetében is az élen áll. Az átlagos állami nyugdíj itt meghaladja a kétezer eurót. A háromoldalú rendszer szerint ezt a munkaadók, a munkavállalók és az állam egyenlő arányban finanszírozzák - mindegyikük a bruttó bérek nyolc százalékával járul hozzá.A második pillér Luxemburgban nem kötelező, és azt közvetlenül a munkaadók ajánlják fel. Ők határozzák meg a járulékszintekre és a juttatásokra vonatkozó szabályokat is. A második pillérből származó kiegészítő nyugdíj megduplázhatja a nyugdíjas jövedelmét.Luxemburgban van egy minimálnyugdíj is. Ez 2022-ben bruttó összegben havi 1840 euró volt, ami nettó értelemben a TREND számításai szerint több mint 1500 eurót tett ki. Ráadásul, ha egy munkavállaló egy másik uniós országba költözik, megtarthatja a luxemburgi nyugdíjrendszer valamennyi előnyét.Az utolsó oldalon megtudhatja, hogyan szerepelt Szlovákia a nemzetközi összehasonlításban, és a vizsgált országok közül melyikben a legalacsonyabb a nyugdíj.",

        "content": "Everything was looking rosy for Scott McLaughlin as he led the field into Turn 1 from pole position at the Indianapolis 500. The New Zealander flew high in the No. 3 Team Penske Chevy as he led a race-topping 64 laps, but McLaughlin’s day was a bit like a balloon with a slow leak. The longer the race went, the lower McLaughlin went as the Indy 500’s most rewarding – or problematic – dynamic played out with the timing of cautions and how they affected pit strategies, and the Kiwi found himself on the wrong end of the equation. More IndyCar! Team Chevy conquers all at Indy Foiled double ‘one of the most disappointing’ days for Larson Indy 500 race report with O'Ward, Dixon, Rasmussen and Ferrucci All of those 64 laps spent at the front of the field were produced in the first 125 laps; he’d fall as far back as 11th before recovering to take a rather unrewarding sixth as teammate Josef Newgarden went on to win a thriller in the No. 2 Chevy. “I just gave it my all, all month,” McLaughlin said. “It’s just emotionally draining. Unfortunately, that’s my best run and I’m upset about it obviously. You’re a competitor. But Team Penske won and that’s the main thing. “Congrats to Josef. This place just kicks your butt and you’ve got to come back stronger next year.”",

        "description": "Canadian skip Brendan Bottcher, who split with his four-person curling team a month ago, will coach Team Rachel Homan next season and for the foreseeable future.",
        "content": "Brendan Bottcher is returning to the curling world, but not the way many fans and followers of the sport might have expected. Bottcher, who split with his four-person team a month ago, will coach Rachel Homan's next season and for the foreseeable future. \"I took the last month in a bit to really reflect on where I'm at and figure out what I want to be passionate about,\" Bottcher told CBC Sports. \"I can't say enough good things about all the team and certainly can't say enough good things about Rachel. They've had an incredible season this past year together and I'm just so excited to get on board with all of them.\" Bottcher also will join forces with world champion Homan to form a mixed doubles team that will attempt to first qualify for the mixed doubles Olympic trials set for late December in hopes of representing Canada at the 2026 Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo Games in Italy. \"We put the team together for a specific reason and that's to win. We're both invested I'd say 110 per cent, so we're certainly going to put the work in,\" Bottcher said. \"There's lots of parity but we're looking forward to putting in a run. We think we can qualify for the trials and hopefully represent Team Canada along the way.\" In mid-April there was a shockwave sent across the curling world when Marc Kennedy, Brett Gallant, Ben Hebert and Bottcher announced they'd be parting ways. Veteran skip Bottcher parts ways with team after 2 seasons Olympic curling champion Brad Jacobs splits with Team Carruthers, joins former Bottcher teammates \"I started reflecting on the last couple of years, we had a pile of success and we did a lot of really good things, and I feel like I grew as a curler quite a bit through the last couple of years,\" he said. \"So although it maybe wasn't the ending and the timing I can envision, there are a lot of positives there. So how do I keep that momentum going? How do I keep building on a lot of skills that I have? What kind of curler do I want to be through this part, but into the next quad and into the quad after that, hopefully?\" “It just makes a pile of sense”@BottcherCurling is stepping away from men's competitive curling to coach @TeamHoman MORE: https://t.co/gnP2QJPvjj pic.twitter.com/LE64DAsBvM — @CBCOlympics Passionate about coaching Bottcher said when his team split last month it left him in a spot he could not have planned for this late in the Olympic cycle, but it also allowed him to take some time to decide what he was truly passionate about. \"Although maybe it wasn't the position I was hoping to be in, it gave me an opportunity to really take some time,\" he said. \"And as opposed to looking at it from a scarcity standpoint, trying to figure out what I had to do tomorrow, I took a little bit of time and reflected on what am I actually going to be passionate about and what am I going to be excited for?\" Bottcher, who has reached the podium in seven of the last eight Briers, including a 2021 title, said he is not done with the four-person game and has big plans for when he returns. \"In all honesty, I think I'm going to come back a more well-rounded curler than I left. I think I'm going to learn a few things along the way here from both of these two experiences,\" Bottcher said. Homan dethrones Switzerland's Tirinzoni to win Canada's 1st curling world title since 2018 More curling coverage \"That'll make me a better curler when I come back to it. And I think that's what I'm thrilled about. I'm not thinking that it's a step back by any means. I think I'm going ahead with a few things I'm super excited about.\" Homan is coming off one of the best curling seasons ever in the sport, having won the Scotties Tournament of Hearts and then capping it off with a memorable world championship win over Switzerland in Sydney, N.S. WATCH l Homan rink defeats Switzerland for 2024 world title: Canada's Homan defeats Switzerland's Tirinzoni for 2nd title at women's curling worlds 2 months ago Duration 2:05 Canada's Rachel Homan wins gold at the women's curling world championship with a 7-5 win over Switzerland's Silvana Tirinzoni. The win ended Canada's six-year title drought at this event. \"Having Brendan join our coaching staff is incredibly exciting. His experience, leadership, and strategy will undoubtedly elevate our game,\" Homan said. \"With Brendan living in Edmonton near me, his continuous support will be invaluable both on and off the ice.\" Bottcher is taking over coaching duties for Don Bartlett, who helped guide the team to success over the past couple of seasons. \"As I step back from coaching to pursue personal travel, I will continue to support them wholeheartedly. Working with some of the best curlers of this generation in Team Homan and Brendan Bottcher is something that I will be forever grateful for,\" Bartlett said. Rachelle Brown, who was an alternate with Homan's rink during its Scotties victory and world championship win, is staying on as a permanent member through the rest of this Olympic cycle.",

The Army veteran, who served in combat in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars before becoming a rising star in Republican Party politics, has been viewed as a potential running mate since he endorsed the former president in early January, two weeks ahead of the Iowa caucuses. But a report last week that Cotton may be moving up on T rump's list for the GOP's vice presidential nominee sparked a slew of stories in recent days about the senator. Rarely mentioned was that Cotton seriously mulled a 2024 White House run of his own before deciding against it in late 2022. NEW CONTENDER ON TRUMP'S LIST OF POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES? President Trump speaks while Sen. Tom Cotton listens in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Aug. 2, 2017. (Zach Gibson/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Cotton, who won re-election by a landslide in the 2020 Senate election in red-state Arkansas , spent plenty of time in 2021 and 2022 on the campaign trail on behalf of fellow Republicans running in the midterm elections. And those trips brought the senator multiple times to Iowa and New Hampshire, which for a half century have led off the GOP's presidential nominating calendar. The senator also bolstered his fundraising and political operation, and expanded his national profile with a book on military history. WATCH WHAT SEN. TOM COTTON HAS TO SAY ABOUT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ALITO FLAG CONTROVERSY But days before the 2022 midterms, Cotton announced he wouldn't run for the White House in 2024. And in his first interview after announcing his decision, the senator emphasized why he didn't run. \"Family was really the only consideration,\" he told Fox News Digital. Sen. Tom Cotton of speaks with an activist at a GOP fundraiser in Rye, New Hampshire, on Aug. 16, 2022. (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) The now-47-year-old senator and his wife Anna are the parents of two young boys. \"My boys are age 7 and 5. They’re old enough to know that dad’s gone and be sad about it, but not old enough to understand the purpose and why it all matters and why the sacrifice is worth it,\" Cotton said at the time. \"I am pretty sure Republican voters can find another nominee, but I know that my sons can’t find another dad for the next two years.\" The senator added that \"over the next two years my 7-year-old will learn to hit the fastball and my 5-year-old will learn to read, and I want to be there to teach them both.\" 2024 WILDCARD: COULD TRUMP CRIMINAL TRIAL VERDICT ROCK THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION? But Cotton left the door wide open to a future White House run, emphasizing, \"this is a decision only about this 2024 race and this time for my family. We’ll make a decision about future races in the future, especially as my boys get older and understand more about why I do the work I do and what it means for them and for our country.\" And he also said at the time that he'd consider serving in a GOP administration. \"Under the right circumstances, if a Republican president asked me to consider such a job, I’d of course consider it any time a president asks one to serve the nation,\" Cotton said.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Fast-forward nearly two years and Cotton told Fox News' Brett Baier last week that he and Trump have had a few conversations \"about what it's going to take to win this election in November, to elect President Trump to another term in the White House and elect a Republican Congress so we can begin to repair the damage that Joe Biden's presidency has inflicted on this country.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the senator said that neither Trump nor his campaign had reached out to him regarding serving as running mate. \"I suspect only Donald Trump knows who's really on his short list,\" Cotton added in his interview on Fox News' \"Special Report.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.

Apparently, neighbouring, Zambia power supplier, ZESCO Limited has announced a new 12-hour staggered load-shedding schedule for Lusaka, effective May 27, 2024. ZESCO says this approach aims to minimize the impact on customers as much as possible. About 80% of Zambia’s energy comes from hydro power stations which were severely affected by El Niño induced drought. Zimbabwe is equally affected as power production at Kariba is below full capacity due to limited water supply. Zwnews",

        "content": "cannot believe that eldest son is all grown up — and on Instagram. “My first baby is on Insta and I’m not OK,” Kourtney, 45, captioned an Instagram Story post on Sunday, May 26. The reality star included a series of emojis, showing off her emotions and added a red heart. Kourtney’s Instagram Story post came one day after Mason made on Saturday, May 25. The teenager offered a look at his personal style with his first post, wearing baggy pants and a black T-shirt in the photo. Mason covered his face with a baseball hat. Both Mason’s parents, Kourtney and , “liked” the photo. Kourtney and ex-boyfriend Scott share Mason, 13, daughter Penelope, 11, and son Reign, 9. (Kourtney also shares 6-month-old with husband .) , and also “liked” Mason’s first Instagram photo — and some left comments. “You’re really on Instagram,” Kim, 43, wrote. Khloé, 39, shared his photo on her Instagram Story on Saturday. “I can’t believe my @masondisick is on Insta,” she wrote. “The one who named [Kim and I] Kiki and Koko is a legit teenager.” Mason has since uploaded two subsequent posts. Both featured photos of Mason and his friends. His siblings, Penelope and Reign, also made an appearance. Mason’s birth and most of his youth was chronicled on , but the teen has since taken a step back from the spotlight — until now. You have successfully subscribed.

He’s extremely excited about that new car you promised him in three years.” Jenner, 68, previously explained during an April appearance on the “Next Question With Katie Couric” podcast that she promised Mason a car for his 16th birthday — pending a few conditions. “[I told him] on his bar mitzvah that I would buy him a car when he was 16 if I felt really confident and I could have proof that he’s never done any drugs or alcohol or anything like that,” the momager said at the time. “And then yeah, what happens is my kids kept, you know, keep having kids.

        "description": "Talks between China and the United States on the future development of artificial intelligence have been constructive.",
        "content": "Agreement has not yet been reached, but the world should take heart that the United States and China recently met to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) – an issue with profound global implications. The Geneva talks were the first intergovernmental exchange since leaders of the world’s two largest economies agreed to cooperate on reducing risks and improving governance of the technology. The high-level delegations exchanged views “constructively” at the May 14 meeting, according to readouts from both sides. China’s foreign ministry said both delegations reaffirmed a commitment to implementing the consensus President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden reached in November in San Francisco. A US National Security Council spokeswoman said Washington’s representatives stressed the importance of harnessing the benefits of AI for sustainable development and the need to build global consensus to ensure AI systems are “safe, secure and trustworthy”. US delegates raised concerns over the misuse of AI, including by China, as it affirmed the need to maintain open lines of communication on AI risk and safety as part of “responsibly managing competition”. China’s delegates said Beijing had stuck to a principle that AI technology should be people-centred and used for good and laid out a “solemn position” regarding US restrictions on AI. Chinese delegation leader Yang Tao said Beijing was willing to step up communication with Washington. He said China supported strengthening global governance of AI and “for the United Nations to play the role of main channel”. A global framework for AI governance, with standards and norms formed by wide consensus, is a sensible goal. It is right to focus on an issue that stands in the way of mending bilateral ties and deepening engagement. Earlier in the month, freshly appointed climate envoys from the US and China also held inaugural face-to-face discussions. Both sides have said that environmental issues should be free of the divisive rancour on other fronts. It is time for progress to be made. Market suppression and security concerns threaten to make AI talks relatively thorny. However, the benefits of AI, and the threat we all face if the technology is left unchecked should drive both sides to cooperate.",

Jaafar, 27, looks near identical to his uncle in the photos, donning the singer's red ensemble to shoot scenes for the upcoming biopic, simply named . In the behind-the-scenes photos, Jaafar dances on stage with his hair teased into Michael's trademark curls, wearing the star's iconic outfit from the 15-minute-long music video. Jaafar, who is the son of Michael's brother Jermaine, was around 13 years old when his uncle died shared his delight at being cast in the movie, writing on Instagram in January 2023: \"I'm humbled and honored to bring my Uncle Michael's story to life. To all the fans all over the world, I'll see you soon.\" The performer proceeded to go silent on social media until January of this year, when he shared a photo from set, writing: \"The Journey Starts Monday,\" revealing filming of the movie, which is set to drop in 2025, is in process. The movie is set to explore Michael's expansive career which saw him become one of the most successful artists of all time.

It’s Michael’s spirit that comes through in a magical way. You have to experience it to believe it,” he continued – we can't wait to see more! By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

SO WHAT: If you purchased Globe Life common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Globe Life class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24072 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 1, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made numerous materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning: (1) Globe Life’s consistent premium revenue growth, particularly from American Income Life Insurance Company (“AIL”); and (2) Globe Life’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”). Specifically, defendants repeatedly attributed Globe Life’s consistent premium revenue growth “to increased agent count and productivity.” In addition, Globe Life’s Code of Conduct stated, among other things, that “[t]he Company is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment,” that “[v]iolence and threatening behavior are not permitted,” and that “[t]he use of illegal drugs in the workplace will not be tolerated.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Globe Life class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24072 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

        "content": "News Haris Rauf: Injury lay-off could be 'blessing in disguise' Fast bowler returned to Pakistan ranks for second T20I at Edgbaston on Saturday Danyal Rasool 27-May-2024 • 51 mins ago Haris Rauf talks to the media ahead of the third T20I against Pakistan • Getty Images Elite athletes may have everything at their beck and call, but one thing they usually lack is time. In Pakistan cricket, no player has ever voluntarily taken time off from any kind of cricket - except to play cricket elsewhere during a calendar clash. Haris Rauf knows that better than anyone else after he decided to pull out of Pakistan's Test series in Australia to play the Big Bash, and paid for it with his central contract. As he worked his way mending fences with his cricket board, any notion of voluntary time off was fanciful. But events took their course, and an untimely dive during the final over of the PSL's highest-profile match saw him dislocate his shoulder. He would be ruled out for three months, missing the remainder of the PSL, Pakistan's home series against New Zealand and away series in Ireland, and he only made his competitive return in Birmingham on Saturday. All that time off, Haris acknowledges, may not have been such a bad thing. \"I was injured the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,\" he said at a press conference ahead of Pakistan's third T20I against England in Cardiff. \"Because you have time to recover and reassess your gameplans. I felt good coming back to cricket. When you play for your country, it makes you very proud.\" His comeback at Edgbastan was solid, if short of spectacular. He was the pick of the fast bowlers, taking two wickets for 34 in his allocated spell. It included an ill-advised Powerplay over - by far Rauf's weakest phase - that conceded 17. For the rest of his spell he maintained consistent pace and accuracy, and went at less than a run a ball while picking up two wickets., Related A nervous smile and a forced handshake - dealing with a crisis, the PCB way PCB terminates Haris Rauf's central contract for not committing to Australia tour Jos Buttler backs England to learn lessons from 50-over World Cup debacle Jofra Archer impresses on comeback as Jos Buttler makes the difference in 23-run win Jofra Archer's smooth comeback gives England a 'different level mood' It wouldn't ultimately be enough as Pakistan fell comfortably short in the end. \"When you lose a game it hurts, but as a team, we are confident,\" he said. \"We feel we can beat any opposition on any day. We've done it in the past, too. When you make mistakes you learn and try not to repeat those mistakes. We're looking to play better in the next few games and make a comeback. \"The camp is relaxed. We're enjoying ourselves. We're trying to follow our gameplans and execute them well. The results haven't often been in our favour recently but if you stick to your plans they can sometimes follow.\" Rauf also spoke of the psychological and physical struggles of returning from a long-term injury, particularly for a fast bowler - a topic that Naseem Shah also addressed recently. \"It's hard,\" he said. \"It's a struggle during your rehab, and it's difficult when you come back to maintain that pace and accuracy. But if you believe in yourself, it makes things easier. When I wasn't in the team and rehabbing, I had a lot of time to think about my game and work on myself. Thankfully I'm back now, and the World Cup is coming up.\" Pakistan have ensured they get as much match practice as possible ahead of the World Cup; in 2024, they will have played 17 T20Is by the end of this series, in addition to the PSL. It has included experimentation with the top order, the bowling combinations, and indeed a change of captain . It hasn't all gone their way, with the 2-1 win in Ireland their only T20I series win since the 2022 World Cup. Rauf admits winning the next two games would give Pakistan much-needed confidence, but insists these games are about more than just that. \"Before the World Cup, if you win a series it gives you confidence, but even if you lose you understand where you made mistakes and you learn from them,\" he said. \"This series is difficult, but we'll try to win it. The focus is of course on the World Cup, which we aim to win to make our country proud.\" Haris Rauf Pakistan England vs Pakistan Pakistan in England Danyal Rasool is ESPNcricinfo's Pakistan correspondent. @Danny61000",

Advertisement Elon Musk is getting dragged by Meta's AI chief on his own platform. Yann LeCun, Meta's leading AI scientist, poked fun at Musk on X on Monday over his attempt to recruit AI workers for his $24 billion firm xAI . The pair have been embroiled in a fresh spat since Musk's xAI announced Sunday that it had raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round. This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . On Monday, Musk posted a call to tech workers to join his company: \"Join xAI if you believe in our mission of understanding the universe, which requires maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth, without regard to popularity or political correctness.\" Advertisement LeCun, who has publicly feuded with Musk in the past, was quick to respond to Musk's post. He wrote : \"Join xAI if you can stand a boss who: - claims that what you are working on will be solved next year (no pressure). - claims that what you are working on will kill everyone and must be stopped or paused (yay, vacation for 6 months!). - claims to want a 'maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth' but spews crazy-ass conspiracy theories on his own social platform.\" LeCun was referring to Musk's claim in April that artificial general intelligence will arrive by next year, a prediction that he doubled down on last week, as well as his estimate of there being a 10-20% chance that AI could destroy humanity . The \"godfather of AI\" also took a jab at Musk's claims of being a free-speech absolutist and for sharing unverified claims on X. Advertisement The platform took down a post that Musk re-shared in March because it violated X's own rules. The tech rivals have quarreled online since at least 2017 and often don't see eye-to-eye. LeCun snapped at Musk in March, and disputed his claim that AI \"will probably be smarter than any single human next year.\" xAI's sole product so far is a chatbot called Grok, which was trained using data from Twitter, now called X, including Musk's posts. Elon Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

        "description": "The Chernigov Drama Theater is being forced to close after most men working there were drafted by the military, its head has said Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "A drama theater in the Ukrainian city of Chernigov is being forced to shut down, after the local military conscription center called up almost all of its male staff members, the facility’s leader has complained. Kiev has ramped up its mobilization push after sweeping reforms made it easier for the military to summon recruits. The theater based in a settlement some 125km north of the capital Kiev had received summonses for 34 of its employees, Andrey Bakirov told the news outlet Suspilne last Sunday. “Seven actors, two sound engineers, an editor, a violinist,” he noted. Some people on the list were already serving in the military, he added. Most of those who answered the call have been deemed fit for duty and sent to a boot camp, Bakirov said. A few, including a 56-year-old distinguished actor and a 59-year-old driver, were told to attend an extended medical examination to determine whether the Defense Ministry wants them. Under the new rules, people aged between 25 and 60 are eligible for mobilization. “Our theater will be closed for an indefinite time. We cannot perform anything, only produce something new. Everyone is in shock. They took almost all the men,” the theater head said. The only ones left are men of retirement age, a few students, and a 24-year-old actor, who has an exemption from military service, Bakirov added. Vladimir Zelensky signed the military reform last month in an attempt to bolster enrollment rates and prepare new units for Ukraine’s hostilities with Russia. His government claims that only by defeating Moscow can Kiev achieve a “just peace.” With the new rules coming into force this month, the Ukrainian economy is reportedly taking a hit, as fighting-age men refuse to show up in public spaces out of fear of being caught by conscription patrols. Mauro Longobardo, the CEO of a Kiev-based steel plant owned by the international giant ArcelorMittal, told The Financial Times this month that the factory’s existence is at risk due to lack of labor. He said: “If they continue to mobilize, we will not have enough [staff] to operate.” The company is being forced to give some physically demanding jobs to women in an attempt to stay afloat, he added. While Kiev officials previously claimed that just around 31,000 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed since the beginning of the hostilities in 2022, the actual tally is widely believed to be much higher. According to estimates by then-Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu earlier this month, Ukrainian military casualties have reached 111,000 soldiers since the beginning of the year alone.",

        "content": "During an Instagram live session, Lorch was observed at what appeared to be a house party, accompanied by two women. Thembinkosi Lorch, the talented midfielder for Mamelodi Sundowns, recently found himself in the spotlight for reasons beyond his football prowess. Following his club’s triumphant achievement of securing its seventh successive league title, Lorch was seen celebrating in high spirits. This victory marks a significant milestone in Lorch’s career, as it represents his first league cup win. To commemorate this momentous occasion, Lorch opted for a night of revelry. During an Instagram live session, Lorch was observed at what appeared to be a house party, accompanied by two women. The trio, seemingly under the influence of alcohol, danced and interacted with the camera, with Lorch embracing a woman on each side. This public display of celebration was met with a spectrum of reactions from fans and followers. A Natasha Thahane gave this womaniser, abuser and a loser a Child 🤣🤣. Every time we mention Lorch’s failures, Natasha Thahane’s name can’t be left out. Because she stood with an abuser all the way 😭. — Slaughter. (@BafanaSurprise) While some supporters expressed their happiness for Lorch’s personal and professional achievements, others were critical of the manner in which he chose to celebrate. The mixed reactions were particularly influenced by the context of Lorch’s recent personal developments, which have been a topic of public interest. Earlier this year, Lorch made a high-profile move from Orlando Pirates to Mamelodi Sundowns, a transition that was soon followed by his breakup with actress Natasha Thahane. The couple, who share a two-year-old son, parted ways amidst a flurry of rumours and public speculation, adding another layer of complexity to Lorch’s already busy life. Natasha Thahane, a well-known actress with a substantial social media following, found herself at the centre of a media storm following reports that Lorch had left her and their child to party with other women.

        "content": "A slow start in the Indian Premier League put Mitchell Starc’s record price tag under the microscope but the Australian all-formats hero underlined his worth as he lifted Kolkata Knight Riders to a third title. Starc, the costliest cricketer in the history of the league, was named Player of the Match after taking 2-14 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, including bowling opener Abhishek Sharma with an unplayable delivery that pundits judged the tournament’s best. A post shared by IPL (@iplt20) The performance followed on from his brilliant semi-final when he took three wickets and bowled Australia team mate Travis Head with the second ball. Starc started the tournament as one of its least economical bowlers, generating headlines across the world that compared his $2.98 million price tag with his paucity of wickets. It also led to a few light-hearted barbs from team-mates. None will be laughing at him now. “There have been plenty of jokes. A lot has been made of the money,” said the rangy left-armer. “I am older and more experienced now, so that has helped with managing the expectations and leading the attack. “It’s been a lot of fun, it’s been great to learn and see how these guys go about it but full credit to the whole players and staff, it’s made my life pretty easy.” Starc’s stunning return to form in the IPL burnishes his record in big matches and comes days before the T20 World Cup starts in the United States and the Caribbean. The 34-year-old took three wickets in the final of last year’s 50-over World Cup against hosts India and will likely be important for Australia’s hopes of becoming the first nation to hold cricket’s three global trophies in tests, ODIs and T20. Kolkata’s eye-watering bid for Starc during the IPL auctions stunned the cricket world late last year but it now appears to have been a master stroke. They may have to fork out more to retain his services in 2025. Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins will no doubt be happier playing with Starc for Australia than against him in the IPL. “I thought they bowled fantastically,” Cummins said after Hyderabad were skittled for 113. “Unfortunately, my old mate Starcy turned it on again.” Starc, Cummins and Head will link up with the rest of Australia’s T20 World Cup squad in the coming days ahead of their opener against Oman next week. Captain Mitchell Marsh said Australia felt lucky to have “world-class” Starc. “He’s so important for the make-up of our team,” Marsh said after training in Trinidad. “We know that Starcy is the X-factor, and you see throughout T20 cricket these days it’s the X-factor players who win you games, win you tournaments.”",

The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ? Fresh out of college, many Gen Z individuals are trying to navigate an econom y significantly reshaped by the COVID-19 pandemic. High interest rates, job market instability, and inflation have compounded their financial challenges. Gen Z has the lowest credit history and available credit, making it easier for them to max out their credit cards. According to Handshake, Gen Z defines a high starting salary as $82,000 on average. Despite this, they face substantial financial burdens. A similar report by TransUnion found that 22- to 24-year-olds today make less than those of the same age a decade ago. Trending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. The report found that 20-somethings today take home around $45,500, while Millennials earned $51,852 when adjusted for inflation. Moreover, Gen Z’s debt-to-income ratio, including all forms of debt, is 16.05%, compared to 11.76% for Millennials. According to the Federal Reserve report, household debt continues to grow in the U.S., with Americans now owing a collective $1.12 trillion on their credit cards. These financial challenges highlight Gen Z’s unique economic pressures, making it clear that the issue goes far beyond avocado toast.

        "content": "A newcomer to German politics, BSW was formed in January of this year but has already won its first victory in the right-wing hotspot, Thuringia. Experts predict that the party could seduce far-right voters in upcoming European elections. Self-described left-wing conservative politician Sahra Wagenknecht splintered off from the German Die Linke party last year to form her own. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance — Reason and Justice (BSW) and its pledge to stop weapon deliveries into Ukraine now promise to split the AfD vote, potentially winning seven seats in the Europan elections in June. A former MEP and Bundestag deputy since 2009, Wagenknecht also advocates for raising the minimum wage to €15 per hour and wants to water down climate change policies. Many see the party as a good alternative to the far-right parties that threaten to sweep up votes in the European Parliament. During her speech at the kick-off event for her EU vote campaign in Hamburg two weeks ago, Wagenknecht capitalised on the cost of living crisis that has been rocking much of Europe. \"I read that Mr Scholz, the Chancellor of our country, tells us there are no problems, 'Crisis? What crisis? The economy is growing. Future investments are flowing into Germany,'\" she bellowed out, much to the audience's applause. Many, including those who support the far right, have criticised the current traffic light coalition for the way they have been allocating the budget. Wagenknecht also condemns weapons delivery to Ukraine and urges negotiations with Putin. \"No, weapons don’t bring peace, weapons bring more war and weapons bring more death. That’s the reality,\" she said. The leading BSW candidate Fabio De Masi also denounced the government, alluding to corruption at the federal level and pointing to the missing text messages between European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer chief Albert Bourla during COVID-19 vaccines negotiations. De Masi also demands transparency for stock purchases from politicians. \"I am certain, just like with the banking deals during the big crisis, there will be some politicians who bought Rheinmetall shares. That is why we, as the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, demand that stock transactions by politicians must be made public,\" he said. \"This European election is also a chance to show the red card to the traffic light coalition. But not in the way that many people in Germany do out of desperation by voting for the AfD — a party that stirs up resentment, a party that wants to cut wages and pensions, and a party that advocates for increased militarisation in Germany. This is not the way to go,\" De Masi added. Wagenknecht's strategy of promising higher taxes on large companies and wealthier people seems to be working. The newly formed party won its first victory in local Thuringia elections — the first vote it ran in. Although the party is only a few months old, it has already appointed its first mayor in the small town of Bleicherode with 56.6% of the votes. Thuringia, the central German federal state, is a traditional stronghold of the far right. Many of the people at the campaign rally in Hamburg Euronews spoke to said they were either definitely going to vote for the BSW or weren't sure but found Sahra Wagenknecht \"clever\" and \"reasonable\". Several spoke of Germany \"going down the drain\" if the current government and political climate continues. Almost all of them supported Ukraine peace negotiations and stopping weapon deliveries to Kyiv. \"Many things Sahra Wagenknecht says are true, unfortunately,\" one retiree who said she worked for 40 years told Euronews. \"This party was created because sensible politics were not done. In 2015, they [Merkel's government] opened the country [to migrants] and said, 'Come here.' And since then, nothing significant has happened. They talk about skilled workers, but all sorts of people come. This cannot continue. The economy is collapsing, and as Sahra Wagenknecht says, the Greens dictate how people should live,\" she continued. The BSW could become the top far-left force in the European Parliament seeking to form a left-wing faction, but Wagenknecht has already made it clear that she does not see eye to eye with some of its members, “for example, in terms of migration”, which she vehemently opposes. The topic has repeatedly caused feuds between Wagenknecht and Die Linke, as the former has taken a hard-line stance on immigration. This could make it tricky to form a left-wing bloc after the elections in just a few weeks and could potentially spell trouble in the European Parliament. Wagenknecht herself said her policies are “left-wing conservative,” marrying socialist economic policies with conservative attitudes towards immigration.",

        "description": "The encampment has missed a deadline to pack up and go home",
        "content": "The University of Toronto filed an injunction order with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice early Monday morning seeking the removal of the anti-Israel encampment on its campus. “ In addition to pursuing this legal avenue to return King’s College Circle to the University community, we continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment. We held a long and productive meeting yesterday and are meeting again today. We remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement and bring the unauthorized encampment to an end,” President Meric Gertler wrote in a public statement announcing the move. Last Thursday, the university responded to the demands of anti-Israel protesters and presented a public offer following “many hours of in-person meetings and multiple email exchanges between the students and University administrators.” The proposal, presented by Gertler, included a chance for anti-Israel encampment representatives to present their demands to the Business Board of Governing Council as well as to establish a working group to “consider options for disclosure and increased transparency related to the University’s investments.” Gertler underscored that U of T would “not terminate any partnerships with Israeli universities or attempt to curtail scholars’ academic freedom in any way.” “ The University rejects calls for cutting ties with international partner institutions or engaging in academic boycotts because these actions would be at odds with our commitment to academic freedom, the unfettered global circulation of people and ideas, and advancing understanding by fostering collaboration and dialogue,” Gertler’s said in a statement issued last Thursday. He also offered to “increase opportunities for Palestinian scholars and faculty to enrich Palestinian studies at the University.” “The offer above is conditional on the encampment clearing and not resuming at any campus of the University. All participants in the encampment must also refrain from disrupting Convocation activities, which so many graduates and families are preparing to celebrate at this special time of year,” Gertler wrote. “The encampment must end.” The president’s offer came in response to a petition circulated on behalf of U of T Occupy for Palestine, the encampment’s leadership, demanding financial disclosures of the university’s “direct and indirect investments that sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and illegal settlement of Palestine” alongside an academic boycott of Israel. The petition makes no mention of Hamas or the October 7 atrocities committed by the Palestinian terrorist group and does not mention the Israelis abducted and killed in the attack. There have been mounting concerns of antisemitism at the campus encampment. Last week, a video circulated of an anti-Israel demonstrator doing a Nazi salute and praising Adolph Hitler. “ Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler, n—a. Heil Hitler. He’s a G. He’s a gangster. I wish he’d murdered all you guys bro. The world woulda been a better place if you (Jews) were gone. The world would have been a better place. You guys run the whole world. The Jews run the world,” the masked young man says as onlookers mostly ignore his comments. A masked woman in a scarf approaches him and appears to ask him to leave shortly before he does. \"Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler, n****r. Heil Hitler. He's a G. He's a gangster. I wish he'd murdered all you guys bro. The world woulda been a better place. If you were gone the world would have been a better place, you guys run the whole world. The Jews run the world.\" @UofT , what... pic.twitter.com/d5zFbYxtlz Gertler’s initial offer failed to resolve the matter prompting the university to begin posting several Notices of Trespass surrounding the encampment last Friday. The letters notified participants that failure to vacate by Monday, May 27, would result in U of T “taking all necessary legal steps including seeking an Order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.”",

        "content": "Nigeria’s letter of credit payments has plummeted by 63% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year, according to international payments data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). A letter of credit (LOC) is a document issued by a bank or financial institution that guarantees a buyer will pay a seller on time and in full for goods or services. LOCs are often used in international trade to protect both buyers and sellers, and can help businesses win new clients in foreign markets The total payments via official channels for Q1 2024 amounted to $204.47 million, a significant shortfall of $344.75 million compared to $549.22 million in Q1 2023. This steep decline underscores the challenges the country faces in its international trade and financial transactions, reflecting broader economic difficulties emanating from foreign exchange shortages.

Payment Breakdown In Q1 2023, January recorded payments of $107.78 million, followed by an increase in February to $171.95 million. March 2023 saw the highest payments for the quarter, totaling $269.49 million. However, the situation in Q1 2024 presents a stark contrast. January 2024 recorded significantly lower payments of $58.33 million. February saw an increase to $102.6 million, still far below the corresponding month in 2023. The trend continued downward in March 2024, with payments dropping to $43.54 million. Other details A letter of credit is a mode of payment for the importation of visible goods. As requested by the customer, the bank promises in writing to pay the exporter a certain sum within a certain time frame in return for goods, provided the customer supplies the proper paperwork. Earlier, the CBN extended the timeline for the issuance of letters of credit from 24 hours to five working days as the country continues to struggle with foreign exchange scarcity. The approved 2020 service charter of the CBN stipulated a 24-hour timeline for the issuance and management of letters of credit. However, the newly approved 2023 service charter extended this to five working days. This change likely reflects the ongoing difficulties in accessing foreign currency, which in turn hindered the ability of businesses to open letters of credit. Towards the end of Q1 2024, Nigeria’s foreign exchange (FX) reserves depleted significantly. CBN Governor Yemi Cardoso explained that the decreasing reserves were primarily due to debt repayments and other standard financial obligations rather than efforts to defend the naira. During this period, the CBN started selling dollars to Bureau De Change operators (BDCs) in February 2024 and made another sale in March but reduced the allocation by 50% and sold FX at a rate of N1,251/$1. Additionally, Nigeria spent about $1.12 billion on foreign debt service payments, marking a 39.7% increase. Implications for the Economy The 63% reduction in letters of credit could have several implications for Nigeria’s economy. Letters of credit are a crucial component of international trade, assuring exporters they will receive payment. A sharp decline in such payments could indicate decreased import activity, possibly due to foreign exchange shortages, stricter import regulations, or other economic constraints. This decline can lead to reduced availability of imported goods, impacting various sectors of the economy, including manufacturing and retail, which rely on imported materials and products. The situation also highlights the broader economic challenges Nigeria faces , including foreign exchange scarcity, rising debt obligations, and pressures on the national currency. Moving forward, business leaders have noted that the ability of Nigeria to stabilize its foreign exchange reserves and improve access to international financial instruments like letters of credit will be crucial in supporting its trade and economic growth. The recent policy measures and economic strategies implemented by the CBN and the federal government are expected to play a vital role in addressing these challenges and fostering a more robust economic environment.",

        "content": "VIEWERS had mixed reactions as ITV thriller Red Eye aired its final episode last night. The six-part political crime drama told the story of Matthew Nolan (Richard Armitage), a British doctor being extradited to China on suspicion of murder. This followed an incident in Beijing where Matthew was alleged to have left Shen Zhao, a Chinese woman, to die after crashing his car. Although Matthew confirmed the car crash, he denied the deceased Shen Zhao had been a passenger in his vehicle. Meanwhile DC Hana Li (Jing Lusi), who was born in Hong Kong, was designated to accompany Matthew on his return flight to Beijing. The flight however takes a dramatic turn when dead bodies start piling up - while intelligence agencies on the ground try to get to the bottom of a conspiracy. All six episodes premiered on ITVX on April 21, although also aired each Sunday at 9pm. As the show progressed, fans have not held back in sharing their opinions of the series. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), one person wrote: “Stuck with Red Eye on ITV hoping for a big pay off even though it's been a drag to get through and it was a total anticlimax.” Another added: “It's completely implausible and ridiculous at times but as Alec Guiness said when he first read the script for Star Wars , I had to keep turning the page.” A third viewer said they ultimately gave up on watching Red Eye, describing the show as “too stupid.” A fourth watcher penned: “Red Eye on ITV is quite possibly one of the worst things I’ve ever watched. Writing/acting- sorry overacting... it’s been bad from the get go!” However, not everyone had negative thoughts about Red Eye, with others praising the series. One posted: “Just finished Red Eye on ITV, good little series that was!” “Red Eye was fantastic! We watched them on ITVX”, another person echoed. The cast also includes Lesley Sharp, Jemma Moore, Dan Li, Jonathan Aris, Thomas Chaanhing and Mido Hamada, among others. All six episodes of Red Eye are available to watch on ITVX.",

        "content": "There’s a new addition to the exterior of the Whitestone Public Library and Technology Centre in Parry Sound District, and it’s hard to miss. It’s a 10-metre high fishing pole created by Buffalo, New York native Albert Gilewicz. Gilewicz is no stranger to the Whitestone area. He was six months old when his parents built a family cabin at nearby Lake Wahwashkesh in the early 1960s, and he’s been visiting the area ever since. Nowadays Gilewicz visits the family cabin with his wife P.J. Watkins. Gilewicz is an engineer but also an artist. He told the North Bay Nugget that the concept of building a 10 metre tall fishing pole is something he’s toyed with for years. “The question was where and how to do it,” Gilewicz said. The first part of the question was answered while Gilewicz visited the Whitestone library a while back and learned of its fishing pole and tackle box lending program. Whitestone Librarian and CEO Eva Fincham says the fishing poles are provided through the Tackleshare program which was initiated by the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. A woman donated two additional kits while the Whitestone Rod and Gun club donated ice fishing kits. When Gilewicz approached Fincham about his idea, she was interested, but at the same time Fincham also found it hard to visualize a 10-metre fishing pole and, then there was the question of where to put it. “He took a lot of pictures of the fishing rods we lend out,” she said. “He wanted to model the giant fishing rod after the ones we have in the library”. Fincham said the concept needed the approval of both the local library board and municipality which Gilewicz expected, and once he showed all the parties designs of his vision, it didn’t take long for everyone to come on board. Gilewicz says he “grew up fishing” in the Whitestone area and over the years he developed “a passion and a sense of home” for the area. He and his parents got to know many of the year-round residents over the years, and when Gilewicz conceptualized the fishing pole, he thought “why not here”. As an engineer Gilewicz had the skill set to make a structurally strong sculpture. The components also had to fit in his sedan since he would be building the artwork in Buffalo and then driving the sections to Whitestone where they would be assembled. “That changes how you think of the construction,” he said “But it also forces you to think about how to make it safe and secure”. The result was a fishing pole made up of eight pieces and constructed from PVC pipes. The handle which supports the fishing reel is the thickest section with a four inch diameter pipe and that’s connected to a three inch pipe followed by a stream of smaller pipes until the tip of the rod is reached which is made from a half inch pipe. The fishing rod’s hook runs through the Dr. Seuss book ‘One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish’. Gilewicz would have preferred to see the hook pass through Ernest Hemingway’s novel “The Old Man and the Sea” but his wife and friends convinced him to go with Dr. Seuss since it will have more meaning to children at that age who see the giant fishing pole. The pole is anchored to the library roof and Gilewicz says nothing but a catastrophic storm is knocking it down. Gilewicz dry-fitted the pipes in Buffalo to make sure there were no connection issues, and Whitestone municipal staff helped erect the fishing pole. Gilewicz said the municipal employees were comfortable with the construction. The fishing pole went up during the Victoria Day long weekend and it will come down at Thanksgiving. Gilewicz isn’t sure where the sculpture will go after it’s taken down. The library held a ceremony to recognize Gilewicz’s art piece. Library board member Josh Davis officiated and talked about Gilewicz 60 plus year association with the Whitestone region. While in Grade 1, a teacher of Gilewicz recognized he was dyslexic, but Davis pointed out this didn’t hold back the future engineer and artist. “He developed a unique way of thinking that helped him excel in engineering but his creative side has always shown through ,” Davis said. “It’s allowed him to solve technical problems with ‘out of the box’ thinking and to create stunning art that speaks to both mind and heart”. Davis also highlighted the art residencies Gilewicz has been part of over the years and these have taken him to places like Barcelona, Denmark and South Carolina. Davis said Gilewicz is a person who is passionate about the environment and responsible energy use and he brings those attributes to his art. “Albert combines his background in engineering with his love for creativity making his work unique and thought-provoking,” he said. “He’s explored environmental themes and created works that connect deeply with their surroundings”. Davis added Gilewicz has that ability to turn “everyday objects into powerful works of art” as is shown by the 10-metre fishing rod. Davis said Gilewicz’s giant fishing pole “isn’t just a nod to the joys of fishing”. “It’s also a symbol of the beauty and calm that art brings to our lives,” he said.",

With Euro 2024 just around the corner, we could not end the season without an all-Italian Serie A XI for 2023-24. Several Azzurri, such as Federico Dimarco, Alessandro Bastoni and Riccardo Calafiori have already been mentioned in our Best Serie A XI for 2023-24, but they also feature in the all-Italian team. Almost every Football Italia writer has mentioned centre-back Alessandro Buongiorno, and the same is true of Federico Chiesa and Gianluca Scamacca, who had not found space in our ideal Serie A XIs. By the look of it, Raoul Bellanova was the best right wing-back in the league, having ended the season with one goal and seven assists for Torino.

        "content": "The power of a good outfit and make-up is unmatchable, but one woman's transformation took her from \"50 to 25\" and people were stunned. Instagram user @cyntanner shared a video showing off her \"casual brunch\" outfit, but it was far more than casual and people were amazed at how different she looked in the before and after. Most women will know that 'I woke up like this' is a downright lie, so they would be able to relate to the process, but many couldn't believe how the messy-haired woman turned glam in a short skirt and sunnies. Sporting a burgundy tank top, casual joggers and a bed-head before her transformation, Cyn showed that she was going to get ready off camera. When she came back with a full face of make-up, slicked back hair, baby tee, mini skirt and knee-high boots, people were stunned. 'Woman smashed into my car but it's what she did after that really annoyed me' Commenting on the video - which has garnered almost 96,000 likes - one person said she'd gone from \"50 to 25\". The final part of the video showed her swaying her hips as she strutted towards the camera, obviously loving the way that she looked at that moment. Another commenter said she looked like actress Zendaya when she was done up, and others agreed, writing: \"How'd you transform into Zendaya like that?\" Other comments on the video included: \"My jaw dropped\", \"She went from grandma to DAMNma\", and \"Aged backwards\". Some were less than complimentary though, saying: \"This is f***ed. Can you imagine waking up and not even recognising the person the next morning?\" Another man agreed, saying: \"Make-up should be illegal.\" One woman fumed at the negative comments some were leaving, however, typing: \"People love to hate. You're just ageing, and that's ok. Your makeup doesn't make you look significantly younger, and it shouldn't.\" Do you have a story to share?

But what about atmospheric samples? Could these provide scientists with better information pertaining to the history of Mars?",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Laurence Tognetti, Universe Today NASA is actively working to return surface samples from Mars in the next few years, which they hope will help us better understand whether ancient life once existed on the red planet's surface billions of years ago. But what about atmospheric samples? Could these provide scientists with better information pertaining to the history of Mars? This is what a recent study presented at the 55th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference hopes to address as a team of international researchers investigated the significance of returning atmospheric samples from Mars and how these could teach us about the formation and evolution of the red planet. Here, Universe Today discusses this research with the study's lead author, Dr. Edward Young, who is a professor in the Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences at UCLA, and study co-author, Dr. Timothy Swindle, who is a Professor Emeritus in the Lunar & Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, regarding the motivation behind the study, how atmospheric samples would be obtained, current or proposed missions, follow-up studies, and whether they think life ever existed on the red planet. Therefore, what was the motivation for the study? Dr. Young tells Universe Today, \"We learn a lot about the origin of a planet from its atmosphere as well as its rocks. In particular, isotope ratios of certain elements can constrain the processes leading to the formation of the planet.\" Dr. Swindle follows this with, \"There are two basic types of motivation. One is that we're planning on bringing all these rock samples , and we're going to be interested in knowing how they've interacted with the atmosphere, but we can't figure that out without knowing the composition of the atmosphere in detail. \"So, we need an atmospheric sample to know what the rocks might have been exchanging elements and isotopes with. But we'd also like to have a sample of the Martian atmosphere to answer some basic questions about processes that have occurred, or are occurring, on Mars. \"For example, Martian meteorites contain trapped atmospheric noble gases, like krypton and xenon. But it appears that there are at least two different 'atmospheric' components in those meteorites.\" For the study, the researchers proposed several benefits of returning a Mars atmospheric sample to Earth, including atmospheric samples being among the NASA Perseverance (Percy) rover sample tubes, gaining insight into potential solar gar within the Martian interior, evolutionary trends in atmospheric compositions, nitrogen cycling, and sources of methane on Mars. For the Percy atmospheric sample, also known as Sample No.1 \"Roubion,\" the study notes how this sample was obtained after Percy tried to collect a rock core sample but ended up collecting atmospheric gases instead. Additionally, the study proposes the lack of leakage the sample tube will experience while awaiting its return to Earth and the gases present within the sample are ideal for analysis once returned to Earth, as well. But aside from the Percy rover sample, how else could a Martian atmosphere sample be obtained? \"At least two other ideas for collecting a sample of Martian atmosphere have been suggested,\" Dr. Swindle tells Universe Today. \"One is to fly a spacecraft through the Martian atmosphere, collect a sample as it goes through, then return it to Earth. The other is to have a sample return cannister (it doesn't have to be any bigger than a Perseverance tube) that has valves and a (Martian) air compressor. \"You could land it on the surface of Mars, open the valve to the atmosphere, turn on the compressor, and get a sample that has hundreds or thousands of times as much Martian atmosphere as a volume that is just sealed without compression, as Perseverance has done, and hopefully will do again.\" Dr. Swindle and Dr. Young both mention the Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars (SCIM) mission, which was proposed in 2002 by a team of NASA and academic researchers with the goal of collecting atmospheric samples at an altitude of 40 kilometers (25 miles) above the Martian surface and return them to Earth for further analysis. While SCIM was selected as a semi-finalist for the 2007 Mars Scout Program, it was unfortunately not selected for further development, and both Dr. Young and Dr. Swindle tell Universe Today there are currently no atmospheric sample missions being planned aside from the Percy rover sample. Therefore, what follow-up studies from this research are currently underway or being planned? Dr. Swindle and Dr. Young both mention how efforts are being made to collect small quantities of atmospheric gas due to the small size of the sample tubes, with Dr. Swindle telling Universe Today, \"A big set of questions right now is how good a sealed Perseverance tube would be at containing an atmospheric sample. How good is the seal? Might the tube spring a leak on a hard landing? Would some molecules in the Martian atmosphere stick to the coatings of the tubes? \"There's been some activity on all of these questions, and so far, the answers have all been good—it looks like those Perseverance tubes may do well, even though they weren't really designed with atmospheric sampling in mind.\" As noted, the purpose of obtaining and returning an atmospheric sample from Mars could help scientists better understand the formation and evolution of the red planet. While present-day Mars is a very cold and dry world with an atmosphere that is a fraction of the Earth's atmosphere, with liquid water being unable to exist on the surface, along with no active volcanism, as well. However, significant evidence obtained from landers, rovers, and orbiters over the last several decades point to a much different Mars billions of years ago after it first formed. This included an active interior that produced a magnetic field that shielded the surface from harmful solar and cosmic radiation, a much thicker atmosphere being replenished from active volcanism, and flowing liquid water, all of which potentially led to the existence of some forms of life on the surface. However, given Mars' small size (half of Earth), this means its internal heat cooled off much faster (possibly over millions of years), resulting in volcanism becoming inactive and the dissipation of the magnetic field the interior activity was driving, the latter of which led to harmful solar and cosmic radiation stripping the atmosphere, with the surface liquid water evaporating to space along with it. Therefore, do Dr. Young and Dr. Swindle believe life ever existed on Mars, and will we ever find it? Dr. Young tells Universe Today, \"I really don't know. I think microbial life sometime in the past, or even now, is a reasonable hypothesis but we don't have enough information.\" Dr. Swindle also echoes his uncertainty whether life ever existed on Mars, but elaborates by telling Universe Today, \"If there hasn't, why did life start so early on Earth, but didn't start on Mars, which had a similar climate at the time. If there has been, how similar is it to life on Earth? Since Earth and Mars are always exchanging rocks because of impacts, is life on Earth related to life on Mars? \"If it has existed, it will be tough to find. But an atmospheric sample could help. For instance, there seems to be methane in the Martian atmosphere. Most, but not all, of the methane in Earth's atmosphere is biological, and analyzing the relative ratios of the isotopes of carbon or hydrogen is one of the best ways to figure that out.\" More information: The importance of Martian atmosphere sample return. www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2024/pdf/2620.pdf Provided by Universe Today",

        "description": "Destiny 2’s perk pool could do with some liberal pruning to eliminate useless buffs ahead of The Final Shape.",
        "content": "The pool of undesirable perks in Destiny 2 has grown exponentially over the years, and players are beginning to question their place in the sandbox. The chase for a perfect weapon roll has always been at the core of Bungie’s looter shooter but doing so has become increasingly difficult due to perk bloat. With more options comes less chance for Guardians to find loot with best-in-slot winners like Bait and Switch or other heavily meta perks. The as part of Into The Light last month hasn’t exacerbated the issue, but the chase for those shiny new has absolutely renewed debate. Invisible Hand has become a particular pain point, with the perk’s function (or lack thereof) over on the Destiny subreddit. User Spikehiyashi6 posted, “Is this an April Fools’ perk? Miss MULTIPLE shots in order to get +25 stability for one second? How is this even remotely useful?” Invisible Hand has faced stiff derision ever since its introduction in Season of the Deep. Granting bonus stability for a minuscule window after failing to land hits isn’t great. It’s currently only available on four weapons, Kept Confidence, Rapacious Appetite, Different Times and Targeted Redcation so it’s not a wide spread problem, but all of those weapons likely would benefit from better perk choice there. However, even when it is working, players have . “I honestly was struggling to proc it, unless I tried to miss my target intentionally”, one player claimed, adding “Even if it procs, it’s barely noticeable. Expectedly, the criticism triggered others to jump on the bandwagon to share their own list of perks perceived to have little use. “Slickdraw I could see being great on a shotgun at least, although it is a gimped version of Quickdraw”, added one user, with Adrenaline Junkie also being thrown under the bus. “Adrenaline Junkie can pretty much always have a better perk in its slot.” As with every expansion before it, The Final Shape will be accompanied by its own fresh set of . Some of these are bound to be better than others, potentially prolonging the loot grind even further. Bungie removing the ability to farm Limited Edition Brave weapons with the DLC could result in a double whammy of unsatisfying loot.

        "content": "While Orlando Pirates celebrated a return to the Caf Champions League with their DStv Premiership runners-up position clinched at the weekend, they cannot be pleased at a gap of 23 points from champions Mamelodi Sundowns, Bucs coach Jose Riveiro admitted. Riveiro said Bucs will strive to perform better in the 2024-25 Champions League than this campaign, where his team bombed out in the second preliminary round with a shock defeat to Botswana’s Jwaneng Galaxy. Pirates (50 points) wrapped up second place in the Premiership on goal difference on Saturday when they drew 1-1 against SuperSport United and Stellenbosch FC (also 50) lost 2-1 against Richards Bay FC. Bucs twice failed to capitalise on two previous defeats by Stellies, both sides dropping six points in their last two games in the two-horse race for second. Those defeats contributed to Pirates ending 23 points behind seventh time successive champions Mamelodi Sundowns, eight more than their gap of 16 as runners-up last campaign. “Fantastic result, fantastic that Pirates are going to be in the Champions League again next season and I am really proud Pirates will represent South Africa on the continent and hopefully better than the last time,” Riveiro said of the hard-earned draw against SuperSport that finally clinched second place. The Spaniard was asked about this month’s dropped points as Bucs seemed to see second place slipping away. “I’m so proud and happy because it’s not easy. I think we shouldn’t undermine what it means to be in the Champions League, but we’re not celebrating being in second place — we are celebrating being in the Champions League. We’ve got the right to be there and it means a lot to the club. “But being second, 23 points behind the winners, is not a huge achievement. That’s our objective from now — how can we reduce that gap with whoever is leading the log? “It’s too much distance for the second position even though, like I said many times, we are competing with a team that is not famous for dropping points frequently. “But the things we can control — things like the previous two games, having the opportunity to consolidate second spot and giving away points — it’s something we need to do a reflection on and understand why it happened.” Pirates end their season with the Nedbank Cup final against Sundowns at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The clash is a rematch of this season’s MTN8 final where Pirates beat Downs on penalties. Bucs are out to defend a second cup title this campaign. Sundowns are seeking a treble as a win in the Nedbank would add to their Premiership and African Football League trophies in 2023-24.",

        "description": "Nick Carter has been accused of sexual assault by three women. What are Melissa Schuman, Ashley and Shannon Ruth's allegations? Where do the lawsuits stand?",
        "content": "This story mentions sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse. If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673. The four-part Investigation Discovery docuseries “ Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter ” unpacks sexual assault allegations involving Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter. Nick Carter, 44, has been accused of sexual assault by three women, all of whom filed lawsuits against him in 2022 and 2023. His three accusers are interviewed in the documentary. He previously denied all allegations in past statements and responded to the women's lawsuits with counterclaims against each. The docuseries, airing on May 27 and 28, warns viewers that the details might be “disturbing” as the three women recount the trauma they allegedly suffered. “The views expressed are those of the accused alone,” the docuseries says. It also notes that the cases involving these allegations are ongoing and that the singer declined to be interviewed for “Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter.” TODAY.com has reached out to Carter for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication. Who has come forward with allegations against Nick Carter? Former singer and actor Melissa Schuman, Shannon “Shay” Ruth and a third accuser, who is referred to as “Ashley” in the Investigation Discovery docuseries and A.R. in a lawsuit, all open up about their sexual assault allegations against Nick Carter. NBC News identifies people alleging sexual abuse only when they have agreed to come forward publicly. As of August 2023, each woman has filed a lawsuit against the pop star, according to documents obtained by TODAY.com show. Melissa Schuman Melissa Schuman, a former member of the girl group DREAM, first came forward with sexual assault allegations against Nick Carter in a blog post published in November 2017, which she says took place in 2003. She described, in the documentary, the “hell on earth” that came after she published her blog post. The episode includes screenshots of hateful messages she has received from Backstreet Boys fans questioning her credibility. Nick Carter responded in November 2017 to her blog post’s allegations in a statement obtained by NBC News. “I am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman’s accusations. Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual. We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally,” he said. “This is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later. It is contrary to my nature and everything I hold dear to intentionally cause someone discomfort or harm,” he continued. Schuman was unable to file a lawsuit when she first came out with the allegations because of a 10-year statute of limitations, but that changed in 2023, when a new California law changed the statute of limitations window for sexual assault claims made by adult accusers. The lawsuit, filed in January 2023, describes Schuman as “a survivor of sexual abuse, sexual battery, assault, and molestation at the hands of ... Nick Carter,” and said Carter used his power to “gain access to, groom, manipulate, exploit, and sexually assault” Schuman. It lists sexual battery, sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress as causes of action. The incident, per the lawsuit, took place when Schuman was 18 at Carter’s apartment in Santa Monica. At the time, she and Carter were co-stars in the teen horror film “The Hollow.” Schuman had left the girl group DREAM the year prior, in 2002. Carter invited Schuman over to his apartment and she went over with her roommate, per the lawsuit. Schuman alleges Carter assaulted her in his office that evening. “It felt like getting hit by waves where you come up for air and you keep getting hit and you go back down,” she says in the documentary, going into detail about the alleged attack. Schuman said in the lawsuit she was a virgin before the alleged assault and that she contracted HPV. She told people about the alleged assault including her father, Jerome Schuman, featured in the documentary. Nick Carter’s attorney Liane K. Wakayama called the lawsuit a “PR stunt” in a statement: “Melissa Schuman has been peddling this tale for many years, but her allegation was false when she first made it back in 2017 — and it still is.” Schuman’s lawsuit came after a judge in Nevada allowed Carter to move forward with a counterclaim against another accuser, Shannon Ruth, who filed a lawsuit in December 2022. Schuman and her father were named as defendants, and in 2024 the third accuser, A.R., was added. Ashley Rapp The plaintiff known as A.R., who goes by Ashley in the documentary, says she saw Schuman’s blog post and it “sent shivers down” her spine. She goes on to discuss something “very traumatic” she says happened when she was 15 years old, and is described in her lawsuit filed in August 2023. The lawsuit listed sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress as causes for action. The incidents took place in Marathon, Florida in 2003, where the Carter family had a compound, per the lawsuit. The lawsuit said Carter “was aware” A.R. was a minor at the time of multiple sexual acts, engaged ‘without (A.R.’s) consent.” A.R. said she was a virgin during their first encounter and she contracted HPV. The lawsuit said Carter “instructed” three friends to observe them “engage in sexual intercourse.” A.R., in the documentary, says she was “adamantly, vocally against” having sex. A.R. returned to her home in Pennsylvania and told her mother what had happened, who then filed a police report. Authorities did not press charges, per the lawsuit. A countersuit filed in 2024 gives insight into why the state prosecutor didn’t press charges, quoting a sheriff’s filing at the time that cited A.R.’s three-month delay in reporting the incident and the Carter family “believing she was 18 years of age.” A.R. “looked 18” and that “any reasonable person would believe that she were at least that age.” Lawyer for Nick Carter responded to the lawsuit at the time saying A.R. was “repeating the same false accusations” she once did. “Nick is looking forward to the evidence being presented and the truth about these malicious schemes coming to light,” the statement from lawyer Dale Hynes, Jr. said, in part. Shannon “Shay” Ruth In December 2022, Shannon “Shay” Ruth became the first woman to file a lawsuit against Carter on the grounds of sexual assault. Ruth alleges the incident took place in a tour bus when she was 17 in 2001. Per the lawsuit, Carter invited her to the tour bus while Ruth was in a meet and greet line after a Backstreet Boys concert at the Tacoma Dome. Ruth, like the other two women who filed lawsuits, said she was a virgin at the time of the incident and that she contracted HPV. The causes of action listed are sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Nick Carter’s attorney, Michael Holtz, denied Ruth’s allegations in a statement on Dec. 8, 2022. “This claim about an incident that supposedly took place more than 20 years ago is not only legally meritless but also entirely untrue. Unfortunately, for several years now, Ms. Ruth has been manipulated into making false allegations about Nick — and those allegations have changed repeatedly and materially over time,” Holtz said. How has Nick Carter responded to the allegations? Nick Carter filed a counterclaim against Ruth in February 2023, seeking $2.35 million in damages. The lawsuit, obtained by NBC News, lists Melissa Schuman and her father as counter-defendants, too. The filing alleges that the Schumans brought Ruth “into their scheme\" and “groomed and coached” her to say she was sexually assaulted by the Backstreet Boys member. The countersuit claims, generally, that Schuman, his other two accusers and Schuman’s father Jerome Schuman are engaging in a “conspiracy to defame and vilify Carter and otherwise ruin Carter’s reputation for the purposes of garnering attention and fame and/or extorting money from Carter.” Evidence the judge used to allow the countersuit to move forward included a correspondence between Ruth and an online friend named Heather Hayat, who, according to her declaration, met on Twitter. “Shay messaged me and told me she felt bad because she hadn’t been hurt by Nick like Melissa and Ashley were claiming. Instead, she told me Nick had said mean things to her and she had been bullied,” Hayat wrote in the declaration, attaching a screenshot of their alleged direct message. Further evidence included an affidavit from a friend of Ruth’s who attended the concert when the alleged incident took place and “believes Ruth’s timeline is factually impossible” after witnessing the band members return to the hotel from the meet and greet. One of the Backstreet Boys' security guards, Marcus Johnson, wrote in a declaration that it would be “impossible for any fan to be alone with any of the band members on their tour bus,” and that he would have been “made aware” of any deviation at the Tacoma concert. Jerome Schuman, Melissa Schuman and Ruth denied Nick Carter’s allegations in the docuseries. Jerome Schuman says, “We only have one reason we are doing what we’re doing which is to attain justice.” Ruth says, “Nobody manipulated me or forced me or planned out any conspiracy or anything else.” Melissa Schuman says that she is suing because she wants her own due process and thought that it would never be a possibility until the statute of limitations changed in California civil court. “As of January 2023 I could finally file a lawsuit and attempt to hold him accountable and so I did,” she says. In new documents filed in January 2024, an “A.R.” was mentioned as a defendant and called a “co-conspirator” in the suit. Where do lawsuits against Nick Carter, and his countersuit, stand now? As the docuseries mentioned, Melissa Schuman and Ruth both filed to have Nick Carter’s lawsuit dismissed. A judge ruled in March 2023 that his counterclaim could move forward, documents obtained by NBC News show. In January a judge denied Nick Carter’s request to move his sexual assault case involving Melissa Schuman from California to Nevada. Nick Carter spoke about the allegations for the first time during an interview with “Entertainment Tonight” in May. “There is a legal process happening right now, and I can’t get into too many of the details. But you know what I can say is that I’m really happy with the way things are going and once it’s all done I look forward to finally talking about it,” he said.",

        "content": "FanCamp was set to offer accommodation with a garden, a bar and a shared lounge, for fans basing themselves in host city Cologne – which will host Scotland’s second group stage match against Switzerland on June 19. The campsite was said to be on a headland directly on the river Rhine, centrally located near the Cologne Messe/Deutz long-distance train station, and right next to the public viewing “Tanzbrunnen”. However, the camp, which bosses said was “particularly popular with Scottish and English football fans”, has been forced to cancel due to heavy rainfall making the water level on the river rise. As many as 150,000 Scots are expected to make the trip to support the national team as they play in their first major finals overseas since the World Cup in France in 1998. Organiser Dirk Stoeveken apologised to Scotland fans, but insisted they were left with no option but to cancel after the camp was put “almost completely under water”. He said: “The camp site is currently almost completely under water and the forecast is that the water level of the Rhine will continue to rise. “This is having a huge impact on the preparations and unfortunately does not allow for a reliable forecast regarding the timeframe and possible cost development.“ Gregor Timmer, the City of Cologne’s representative for the European Championships: “It is a great pity that we had to make this decision. “We were all very much looking forward to this offer, which was particularly popular with Scottish and English football fans. “However, the safety of everyone involved is always our top priority and we take concerns about this very seriously. It was important for us to make a decision as early as possible to allow fans to make alternative arrangements. “We are also avoiding a financial risk that would otherwise have been borne in full by the City of Cologne. “Unfortunately, a serious assessment of all these points has left us with no option but to cancel.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "description": "The Italian guided Leicester back into the Premier League at the first attempt.",
        "content": "CHELSEA ARE REPORTEDLY in advanced talks to make Leicester’s Enzo Maresca their new head coach. The Italian, who until last summer was Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Manchester City, has guided the Foxes back into the Premier League at the first time of asking following their relegation 12 months ago. That, and the style of football with which he achieved it, has impressed the Chelsea hierarchy who are looking for a successor to Mauricio Pochettino after they parted ways after just one season. Reports suggest Chelsea have asked for permission to speak to Maresca, whom Leicester would demand compensation for with a figure of £10 million (€11.7m) being floated. Brentford’s Thomas Frank and Kieran McKenna, who got Ipswich promoted from the Sky Bet Championship behind Leicester, were also apparent contenders for the role. The task of identifying a replacement for Pochettino, who departed on amicable terms having failed to reach agreement with the club over how much responsibility he would be given over football matters, is being overseen by co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart. A final decision on any appointment must ultimately be signed off by the club’s co-controlling owners Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali, who is understood to have been lukewarm on the prospect of Pochettino remaining in the job, and Jose E Feliciano. Chelsea and Leicester have been approached for comment.",

        "content": "David Raya, who was on loan at Arsenal this season, has been announced as a part of the Spain provisional squad for the Euro 2024 in Germany. David Raya Gets Euro 2024 Call-up for Spain Raya’s exploits in goal coupled with Arsenal’s resolute defence helped the Spaniard win the Golden Glove this season. He kept 16 clean sheets in total and thus beat his nearest competitor Jordan Pickford who had 13. The Brentford goalkeeper moved to Arsenal on loan in a deal with an option to buy for £27 million. The move was initially met with scepticism, especially due to Aaron Ramsdale’s popularity among the fanbase. But soon he started winning over the critics with his calm and composed nature at goal. Mikel Arteta went on to describe him as ‘magnificent’ after the recent North London Derby, which the Gunners won 3-2. Arguably his best moment in an Arsenal jersey came against Porto in the Champions League round of 16 . He saved two penalties in the shoot-out to send the Gunners to the quarterfinals of the Champions League after 14 years. Owing to his excellent performances Arsenal are expected to make his loan move permanent this summer. Spain manager Luis de la Fuente named his 29-man provisional squad for the upcoming Euros in Germany. Raya was one of the 3 goalkeepers named by him. The 28-year-old is expected to provide heavy competition to Athletic Bilbao keeper Unai Simon for a spot in the starting lineup. So far he has featured for Spain just four times. Simon on the other hand has been Spain’s first-choice keeper for the last four years and played in all of their matches in Euro 2020. The Arsenal man is accompanied by fellow Premier League stars Rodri(Manchester City) and Marc Cucurella (Chelsea). Pedro Porro and Pau Torres were prominent names missing from the squad despite having a good season for Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa respectively. Goalkeepers: David Raya, Unai Simon, Alex Remiro Defenders: Aymeric Laporte, Robin Le Normand, Alex Grimaldo, Dani Carvajal, Dani Vivian, Jesus Navas, Nacho Fernandez, Marc Cucurella, Pau Cubarsi Midfielders: Mikel Merino, Fabian Ruiz, Alex Baena, Martin Zubimendi, Rodrigo, Marcos Llorente, Pedri, Aleix Garcia, Fermin Lopez Forwards: Alvaro Morata, Dani Olmo, Joselu, Lamine Yamal, Mikel Oyarzabal, Ayoze Perez, Ferran Torres, Nico Williams Spain will kick off their Euro 2024 campaign against Croatia on June 15, 2024. They are placed in Group B, considered the ‘Group of Death’ since it also contains Italy and Albania, making it the toughest group in the tournament.

        "description": "The PGA Tour were quick to dampen the celebrations of LIV Golf player Richard Bland after his surprise Senior PGA Championship success at Harbor Shores over Memorial Day weekend",
        "content": "Richard Bland will not receive the customary one-year Champions exemption for winning the Senior PGA Championship. That is because the Briton is a player, joining the inaugural invitational series in 2022 following a breakout season on the DP World Tour. Bland, 51, was granted a special invite by the PGA of America to compete in the over-50s tournament before emerging victorious, three strokes ahead of his nearest rival, marking his first senior win. His last triumph was at the 2021 British Masters on the European Tour. Following a stellar performance on the Race to Dubai and then at the , Bland joined LIV. The move resulted in Bland resigning his membership of the European Tour following fines and a suspension from the tour. The repercussions of his decision are still being felt, including in senior golf. \"In spite of the win, because of competing in an unauthorized event by the PGA TOUR, he will be ineligible for TOUR-affiliated events,\" the tour confirmed in a statement shared shortly after his Senior PGA Championship victory. The tour recognized that \"The PGA of America, USGA and R&A each operate based on criteria of their own,\" which means Bland still qualifies for the upcoming USGA-run US Senior Open on June 27. Bland will also return next year to defend his Senior PGA Championship crown at Congressional. He expressed his anticipation during a post-victory press conference, exclaiming he, \"can't wait to get there.\" But not before adding, \"I'm going to enjoy this first. I'm going to enjoy the heck out of this.\" Earlier this week, Bland restated his commitment to the -funded breakaway league. \"I want to play LIV as long as I can,\" he said during an interview after the second round. \"I don't really know what I want to do when that ends, whether I do want to come and try and play out here (on the PGA Tour Champions).\" Bland explained: \"It's not something on my radar right now to be playing (Champions).\" However, he nonetheless spoke highly about the tour. \"This is the hardest tour in the world to try to get on to,\" Bland remarked. \"I would have to go to the qualifying school, as it stands right now. But I will see. I will cross that bridge when I come to it, whether I decide to hang them up or carry on playing. My wife seems to think I'll never retire, but, yeah, we'll see. He also acknowledged beforehand not knowing whether the PGA Tour would allow him to play Champions. Winning at Harbor Shores has cleared that up for the time being. Before being back out at the US Senior Open, there are two LIV Golf events for Bland in Houston, and Nashville, . He is part of Martin Kaymer's Cleeks GC in the league alongside Adrian Meronk and Kalle Smooja.",

        "description": "A cleaning influencer claims that they have found three remedies to spare us from spiders and other creepy crawlies this summer",
        "content": "Summer is just around the corner now - and while we'll all be looking forward to days spent in the garden with family and friends, we could do without the spiders that will start creeping into our homes. But if you're especially anxious about arachnids and an abundance of other creepy crawlies which come out to play in the warmer weather, fear not. That's because Anna Louisa - a UK cleaning influencer - has some top tips to keep spiders at bay, and her home remedies are incredibly easy to create. Taking to Instagram on her @anna_louisa_at_home account, she said: \"Anyone else had crowds of ants and spiders in their homes recently? The ants especially have been everywhere so I was a woman on a mission to get them out. \"These are three ways I have found have helped.\" Read more: Terrified cat in shelter for over 100 days finds loving Northumberland home with David Bowie-loving owners Keep up to date with all the latest local news from Northumberland with our free newsletter The Mirror reports that Anna first claimed that filling a spray bottle with water and 20 drops of peppermint oil works like a charm. Spiders and insects are believed to hate the minty scent, so a spray around windows and doors will keep them away. A word o warning however is that the oil is toxic to cats and dogs. Secondly, Anna advised: \"Fruit flies dislike the smell of white vinegar, so put a small bowl of it near your fruit to keep them away. I add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to mask the smell of white vinegar, but this isn't necessary. [And finally,] adding 10 drops of orange oil, water and a few drops of dish washing liquid to your spray mop is another way to keep crawling insects away too.\" If using a mop bucket, Anna advises 20 drops of orange oil to a gallon of warm water - as well as a teaspoon of washing up liquid. Once again, dogs and cats should be kept away from the concoction. Anna added: \"Please always research which essential oils you can use if you have pets.\" And a number o people in the guru's comments section were quick to claim that they would be trying out the hacks themselves, with one writing: \"Oh my god!! We have so many spiders suddenly because we've cut down some hedges! I'll be saving this,\" as someone else said: \"Lavender also works with ants too and spiders!\" One pet-savvy commenter added: \"Use Indorex defence spray for cats and dogs. It works on spiders, ants and flies too. It's made to kill fleas and dust mites. It doesn't stain, so it can be used on floors, nooks and crannies where spiders normally lurk.\" ChronicleLive is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join our communities.

        "content": "Kolkata: The Union government on Monday accepted the West Bengal government's plea for the extension of service of Chief Secretary B.P. Gopalika for another three months. A communique from the Department of Personnel & Training, under the Union Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, reached state Secretariat Nabanna on Monday afternoon, apprising the state about the approval for the extension. Gopalika was supposed to retire on May 31 and the state government sought an extension of service on the ground that his scheduled date of retirement would be before the seventh, and final, phase of ongoing Lok Sabha polls on June 1 and the counting day on June 4. Now after the extension, Gopalika will be retiring on August 31. A state Secretariat source said that before receipt of the central communique, the state government was not quite sure whether the plea for extension would be granted or not. \"In normal times, such extension pleas by the state government are granted. But this time, the matter was different with the model code of conduct being in force and the extension would not be possible without the concurrence of the Election Commission of India (ECI). However, after it is being granted, there is a sigh of relief in the state administration,\" the source said. The issue of Gopalika’s extension became complicated for another reason as the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Suvendu Adhikari, requested the ECI to replace Gopalika, who was supposed to retire before the election and counting process was completed.",

A statement by the state’s Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, said the government “would do everything possible to avert a future occurrence of the tragic development and strengthen security strategies.” “We mourn our departed champions. Terror is cowardice, for only a coward will attack those seeking knowledge in schools,” he said. Bandits stormed the school late on 9th May, shooting sporadically into the air before abducting some students, 21 of whom have been rescued , according to the Commissioner of Police, Kogi State Command, Bethrand Onuoha. Mr Onuoha on Sunday confirmed the killing of two of the students by their abductors, describing their killing as very unfortunate. In a statement later on Sunday, the state’s Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, said the killers of the two students will not go unpunished. He said the state government is in deep shock and is heartbroken over the development.

He added that the state government was all out to rescue all the students, unfortunately, only 21 have been rescued alive. Mr Fanwo said the state government had mobilised security operatives, including local hunters and conventional security forces, to rescue the remaining students. The kidnappers contacted the families, and while the dialogue for their release was ongoing, the students were killed. “This is an attack on us as a state, and the killers of our students will not go unpunished. They killed the students at their hideout in Kwara State. We are currently working with security agencies to see how their remaining captives will be released,” he said in a statement. He added that the Kogi State Governor, Usman Ododo, has also opened dialogue with governors of the neighbouring states on how to make the hideouts of the criminals uncomfortable for them. He appreciated the governors of Kwara and Ekiti States for their cooperation “and readiness to rid the evil forest of criminals.” The statement reads in part: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims. The state government will support them in every way possible in this dark hour of grief.

        "content": "The Chennai of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal ( ITAT ) quashed the assessment under Section 153A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as no incriminating material was found during the course of the search proceedings. The assessee trust was running a school namely Sri Vidya Mandir Matriculation Higher Secondary School which was started in 1987. During the relevant period i.e., from assessment year 2011-12 relevant to financial year 2010-11, the students strength was around 2900 with 120 teaching staff and 150 non-teaching staff. During the elections of Tamil Nadu State Assembly, information was received from the District Collector of Krishnagiri that the trust was having unaccounted cash to the tune of Rs.2.75 crores and gold coins of 245 grams. Accordingly, the investigation wing of the Income-tax Department issued a warrant of authorization under by Director of Income Tax (Inv.), Tamilnadu & Pondicherry and accordingly, income-tax search was conducted on 25.04.2016.

Further, notices under Section 153A of the Income Tax Act dated 28.03.2018 were issued for assessment years 2011-12 to 2013-14. The assessee in response to the notices issued under Section of the Income Tax Act 153A of the Act filed its returns of income on 06.08.2008 under Section 153A of the Income Tax Act. Accordingly, assessee’s returns for these three assessment years i.e., 2011-12 to 2013-14 were scrutinized by issuing notice under Section 143(2) of the Income Tax Act asking the assessee to produce books of accounts, documents in connection with assessment proceedings. The bench noted that the assessee trust was created vide trust deed dated 23.03.1987 and is running a school. During the course of Tamil Nadu State Assembly Elections, election officials conducted a search on the assessee from where they found cash of Rs.2.75 crores and gold coins of 245 grams. Further information was passed on to the Income-tax Department and accordingly, a search warrant authorizing the Officer of the Department u/s.132 of the Act was issued by the Director of Income Tax (Inv.), Tamilnadu & Puducherry. Accordingly, income-tax search was also conducted on 25.04.2016. During the course of search apart from cash and gold coins, rough daybooks for 3 months for assessment year 2014-15, for 5 months for assessment year 2015-16, for 9 months for assessment year 2016-17 and for 23 days for assessment year 2017-18 were found and seized.

        "content": "I’m a longtime user who has been using generative AI products for quite a while now, with . But my genAI experience is limited to talking to some sort of chatbot. Whether it’s ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, or Perplexity, I’m essentially chatting with AI. Apple has to play catch-up to all those services, and most rumors agree that Apple won’t have a ChatGPT equivalent of its own ready in time for the arrival of . That’s why Apple might have to integrate ChatGPT or Gemini into iOS to ensure that base is covered. Alongside that third-party chatbot, Apple might deliver a different approach of its own to AI. It might be one that could help it beat rivals like Google and Microsoft, even though is playing catchup. I told you how I use genAI products because I’m not a normal iPhone user. Yes, I’d be interested in ChatGPT and similar products, even if such interests weren’t part of my job. I genuinely believe genAI can transform computing in ways we can’t even imagine yet. But I do follow generative AI news more closely than most regular iPhone users, and I try every new service that pops up. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the What I’m getting at is that plenty of regular iPhone users might not be exposed to ChatGPT and Gemini. They might not use genAI products even if they’re aware of their existence. Then again, thanks to , plenty of iPhone users have unwillingly experienced genAI in the past few weeks. People who aren’t currently reliant on ChatGPT and other chatbots might find Apple’s implementation of AI more useful. They might not even realize that genAI or machine learning is blowing up in popularity. That’s what a report from says. Apple will be “focusing on tools that ordinary consumers can use in their daily lives,” Mark Gurman writes. “The idea is to appeal to a user’s practical side — and leave some of the more whiz-bang features to other companies.” The reporter listed several AI features Apple is reportedly building into iOS 18 that could become useful tools people start taking for granted. Project Greymatter Gurman says Apple will spend plenty of time at WWDC 2024 next month talking about the fruits of Project Greymatter, the internal name for Apple’s suite of AI tools coming to iPhone apps. Here’s what genAI will do for you in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15, according to the report: Finally, developer tools like Xcode will also get AI Integration. These features will sound “boring” to anyone using genAI features already. For example, Samsung’s Galaxy S24 and other flagships support the Galaxy AI suite of generative AI features. Google added Gemini to plenty of apps, and there’s deeper integration on its Pixel phones. , and I’m not talking about chatbot functionality. But Apple will have at least two key advantages. First, Apple can make these genAI features available to hundreds of millions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac users at once. As soon as iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 roll out, the built-in genAI features will be available to them. Gurman says Apple could become one of the main players in AI tech because of its large user base. I agree with that point of view. Apple’s approach to genAI on the iPhone and other devices might have a better chance than rivals. That’s assuming the iOS 18 AI features above are accurate and work as described. Secondly, Apple can make a bigger play about privacy than its rivals. Apparently, Apple wants all of its genAI features to run on the device. For those cases where cloud processing is needed, Apple will pass on data to its own servers. But Gurman says that Apple will probably “tout the security features of the M-series chips that it’s using to conduct the cloud processing” and reassure users it’s not building profiles of customers with the information. What about ChatGPT functionality? The report also notes that Apple won’t be able to deliver its own ChatGPT chatbot and that some execs oppose the need for one. But customers will want one, and that’s something I agree with. I already use ChatGPT via the standalone app, but I’d love it if the chatbot got deeper integration. The report doubles down on something Gurman has said recently. Apple has apparently chosen , even though Gemini seemed to be the favorite a few months ago. The Apple-OpenAI partnership will become official at WWDC, the report notes. Interestingly, the report says Apple is also working with Google for potential Gemini integration just so it has an alternative to ChatGPT. Such a deal is meant to ensure Apple isn’t stuck with ChatGPT, as OpenAI comes with risks. The , even though I still prefer it over Google.",

        "content": "CAIRO – A member of Egypt’s security forces was killed in a shooting incident near the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, and an investigation is under way, said Egypt’s military spokesman in a statement on May 27. Israel’s military earlier said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers. “A few hours ago (on May 27), a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,” the Israeli military said in a statement. Israel seized control of the Rafah border crossing from the Gaza side of the border earlier in May as it stepped up its military offensive in the area, drawing criticism from Egypt. Egypt is worried that Palestinians could be displaced from southern Gaza by the offensive, and has also repeatedly accused Israel of holding up deliveries of humanitarian aid to the territory, something Israel denies. Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and have cooperated closely on security issues around the borders between Israel, Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. They jointly upheld a blockade of Gaza after Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. Security incidents between the two countries have been rare. In October 2023, two weeks after the start of the war in Gaza, Israel said one of its tanks accidentally hit an Egyptian position near the border with Gaza, and Egypt said several Egyptian border guards had minor injuries. In June 2023, three Israeli soldiers and an Egyptian security officer were killed in a clash at the border. REUTERS",

Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter We have more newsletters The wife of a former Scots MP, who alleges she was the target of the real-life Martha from Baby Reindeer , is considering legal action against Fiona Harvey following her interview with Piers Morgan . Laura Wray, 62, is mulling over her next legal steps following Harvey's allegations on the show, claiming she was harassed by her. It comes in the wake of Wray's claim that she was stalked by Harvey for four years, resulting in a court order from Glasgow Sheriff Court in 2002. Wray, widow of the late Labour MP Jimmy Wray, has claimed that Harvey made defamatory comments during her appearance on Piers Morgan's programme, as reported by the Scottish Daily Express . On the show, Harvey denied being fired by Mrs Wray after a two-week trial at her solicitor's office in 1997 and argued that she was the one who secured a court order against Mrs Wray. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Mrs Wray said: \"I felt I was defamed by Ms Harvey on Piers Morgan's show. \"Many of the things she said were completely and utterly wrong and I would really like to set the record straight. Now I'm giving consideration to the possibility of raising an action for defamation against Miss Harvey.\" Additionally, Mrs Wray shared her shock at seeing the character Martha in the hit Netflix series Baby Reindeer, who she believes is based on her alleged stalker.

The series, which has captivated over 22 million viewers across 30 countries, draws from the true story of Scottish comedian Richard Gadd, who portrays Donny Dunn. The series subtly suggests Martha's past history of stalking. Gadd's character looks up her name online and discovers a newspaper article - created for the show - with the headline: 'Sick stalker targets barrister's deaf child'. This barrister is Mrs Wray, an advocate in Scotland whose family - including her disabled son Frankie - was targeted during the stalking campaign. In 2002, the situation escalated when she and her husband were accused by Harvey of assaulting three year old Frankie, who was born with a rare chromosomal disorder. Mrs Wray then obtained an interim interdict in court which stopped Harvey from further harassing her. Harvey spoke to the Daily Record soon after being identified online to refute a number of claims made about Martha in the Netflix show. They included sending thousands of emails to Gadd and that she was put in prison. In the series, “Martha” was jailed prior to meeting Gadd’s character Donny and is jailed again for stalking him. That has prompted Harvey to threaten legal action against Netflix and Gadd. She told the Record after demanding more than the £250 fee she was given: “If I can’t get that show to shut down easily, if they don’t give me the money – and I’m talking £1million – ­politicians will shut the show down. \"If the behaviour of Netflix has been discussed in Parliament as it has been discussed all over the country then the show will be shut down – as simple as that. I want at least £1million and they know it.” Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

A beadványt külön a Szövetség képviselői frakciójának is címezték, mert szerintük a frakció tagjai egyrészt alapjogokat sértettek, másrészt pedig a várost anyagilag is megkárosították. A múlt heti, zártkörű megbeszélésen viszont a beadványt lényegében elutasították, az óvoda pedig költözik. Összesen negyvenkét szülő és lakos írta alá azt a beadványt, melyben az Ady utcai szlovák tannyelvű óvoda megszüntetése és átköltözése miatt emeltek panaszt, és amelyben a képviselő-testület Szövetség-frakciójának tagjait név szerint is bírálták. A dokumentumot április végén nyújtották be a városházára. Az aláírók nehezményezik, hogy a párkányi óvodák összevonása, működésének ésszerűsítése kapcsán egyedül és kizárólag az Ady utcai, tisztán szlovák tannyelvű óvoda jár pórul, csak ez az intézmény esik áldozatául a takarékossági intézkedéseknek. Úgy vélik, a képviselő-testület február végi döntése a szlovák óvoda megszüntetéséről és áthelyezéséről alapvetően rossz és erről főképp a Szövetség – frakciója tehet. Melynek tagjai szerintük visszaéltek a testületi számbeli fölényükkel, nem képviselik minden párkányi polgár életét, diszkriminálják a tisztán szlovák óvodát választó szülők és gyerekek alkotmányos és egyéb alapjogait. A beadvány aláírói szerint még a gazdasági érvek sem állják meg a helyüket, ugyanis, például, amíg a nagy vehemenciával megvédett Hársfa utcai óvoda város által fedezett havi működési költsége 10 ezer euró, addig a tisztán szlovák nyelvű Ady utcaié 2 ezer euró, ergo, ha valóban csak a takarékosságról lenne szó, akkor nem az Ady utcait kéne áthelyezni, megszüntetni. Főképp, hogy az Ady utcai óvodában már régóta felvételi létszámstopot hirdetett a fenntartó. Az aláírók azt is bírálták, hogy ha Párkánynak van évente 68 ezer eurója a magyar tannyelvű egyházi óvoda támogatására, akkor legyen pénze az Ady utcai egyetlen szlovák ovira is. A panasz benyújtói szerint azzal, hogy az Ady utcáról elköltöztetik a szlovák óvodát a Szövetkezeti soriba, illetve szeptembertől oda tagozódik be, az csupán porhintés. Ugyanis, a képviselő-testület februári határozata értelmében az intézményt augusztus végén kiveszik az országos iskolai hálózatból, tehát de jure ás de facto megszűnik, akárhogy is címkézik ezt. Az aláírók szerint a Szövetkezeti soron sincs garantálva a működésük, mert úgy tudják, hogy változatlan formában csak 1 évig működnek majd tovább. A döntést pedig azért is tartják súlyosan jogsértőnek, mert szerintük a környéken nincs több tisztán szlovák nyelvű óvoda. Egyetlen felvetésre sem kaptak választ... A panaszról május 22-én zárt körben tárgyaltak a városházán az érintettekkel és alaptalannak minősítették a beadványt. A közel másfél órás megbeszélésen lapunk nem lehetett jelen, de utána minden érintett rendelkezésünkre állt. Süll Viviána és Markéta Gálová a szülők képviseletében az Új Szónak úgy nyilatkoztak, hogy a tárgyaláson tulajdonképpen egyetlen felvetésükre sem kaptak érdemi választ, főképp arra nem, hogy gazdaságilag miért épp az ő óvodájukat sújtják ezzel a döntéssel. „Nem kaptunk válaszokat, mert nem tudtuk a számokat és nem is kaptuk meg a számokat. A képviselők azt mondták, hogy ez a racionalizáció első lépése. Hogy aztán lehet, még bezárnak még egy másik óvodát, lehet, hogy nem, de, hogy ez a racionalizáció első lépése” – közölte Süll Viviána, aki úgy véli, sajnos, már nincs lehetőségük a további lépésekre, mert már úgy tűnik, késő. Markéta Gálová is úgy nyilatkozott, hogy főképp az óvoda megszüntetéséről volt szó, de arra nem kaptak igazán választ, hogy a képviselők miért szavaztak így. Szerinte sincs arra esély, hogy a testület megváltoztassa a döntését. Az óvodák összevonásáról pedig kimondva senki nem beszélt a mostani megbeszélésen. A szülők továbbra is azt mondják, hogy értik a spórolást és a csökkenő gyermeklétszámot, de azt továbbra sem, hogy miért épp az ő ovijukkal kezdik először, miért épp ők az első áldozatai a racionalizációnak? Andrea Csányiová, az óvoda igazgatónője szerint nálunk lett volna elég jelentkező gyermek, ha ez az ügy nem húzódik már két éve, és az óvodában nem lett volna létszámstop elrendelve már tavaly októberben. „Mindenképp több gyerekünk lett volna, ha a fenntartó ismét megengedte volna a beíratkozást. „Ez nem a gyereklétszámról szól. Mi ugyanis a szülőkkel együtt értjük a racionalizációt és mi egyáltalán nem akarjuk, és nem szeretnénk nemzetiségi síkra terelni az ügyet. De csak, ha az ésszerűsítés valóban ésszerűsítést jelent, nem pedig valamiféle politikai szándékokat takar. Ezt tényleg nem szeretném kommentálni. Lehet, hogy a szülők nem voltak kellőképp tájékoztatva, de ha a képviselő-testület elé 5-6 anyag kerül az ügyben és nem tudnak dönteni, nem akarnak dönteni, akkor milyen anyagot kellett volna kapnunk, ha 5-6 változat is volt erre?” – kérdezte az igazgatónő és hozzátette, hogy az óvodák működésének ügye már 2 éve húzódik, ez tarthatatlan, így nem lehet dolgozni. „Ennek véget kell vetni, ahogy az iskolatanács elnöke is mondta. Már ha valóban racionalizációról van szó és ez a folyamat kezdő lépése. De most a szülők nevében mondom, roppant kíváncsi vagyok, mi történik majd a következő iskolaévben. A beíratások ugyanis már végbementek, és a Bartók utcai oviban már most érzékelhető a létszámhiány, jövőre pedig még inkább érezhető lesz. Ez az én feltételezésem. De ha azt látom, hogy januártól májusig összesen 6 gyermek született, akkor ez talán mégsem az én kitalációm” – közölte lapunkkal az óvoda igazgatónője. Nem politikai alapon döntöttek Mivel a beadványban az aláírók főképp a képviselő-testület Szövetség-frakciójának szavazását bírálták, ezért szerkesztőségünk írásban fordult Fekete László frakcióvezetőhöz. Fekete az Új Szónak úgy válaszolt, hogy a tárgyalást eredményesnek tartja, mivel több pontatlanságot és valótlan állítást, melyeket a beadványban megfogalmaztak, tisztázni tudtak. Egyúttal megállapította, hogy több fontos adat és információ is hiányzik a beadványból. Mivel a beadvány nem tartalmazza a törvény által előírt adatokat, a beadvány nem minősíthető panasznak. „A szavazásnál tíz képviselőből nyolcan igennel szavaztak (ebből heten a Magyar Szövetség listáján bejutott képviselő és egy független képviselő), valamint két független képviselő volt ellene a városi hivatal által beterjesztett anyagnak, melyet a hivatal szakosztálya dolgozott ki és a városi óvodák igazgatónői is támogatták. A tiszta szlovák környezet az áthelyezés után is megtartható (külön pavilon) – ez szervezési kérdés” – reagált Fekete László a jogsérelmet firtató kérdésünkre. A frakcióvezető szerint nem igaz, hogy a szülők egyetlen, a panaszban megfogalmazott érvükre sem kaptak választ, valamint a Hársfa utcai óvoda és az Ady utcai óvoda működési költségeinek összehasonlítása sem jó, mert ezek az összegek nem helyénvalóak és ezt a hivatal is megerősítette. Fekete László az egyházi óvoda támogatása kapcsán közölte, hogy a Szent Imre Egyházi Óvoda a 2023-as évre a városi költségvetésből 68 457 eurót kapott, ebből 55 781 eurót kapott az állami költségvetésből, a dotáció a város részéről pedig 12 667 euró volt. A 2024-es évre a tervezett költség az állami költségvetésből 55 719 euró, a város részéről a támogatás pedig 0 euró! Az Ady utcai óvoda működését a város a 2023-as évben a megkapott állami támogatás mellett a saját költségvetéséből még 74 985 euróval támogatta. Arra a felvetésre, hogy jogsértő volt az Ady utcai óvoda kivétele az iskolarendszerből és az áthelyezése is, mert semmi garancia nincs a másik helyen történő további, változatlan működésükre, a frakcióvezető úgy válaszolt, hogy az előzetes egyeztetések folyamán – több, mint egy év – valamint a szakbizottsági ülésen is a két igazgató asszony (Szövetkezeti sor és az Ady utca) nem látott gondot a további, változatlan működésre. Az pedig Fekete László szerint nem igaz, hogy ők politikai alapon döntöttek, bárkinek is a rovására. Az óvodák működésének racionalizációja kapcsán pedig hangsúlyozza, hogy ez semmiképp sem befejezett folyamat, sok összetevője van, a legfontosabb feltétel a gazdaságos működéshez szükséges gyereklétszám. Nem történt jogsértésEugen Szabó, Párkány polgármestere lapunknak elmondta, hogy a februári testületi döntést érintő, írásban benyújtott panaszt a törvény szerint ők nem vizsgálhatják ki, mert az ügyben a testület és a hivatal is érintett. De a tény az, hogy magában a panaszban sok hiba van, ezért érdemben nem foglalkoznak vele. A testület határozatait igazából az ügyészség vizsgálhatja ki- fűzte hozzá a polgármester. „Mi a mostani tárgyaláson megmagyaráztuk, hogy miért hozott a testület ilyen döntést. Viszont az ő felvetéseik nem relevánsak, mert ezt így objektíve nem lehet megítélni. Egyik dolog ugyanis a költségek szintje, a másik a gyermeklétszám. Az egyik évben itt mutatkozik jobb telítettség, a másik évben a másik oviban. De még ettől sem lesz egyik vagy másik óvoda előnyösebb vagy hátrányosabb helyzetben. Igen, a számok mutatnak valamit, de ez a gyermeklétszámtól függően változik. A gyereklétszám is változik. A létszámstopra vonatkozó felvetést is értem, de szerintem, felelőtlenség megvárni azt, hogy olyan gazdasági helyzetbe kerüljön a város, hogy az összes óvodát meg kelljen nyirbálnia. A városnak el kell kezdeni a racionalizációs lépéseket, ezt meg kellett tenni. Most a tavalyi évi eredmények állnak rendelkezésünkre, azok alapján pedig egyre nyílik az olló aközött, amennyi pénzt ad az állam az óvodák működtetésére és aközött, amennyivel mi, a város valóban fedezi az ovik működését. A különbség tavaly kb. 300 ezer euróra rúgott, ez most már 700 ezer euró körül van. Jövőre már látni fogjuk a megtakarítási intézkedések első számait” – fejtette ki Eugen Szabó. A polgármester szerint alaptalan, hogy jogsértés történt és megszűnne a tisztán szlovák nyelvű óvodai oktatás. „A tisztán szlovák nyelvű oktatás továbbra is biztosított, hiszen az Ady utcaiak átköltöznek a Szövetkezeti sori külön pavilonjába és ott változatlan formában és változatlan összetétellel működnek majd tovább, tehát nem kevert osztályokban, ugyanazzal a személyzettel. Való igaz, hogy az elmúlt években az egyházi óvodának többet adtunk, mint amire a törvény alapján jogosultak lennének, de ez az idei évre már nem érvényes” – jelentette ki Eugen Szabó. Idén 55 ezer euróval számolnak állami támogatásként az egyházi óvodára, azt oda is adják, de ezen felül nem kap több pénzt a Szent Imre Óvoda. „Nem fogadom el, hogy most az aláírók nem kaptak érdemi válaszokat. Ugyanis felajánlottuk, hogy nem kevert osztályokban lesznek, sőt, külön pavilonban, ugyanazokkal a tanárnőkkel, a csoport egyben marad, csak épp egy másik épületben folytatják tovább. Az Ady utcai címen valóban megszűnik az óvoda, de a gyermekcsoport egysége nem lett megbontva, szétrakva és szétrombolva. Abban a pavilonban egyben marad ez az osztály, vagyis az Ady utcai csoport, és mellettük lesz egy másik, új, szlovák osztály”. További felvetésünkre, hogy a panasz benyújtói nem látnak garanciát arra, hogy hosszabb távon is változatlanul működhetnek majd, Eugen Szabó visszakérdezett: melyikünknek van biztonsága, hogy két év múlva is ugyanilyen formában leszünk? Kérdésünkre, miszerint nem lett volna jobb, ha a továbbiakban egy tisztán magyar és egy tisztán szlovák óvoda működött volna Párkányban – jobb helykihasználással, a polgármester úgy válaszolt, ez is egy megoldás lett volna, csak ezt javaslatként senki sem terjesztette elő az önkormányzati ülésen. „Ismétlem, az oktatás be van biztosítva továbbra is, sőt kb. 15 kétéves gyermeknek is biztosítunk majd kis létszámú osztályokat is, például a Bartók utcán. A racionalizációs lépéseket meg kell tenni. Mivel az Ady utcán volt a legkevesebb gyermek, ezért úgy láttuk, hogy náluk lesz a legkisebb negatív hatása, ha áthelyezzük őket máshová. Úgy, hogy nem szakítjuk szét a csoportot. Ezt tartottuk emberi szempontból is a legkevésbé károsnak” – állapította meg a polgármester. Az Ady utcai szlovák tannyelvű óvoda tehát elköltözik, nem várható, hogy a képviselő-testület másképp döntsön az ügyben.",

        "content": "The Presidency has said organized labour’s demand for ₦497,000 as minimum wage is unrealistic and unserious. Recall that organized labour had demanded a minimum wage of N615,000 but later reduced it to N500,000 and then N497,000, while the government and the private sector increased their offer to N57,000 in the last Tripartite meeting. In an interview with Vanguard, the Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga , said that the federal and state governments have bloated workforces, and the demand by organised labour is outrageous. Onanuga stated that what should be paramount to arriving at the new minimum wage by the Tripartite Committee on the new minimum wage should be the availability of resources to pay whatever is agreed upon. According to him, the government is spending on recurrent expenditures, and it will be difficult for either the federal, state, or local governments to spend all their money on paying workers. He said, “Well, it’s very simple. I think the demand is outrageous. If you ask Mr. Ajaero or our brother who is the President of the TUC, Osifo how much do they pay their drivers or their lowest paid workers, how much do they pay their cleaners, can they pay them N500,000, can they pay them N615,000. It’s unrealistic. “We have bloated civil service at all levels. Government is keeping them as a social service, because it doesn’t have other jobs for them. “The last time someone gave the census of the federal civil servants, they are said to be about 50,000. I am not talking about the police, army or those employed by some agencies. I am talking about the hardcore civil servants. “If you visit the Federal Secretariat, you will see them milling round. You do not expect much productivity from them. Yet these are people Ajaero wants the Federal Government to pay N615,000. “At the moment, what government is spending on recurrent expenditure, is too high . I don’t foresee any government either the federal, state or local government council spending spending all its money just to pay workers. “There are still people who are self employed, people who are doing their own businesses to whom government has responsibility to do roads, provide healthcare, provide education and others. So, Labour should be realistic. “From what I have seen so far, they are unserious, unrealistic with their outlandish demand. I know that what the President has been promising is not just a minimum wage but a living wage. “It’s too early now to say this is what government will agree to. But I think they are still negotiating. In the coming weeks, they will agree on a figure and then announce it to the Nigerian people. “Then we have to be worried whether the states have the earning power to pay whatever the minimum wage agreed on because some states found it difficult to pay the old minimum wage of N30,000. “I read a few days ago that Zamfara state government which failed to pay the N30,000 current minimum wage announced that they will pay.. If some states have not paid minimum wage announced by President Muhammadu Buhari five years ago, it is an indication that the states will also fail the new minimum wage. So labour needs to be realistic. “In my own view, I think what labour should be talking about is how to make affordable housing available, how to reduce transport cost, how to make food cheap and affordable to our people because by the time you spend less money on food, less money on transport, education and other things, the earning power will improve. I don’t believe in quantum of money, it will not solve the problem. “We have seen all the wage increases in the past. They ended up creating more frustration to the workers.”",

        "description": "Apple's iPhone update shows Samsung is way behind...",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Has your Samsung Galaxy device finally received the latest critical security update, or are you still waiting—and why are some devices not getting updated at all? Does this leave your phone at risk? Meanwhile, Apple has just sent an enticing message to millions of Samsung users... Has Samsung just given Galaxy users a reason to switch to iPhones? Updated 5/27, as more Samsung devices receive delayed security update. This has not been a good month for Samsung Galaxy users on the security front. After a good start, when the company beat even Google to the punch in detailing the month’s wider Android and Samsung-only fixes, the rollout has been a mess—it’s late May, and millions of users have been kept waiting. According to the latest reports , “Samsung's May 2024 update is rolling out widely,” finally; and while “things are a bit more exciting this month, as this update will bring One UI 6.1 to a host of older phones and tablets,” the stark reality is that security updates should be issued quickly and efficiently. The One UI 6.1 in itself is not a blanket reason for the delays—let’s remember, that the monthly schedule might usually be less messy than this, but it’s still confusing. Users await the right install for their country, device, network and whether or not their phone is unlocked. “The updates started as early as May 10th for select models, and by the end of the month, many devices across different series and carriers will have received the update.” Not a good look at all—not in 2024. Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time At Lower Price Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50% Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone And it gets worse. For users of one two-year-old midrange device, the surprising news is that the just released UI 6.1 update “doesn’t come with the latest May security update. Instead, it brings the April security patch, and it’s not clear whether Samsung will roll out a separate update for it.” I’m sorry— but what? This is also made worse because May’s update includes a critical Android fix that was issued by Google in April, delayed by Samsung until May, and is now delayed further. When I first reported on this nearly three weeks ago, I said that it should be installed urgently.” I haven't changed my view, but a good amount of time has passed since Google made the fix available. From a user perspective, how should they interpret this kind of advice : “a few days ago, Samsung rolled out the May SMR (Security Maintenance Release) to the Galaxy S23 FE, Galaxy Z Flip 4, and a few other devices in the US. The Galaxy Z Fold 4 also started picking up the update around the same time but only in select international markets. Thankfully, the company didn’t take long to bring it to the US.” Other models now receiving the delayed May update include the factory-unlocked Galaxy S22 in the US. This is another two-year old model, but this one is a flagship. The Galaxy 22 update “is currently available in the US, but only for factory-unlocked models... It includes the May 2024 security patch that fixes 45 security vulnerabilities and nothing else.” So, to be clear, this update was available to other flagships in other locations weeks earlier. Also in the US, both the carrier-locked and unlocked S21 FE devices can also now be updated with those security fixes. SamMobile also reports that “Samsung has started rolling out the May 2024 security update to the Galaxy A53 and Galaxy A54. The update is rolling out to the Galaxy A53 in Europe and several Asian countries. In other regions, the new security update could be released to these phones soon.” Again, “the new security update could be released to these phones soon” is not a good look. Let’s contrast all this with Apple for a moment, Samsung’s major rival in the premium handset market. Within days of its release of iOS 17.5 to all its users, everywhere, all at the same time, it became clear that there was a worrying issue where users reported long-deleted photos reappearing unexpectedly. Apple issued a fix right away, to everyone, meaning that it managed to provide two global updates to all its iPhones—regardless of country, carrier, network or lock status—inside a week. Google is tidying up Android on the security front—that was clear anyway, and has been made even more so with the Android 15 innovations that push even Apple hard in certain areas. But where the security update process and schedule is this complex and confusing, it undermines both the safety nets and also the latest battle in just how many years of updates each device might receive. Samsung’s response to users complaining about the lack of security clarity is to confirm the seemingly random process in play—in many cases the confusion is worse than the delay. “Regular OS upgrades may cause delays to planned security updates. However, you can rest assured the OS upgrades will include up-to-date security patches when delivered. We are doing our best to deliver the security patches, the delivery time of security patches may vary depending on the regions and models.” As a reminder, not all Samsung devices receive monthly updates, but will sit on one of their monthly, quarterly and biannual firmware security update schedule. This means extended periods of risk where a serious issue has been patched. Again, it is clearly a situation that should be tidied up given the current mobile landscape and risks profile from the ever more advanced threats landscape. While security update considerations will be critical for many users, there are clearly other areas which will also factor into the Samsung versus Apple question—the forthcoming hybrid-AI from Samsung set against whatever Apple elects to deploy will be the most evident this year, but we have also seen other reports on Samsung’s hardware gap to iPhone and even claims it ages new, midlevel devices to push users towards newer flagships instead. On the AI front, Samsung’s reliance on Android—which means Google, will always compromise the purity of its AI privacy approach, however laudable the intent. In a month where we have seen Google update Chrome multiple times and Apple update iPhone multiple times, Samsung’s process needs to be simplified. Yes, it might take a few days to reach its install base, but users shouldn't be inundated with news update reports on which model, which country, which network for week after week, especially when security has become such a front and center issue.

        "content": "RAFAH, Gaza - The al-Attar family was praying and getting children ready for bed in southern Gaza when they heard a loud noise. Immediately fire erupted around their informal shack home, and the children started screaming. Israel was pulverising Gaza again, and the airstrike left a fire raging on Sunday evening in a camp area designated for displaced people in Rafah city's Tel Al-Sultan district. Terrified camp residents ran to try to escape the flames, survivors said. \"Our room was filled with shrapnel... Missiles or bombs weighing tons are falling on zinc,\" said Umm Mohamed al-Attar, surveying the wrecked camp of tents and corrugated metal shacks. \"There was a woman with disabled children who was martyred at the door of her room. What was her crime? ... Our neighbour, may God have mercy on him, was praying and was martyred; his brain ended up on the wall.\" Gaza health authorities said 45 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, were killed. The toll prompted an outcry from global leaders, and Israel's top military prosecutor called the air strike \"very grave\" and said an investigation was under way. Thousands of Palestinians had been sheltering in Tel Al-Sultan after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. After daybreak, people searched the debris for belongings. \"Gaza burns every day, every day and every hour. They (Israelis) were burned once, but we burn every day. Our children, our elders, our women, and our homes burn every day in Palestine,\" said Jamal al-Attar, a camp resident and Umm Mohammed's uncle. Housewife Manal Salman surveyed the charred wrekcage. \"We were here in this very spot displaced, we were here in tents and suddenly we found rockets falling on us in the same place,\" she said. \"We didn't know where to go, it was dark and there were no ambulances, they didn't come straight away. We looked around - martyrs here and martyrs there - and now we're being displaced.\" Retrieving items from the ruins of his temporary home, Talal Saeed Salman said his family would now have to move for the eighth time in the war. \"Where are we to go - help me understand, where are we to go?\" he said, carrying a plastic tub. \"How long will we be disgraced like this?\" Commenting on the incident in Tel Al-Sultan, an Israeli government spokesperson said on Monday that initial reports coming from an overnight air strike against Hamas commanders in the Gazan city of Rafah was that a fire broke out after the strike, killing civilians. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

        "content": "Kyle Larson called Sunday “one of the most disappointing” days he’s ever experienced after not being able to complete the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 double. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson posted Monday morning on X. “I hate it for Rick Hendrick, Jeff Gordon, HAG, Hendrick Motorsports, everyone part of the 5 team, everyone on the 17 IndyCar for speeding, my family, my friends, my fans, and the documentary crew that has followed along the journey the past eight months. “So much time, money, and effort went into this experience, and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did. I feel like I let so many people down.” Larson qualified fifth at Indianapolis Motor Speedway with Arrow McLaren and finished 18th after a speeding penalty. Because the start of the race was delayed by four hours because of rain, the decision was made for Larson to compete at Indianapolis and then take over his NASCAR Cup Series car on arrival at Charlotte Motor Speedway. At approximately 9:30pm ET, Larson arrived in his NASCAR pit stall and began preparing to get into his Chevrolet. Simultaneously, the race — which had already reached the point where it could be declared official — went into a weather delay and never restarted. Justin Allgaier ran the 249 laps that were completed of the Coca-Cola 600 in Larson’s No. 5. “We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things, but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling,” Larson’s post continued. “Up until Sunday, it was truly one of the greatest experiences of my life. I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream. I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try the Double, but if it is, I guess it was memorable. “Thank you to everyone at Arrow McLaren, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and all the competitors there for making me feel welcome. (I’m) ready to get back on track now and get refocused on winning a second championship for our team.” Because he did not start the Coca-Cola 600, Larson will need a waiver from NASCAR to remain eligible for the postseason. NASCAR and Hendrick Motorsports have yet to announce if the request has been made or granted.",

Together they have two daughters: Rowan Francis Henchy and Grier Hammond Henchy Brooke was wishing Chris a happy 23 year wedding anniversary. 'Today marks 23 years married to the love of my life, still giddy to be stuck with you, Henchy!' wrote the former Vogue model in her Instagram caption. This comes after she said she has created a collection of products called Commence. They have been specially formulated for women aged 40-plus and came about from conversations she had on her Beginning Is Now online community. Brooke - whose new movie Mother Of The Brides is in the top 10 on Netflix - insists she's taking a hands-on approach to the brand. She told WWD : 'We have to establish ourselves as experts. Just because I'm Brooke Shields and I have hair doesn't make me an expert. 'The efficacy of the products is what I'm painstakingly focused on. I can sell anything once, but I want the repeat business and to do that, we have to establish ourselves as experts in hair and beauty care.'

It's just business.' She also told WWD: 'When I hit this age, I had a sense of accomplishment, but also this excitement that there is more to look forward to. 'I wanted this optimism to be something that we all shared with regards to how we age.' She previously explained her plan at the SHE Media Co-Lab Whole Life Health SXSW panel in March, saying: 'It's coming this summer, but it was really about tapping into the community and finding what their needs are. 'What happens after 40?' she asked. 'Thinning hair, scalp health, loss of collagen, all these things that happen to our bodies. Shields is launching a haircare line for the over-40s. The 58-year-old actress/model has created a collection of products called Commence; seen in May 8 Her latest movie is Mother of the Bride with Benjamin Bratt 'And addressing that and then going to the experts and saying, what proprietary formulas can we find?'

        "content": "By HYUNG-JIN KIM and MARI YAMAGUCHI (Associated Press) SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea launched a rocket likely carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night, hours after its announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center in the northeast at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula’s west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket” during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",

        "description": "The minister declared that the Nigeria Air remains suspended, adding that it was anti-Nigeria.",
        "content": "The Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo has given more insight following the indefinite suspension of ‘Nigeria Air’ project. This is as he described the project as fraud. While giving details about that project, Keyamo explained that the ‘national carrier’ that was supposed to be an indigenous project and one that was supposed to stir hope for Nigerians, was flawed with a lot of secrecy and fraudulent activities. Answering questions from newsmen during the second day of the Ministerial Sectorial update, held on Monday in Abuja, the minister declared that the Nigeria Air remains suspended, adding that it was anti-Nigeria. “It was never Air Nigeria, it was Ethiopian trying to fly our flag. It was not Air Nigeria. That is the truth. It was not Nigeria. It only printed Air Nigeria. It was an Ethiopian airline trying to fly our flag. If it is so, why not allow our local people to fly our flag? Why bring a foreigner to fly our flag? “So nobody should deceive you that it is Air Nigeria. Air Nigeria must be indigenous, must be wholly Nigerian or must be for the full benefit of Nigerians, not that 60 per cent of the profit is given to another country. How does that benefit us? It remains suspended. It remains so,” he said. Speaking on some of the steps so far taken to improve economic development in the aviation sector, Keyamo highlighted the commencement of cargo flights to Saudi Arabia, noting that it would enable Nigeria to tap into the $6 trillion global cargo market. “We have agreed that we’re going to resume cargo flights between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. This has been suspended for a long time but now cargo flights are back. “Guess what? Air cargo trade accounts for 35 per cent of the world trade deficit and air cargo trade according to the International Air Transport Association, IATA, attracts about $6 trillion annually and we’re missing you know, within that sector we were missing in many routes around the world and we have achieved that,” he said.",

        "description": "Jason Kelce responds to an X user who called his wife a \"homemaker\" following a viral Harrison Butker speech.",
        "content": "Retirement hasn't slowed down former Philadelphia Eagle Jason Kelce. He's appeared on Abbott Elementary , joined ESPN as an analyst , and even made a memorable appearance on Jeopardy ! Masters , quoting Salt-N-Peppa . However, his latest spotlight moment wasn’t about football or game shows, but rather a social media response defending his wife. Following Harrison Butker’s NFL response-provoking commencement speech , a user made a critical comment, calling Jason’s wife a homemaker and accusing their home of being messy, and the former NFL star responded in the most thoughtful way. A user on X (formerly Twitter) posted a critical comment targeting Kelce and his wife, Kylie. The user took to social media, writing: Your wife is a homemaker. But you can't support Butker. And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. Sorry but it is dirty and messy on television. Seems you're a bit hypocritical. Y'all are going to be left with nothing but Swifties. You just ruined your gig. It's a shame. Not one to let such comments go unanswered, Kelce responded on his official X account with a thoughtful and heartfelt reply. He wrote: Responding to this, because I have seen a number of people say it. I don’t think of Kylie as a homemaker, I think of her as my wife. I think of her as a mother. She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily. The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first. We both raise our kids, we both work, we both keep our home. It is both our faults it is messy, but such is life with 3 young children, busy schedules, and neither of us being neat freaks. She also makes a mean sandwich. The former Super Bowl champ’s response illuminates the modern dynamics of their relationship, which defies traditional, often outdated, labels. The former NFL player emphasizes his marriage is built on mutual respect and shared responsibilities. Jason also made a point to respect those who do identify as homemakers. He continued: If being a homemaker, works for some, and that’s what they want, then hell yea, that’s awesome, more power to you. I want to be clear, I’m not downplaying that at all, but that is not our family dynamic. This thoughtful statement from the seven-time Pro Bowl selection highlights that every family operates differently, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to marriage and parenting. His comments emphasize the importance of respecting the diverse ways families organize their lives. It also reminds us of how great Jason is—who could forget the adorable viral video of him playing with his daughters ? You can catch the “ world’s favorite brothers ,” Jason and Travis, on their podcast, New Heights , available to watch on YouTube. Or If you missed the Jeopardy! Masters finale and want to see Jason Kelce’s entire appearance, the May 22 episode (and the rest of the spinoff’s second season) are available to stream with a Hulu subscription . Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News We'll update our readers if either Kelce brother announces new projects for the 2024 TV schedule .",

        "content": "Tiwa Savage surprised fans by announcing her debut Prime Video film “ Water and Garri , ” an extension of her creative vision from her 2021 EP of the same name . While the EP showcased her musical talents, the film allowed her to shine as an actress and executive producer through her company, Everything Savage. Tiwa Savage isn’t new to the acting scene. She previously played Sade , a club owner and over-protective adoptive mother of a son who’s HIV positive in the MTV series “ Shuga Naija ” (season 3) and made a cameo in Funke Akindele ‘s “ Jennifer’s Diary .” In “ Water and Garri ,” Tiwa takes centre stage as Aisha , an ambitious fashion designer returning to Nigeria after a decade in the U.S. following a family loss. Upon arrival, she grapples with the many changes she finds back home. “Performing as Aisha allowed me to be totally vulnerable and pushed me to express myself in a way that I’ve never done before,” she says about the role. She co-stars with Jemima Osunde (known for movies like “Shuga,” Lionheart ” and “ Far From Home “) who played the character of Stephany , Aisha’s cousin, who broke the news of her father’s passing. In a press interview with the cast and crew of the film, we hear from Jemima Osunde, Mike Afolarin, and Vannessa Amadi-Ogbonna, about their experiences on set, the music score, working with Tiwa, bringing the story to life and lots more. Jemimah Osunde on her experience on set: It was a very beautiful shoot. We were in a very beautiful location, so even when I wasn’t filming, walking around was a very awesome experience. But I would say that there was a particular day when we were in a keke maruwa , it was Tiwa and I and it was very funny. We had a lot of things going on, we were filming in the middle of the street, so people were going on with their daily activities and the maruwa had to move, we had to get to the director, and there was just a lot going on and it was really funny. Tiwa cutting in: She was actually teasing me because she was saying I hadn’t been in one before, but have you been in one before? Jemima : Yes! I have Tiwa : Oh! Jemima: It was your first time, not mine. Davidson on being a part of the project. When I got the call from the lovely Tiwa and Vanessa, I was like I am going to do this. It was a yes. When I read the script, I really connected with my character and everyone’s character, and I saw the vision, the idea of what this movie was about to bring to life, and I wanted to be a part of it. If I am being honest, this movie for me I haven’t seen such substance, especially coming from Nigeria and Africa. You will feel the movie when you watch it, you will feel connected even to the minutest detail. Vannessa Amadi-Ogbonna on the soundtracks to the film and working with Tiwa Savage: It’s an incredible film that you will all get to experience. There’s also a brilliant ten-track album that Tiwa put together while recording the initial EP, “Water & Garri.” There’s a project called “Water & Garri,” an EP of five songs that came out. Tiwa recorded additional songs that were supposed to be part of the film project, but as we were filming, she decided to scrap them. So naturally panic. We had no time. We were ready to wrap up filming. Tiwa, in her entrepreneurial self, said she was going to create completely new music for the project. She went out to Malibu and spent ten days on ten records. I have never experienced working with anyone who works as hard as her. Even when we were doing the New York premiere, Tiwa slipped away to record even more music because she had another project coming up. One of the other things I wanted to highlight was the strength of a woman. It’s important for me as a woman and as a mother to highlight that we are special and that the work that gets put in is not talked about enough in this industry, and that’s why I am personally really proud to have the opportunity of a lifetime to work with someone like Tiwa and show that we can do it all honestly. Mike Afolarin on the Water & Garri story and how the audience will connect to it. There are times when you feel like you have choices to make, and I feel like that’s literally the story of Water & Garri. Someone abroad has to come back to the realities of the country that she left. She knows, of course, that times have changed. She knows that she would have to navigate those troubles, for whatever reason it is that she came back. You also find touch points on family, community, and all of that. So I feel like everyone who watches this will have something to connect with. It was just an amazing journey for me with these creatives. I got to work with the creative genius that is Meji Alabi. I got to watch Tiwa work through creating music, acting, and producing. It’s just mind-blowing to watch her work and still care about the actors on set and them not hurting themselves doing stunts and all of that. We had a great time making this.",

        "description": "The number of VAR errors made by Premier League officials have been revealed, with two referees making four errors in 2023/24.",
        "content": "Another season is in the books, and there were plenty of talking points across the year. None have proven to be more controversial, though, than VAR and the league's officiating. The 2023/24 season saw numerous contentious decisions made by referees on match days - from Luis Diaz's offside against Tottenham to several other disallowed goals, fans and clubs have been left frustrated with how the video officials have operated at times. So much so that Wolves have even at the next AGM meeting in June. With so many individuals taking charge of games over the course of the season, there have been a few talking points, and also several mistakes. And ESPN's Dale Johnson, a VAR expert, has trawled through the archives of the most recent term to pick out who was on VAR duty for at least 10 games during the 23/24 season, ranking them from worst to best depending on the frequency of their errors. While some have almost perfect records, others really did have years to forget. VAR Officials Ranked Based on VAR Errors Made in 2023/24 Rank Referee Games Errors Frequency 1. Michael Salisbury 35 1 35.00 2. John Brooks 33 1 33.00 3. Michael Oliver 26 1 26.00 4. Robert Jones 21 1 21.00 5. Simon Hooper 14 1 14.00 6. Craig Pawson 10 1 10.00 7. Peter Bankes 35 2 17.50 8. David Coote 30 2 15.00 9. Chris Kavanagh 23 2 11.50 10 Andy Madley 20 2 10.00 11. Darren England 11 2 5.50 12. Tony Harrington 10 2 5.00 13. Jarred Gillet 31 3 10.33 14. Paul Tierney 31 4 7.75 15. Stuart Attwell 30 4 7.50 * Must have officiated a minimum of 10 games Six Referees Make Just One VAR Mistake While fans are often quick to criticise officials for their performances during games, what stands out here is the number of referees who made just a single mistake during the year while on VAR duty. A total of six individuals made just one error, although no ref had a spotless record out of all those who took charge of the technology for a minimum of 10 games. The best performer of the bunch, just about, was Michael Salisbury, who's only error during the 2023/24 season came during the first week of the season. He was the man in charge for Wolves' trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United, when Andre Onana cleaned out Sasa Kalajdzic, only for no penalty to be given, . Impressively, Salisbury would then take charge of an additional 34 games, making him the official to be on VAR duty the most. During that run, he made no errors at all, which make him the best performing match official based on frequency of errors. In February, ESPN estimated the accuracy of key Premier League match decisions to be 96% in 2023/24, a marked increase from the 82% recorded before VAR. Not far behind him, though, with just one error in 33 games, was John Brooks. That mistake came in March 2024 when Chelsea were awarded a penalty against Burnley after Lorenz Assignon fouled Mykhailo Mudryk inside the penalty area. The Clarets' defender was shown a second yellow card for the challenge, adding further insult to injury, with Vincent Kompany handed a two-match ban for his reaction to the incident. Michael Oliver, Robert Jones, Simon Hooper and Craig Pawson only made one error apiece too, but each of them took charge of VAR on significantly fewer occasions. Peter Bankes might have been tied with Salisbury for the best record, but his failure to award Brighton a penalty against Chelsea in May, as well as failing to intervene over a potential red card for Joao Palhinha during Fulham's draw against Brighton in October 2023. Paul Tierney and Stuart Attwell Make Most Mistakes At the other end of the table, the performances of six referees is cause for concern, as they made mistakes while on VAR duty in one of every 10 games they took charge of or less. The worst performing individual in terms of frequency, Tony Harrington, made an error every five games! Darren England was not much better than the aforementioned Harrington, as he also made two errors. The only reason he records a higher frequency is because he took charge of an additional game. However, England was the man on VAR duty during Tottenham's 2-1 win over Liverpool, when despite the Colombian international being onside - arguably the most high-profile error of the season. Neither man, though, made the most errors while on VAR duty. That title was shared by Stuart Attewell and Paul Tierney, who both made four errors during their games in charge. The former allowed three goals to wrongly stand during the course of the season, while he was also on VAR duty during Everton 2-0 Nottingham Forest when a penalty was not awarded to the visitors. Attwell will be at Euro 2024 as an official, and will be hoping less controversy circles around him at the international tournament. Tierney, meanwhile, is just above Attwell on frequency of errors purely because he took charge of an additional game. He failed to intervene over Alexis Mac Allister's red card against Bournemouth, which was subsequently overturned by the FA, while he failed to advise that a red card must be shown to Jack Robinson during Sheffield United's 2-2 draw against Chelsea. His worst day at the office, though, was during the Blades' visit to Luton Town, when Tierney wrongly advised two penalties be given during United's 3-1 win. VAR Vote Likely to Fail The table shows just how inconsistent the technology has been used by the men in charge of it during the 2023/24 season, with a total of 31 incorrect decisions made by referees. But while clubs may be frustrated by the use of the technology, it is likely to stay for the 2024/25 term despite Wolves' motion. Per Ben Jacobs, eight clubs have already made their stance clear on the matter, with . Considering that the motion requires a two-thirds majority to pass (14 out of 20 clubs), VAR will likely be used next season. However, significant changes can be expected. PGMOL chief Howard Webb has confirmed that a process is being outlined for referees to explain their choice to the crowd, should they visit the monitor and change their on-field decision. While the new policy requires approval, it will be a welcome shift for supporters in attendance. Nevertheless, further consistency will be required of fans to get on board with VAR once and for all in 2024/25. If another season of chaos is to follow, then expect the discussion over its abolition from the English top flight to resurface.",

The Magpies are looking for a keeper to provide competition for Eddie Howe's No1 Nick Pope ahead of next season. The Toon have been keeping tabs on Ramsdale , 26, who has fallen out of favour at the Emirates with Mikel Arteta preferring David Raya between the sticks. According to The Mail , however, the Geordies have been put off by the England international's expensive release clause, which is said to be in the region of £30million. That is why Newcastle have turned their attention on Trafford, 21, who would cost around £20m. The Tyneside giants could also get the Euro 2024 hopeful in a deal that would include future incentives. Nevertheless, Newcastle will be facing competition from Premier League foes Chelsea who have also been interested in Trafford. Valencia’s Giorgi Mamardashvili has also been touted but would cost about as much as Ramsdale. Newcastle will have to be careful with finances in the summer transfer window.

        "content": "Kilkenny welcomed a major European gathering on intellectual property rights last week as The Marble City hosted the European Union Intellectual Property Office’s (EUIPO) annual meeting. The conference was jointly hosted by the EUIPO and the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland (IPOI), which is based in Government Buildings, Kilkenny. Delegates from 27 countries across the European Union gathered to discuss the EUIPO’s strategic plan to 2030 and the future direction of the European Union Intellectual Property Network (EUIPN). The meeting was officially opened by the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Emer Higgins. The Minister outlined the importance of Intellectual Property (IP) for business and the economy during her visit. \"I recognise the important role that a progressive intellectual property ecosystem plays in encouraging innovation and creativity and in fostering the EU’s ability to compete in the global economy,\" she said. \"We must ensure that the EU IP ecosystem continues to evolve so that European investors, creators, and businesses are assured of an effective and efficient IP protection system that will be an incentive to invest in research and development, leading to the creation of high-quality innovative goods and services. \"Therefore, the role and contributions of the EUIPO and the EU Intellectual Property Network in further developing these ecosystems is vital.\" The Executive Director of the EUIPO, João Negrão, commented that it was a pleasure to host the European Union Intellectual Property Network (EUIPN) annual meeting in Kilkenny. \"During the two days, we discussed the future of IP at EU level, and how best to continue our cooperation going forward in the context of the next strategic plan 2025-2030 of the EUIPO,\" he said. Over the two days the conference included visits by delegates to some of Kilkenny’s best known landmarks, including Kilkenny Castle, Smithwicks Brewery, Butler House and the National Design and Craft Gallery - culminating with a very special musical event in St Canice’s Cathedral. IPOI has been based in Kilkenny for over 25 years with 47 staff working in the Hebron Road offices. The Office is responsible for administrating and registering intellectual property rights, such as patents, trade marks, industrial designs and copyright. The Office also represents Ireland at international meetings which ensures Irelands position on intellectual property is represented at EU level.",

        "content": "For Marvin Romero, Emilio Aguinaldo College just finished a wild ride in its NCAA Season 99 men’s volleyball campaign. “Sabi nga namin, di namin in-expect na ‘to, ‘yung championship game. ‘Yun nga, ‘yung kagustuhan namin na magkaroon ng great season,” Romero told GMA News Online. [Like we said, we didn't expect this, the championship game. It's just our desire to have a great season.] The Generals, who only lost to University of Perpetual Help System DALTA the entire season, finished as runners-up after Game 2 on Sunday. EAC fought until the end, extending the third set to 29-27 as Romero said they were playing their hearts out already by that time. “Dun na po pumasok ‘yung kagustuhan namin na kahit anong mangyari this game, no regret kasi ‘di namin in-expect yung ganitong sitwasyon na nakaabot kami sa championship game. Habang nagha-huddle kami sa game, gawin na namin lahat. It’s now or never or kahit anong gawin namin walang regret,” he said. “‘Di na po kami yun, puso na po ‘yung lumalaban doon.” [That's where our desire came in, that no matter what happened in this game, no regret because we didn't expect to be in this situation, to reach the championship game. While we were in the huddle in the game, we wanted to give it our all. It's now or never so whatever we do, no regrets. That wasn't us anymore, that was just our heart fighting out there.] Aside from a great run, Romero said it was also an emotional season, which the fans also even felt during their matches. “It was a great season and emotional season kasi parang marami ring nagsasabi na supporters na nata-touch sila every win namin, ‘di rin nila alam bakit sila naiiyak kapag nananalo kami lalo na yung game namin sa Letran, Mapua. Maraming nag-message na grabe ‘yung dedication namin, grabe ‘yung pinapakita naming emotion every game,” said Romero, who previously said they were also dedicating their campaign to their late teammate. [It was a great season and emotional season because there were a lot of supporters who said they were touched with every win of ours, even they didn't know why they felt like crying when we would win, especially our games against Letran, Mapua. A lot of people messaged saying our dedication was great and we showed a lot of emotion every game.] Now, Romero will wait for what’s next for him. “‘Di ko muna siya iniisip, pero merong clubs na nagtatanong kung ilang taon pa ako, pero di ko siya iniisip eh. Sa sarili ko, ang sponty (spontaneous) kong person. Hindi ko pinaplano lahat, kung dumating sa akin, dumating. Kung hindi, hindi. I’m living just in the moment.” [I'm not thinking about it too much, but there are clubs that have asked how many years I still have, but I'm not thinking about it. I'm a spontaneous person. I don't plan everything, if it comes, it comes. If not, then it doesn't. I'm living just in the moment.] Aside from Romero, Bhim Diones and John Michael Paglaon have played their final game for EAC. —JMB, GMA Integrated News",

        "content": "A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Rilwan Olanrewaju has said that the meeting between the party’s flag bearer in the 2023 elections, Atiku Abubakar and his counterpart in the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi is normal. He opined that Nigerians are eager to see two like-minds working together to revive the country. The PDP chieftain, however, stated that the meeting of Obi and Atiku was just two friends having a courtesy meeting. He shared his submissions during an interview with Legit. Olanrewaju alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) spread most speculations about the meeting between the former PDP presidential candidate and his counterpart in the Labour Party. His statement reads: “ H.E. Alhaji Abubakar and H.E. Peter Obi are friends and brothers. I don’t see any permutations yet, as it’s still very premature. It’s normal for two friends to meet and spend time together. “I understand Nigerians’ anticipation and passion to see two brilliant minds working together in the future. In politics, everything is possible, but in my opinion, two friends met, and I don’t think we should read too much into the media speculations, especially from the ruling APC. “Like I said, I would be happy to see them work together in the future, but as it stands, it’s all hands on deck.”",

        "content": "TEN brand new contestants are set to search for their soulmates on Love Island 2024. Here we get to know Sam Taylor, who has been confirmed as one of the Islanders . Love Island producers have finally revealed their 2024 line-up after combing through thousands of hopeful applicants. Sam Taylor from Chesterfield is one of the lucky contestants chosen to enter the famous Majorcan villa this summer . You wouldn’t look at me as a tall guy covered in tattoos and think that I make girls' hair look pretty for a living When asked why he wants to go on Love Island now, the 23-year-old replied: \"At this point in my life I just want the opportunity to find a real connection with someone. \"I’ve been looking for that connection for quite some time but I’ve never really found it — I’m hoping I find that spark in the Villa.\" On what makes him a catch, Sam said: \"My personality and chat. \"I’d like to think I’ve got lots of depth and substance, which should hopefully help me out when trying to find a connection.\" Sam is a professional hairdresser who works in a salon in Sheffield . The stylist also boasts over 4,000 followers on Instagram , where he regularly shares snaps of his incredible haircuts. He warned his new fellow Islanders that when it comes to his profession, appearances might be deceiving: \"I’d say not to judge a book by its cover because how I look compared to what I do for work might not necessarily add up. \"You wouldn’t look at me as a tall guy covered in tattoos and think that I make girls' hair look pretty for a living.\" Sam is heading into the Love Island villa for season 11, which kicks off on June 3, 2024. He will be joined by nine other singletons all looking for a steamy summer of love. As the weeks go on, the original cast will be joined by more bombshells. The Sun revealed how the famous villa has gone through a glam makeover in time for the new series. The launch show will start at 9pm on ITV2 on June 3, 2024. Episodes will then continue at the same time from Sunday to Friday. On Saturdays a highlights show is aired instead of the main programme. The Sun previously revealed how Love Island bosses are planning a huge shake-up for the launch night. ITV is going to air the dating show simultaneously across ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX for the first time. A source said: “ITV want to throw their weight behind Love Island and make sure it has a big, glitzy moment when the 11th series kicks off next month. “Showing it across every channel means creating what they hope will be a big TV moment. It shows there is still a real commitment to the format even nine years on.\" Every year Love Island opens its doors to more sexy Islanders who are hoping for a holiday romance that could turn into more. Here we take you though all of the Love Island winners so far and what their relationship statuses are now: 2024 - The first ever All stars spin off show was won by Molly Smith and Tom Clare . STATUS: Still together. 2023 - Jess Harding and Sammy Root took home the 50K, and won the summer 2023 Love Island . STATUS: Broken up. 2023 - The first series of 2023 saw Sanam Harrinanan and Kai Fagan crowned Love Island winners in South Africa . STATUS: Still together. 2022 - Davide Sanclimenti and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu's time in the villa was anything but a smooth ride, but they managed to win the public's hearts - and the ITV2 reality show. STATUS: Broken up. 2021 - Liam Reardon and Millie Court were announced winners of Love Island 2021. STATUS: Still together. 2020 - The first ever winter Love Island saw Paige Turley and Finn Tapp crowned winners after falling in love on the show. STATUS: Broken up. 2019 - Series 5 saw Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague runners up to winners Greg O'Shea and Amber Gill, who met in the last few days of the series. STATUS: Broken up. 2018 - It wasn't surprising fan favourites Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer won the show , as they were strong throughout. But sadly things didn't last. STATUS: Broken up. 2017 - Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies had lots of ups and downs in the villa but went on to win the show . STATUS: Broken up. 2016 - Nathan Massey and Cara De La Hoyde were together form the start of the series, and since they won show have two kids and are married. STATUS: Still together. 2015 - Despite poor Jess Hayes being Max Morley's second choice on the show, they did win - but they didn't last as a couple. STATUS: Broken up.",

        "description": "Two of Spain's most popular holiday destinations are to limit and even BAN the arrival of massive cruise ships as the row over tourist saturation spreads across the country.",
        "content": "The Spanish cities are set to limit the arrival of massive cruise ships (Image: AFP PHOTO/ ANDER GILLENEAANDER GILLENEA/AFP/Getty Images) The mayor of Valencia says she wants to restrict the arrival of mega cruise ships from 2026. And Barcelona city council is negotiating with the city's port to update the 2018 agreement to limit huge ships. In 2023, the port of Barcelona received 3.6 million tourists. Both destinations say the move is vital to control the number of people who flock into the centre on a weekly basis, causing overcrowding and congestion. When several ships arrive on the same day, these numbers soar into their thousands. \"Floating cities are bad,\" said Valencia's mayor, María José Catalá. \"We are reaching the limit.\"# function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Trending Barcelona's mayor, Jaume Collboni said he would not rule out eliminating some of the city's seven terminals and limiting cruise ship arrivals, following in the footsteps of other European locations such as Amsterdam, Venice and Mallorca. Valencia's mayor said the current model of attracting mega cruise ships was not what the city wanted. However, she stressed \"the smaller and different profile cruises that generate wealth for the city will continue.\" In Barcelona, when the last agreement with the port was signed in 2018, 2.6 million cruise passengers were registered. In 2023, the port of Barcelona received 803 cruise ships with 3,568,000 passengers. The million increase has happened even though the terminals have been relocated to avoid city centre congestion. Deputy mayor, Laia Bonet said the negotiations to update the 2018 agreement did not have a calendar but stressed that Barcelona city council and the port agreed on \"the line of higher quality and not more quantity\". These talks would \"establish a limit\" for cruise ships and cruise passengers\". Spokesperson for Barcelona en Comú, one of the opposition parties, Janet Sanz said: \"It is hard to believe that Collboni now wants to limit the number of cruises. Two months ago we presented a proposal to a committee to limit the number of cruise passengers and the PSC voted against.\" Valencia says the criteria that will be used to discern which cruise ships will be banned have not been defined but the city council anticipates this will be done based on their dimensions (length) or capacity. The city is already taking other steps to cut back on tourist saturation, including a limit on tourist accommodation places, as it bids for \"sustainable and quality tourism\".

This ice cream maker from Walmart , which is currently on sale for just $110, is the perfect way to enjoy a sweet treat all summer long. The Ninja CREAMi turns frozen solid bases into ice cream, sorbets, milkshakes, and more, and all you have to do is press a button. Walmart’s ‘impressive’ upper body workout machine has customers say ‘no regrets' ‘High quality’ camping tent recommended for large family is ‘simple to set up' You can customize your flavor and add in mix-ins to your heart's content. Per the product’s description: “Ninja’s Creamify Technology enables the CREAMi to break down a uniformly frozen block into an incredibly smooth, creamy texture in minutes. “Easily enjoy a wide array of frozen treats like delicious sorbet, decedent milkshakes, lite ice cream, dairy-free options, and much more. From healthy to indulgent, the Ninja CREAMi can create frozen treats as unique as you are! (NC300)” Walmart customers have left rave reviews for the product. One person said: “My husband loves ice cream, so I thought this would be a great way to make a healthier ice cream for us both. “Love it so far, have made 4 pints in it, using the lite ice cream feature. Pictured is a chocolate peanut butter.” Another chimed in: “I absolutely love my Ninja Creami. I have used everyday since I bought it. The price was amazing. It was on sale when I bought it and I even went back and bought my son one. So easy to use.” DON'T MISS... Walmart’s ‘impressive’ upper body workout machine has customers say ‘no regrets' ‘High quality’ camping tent recommended for large family is ‘simple to set up' Walmart's basketball hoop $80 off – customers say it's ‘100 percent worth it' Someone else said: “I love this kitchen device SO MUCH! I’m a plant based/whole food vegan and I can make the most creamy and delicious ice cream using ripe banana, cacao, dates, rolled oats and water.. it’s the best thing ever!” While most people loved the product, some had reservations, like one person who wrote: “Really like the product. It really does produce ice cream easily at home that tastes like the real deal. “However, that is overshadowed by the taste of plastic caused by a design flaw where the blade contacts the container. “Didn't even realize it until I had plastic in my mouth. Ninja offered to replace the container with me covering the shipping cost which I find unacceptable.”",

        "content": "By BL Pune Bureau Comments READ LATER In terms of standalone performance, KIL ’s total income for the fourth quarter of FY24 was ₹40.65 crore, compared with ₹39.82 crore in the same period last year, marking a 2.08 per cent increase year-on-year. However, the standalone profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter decreased by 11.36 per cent to ₹22.23 crore from ₹25.08 crore in Q4 FY23. For the full fiscal year 2023-24, KIL’s standalone total income stood at ₹133.51 crore, up from ₹114.99 crore in FY23, representing a 16.10 per cent increase y-o-y.

On a consolidated basis, KIL reported a total income of ₹1,736.44 crore for the fourth quarter of FY24, up from ₹1,591.51 crore in Q4 FY23, indicating a 9.11 per cent increase y-o-y. However, the consolidated PAT for the quarter decreased by 23.82 per cent to ₹70.99 crore from ₹93.19 crore in Q4 FY23. Also read: Adani Energy Solutions to raise ₹12,500 crore via QIP For the full fiscal year 2023-24, KIL’s consolidated total income was ₹6,411.65 crore, slightly down from ₹6,532.65 crore in FY23, representing a 1.85 per cent decrease y-o-y. The consolidated PAT for FY24 was ₹360.73 crore, a 21.50 per cent decrease compared with ₹459.57 crore in the previous fiscal year. Commenting on the Q4 and full year results, Mahesh Chhabria, Managing Director, KIL, said “We are delighted to announce our fourth quarter and full year results. This quarter marks a significant milestone as Avante Spaces Ltd (ASL), our 100 per cent subsidiary in real estate business, has recognised revenue from its first project “One Avante” in Kothrud (Pune), which is now reflected in our consolidated performance. ASL is now focused on executing the second project on time despite challenges in labour market and approval delays. Due to the challenges faced by our subsidiary Kirloskar Ferrous Industries Ltd. (KFIL), on account of subdued demand in the tractor industry and lower pig iron realisation, we saw a dip of ~1.5 per cent in our consolidated revenue from operations. Additionally, the KFIL-ISMT merger is progressing well and is expected to be completed soon.” Comments",

        "description": "Ruling-party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum has 55% of voter support, according to a poll average.",
        "content": "MEXICO IS ON course to elect its first woman president this weekend, with two front-runners competing to break the highest political glass ceiling in a country with a history of gender violence and inequality. Ruling-party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum and opposition hopeful Xochitl Galvez, both 61, have dominated the presidential race in the world’s most populous Spanish-speaking country, home to 129 million people. The only man running, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, is trailing far behind with just days left before the vote this coming Sunday. “It’s a huge change,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University, in the United States. “A woman president will be an inspiration for women in every single sector of the economy, politics, society and culture,” she added. Sheinbaum owes much of her popularity to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a close ally who has an approval rating of more than 60% but is only allowed to serve one term. A former Mexico City mayor and a scientist by training, Sheinbaum has 55% of voter support, according to a poll average compiled by research firm Oraculus. Galvez, an outspoken senator and businesswoman with Indigenous roots who represents a broad coalition of opposition parties, has 33%. Maynez, 38, of the small Citizens’ Movement party, has just 12%. The longshot centrist resumed campaigning Saturday after suspending activities for several days following a stage collapse at one of his rallies that left nine people dead. Mexico’s next president will face an array of challenges, including managing migration, delicate relations with the neighboring United States and criminal violence that has left more than 450,000 people dead and tens of thousands missing since 2006. Around 30 candidates for local office have been murdered in a wave of electoral violence since last September, in a country where politics, corruption and crime are closely intertwined. “The ominous spread of organized crime and flourishing cartels is the most daunting problem Sheinbaum will need to confront” if elected, said Michael Shifter, a researcher and former president of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. Whoever wins, it will likely be business as usual for the cartels that control swaths of the country and smuggle vast amounts of cocaine, fentanyl and other drugs into the United States, experts predict. “They’re not going to change their attitude just because Mexico has a female president,” Correa-Cabrera said. Sheinbaum has pledged to continue Lopez Obrador’s strategy of tackling crime at its roots – a controversial strategy that the left-wing populist calls “hugs not bullets.” Galvez, who often evokes her childhood story of growing up in a poor, rural town in central Mexico, has vowed a tougher approach, declaring “hugs for criminals are over.” Another major challenge will be Mexico’s complex relationship with the United States, particularly if former president Donald Trump is re-elected in November, Shifter said. “If he returns to the White House, Trump is expected to double down on his hardline stance on immigration, trade and drugs – very sensitive issues crucial to the bilateral relationship,” he said. While Mexican women enjoy growing success in politics and business, gender violence remains a major problem in a country where around 10 women are murdered every day. And while millions of Mexicans have escaped poverty in recent years, more than a third still live below the poverty line, official figures showed last year. Mexico has Latin America’s second-biggest economy, but many people rely on informal jobs to scrape together a living. “One of the things that most affects us young people is work and obviously insecurity,” said Fatima Gonzalez, a 20-year-old vendor in a town near Mexico City who admires Xochitl’s “authenticity.” Having a woman president will not transform the lives of ordinary Mexican women overnight, Correa-Cabrera said. “Inequality affecting women, particularly in the poorest segments of society, is not going to change just because we have a female president who represents the elite and privileged,” she said. As well as voting for a new president, Mexicans will choose members of Congress, several state governors, and myriad local officials. In total, more than 20,000 positions are being contested. Nearly 100 million people are registered to vote. Ricardo Escobar, 20, hopes that a Sheinbaum presidency will bring benefits in terms of education and scholarships. “We did well with the current government,” he said.",

        "content": "Banex Plaza , a popular shopping hub in Abuja, has reopened after being shut down for a week following clashes between soldiers and traders. According to PoliticsNigeria, the plaza resumed operations at 2:30 PM on Monday, May 27, marking the end of a tense period that had disrupted business activities. Naija News reports that the closure was initiated after an incident involving personnel from the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police and traders at the plaza. The confrontation escalated into physical altercations involving passersby and security guards, leading authorities to temporarily shut down the facility to ensure public safety and order. According to reports, the reopening was agreed upon after successful resolutions between the traders involved in the altercations and military authorities. This agreement comes as a relief to many business owners and customers who frequent the bustling electronics and telecommunications market. The initial clash that prompted the closure occurred when four military police personnel retaliated against traders following a previous disagreement. The reopening signifies a return to normalcy and the restoration of business activities at one of Abuja’s major commercial centers. Peter Obi Reacts To Closure Of Banex Plaza In Abuja The 2023 presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has condemned the closure of Banex Plaza in Abuja by the Nigerian Army. Recall that a fracas occurred last Saturday at the popular business plaza between some military personnel and traders. Following the development, the Nigerian Army closed down the phone market for a week over the assault on its officers. In a statement posted on his official X handle on Saturday, Obi said the incident and its aftermath are another manifestation of the nation’s growing tension and intolerance.",

        "description": "T-Rex motorcycles are a little different from typical bikes, in that they're not bikes at all, instead going for a 3-wheel design. Who makes these trikes?",
        "content": "Three-wheeled vehicles are an uncommon configuration for a modern conveyance, as well as a rare sight on American roads when compared to the ubiquitous four-wheel or two-wheel forms most road-legal vehicles take. Manufacturers that opt to go tri-wheel often blur the line between car and motorcycle, including the Polaris Slingshot , the Morgan 3-Wheeler , and the T-Rex RR from Campagna. Based out of Quebec, Canada, Campagna first introduced the T-Rex in 1995. The T-Rex is built at Campagna's Boucherville, Quebec assembly plant. Originally conceived by F1 mechanic Daniel Campagna and automotive designer Paul Deutschman, the T-Rex RR is powered by a Kawasaki 1441cc four-cylinder engine making a claimed 208 horsepower and driven through a sequential six-speed gearbox — all in a vehicle that weighs only 1,098 lbs according to the manufacturer. For comparison, the base curb weight of a 2024 Mazda MX-5 with a manual transmission, a four-wheeled roadster with similar sporting intentions to the T-Rex RR, tips the scales at a comparatively hefty 2,341 lbs. With such a high horsepower-to-weight ratio and serious sporting pretensions, how much does it cost to get behind the wheel of a T-Rex RR as an owner? The 2024 T-Rex RR starts at $68,999. For comparison, the aforementioned Mazda MX-5 begins at $28,985. At that price, the T-Rex RR is equipped with weather-resistant black vinyl upholstery, 3-point safety belts, an Alcantara-covered Sparco steering wheel, and a fully adjustable suspension. Like other boutique manufacturers, Campagna has a multitude of colors and options that can lighten both the vehicle and your bank account. The T-Rex RR is available with seven different body colors, six color options for the chassis, five color options for the headlight bezels, six different seatbelt colors, three colors for the seats, five color options for the wheels, and three different colors for the brake calipers. In case the available hues don't suit the buyer's fancy, Campagna gives the option to customize the trike further with custom colors. The T-Rex RR has available performance enhancing options including carbon fiber body panels and an up-rated brake package featuring Wilwood four-piston calipers. Configurable, indeed. Campagna does not show the pricing for its optional upgrades. Inspecting the inventory of authorized T-Rex RR dealers does not offer any insights either, as they do not list available new inventory. Interested parties are encouraged to contact an authorized dealer or the manufacturer directly. Pre-owned examples are also available from those same authorized dealers, as well as other used-vehicle retailers. Consulting EBay motors at the time of publication found two used T-Rex RR models from recent model years with \"Buy It Now\" pricing at a bit less than $60,000.",

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. In tit-for-tat comments and diplomatic actions, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leaders of the Hamas militant group. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu’s government does not like,\" Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it's too heavy. It's too important.” Angry words abounded Monday, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognizing a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence — those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares slammed the comments, and said his colleagues from Ireland and non-EU member Norway were “also receiving absolutely unjustified and absolutely reprehensible provocations from our Israeli colleague” because of their plans to recognize Palestine. \"In the face of those who want to divide us with any type of intimidating propaganda, the unity of Europeans is essential to send a very powerful message,\" he said. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The latest attacks have centered on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 people Sunday , hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that such strikes will have long-standing repercussions. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. The strikes came after the U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice , on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. Albares said that Spain and other countries asked Borrell “to provide a list of what measures the European Union could apply\" to make Israel heed the ICJ’s ruling and explain what the EU has done in the past in similar circumstances \"\"when there has been a flagrant violation of international law.” Spain, Ireland and Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. Their joint announcement last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries' ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by the three countries might make on the ground. The recognition, however, is a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Albares criticized the treatment of the European ambassadors in Israel. “We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” he said. “But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall for any provocation that distances us from our goal,” he added. “Our aim is to recognize the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.” Colleen Barry contributed from Milan and Aritz Parra from Madrid.

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. In tit-for-tat comments and diplomatic actions, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leaders of the Hamas militant group. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu’s government does not like,\" Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it's too heavy. It's too important.” Angry words abounded Monday, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognizing a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence — those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares slammed the comments, and said his colleagues from Ireland and non-EU member Norway were “also receiving absolutely unjustified and absolutely reprehensible provocations from our Israeli colleague” because of their plans to recognize Palestine. \"In the face of those who want to divide us with any type of intimidating propaganda, the unity of Europeans is essential to send a very powerful message,\" he said. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The latest attacks have centered on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 people Sunday , hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that such strikes will have long-standing repercussions. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. The strikes came after the U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice , on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. Albares said that Spain and other countries asked Borrell “to provide a list of what measures the European Union could apply\" to make Israel heed the ICJ’s ruling and explain what the EU has done in the past in similar circumstances \"\"when there has been a flagrant violation of international law.” Spain, Ireland and Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday.

        "content": "The end of the polling process for the five Lok Sabha seats in Jammu and Kashmir marks a significant milestone in the region’s democratic history. It is the first such poll after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019. The turnout was 58 percent, the highest in 35 years. This election has shattered previous records, reflecting a degree of renewed faith in the electoral process among the people of J&K. The election stood out not only for its high turnout but also for the peaceful conduct of the polling process. Despite the region’s history of election boycott and violence, the exercise was largely incident-free, with only isolated disturbances reported. Over the past more than three decades, Kashmir has consistently witnessed low voter turnout due to conflict and political disillusionment. The Anantnag-Rajouri seat which was the last to go to poll saw a turnout of 53 percent, the highest since 1984. This is a stark contrast to the 9 percent turnout in 2019, highlighting a dramatic shift in voter engagement. Similarly, Baramulla and Srinagar saw turnouts of 59.1 percent and 38.49 percent, respectively, the highest in decades. However, the high voter turnout should not overshadow the need for ongoing efforts to ensure free and fair elections. The Election Commission must continue to address challenges such as electoral fraud, voter intimidation, and logistical hurdles that undermine the integrity of the electoral process. Transparent and accountable electoral practices are essential to maintain public trust and confidence in democracy. As the region moves forward, it is imperative that the authorities build on this momentum by addressing underlying issues, fostering political stability, and ensuring that the voices of all citizens are heard and respected. And to start it would be helpful if the central government holds Assembly elections in the union territory, now that the parliament polls have been a roaring success without the usual boycott or the spurt in violence. On a positive note, home minister Amit Shah has said that the Assembly election will be held before September this year in line with the Supreme Court’s direction. Should that happen, J&K will have a democratically elected government after September. And subsequently, it would be in the fitness of things if the union government reinstates statehood, which again is a promise made by the prime minister Narendra Modi and home minister Shah. .However, much depends on what happens on June 4 and which party’s or a coalition’s government comes to power at the centre. Until then all we can do is keep our fingers crossed.",

        "content": "ASTANA – Kazakhstan, as Central Asia’s most prosperous country, serves as a gateway to the region, President of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam wrote on his LinkedIn page on May 24, following Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s state visit . Kassym-Jomart Tokayev with Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Photo credit: Akorda According to Shanmugaratnam, Kazakhstan and Singapore share a common interest in fostering cohesive, multiethnic, and multireligious societies. Both countries also promote cooperation to address climate change and transit to a sustainable planet. Rising economic cooperation Economic cooperation is on the rise, with a growing presence of Singaporian companies in Kazakhstan. The country is diversifying and reforming its economy, creating trade opportunities via the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route from China to Western Asia through the Caspian Sea. Shanmugaratnam “much welcomed” Air Astana national flagship carrier’s plans to launch direct flights between the countries, noting that this would help more Singaporeans and their businesses explore what Kazakhstan offers and vice versa. High competence in foreign policy In an interview with Kazinform, political scientist Eduard Poletayev commented on Tokayev’s address at the 46th Singapore lecture, stating that not every president can deliver a lecture on such an authoritative platform, as it requires high competence in foreign policy. “It is one thing to read something from a piece of paper; it is another to clearly understand your country, have the ability to define goals, and find the necessary means to achieve the desired results,” he added. The lecture went far beyond the scope of official protocols, routine compliments, and necessary conventions, aiming to convey Kazakhstan’s position and understanding of the global situation. According to Poletayev, it is vital that Tokayev mentions Kazakhstan’s inclusion among the world’s middle powers, noting that in terms of foreign policy, the country can safely be classified not only as a second-tier power but also as a first-tier one. “In fact, Kazakhstan is in some ways a first-world country and in other ways, perhaps, a third-world country. Countries try to demonstrate superpowers and dictate what other states should do. This is all quite difficult, and Tokayev addresses this in his lecture,” the expert said. Kazakhstan’s Middle Power status Political scientist Burikhan Nurmukhamedov opined that Tokayev raised the issue of the middle powers’ role in the international security system and relations by no coincidence. This year, the German Institute for International and Security Affairs determined Kazakhstan as a middle power for the first time. The middle power status means that with relatively small economic, military, and cultural potential, the state demonstrates sustainable development and can impact neighboring regional countries. Nurmukhamedov stated that the President outlined objective trends that can lead to irreparable consequences. In this regard, Tokayev necessitated reforming the United Nations (UN) and involving middle powers in the composition of the UN Security Council’s permanent members to ensure their perspectives are also taken into account when making decisions that affect many states. The expert also stressed the strategic significance of delivering the speech in Singapore, a central hub in Southeast Asia with around 60-70% concentration of the global population. He suggested that Tokayev’s proposals should resonate with UN members from this influential region. A new level of international positioning Andrey Chebotaryov, director of the Alternativa Center for Contemporary Studies, stressed the importance of updating Kazakhstan’s Foreign Policy Concept following Tokayev’s instructions. He advocated positioning Kazakhstan as a model nation, emphasizing its nuclear-free status and policies to ensure interethnic and interfaith harmony. Chebotaryov also proposed presenting Kazakhstan as a proactive country that generates important ideas and initiatives and sets trends of a regional and global nature. He suggested enhancing the principle of partnership, highlighting Kazakhstan as a reliable and responsible participant in foreign economic relations. “In general, in the process of revising key official documents that determine Kazakhstan’s further development and the implementation of its foreign policy course, it is imperative to reach a qualitatively new level of positioning Kazakhstan in the international arena,” Chebotaryov said, concluding that it is not only crucial to compare Kazakhstan with certain countries but also to convince that other nations should compare themselves to the country.",

In Bloomberg ‘s latest Power On newsletter, reliable Apple reporter Mark Gurman outlined many of these AI features, which he says are focused on “tools that ordinary consumers can use in their daily lives.” This is intended to be a contrast to some of the “flashier” AI features that rivals like Google and Microsoft have been promoting as of late. One standout example of Apple’s general consumer AI efforts, per Gurman, is AI-generated emoji. With it, iPhones and other Apple devices would create custom emojis on the fly depending on what you’re texting, which would, in theory, lead to emojis that fit more specific situations. It’s unclear how Apple is working to mitigate issues that other tech giants have run into with AI-generated emojis. For example, Facebook’s experiment in this area last year resulted in the creation of such inappropriate emojis as a woman breastfeeding Pikachu and a child soldier . Elsewhere, Bloomberg reports that a “big part” of Apple’s AI push is to create “smart recaps.” The idea is to use AI to provide users with handy summaries of notifications, text messages, news articles and more. Other AI features that Bloomberg says Apple is working on include voice memo transcription, photo editing and improved Safari web search. As Bloomberg notes, many of these features have already been available on Android devices. The publication adds that Apple will also have to reassure its customers about privacy, especially since some of these features would leverage the cloud. It’s likely that many of these features will be showcased at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) , which kicks off on June 10th. As well, Bloomberg says Apple will announce a partnership with OpenAI at WWDC on a chatbot, following unsuccessful efforts to create one of its own. On the flip side, OpenAI has had its own struggles, including, most recently, a public feud with actress Scarlett Johansson over a ChatGPT voice . Therefore, Bloomberg says Apple is planning to work with multiple companies to bolster its AI efforts, including Google, with which it’s in negotiations to licence Gemini. However, Bloomberg says to not expect to see this Google deal at WWDC. Bloomberg ‘s full newsletter on Apple’s AI plans can be read here .",

        "content": "Led by CEO Fintan Byrne, CR2 generated revenues of nearly €24m in the 12 months leading up to June 2023. Irish fintech firm CR2 has been acquired by Morocco-based payments software company Hightech Payment Systems (HPS). HPS said the acquisition will enhance its digital banking and payments capabilities and accelerate its growth within the space globally. Based in Dublin and led by CEO Fintan Byrne, CR2 has been around for more than two decades, initially focusing on the self-service banking market within the international operations of big banks such as Standard Chartered, Absa and Standard Bank. Today, its proprietary BankWorld software platform powers more than 90 banks across more than 50 countries, providing them with digital banking, digital wallet and payment functionalities. Outside Ireland, CR2 has offices in Dubai, Jordan, India and Australia. Byrne, who took over as CEO in 2017, said that the acquisition by HPS is a “recognition of what the team in CR2 have created and the opportunity within our business for future growth”. “Importantly, it aligns with our continued international scale ambition. With additional scale comes even more opportunity to invest and innovate,” he said. “This is an exciting time to be in the digital banking and payments technology sector. Together, we look forward to continuously delivering for customers and all stakeholders with confidence.” For HPS, the acquisition is an opportunity to gain from “new potential revenue opportunities” in complementary markets already served by CR2, which generated revenues of nearly €24m in the 12 months to June 2023. Abdeslam Alaoui Smaili, CEO and co-founder of HPS, said that the acquisition marks a “significant milestone” in the Casablanca-listed company’s growth. “CR2 has a differentiated and exciting capability set, which is a strong fit for HPS and adds significant depth and breadth to our platform. Both companies share a common passion for excellence in digital payments and for providing high-value solutions to customers,” Smaili said. “With similar cultures valuing customer focus and high performance, we believe that HPS will be an excellent home for CR2 to thrive and deliver long term growth.”",

        "content": "Pandemonium erupted at the Labour Party’s (LP) secretariat in the Edo State chapter as suspected thugs loyal to the embattled National Chairman of the Labour Party (LP), Julius Abure, attacked protesters believed to be party supporters demanding Abure’s removal. Naija News learnt that trouble began when the anti-Abure protesters stormed the party headquarters in several vehicles, holding placards and chanting solidarity songs. No sooner than some of the protesters stepped out of one of the vehicles, the suspected thugs swooped on the vehicles with sticks and other objects, forcing the drivers to zoom off. It took the effort of armed policemen and operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS) to intervene when the thugs started throwing stones into the nearby Secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in pursuit of reporters who were covering the fracas. According to Vanguard, the security officials’ intervention prevented the situation from further escalation and a police vehicle is currently stationed between the warring factions. Abure’s Suspension From Party Invalid – LP NWC Declares Meanwhile, the Labour Party’s National Working Committee (NWC) has declared the Edo State chapter’s suspension of its National Chairman, Julius Abure, is “illegal” and “unconstitutional.” Naija News reports that the clarification comes amid internal disputes within the party that reached a boiling point with Abure’s suspension by his local ward in Esan North-East Local Government, Edo State. The controversy traces back to a letter dated May 14, 2024, followed by a ratification on May 15, 2024, in which Abure was suspended with immediate effect for alleged highhandedness and anti-party activities. These decisions were reportedly endorsed by the state executive committee, led by Kelly Ogbaloi, during a meeting on Friday night in Benin. Addressing the controversy in a statement in Abuja on Saturday, the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Obiora Ifoh , stated that the Edo State chapter acted without proper authority. According to Ifoh, the party’s constitution stipulates in Article 17 Subsection 1 of the 2019 revision that only a national convention convened specifically for this purpose and achieving a two-thirds majority can suspend or remove the national chairman.",

Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.88 days to cover their short positions on average. Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

        "content": "With springtime ushering in the warmer weather, longer days and (whisper it) breaks from school, it's the best time to get the family outdoors for a wee day out to keep them entertained. One museum not far from the city is ideal for wee ones who love farm animals, tractors or just fun days out in general. The , in East Kilbride, is just over 20 minutes drive from the city centre. It offers not only the museum but also a working farm, where you can get up close and personal with their most recent arrivals, the adorable purebred baby Highland cows, Maisie and Ishbel. The farm is also home to other farm favourites including Heilan coo mums Ceo and Airgead, dad Lewis, rare-breed Tamworth pigs, this year’s new lambs, hens and cockerel Russell, as well as Anna and Gina, the Museum’s two magnificent Clydesdale horses. Alongside learning about life on the farm, you'll also be able to enjoy a tour and even get to enjoy watching the milking of the Ayrshire dairy herd at 3.15 pm each afternoon. Open seven days a week, from 10 am until 5 pm, the top museum, farmhouse and historic working farm also features a play park, picnic and play area where children can have fun. Not only that but their magnifying glass posts allow wee ones to inspect things like insects and plants up close to learn more about them. They will also get then chance to see Scotland’s largest collection of tractors, combine harvesters and other farming machinery. You can also visit the Georgian farmhouse where Lanarkshire’s Reid family lived for 10 generations, with rooms decorated as they would have been in the 1950s. While the museum building houses galleries that reveal the story of Scotland’s rural past. Tickets are priced at £10 per adult (£9 for concessions) and £7 for children 5-15 (Under 5s go free) while family tickets are also available. Free for members of either National Museums or the National Trust for Scotland.",

        "content": "Calgary Flames defenseman Nikita Okhotiuk has signed a two-year deal with CSKA Moscow of the Kontential Hockey League (KHL). Okhotiuk was acquired by the Flames from the San Jose Sharks for a 2024 5th round pick. That pick was originally included as part of the return from Vancouver in the Nikita Zadorov trade. The Flames can still retain Okhotiuk’s rights if they give him a qualifying offer by June 30th, as he’s a pending restricted free agent. Nikita Okhotyuk has signed a 2 year deal with CSKA. Clearly no concern with the intentional ban that remains in effect. The 23-year-old was originally a 2nd-round pick by the New Jersey Devils in 2019. He was then traded to San Jose as a part of the blockbuster Timo Meier deal . He only appeared in nine games for Calgary and managed to record one assist. He was a plus/minus – 2. In his NHL career so far, Okhotiuk has played 67 games notching 12 total points. In his short stint with the Flames, he mostly played a shutdown role on the 3rd defensive pair. Regarding Okhotiuk’s departure, Calgary has many options available for defensive depth. Players such as Brayden Pachal , Joel Hanley and Ilya Solovyov are all solid third-pair options who play a similar style. The Flames also have young defenders in Jeremie Poirier , Artem Grushnikov, and Hunter Brzustewicz. It’s a likely scenario that we see these young players get looks with the big club next season as the youth movement continues. It’s unfortunate that Okhotiuk didn’t get a longer look, but his departure just opens up an opportunity for another young player to potentially earn a job. Flames Have Other Defensive Decisions To Make There’s also the issue with Oliver Kylington and whether he’ll be extending his contract in Calgary. The 27-year-old Swedish defenseman missed the entire 2022-2023 season due to personal reasons and re-joined the team in January. Kylington was solid in his return with the team as in 33 games, he recorded three goals and eight points. There’s no doubt that Kylington is a top-4 defenseman on this current Flames team. Calgary would love to bring him back but news on negotiations has been minimal. If Kylington does return with the Flames, it’ll be on a short-term deal. The term would likely be around 1-2 years and more of a “show me” type of deal. The Flames may also look to bring in another top-4 defensemen via trade or free agency. If a quick retool is what the Flames are going for, the blueline is an area that must be addressed. This article first appeared on NHL Trade Talk and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, MEDINA -- Indonesian pilgrims are advised not to drink ice or cold water while in the Holy Land. The goal is to keep worshippers from contracting diseases such as coughs and colds. “Never drink cold water, let alone ice water. Including cold zamzam water,” said Head of Haji Indonesia Health Clinic (KKHI) Doctor Karmijono in Medina, Saturday (26/5/2024). He advocated that pilgrims drink warm water at least three times, such as warm milk. “That (warm milk) God willing can prevent coughing. So the air is already dry, if drinking cold water stimulates the effect of coughing. So warm water can prevent coughing,” he said. Then what if worshippers eat ice cream? “Once in a while, it's okay, but after that it's warm water,” Dr. Karmijono said. In addition to ice, Dr. Karmijono explains why pilgrims also need to avoid drinking cold zamzam water. “It's the same. Whether it is cold or non-cold, it is Insha Allah that is not cold is better. If we drink cold it is as if our needs are met, when they are being met falsely. In fact, he is still thirsty, but as if his thirst has been fulfilled,” he said.",

        "content": "This really shouldn’t happen to the ( ) share price, but it has. The transmission giant’s shares crashed 14.81% last week. Isn’t it supposed to be the most solid stock on the FTSE 100? Not now. I once described National Grid a . Yet and I did have one concern. It had a heap of debt but was having to invest billions into the UK’s energy network, especially electrification to hit net zero targets. Stock shock Last Thursday (23 May), that risk came in as the board announced a meaty £7bn equity raise through a rights issue. This will help fund £60bn of investment over the five years to March 2029, doubling the previous five-year spend. Its shares fell more than 10% on Thursday and fell on Friday too. Over 12 months, the stock is down 11.91%. National Grid still came through with the dividend, which is the main reason people buy the stock. Investors received 58.52p per share in 2023, up 5.55% on the previous year. Analysts forecast the shares will yield 6.17% in 2025, rising to 6.48% for 2026. That’s higher than today but I’m not completely convinced by those figures, given that the dividend will be rebased, with the same money spread between more shares due to that equity raise. Unsurprisingly, National Grid shares are suddenly cheaper than they were, trading at 13.2 times forward earnings. They’d been hovering around 15 to 16 times for yonks. Analysts forecast net debt will top £48.01bn in 2025, then climb again to £53.56bn in 2026. Those are dizzying sums, way above today’s market cap of £42.75bn. They’re more than 10 times the group’s annual profit, which rose 6% to £4.8bn in the year to 31 March. Pure recovery play? Much now rests on the board’s turnaround plan. It has the power to shrink that debt with disposals, announcing plans to sell its UK LNG business, Grain LNG, and US onshore business National Grid Renewables. The board reckons that turning the group into a will drive up group assets by 10% a year, lifting them to £100bn by 2029. I’ve never bought National Grid shares, ironically because I thought they were a bit boring. So in that respect, I’ve dodged a bullet. On the other hand, the equity raise allows investors to buy seven new shares for every 24 they own and pay just 645p for each of them. That’s a 30% discount on today’s price of 897.4p per share. The group’s huge capex investment could drive , something investors usually don’t expect from a utility. National Grid still has safe-haven characteristics, with relatively low borrowing costs and regulated revenues as a monopoly. If I owned any of the shares, I’d hold my nose and buy more at 645p. As I don’t, I’ll sit this out. I don’t fancy paying closer to 900p now. If I’m going to hold a risky FTSE 100 dividend stock, then I want less debt and more potential to grow the share price than I can see here.",

        "description": "ROOKE: The Left's Insane Hatred Of America Peaked Right Before Memorial Day",
        "content": "While everyday Americans were preparing to celebrate Memorial Day with patriotism and somber remembrance of our heroic veterans, the left was once again revealing their unbridled hatred for the greatest country on Earth. Progressive journalists are on U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. as they launch attacks over his use of classic American flags, the “Appeal to Heaven” flag flown under George Washington, which became one of the most recognized emblems of the American Revolution. An Appeal to Heaven flag at the Martha’s Vineyard 2022 4th of July parade? How could Justice Alito do this?? — Abigail Jackson 🇺🇸 (@abigailmarone) The left recently found out that two years after Alito’s wife flew the American flag upside down on Jan. 6, a symbol that America is in distress, the family flew the “Appeal to Heaven” flag at his New Jersey beach home. The liberal journalists are hoping their onslaught of attacks will increase the chances that Alito will recuse himself from the . “During the period the Appeal to Heaven flag was seen flying at the justice’s New Jersey house, a key Jan. 6 case arrived at the Supreme Court, challenging whether those who stormed the Capitol could be prosecuted for obstruction,” The New York Times . “In coming weeks, the justices will rule on that case, which could scuttle some of the charges against Mr. Trump, as well as on whether he is immune from prosecution for actions he took while president. Their decisions will shape how accountable he can be held for trying to overturn the last presidential election and his chances at regaining the White House in the next one.” “The disclosure about the new flag is troubling, several ethics experts said in interviews, because it ties Justice Alito more closely to symbols associated with the attempted election subversion on Jan. 6, and because it was displayed as the obstruction case was first coming for consideration by the court,” the outlet adds. What the story doesn’t say about the image in it’s story about a “controversial symbol” is that it’s from the Minnesota State Capitol building. — Stephen L. Miller (@redsteeze) Far-left outlet Slate also jumped into the ring to sound the alarm over Alito’s flags with a piece hilariously ,”Alito flag scandal: The second one is even scarier than the first.” Slate argues that the “Appeal to Heaven” flag is “even scarier” than Alito’s flying the upside-down American flag because it’s a call to God to help heal America, and thus, it “means praying for the intervention of God’s forces on earth.” And as we saw with the outrage against Harrison Butker’s , if there is anything the left hates more than America herself, it’s Christianity. Despite Alito being a Catechized Roman Catholic, Slate spends the piece equating the “Appeal to Heaven” flag as a symbol of charismatic Christianity and Christian nationalism. “The spread of this symbol among various political conservatives shows just how much the Appeal to Heaven flag has caught on with Christian nationalists, defined as those who abide by the (ahistorical) belief that the United States was founded as an explicitly Christian nation and needs to be reclaimed as one. (A Christian nation can mean many things, but at its core, it means a government that operates by Christian values, with an explicit privileging of the Christian faith above other religions),” Slate wrote. “Others interpret it as a symbol that God backs their specific conservative, Christian visions for the country. And it is also, now, inextricably linked to the violence of Jan. 6 and the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results,” the outlet continues. “Some conservatives have pointed defensively to the flag’s origin in the Revolutionary War to justify the Alitos’ actions. The idea that the symbol is pulled from U.S. history could grant the flag a veneer of democratic legitimacy—but no one should confuse it for a contemporary democratic symbol. It’s a resurrected emblem, with a uniquely theocratic twist.” “Regardless, anyone who owns one of these flags knows the most basic message behind it: America needs to be re-won for God. It involves Trump. But the goal will outlast I wasn’t familiar with the ‘Appeal to Heaven’ flag that evidently flew at the Alito beach house – but they aren’t hard to find at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) In the left’s haste to find a reason to attack what appears to be Alito’s simple patriotism, Slate, The New York Times and others didn’t bother checking whether the “Appeal to Heaven” flag was flown at protests or within movements outside of the “scary” Christians. Michelle Lhooq wrote a Substack piece called “ ” that glorified the Black Lives Matter protests. The piece focused on an all-night rave in D.C. hosted by BLM supporters in Black Lives Matter Plaza. The featured image of her post is a D.J. working his booth in front of various signs, including a prominently displayed “Appeal to Heaven” flag. These publications hate Christianity so much that they are willing to continue to destroy American idealism and patriotism in order to keep the faith out of the mainstream. Their attacks on Alito are not only because they want to sow doubt and confusion about whether he can give an unbiased ruling based on the facts of cases related to Trump or Jan. 6; it’s that they want any mention of Christianity or emergences of it in a positive way to be immediately equated to radicalism and stomped out in its infancy. This Memorial Day, Americans should be looking at the left’s insanity and treating it as laughable attempts to denigrate the greatest country ever created. Only in America can you find a government created by the people, for the people, with the acknowledgment that it is not the government that bestows our inherent rights but God himself. These rights are protected by our laws and brave veterans who answer the call to risk their lives for these freedoms we hold dear. While the left is intent on taking these rights away and turning America into a Communist country, for the moment, she is still free. Until that changes, Americans will continue to wave her flag, salute her veterans and pray for the dead.",

        "description": "Six foot plus of leather and lust, Phil Lynott was the consummate rock bassist. These are his 5 best basslines",
        "content": "Phil Lynott was the consummate rock bassist: always holding Thin Lizzy together, driving things along and just occasionally reminding everyone that there's more to rock than root notes and unison riffing. As a bassist, he wasn't a technician, but he didn't need to be; his always sat perfectly between the drums and the rampant, duelling guitars. He specialised in a warm, middle-heavy bass tone that perfectly anchored his fellow guitarists’ playing. Looking for an example of some deft chops? His most identifiable bassline has to be , with that swinging, jazz-inflected chorus and walking lines under the fadeout, proving that he wasn't all whiskey-soaked eighth note roots. 1980's is another good starting point as Lynott doubles up the fast descending that spans the neck, shifting through two octaves. Lynott used several basses through his career, but for his fans, his trusty black Fender Precision with a mirrored scratchplate was the favoured instrument. He used the scratchplate to highlight members of the crowd from his vantage point on the stage, which he bestrode like a leather-clad god. While his flamboyant style and talent made him a star, it was Lynott’s astonishing appetite for drugs that earned his place in rock notoriety. As the man himself told , “How many times do you say you’re going to give something up and then don’t? People always want to go to extremes. And if you go to the edge, you must be prepared to fall off. And lots of guys have.” Lynott’s struggle with stimulants caught up with him and he was admitted to hospital on Christmas Day, 1985. He died of heart failure and pneumonia 10 days later, aged only 36. Always more extravagant as a singer than a bassist, Phil Lynott’s bass playing always served the songs, but that doesn't mean he couldn't lay down some tasty lines when he needed to. Here, we run through his five greatest basslines. The standout single from one of the band's best albums shows just what a great bassist Phil Lynott was. Its slinky, swinging riff is instantly recognisable, memorable and hummable: all the qualities you want in a bass hook. And we love the way he lays down some walking lines in the outro. The man had groove as well as badass attitude by the bucketful. On this quintessential Lizzy song, Lynott confines himself to root notes with some added embellishments at bar ends, although there isn't much room for showing off in the choruses. Note how the bass drives the song through the verses, with the guitars holding back and Lynott providing an expert, almost funky bassline. This hit tune from saw the return of Irish firebrand Gary Moore. Showing all of the trademarks of one of the hottest rock acts of the ’70s – harmony guitars, flashy solos, pushed rhythms and driving basslines. Not to mention Phil Lynott’s tough vocal delivery and backstreet lyrics. Another much-loved Lizzy tune, opened the album, and with good reason – it's stuffed full of excitement. The live version is probably the best place to start, in fact, as Lynott's bass is mixed high enough for his grasp of the role of the bass in the onstage dynamic to reveal itself perfectly. This song is best known for Gary Moore's phenomenal , but keep an ear out for the bass part – which is thought to be Lynott's line overlaid with a synth-generated sound. The video, with Lynott looking sharp, belies the fact that it was shot so near the end of his life.",

        "description": "V Venu has said media reports hinting at a relaxed liquor policy were baseless.",
        "content": "After the Tourism Director's explanation on May 26, it is now Chief Secretary V Venu's turn to defend Tourism Minister P A Mohammad Riyas and the government. An official release put out by the Public Relations Department in the Chief Secretary's name termed media reports that hinted at a relaxed liquor policy as \"baseless\". \"Media reports on the lines that the State Excise Policy will be tweaked to do away with dry days are baseless,\" the PRD release said quoting the Chief Secretary. \"Such propaganda is being spread by misinterpreting the meetings called at the behest of the Chief Secretary to improve the financial position of the state,\" it said. It was a voice clip that popped up recently that made the tourism director (in charge) Shikha Surendran’s meeting with tourism stakeholders on May 21 controversial. The voice clip - of Animon, the Idukki district president of the Bar Owners' Association, and recorded on May 23 - exhorted members across Kerala to contribute Rs 2.5 lakh each to get the Excise Policy revised in their favour. This was widely seen as a bribe mobilisation drive two days after the tourism director's meeting to discuss the 'dry day' issue. The tourism minister denied any knowledge of such a meeting. \"I have not asked to make any changes in the Excise Policy,\" Riyas said. The tourism director (in charge), too, said that the meeting was not held under the instructions of the minister. She said the meeting discussed the hurdles that stood in the way of transforming Kerala into a wedding destination and also the problems of MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, conventions, exhibitions) tourism. The PRD release on Monday said that a meeting called by the tourism director on May 21 was part of a series of meetings that were held after the Chief Secretary convened a meeting on March 1 and asked secretaries to come up with innovative measures to tackle Kerala’s fiscal distress. The meeting of secretaries called by the Chief secretary on March 1 discussed the state's fiscal situation and also ways to improve the efficiency of governance. \"Many issues were discussed during the meeting, including the consequences of the centre's move to curb the state's borrowing limit,\" the release said. \"The utilisation of Urban Infrastructure Development Fund, cases pending in courts and ways to improve Ease of Doing Business were also discussed,\" it said. At the March 1 meeting, the secretaries were told to hold further discussions on the issues. They were told to actively participate in these discussions, contribute ideas and eventually come up with plans of action within two months. The March 1 meeting also identified various issues and sectors that required greater attention. One such issue, according to the Chief Secretary, was the 'dry day' problem and how 12 dry days a year was affecting the MICE sector. The Chief Secretary had also directed the tourism secretary to do a fact-based assessment of the losses suffered by the tourism sector as a consequence of the 'dry day' policy. He also told the tourism secretary to hold discussions with various stakeholders in the tourism sector and to submit a detailed report. The release also said that it was routine for the tourism director to hold constant interactions with stakeholders in the tourism industry. Further, Venu said that the demand to scrap 'dry days' was a long-standing demand of the tourism sector. The same demand had been voiced by stakeholders in the excise sector, too. The issue came up during a meeting of excise stakeholders called by the Chief Secretary on January 4. However, a final decision on this has not been taken. \"Such discussions on improving the finances of the state were held only at the level of officials. It was these discussions of a routine nature that are now being misinterpreted to mean that the government was planning to revise the Excise Policy,\" the Chief Secretary said.",

        "content": "A Syrian national accused of killing the Russian feminist and anti-war activist Anastasia Yemelyanova has been acquitted of a murder charge due to a lack of evidence against him, Turkish and Russian media reported Monday. Mohammad Nizar Arnabeh was in September after Yemelyanova, with whom he was in a relationship at the time, was found dead in their shared apartment in the eastern Turkish city of Erzurum. A medical examination showed that Yemelyanova, who had moved to Turkey after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and later settled in Erzurum to live with Arnabeh, died from blood loss, according to Turkish media. Arnabeh denied the murder allegations, but local women’s rights activists said he had his testimony four times at the start of the criminal investigation into the activist’s death. The Erzurum 1st High Criminal Court found Arnabeh of the intentional killing of a woman, a felony punishable by life imprisonment, according to the Turkish daily Hurriyet. Begum Osma, a volunteer lawyer with the Women and Children First Association NGO, called the acquittal “unexpected” given the reported inconsistencies in Arnabeh’s statements. The lawyer vowed to appeal the court’s decision. Arnabeh’s lawyers also said they were “thinking of appealing” the ruling since it had not been established that a crime was committed, Hurriyet reported. Investigators previously accused Arnabeh of assaulting Yemelyanova and cutting her leg with a piece of glass. According to the Russian independent news website Mediazona, Arnabeh initially claimed to have accidentally pushed Yemelyanova, causing her to fall on a glass coffee table. He then said he had stabbed Yemelyanova with a piece of glass in the leg before ultimately denying that he was at home at the time she died.",

        "content": "The Bank of Industry (BOI) has announced the extension of the application for the Rural Area Program for Investment and Development (RAPID) for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Community groups in rural areas to June 12. This was disclosed in a post on the official X handle of the bank where it explained that the extension of the deadline was to allow entrepreneurs the opportunity to apply for the loan. It states, “The application deadline for the RAPID initiative has been extended to June 12, 2024, allowing all interested entrepreneurs the opportunity to participate.” Related Stories Development Bank disburses N787 billion to 495,000 MSMEs in Nigeria Gender bias hinders financial backing of women entrepreneurs-IFC The RAPID funding program aims to provide loans of up to N10 million to MSMEs in rural areas at a 5% interest rate for a tenure of 3 years. The bank noted that interested applicants visit its website to apply. The objective of the program is to assist communities in rural and economically disadvantaged areas in utilizing available resources to develop enterprises. These enterprises aim to provide employment, improve the standard of living, contribute to national growth, and address insecurity stemming from youth restiveness. The Bank of Industry (BOI) earlier in May launched the RAPID program in Lagos with the target of empowering 10 beneficiaries per state and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) totalling 370 beneficiaries. Following the removal of fuel subsidy, the federal government announced various grants and loan programs aimed at alleviating the impact of the subsidy removal on their businesses. The programs include; the N75 billion single-digit loan to manufacturers and the N50,000 grant to nano businesses across the 744 local government areas of the country. There is also a N200 billion grant to Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) all over the country. The Federal Government’s Presidential Conditional Grant Scheme (PCGS) , offers non-repayable financial grants to eligible small business owners in various sectors, including trading, food services, ICT, transportation, creative industries, and artisans. The PCGS plans to allocate 70% of the grants to women and youths, 10% to individuals with disabilities, and 5% to senior citizens, with the remaining 15% designated for other demographics. The Bank of Industry (BOI) is also partnering with the federal government in the distribution of the N200 billion loan to manufacturers and SMEs across the country which has already been launched. According to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Doris Uzoka Anitie, under the program, N75 billion will be distributed to MSMEs while another N75 billion will be distributed to the manufacturing industry under the Presidential Intervention Fund.",

        "content": "The circular route is 170 kilometres long and can be completed in seven days. A new hiking trail winding through the wild, nature-rich landscape of Italy’s Dolomites mountain range has just opened. The Cammino Retico is named after the ancient Raeti people who once lived there in pre-Roman times. It connects various remote villages between the Veneto and Trentino regions. The circular route is 170 kilometres long and can be completed in seven days. It hopes to bring slow and to some of Italy’s lesser-known territories at risk of depopulation while letting visitors explore an uncrowded and “uncontaminated” side of the country. Set out by the social association Carpe Diem, the Cammino Retico begins and ends in Aune di Sovramonte near the city of Belluno. The passes through 10 municipalities in the Tesino and Feltrino areas. Each night, can stay in a mountain community including the walled town of Feltre and the lakeside village of Arsiè. There are already 50 accommodation options along the route. The follows other pre-marked routes including the ancient Claudia Augusta and paths plotted by Italy’s Club Alpino (CAI). Elevation along the Cammino Retico ranges between 400 and 1,450 metres above sea level as the path winds through wild limestone peaks, lush valleys and lake shores. “It is a chance for tourists to discover the culture and traditions of these uncontaminated, rural areas,” says Francesco De Bortoli from the Carpe Diem association. “And is the best way to do this.” Along the way, there are various sites of historical interest. can stop at Monte Avena where traces of Neanderthal populations have been discovered. The route passes by the 12th-century, richly frescoed Sanctuary of Saints Vittore and Corona and the elegant 17th-century Villa delle Centenere. Walkers can pause at the Pedavena Brewery and the bicycle museum in Cesiomaggiore. From 2025, a twin will be laid out for cyclists. Drawing inspiration from the popular Camino de Santiago, the Carpe Diem association says they will introduce a traveller’s passport and diploma for those who complete the circuit.",

        "description": "IPL 2024 was one of the most exciting seasons with several thrilling contests taking place. Kolkata Knight Riders ended up winning the IPL 2024 title with a dominant eight-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad. Read below to check full list of IPL winners after end of season 17.",
        "content": "After 74 high-octane matches, IPL 2024 has come to an end, with Kolkata Knight Riders emerging as the champions. Shreyas Iyer and his men were dominant all season and deservedly came out on top in one of the one-sided contests of the season. Batting first, Sunrisers Hyderabad were bowled out for just 113 runs, the lowest score in an IPL final and later, Kolkata Knight Riders chased down the target in just 10.3 overs with Venkatesh Iyer scoring a quickfire half-century. This was KKR's third title win and first after 10 years. The Kolkata Knight Riders also became the third team in IPL history to win more than three titles. IPL 2024 will always be remembered by fans as one of the most exciting ever. Batters put up explosive shows with totals in excess of 200 and even 250 on some occasions breached quite easily. While the initial phase of the competition was all about batters putting up big scores at astoundingly high strike rates, bowlers made a comeback in the later half of IPL 2024. IPL 2024 also saw the record of most sixes hit in a single IPL season with the ball being sent over the boundary for a whopping 1260 times. Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians are the most successful teams in the history of the IPL, winning the title five times each. KKR are second on the list of most trophies won, with the Knight Riders winning their third title. Rajasthan Royals were champions of the inaugural edition with Shane Warne guiding them to the title. Deccan Chargers (now defunct) and Sunrisers Hyderabad have won one title each. Royal challengers Bengaluru (RCB), Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) are the teams who are yet to open their accounts. After reaching the finals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru had hard luck three times; they couldn’t make it to the podium. They reached the finals in 2009, 2011, 2016 and were declared runner-ups all three times.",

Meaning taking 2 slots overall? Think a backpack slot, that can resupply any mech.” Many players noted that a Stratagem should as a Mech should not be as weak as it is, including who said “I don’t usually complain about balance but this is borderline sabotage considering this should be the one that gets the playerbase excited again.

        "content": "Starling's SaaS platform Engine could generate hundreds of millions of pounds a year for the UK digital bank, propelling it towards a £10 billion valuation, predicts investor Chrysalis. Engine is an API-based, cloud native platform initially built by Starling’s own in-house tech team to run the UK bank. In 2022, Starling began offering Engine to other lenders, promising to help them quickly launch new digital services or to replace legacy systems. The platform has so far only secured two clients, Salt Bank in Romania and AMP Bank in Australia. However, Starling's second largest shareholder, investment trust Chrysalis, is expecting Engine to become a significant source of revenue. Chrysalis co-manager Richard Watts tells the Financial Times that Engine has \"a strong pipeline\" and could have between 40 and 50 clients in a few years, \"which would equate to a revenue opportunity of many hundreds of millions of pounds per annum\". This could help the challenger bank \"see a valuation approaching £10 billion\". Last year, Jupiter Asset Management offloaded a six per cent stake in Starling at a valuation of £1.5 billion , a billion pound discount to the bank's valuation at an internal fundraise in 2022. Starling has been betting on Engine to drive its international expansion since deciding to pull the plug on moving into Europe through an Irish banking licence. In December it signed a deal with professional services giant PwC , which will offer Engine to its clients around the world. Watts tells the FT: \"We’ve been pushing for Engine to be developed to drive Starling’s growth, as this proposition opens up a global market for bank infrastructure.\"",

        "content": "London 'Felt like I was at the Bud': Knights players feeling fan support at Memorial Cup Share Riding a six-game win streak, the Knights want to keep the momentum going tonight in Saginaw, MI. London faces Moose Jaw in their second game of the Memorial Cup tournament, and a victory would put them one win away from the final. That is where the host Saginaw Spirit find themselves after Hunter Haight of Strathroy, Ont. scored the game winner Sunday night in a 4-3 win over Drummondville. With London only three hours southwest of the tournament, they expect to have another large fan base Monday. Of the 4,936 fans in attendance for their first contest Saturday, it felt like the majority were wearing green and gold. “I scored and I felt like I was at the ‘Bud’ [Budweiser Gardens],” said Oliver Bonk. “I heard a lot of people, and it was great to have that much support. There were ‘Go Knights Go’ chants all around. It is really cool to come to an away barn and have that support.” London defeated Drummondville, the champions of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, Saturday 4-0. The London Knights practice in Saginaw, Mich. ahead of their game against the Moose Jaw Warriors Monday night. (Brent Lale/CTV News London) Monday they meet the Warriors, another team they have never played against. “It’s a little bit unknown, that’s the way it is in this tournament,” said Knights Coach Dale Hunter. He felt both Moose Jaw and Saginaw showed a little rust Friday in the opener, so it was tough to gauge which version of the Warriors showed up. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips “Both teams were off for, for a length of time because of, the sweeps in the final round,” added Hunter. “You could see where they [both teams] were following the puck a bit. The play picked up as the game went on.” The Warriors trailed 4-0 to the Spirit Friday, but bounced back after a slow start and nearly tied the game. The Moose Jaw Warriors lace up their skates before practice in Saginaw, Mich. on Sunday May 26, 2024. (Brent Lale/CTV News London) “They are a very good team, very good players in there as we saw [on TV Friday],” said Kasper Halttunen, Knights forward who scored in game one. “If you give them anything they'll score. We’ve got to be ready.”The Warriors coaching staff were in the stands Saturday to see the Knights play live for the first time. They saw what they expected after tracking London on game film for a couple of weeks. “It was as advertised with London, as we've seen them on video a lot,” said Warriors head coach Mark O’Leary. “It's pretty easy to access all that stuff [game video], but it was nice to watch them live and in person. They are a heck of a team. They are deep up front and on the back end, and they have a goaltender [Michael Simpson] that can make saves when they need it.” Moose Jaw Warriors head coach Mark O’Leary explains a drill to his players during practice in Saginaw, Mich. on Sunday May 26, 2024. (Brent Lale/CTV News London) With Drummondville losing both games to start their tournament, the Warriors could guarantee at least a spot in the tiebreaker game with a win tonight. “We need this win,” said Warriors forward Pavel McKenzie. “Hopefully we get off to a strong start. Last game, we didn't get off to a strong start.”In a short tournament, every game has huge implications. A victory would give the Knights a 2-0 start, and set up a winner-direct-to-final matchup with host Saginaw Wednesday. A loss and London could face anything from tiebreaker game to Sunday final depending on the result of their next game.

        "content": "Robbie Williams winced with embarrassment as he recalled his blunder in a topless Instagram video (Image: INSTAGRAM) Robbie Williams took to Instagram for a special Bank Holiday Monday post, in which he confessed he was reeling with embarrassment over his awkward encounter. The pair met at the same airport terminal and were introduced by a mutual friend - but the Let Me Entertain You star seemingly couldn't wait to get away. In his haste to give her some space, he exited while she was still talking - and he admitted to his three million followers that he still expected to be \"beating himself up\" over the error for years to come. Talking about Sunday's encounter, he recalled: \"My social awkwardness kicked in of course. I wanted to make the interaction as painless as possible for her. \"Looking for a natural break or ending in the conversation I made my excuses to go sit down. This was not for me but for her.\" However, he was horrified when he realised his mistake. \"Alas, I don’t think Cher had finished talking which made my exiting our brief interaction seem rude,\" he cringed. \"Of course, I will think of this moment periodically for the next 25 years. *in head when im beating myself up at 4am in the morning * “And remember that time you were rude to Cher?’’ function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) The former Take That star turned solo singer made another blunder when he assumed he knew why Cher was heading to St Tropez - and was greeted with a puzzled look by his fellow star. \"I guess [she was going] to shop?

In fact, this isn't the first time Robbie and Cher have met - and they were even pictured together onstage at events like the 1999 BRIT Awards - but it seems the more quiet, intimate setting was making him feel awkward. \"So yeah, I told you I would be grumpy yesterday morning and I was,\" he groaned, adding: \"The small boat taking us to the harbour bashed on the waves, making my back spasm. \"[My wife] Ayda nervously laughed, not at me but at the situation. I let her know in true Grump fashion that it was not OK to laugh at me and my back.\" He added of Ayda, with whom he tied the knot with in 2010: \"She wasn’t but Mr Grumpy couldn’t [discern] that.\" Don't miss...

Let him know he’s been seen and heard!\" It isn't the first time Robbie has shared his experiences with \"social awkwardness\" as he's been open about his mental health journey over the years. For a three year period between 2006 and 2009, he recalled being left virtually housebound at times after suffering severe agoraphobia. During this era, he also spent time in rehab when his addiction to alcohol, ecstasy, cocaine and painkillers left his life \"spiralling out of control\".

        "content": "As cyclone 'Remal' is expected to move towards the state of Assam after hitting West Bengal and neighbouring Bangladesh on May 26, authorities have issued a 'red alert' for extremely heavy rainfall in seven districts of Assam and an 'orange alert' in 11 districts. In this regard, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) has alerted residents and authorities and has urged them to take precautionary measures so as to mitigate the consequences of this deadly storm. According to the Indian Meteorological Department, Assam and other northeastern states is likely to experience intense rainfall on May 27 and 28. A 'red alert' has been issued for the districts of Chirang, Goalpara, Baksa, Dima Hasao, Cachar, Hailakandi, and Karimganj while an 'orange alert' is in place for Dhubri, South Salmara, Bongaigaon, Bajali, Tamulpur, Barpeta, Nalbari, Morigaon, Nagaon, Hojai, and West Karbi Anglong. South Assam as well as Meghalaya is likely to witness wind speeds of 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph on May 27. Preventive measures are going on in full swing with NDRF teams pre-positioned in various districts and the Fire and Emergency Services headquarters keeping all SDRF teams and fire stations on standby. A series of meetings was convened by the Nodal officers from ASDMA and Revenue and Disaster Management department with all the district authorities on Sunday so as to review the preparedness. Meanwhile, the Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC) has ensured the desiltation of major river channels like Bharalu, Bahini, Basistha, Mora Bharalu and Lakhimijan along with other major drains. The mobilization of Super sucker machines and pumps with additional manpower has also been carried out. Moreover, the GMC is closely monitoring the areas which are susceptible to waterlogging and which have had a track record of it in the past. An official release stated that anticipatory evacuation of vulnerable populations from landslide-prone areas in Guwahati, Kamrup, Dima Hasao, Cachar, Karimganj, Hailakandi, Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts may also be considered. To prevent any sort of hindrance and avoid a chaotic situation, the Health Department has been put on alert, ensuring availability of emergency medicines and healthcare staff. Other departments, including Power, Forest, Panchayat and Rural Development, and Irrigation, have also been instructed to remain vigilant at all times. Meanwhile, the public has been advised to take precautionary measures, such as avoiding vulnerable structures, staying away from waterlogged areas, seeking shelter during storms, stocking up on essentials, and contacting authorities in emergencies.",

        "description": "Akshata Murty gets proactive as hubby Rishi Sunak fights to keep Tories afloat",
        "content": "Akshata Murty, Britain’s Indian first lady, has begun getting proactive as prime minister and husband Rishi Sunak hits the campaign trail in a tough race ahead for the governing Conservatives, starting with a supportive message to say she’s with him “every step of the way”, hours after a rain-soaked Sunak announced 4 July as the general election date on the steps of 10 Downing Street. The 44-year-old businesswoman has used her Instagram handle to post campaign messages in favour of Sunak, who is hoping to prove all the pre-election surveys forecasting a drubbing for the Tories wrong. The couple, who met while studying at Stanford University in the US and are among the richest incumbents of Downing Street in history — in large part owing to Murty’s Infosys shares worth millions of pounds — are expected to work as a team through the course of the just over five-week campaign. “People always ask us – ‘What is the thing you have most in common?’ It’s not just our shared love of watching ‘Friends’ reruns and eating Spanish food. It’s the values that we share,” reads a joint statement signed 'Akshata and Rishi' on social media. Also Read: UK: Labour scrutiny over closure of company owned by Akshata Murthy “We share the belief that hard work should decide where you go in life. We share the belief that it takes bold action to make a difference. We share the belief that our children will inherit a better world than the one we share today,” it reads. It was posted on Instagram over the weekend soon after a campaign stop at Harrow in north London, where the duo said the focus was on the “values that matter\". During her time at 10 Downing Street — where the family settled in October 2022 on Sunak being chosen Conservative Party leader — Murty has been hosting 'Lessons at 10' for schoolchildren to learn more about life behind the iconic black door on the most famous street in London. Last week, just as the snap summer election date was revealed by her husband, she hosted a special event to commemorate the D-Day Landings of World War II that laid the foundations for the victory of the allied forces against Nazi Germany. Accustomed to a more behind the scenes role, Murty has often stepped up to the forefront in support of her husband’s premiership since a surprise debut on the political stage in October last year when she introduced “best friend” Sunak for his first speech as British prime minister to the Conservative Party's annual conference in Manchester. “Rishi and I met when we were 24 when we were both studying abroad in America. Right from the very beginning, I was struck by two things about him... his deep love for his home, the United Kingdom, and his sincere desire to ensure as many people as possible have a chance to have the opportunities he was lucky enough to have had. It completely energised him. Being with Rishi was the easiest decision of my life,” she said at the time. Murty, daughter of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and author Sudha Murty, had claimed her decision to make the speech had surprised their daughters Krishna (12) and Anoushka (11). Now, with the general election campaign set to gather momentum in the coming weeks, the Sunak family is expected to be out in full force to support the country's first prime minister of Indian heritage to appeal to voters across the UK for a fresh mandate Follow us on: Facebook , Twitter , Google News , Instagram Join our official telegram channel ( @nationalherald ) and stay updated with the latest headlines",

        "content": "Pastor Adeyemi mentioned this during his recent interview with Seun on Mic Podcast monitored by SaharaReporters. The Senior Pastor of the Daystar Christian Centre, Sam Adeyemi, has stated that he and his wife have been having terrible dreams about returning to Nigeria. Pastor Adeyemi mentioned this during his recent interview with Seun on Mic Podcast monitored by SaharaReporters, adding that spiritual revelations told him his life and that of his family would be in danger if they visited Nigeria. He said, “It's happened for 10 years now. My wife and I shifted our work to global work, so we established offices in Atlanta 10 years ago. Just so as to be able to leverage the technology and the systems in the Western world to be able to reach the World. Reaching the whole world now does not require for you to go everywhere. You can leverage technology, right? And then all our children were in the US when the COVID lockdown started. \"Everyone stayed with their families, so we stayed with our with our children. So we stay together as a family during the lockdown, the week that I resumed services was the week that ENDSARS started started. OK, so we’re preparing to return. What then happened was when the ENDSARS ended in violence, we stay back a bit. “When we wanted to come to Nigeria then in a different experience altogether happened. My wife had a dream. And in that dream, she travelled to Nigeria, returned to the US, and the dream was a bad dream. I told her I don’t like this dream. Three days later then I had mine. In that dream both of us travelled to Nigeria. And in Nigeria, I was in a big fight. I was being attacked right in a violent way that I have to be asking in my heart, the holy spirit, asking you what should I do? And he said I should just call the name of Jesus Christ. I shouted in the name of Jesus Christ in the dream. And didn’t realise I shouted out and to relate my shout look my wife, Pastor Nike up. \"And she was the one that woke me up because I was still asleep. She just hit me and it was 2:00AM in the night. She hit me. What’s going on? “I woke up and we decided we’re not taking it lightly, especially in the light of our own dream three days before. So we prayed and prayed and prayed. Whatever it was, you know it was, it was indicating danger. 3 hours later, I stepped back. I had another dream, both of us were Nigerian. \"It was another scenario and I was in a fight. When I woke up, I said to her, I have never had two dreams in one night before. Describing the same thing like Pharaoh in the Bible, we need to pay attention to this thing. A few days later, we called family members in Nigeria and one person said I’m feeling very uncomfortable about you travelling to Nigeria. We called another family member and he said the same thing. “From that point onwards, whenever we fixed the dates, booked our seats on the flight, I would have a dream that something bad would happen to me in Nigeria and I said you know what? I’ve been a Christian 40 years. At this point, if God is speaking to me, I should have an idea that is God speaking. Something is going on. I don’t know what it is. I want to pray more about it. And at that point, we call the meeting of all the leaders in this division centre the top 120 leaders on Zoom. And I explained, we’ve never lied to you guys before. This has been run by what God said. It was founded on what God said. I said this is the experience that’s been going on. And I don’t want to pretend that I don’t know what’s going on. “I can’t say this is the specific person who has a problem with me, you know, wants to get rid of me or whatever. And I absolutely believe in God’s protection. But these, what is coming is a warning. Can we keep the church going? Right. Why we continue to pray and work on this. And they responded and said you’ve never deceived us before. Absolutely. God is asking you to stay there for now. Stay there for as long as He tells you to stay. was almost exactly 3 years before we would have the clearance from the audience for it to get back to Nigeria. \"But what eventually the police force would tell me was that he wanted me to shift my focus from just being the pastor of a local church to that global walk that I had known that I would do. “So right now. The shift of focus is to do that global work while we keep this time running leveraging technology,” he added.",

        "description": "Brighton look set to make a major change at the Amex",
        "content": "The days of 'away ends' at football are all but over, especially in the higher divisions. Those two words are still used but they usually refer to the away section, which tends to be in a corner or down one side of the pitch rather than an actual ‘end’ behind a goal. Ironically, Albion – who had an away corner at the Goldstone when most others had ‘ends’ – now have the last genuine 'away end' in the Premier League. But that may well change 15 months or so from now. Albion are looking to move the 3,000-seat away section from behind the goal in the South Stand to a different area – which would obviously be in one corner and/or side area of the Amex. The view is the current configuration gives an illusion of greater away support and takes away part of the home advantage. Such a move would put them in line with every other current Prem club and most in the Championship. Yes, away fans are technically behind a goal at Newcastle but they are way, way up in the top tier, far from the pitch and behind a huge bank of home supporters. Other clubs offer visitors part of one end, such as at Liverpool, Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Fulham. Sheffield United had an away end, with visitors given the lower tier and generally having a ball there, but they have now departed. In the Championship, there are away ends at Millwall, QPR and Preston. Otherwise, you will find yourselves on the side of the pitch, towards one end, at Everton, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and promoted Ipswich. At both Manchester clubs, Arsenal, Tottenham, West Ham, Brentford, Southampton and Leicester you will be in, or close to, the corner, although some of those sections extend to near the goal. Wolves generally give visitors the full length of the pitch along the lower tier, which can make it hard to co-ordinate singing, although there is an alternative corner section. The trend extends to Europe. Albion fans were in corners at all four Europa away games. Any change at the Amex would purely be for perceived sporting advantage. In their account of a recent appearance by chief executive Paul Barber at Seagulls Over London, the club reported: “Paul said that away fans will almost certainly be moved to a different part of the Amex from the 2025-26 season. “Although there was no statistical evidence that the current South Stand arrangements gave visitors any benefit, the consensus inside the club is that what looks like 25% of the stadium being given to visitors (despite the 10% allocation) can motivate away sides where they attack the South end where their fans are.” Visiting fans have been in the South Stand ever since the Amex opened in 2011, although some smaller away allocations have allowed home supporters to be behind that goal. Away teams clearly enjoy attacking that way in the second half and it is very rare for a visiting skipper to turn the teams around on winning the toss at kick-off. Aston Villa were among the first teams to do away with an away end and put visiting fans in a side area. That was back in 2007, when manager Martin O’Neill said it would be advantageous to have home supporters behind both goals. It remains to be seen to what extent Albion will follow suit. Barber has also given some more information as to how the Fan Zone at the Amex will operate. The new £7 million facility, opposite the ticket office, will open a few weeks into the coming season. Capacity will be about 1,000 people in colder months, when it is an indoor venue. But that number will double in warmer weather with sides opened out. There will be no admission fee and Albion promise lots of different food and drink options, live music and big screens for live sport. The Fan Zone will also be used for events away from matchdays.",

        "content": "Punjab Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Sibin C on Monday announced to provide incentives to Booth Level Officers (BLOs) worth Rs 5,000 for achieving a voter turnout increase of 10 per cent or more compared to the 2019 turnout. Additionally, a similar incentive is planned for BLOs at booths where the voter turnout exceeds 75 per cent. The Punjab CEO made the announcement in a meeting with the SVEEP (Systematic Voter Education and Electoral Participation) and Social Media District Nodal Officers. Providing details, the CEO stated that BLOs who achieve a voter turnout increase of 10 per cent or more compared to the 2019 turnout will receive a Rs 5,000 cash prize and will be felicitated at a state-level ceremony. He emphasized that BLOs must personally distribute the Voter Slips and ‘Voting Invitation Cards’ door-to-door, without delegating this responsibility to other officers. On this occasion, he commended the BLOs and SVEEP teams for their excellent work so far and urged them to continue their efforts until the polling concludes, to achieve the goal of “Is Vaar 70 Paar.” He emphasized the importance of their role in ensuring a smooth and efficient electoral process, highlighting that their dedication is crucial for maximizing voter turnout and ensuring every eligible voter has the opportunity to participate. During the meeting, Additional CEO Harish Nayar highlighted that district SVEEP and social media teams should document the initiatives taken, including facilities provided at Polling Stations, Model Booths, and booths managed by women and Persons with Disabilities (PwD). They should also collect voter testimonials about their voting experiences. A detailed report will be submitted to the Election Commission of India in this regard",

        "content": "The Senate has started a public hearing on an Act to provide for the National Anthem of Nigeria and related matters. The leader of the Senate, Opeyemi Bamidele, who represented the President of the Senate at the hearing, said the second stanza of the existing national anthem shall be the national prayer. However, he said if deemed necessary, there will be further consultation on the matter. In his contribution Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, said the amendment should not come only by legislative fiat, but should be subjected to a wider consultation He stated that the reversal is not out of place but it should involve a wider process to ensure it is a true reflection of the generality of the wishes of all Nigerians. READ ALSO: Bill Seeking Return To Old National Anthem Scales Second Reading At Senate Meanwhile, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mike Ozekhome, harped on one of the lines from the previous anthem, which addresses the issue of oppression, while corroborating with the Director General of National Orientation Agency that the change of the nation’s anthem is long overdue. He further recalled that he had mooted the idea 10 years ago at the 2014 CONFAB through a motion and it was debated by the 490 delegates but ultimately discarded. According to him, the present Nigerian flag of green white green is too bland and not inspirational compared to that of US and South Africa. Ozekhome also recalled that he suggested that the name ‘Nigeria’ should be changed’ cause it appeared to be a burden, proposing that the name Nigeria be changed to ‘iregime’. He believes that the change like has been done in other countries such as The Netherlands, Pakistan, France, Russia, Turkey, Zambia, Zimbabwe and 12 others, is quintessential to development. A national referendum is key he maintains to holistically solve the issues, asserting again that the slight amendment to the constitution will not solve Nigeria’s problems. Last week, a bill seeking to make provision for Nigeria to revert to its old national anthem scaled through second reading at the Senate. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to report back to the house in two weeks. Meanwile, at the House of Representatives, the bill to revert to the old national anthem “Nigeria, We Hail Thee”, was passed.",

        "description": "Founded 12 centuries ago as a mosque by a pioneering woman in the old medina of Fez in Morocco, al-Qarawiyyin University hosts one of the world’s oldest libraries, home to unique Islamic manuscripts treasured by historians",
        "content": "By Africanews with AP Indonesian student Kamel Tahdhib traveled thousands of miles to study at a Moroccan university with such a rich history, that its renown continues to draw learners more than 1,000 years after it was founded. The university hosts one of the world’s oldest libraries, home to unique Islamic manuscripts treasured by historians. It was founded 12 centuries ago by a pioneering woman and nestled in the old medina of Fez in Morocco. Tahdhib, a 22-year-old freshman, said he chose to study at al-Qarawiyyin University because of its \"widespread fame around the world.\" A devout and wealthy Muslim woman from the Tunisian town of Kairaouan, Fatima al-Fihri, provided the endowment for building al-Qarawiyyin in the 9th century. Originally a mosque, it expanded in the 10th century to become a university when madrassas or Islamic religious school were built around it. Today, the university is home to 10 of these madrassas. As of 2015, it has become specialized in Islamic teaching and religious education. Through the ages, the university played a crucial role in the preservation and transmission of Islamic knowledge. However, the teaching institution was not always focused on Islamic teaching alone, says Driss Fassi Fihri, the vice-president of al-Qarawiyyin University. \"It was historically a university with specializations in all areas of education,\" he added. The university's library houses a collection of manuscripts written by renowned thinkers from the region, including Ibn Khaldun’s “Muqadimmah.” Other texts include a 9th-century Quran written in Kufic calligraphy, and a manuscript on the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence by Ibn Rochd, also known as Averroes. Guinness world records list this university as the \"oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world.\" The biggest challenge ahead of this university is finding the balance between retaining its authentic message while also modernizing and making use of new technology, Fihri says.",

The ninth-seeded Greek, who won the Monte Carlos Masters this year, showed his range of qualities on clay to set up a second-round meeting with German Daniel Altmaier. Sporting a black and yellow outfit, Tsitsipas ended his opponent's resistance in a one-sided third set. The 25-year-old wrapped up victory when Fucsovics sent a return wide under the roof on Court Suzanne Lenglen.",

        "description": "Jason Kelce clarified his \"family dynamic\" in a message on X after a commenter called his wife, Kylie Kelce, a homemaker amid Harrison Butker's speech.",
        "content": "Jason Kelce is setting the record straight on the dynamics of his marriage with wife Kylie McDevitt Kelce . On May 27, the former professional football player responded to a commenter on X about his wife’s role in their home. The X user replied to a previous tweet from Jason Kelce and wrote: “Your wife is a homemaker. But you can’t support butker.And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. Sorry but it is dirty and messy on television. Seems you’re a bit hypocritical. Y’all are going to be left with nothing but swifties. You just ruined your gig. It’s a shame.” On May 24, the 36-year-old father of three discussed on his \"New Heights\" podcast, which he co-hosts with his brother, Travis Kelce , controversial comments about women , among other topics, NFL player Harrison Butker made in a recent commencement address . “I’ve had so many people ask me, ‘What would you do if your daughters had to sit there and listen to somebody tell them after they just earned a degree that they should just go to align to be homemakers?’” Jason Kelce said on the podcast. “And I would say if my daughters listen to anybody tell them what to do — that they should be homemakers — then I failed as a dad.” In response to the X user who called Kylie Kelce a homemaker, Jason Kelce answered because he said he's seen “a number of people” saying it. “I don’t think of Kylie as a homemaker, I think of her as my wife. I think of her as a mother,” Jason Kelce wrote. “She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can.” Kylie Kelce has played an active role in raising money for the Philadelphia Eagles Autism Foundation , and she’s coached high school field hockey. “Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily,” Jason Kelce continued. “The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first.” He went on to explain that their roles in the home and as parents to their daughters aren’t divided nor gendered. “We both raise our kids, we both work, We both keep our home. It is both our faults it is messy, but such is life with 3 young children, busy schedules, and neither of us being neat freaks. She also makes a mean (sandwich).” Jason Kelce made sure to point out that there’s nothing wrong with those who choose to be homemakers, but that’s simply not the case when it comes to Kylie Kelce. “If being a homemaker, works for some, and that’s what they want, then hell yea, that’s awesome, more power to you,” Jason Kelce wrote. “I want to be clear, I’m not downplaying that at all, but that is not our family dynamic.” Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce, who recently gave a commencement speech at her alma mater , are parents to Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 3, and Bennett, 1, and neither of them was pleased with Butker's comments. Jason Kelce said on “New Heights” he understands the outrage that's built since Butker's May 11 speech went viral. “I get what the fuss is about because I know that certain of these groups have been persecuted against for a long period in this country, and women in particular,” he said. And Kylie Kelce, he said, didn't care for the speech either. “My wife, she was I think a little bit frustrated with some of the comments,” Jason Kelce said. “Initially I said, ‘Listen, you’re going to need to go back in the kitchen and make me a sandwich, I’m listening to the game right now,’” he joked.",

        "description": "It sounds as though the makeup of a potential JJ Redick coaching staff in Los Angeles is taking shape.",
        "content": "JJ Redick is the reported front-runner to succeed Darvin Ham as Lakers head coach. Although Los Angeles is in the early stages of its coaching search, several insiders expect Redick to edge out other candidates such as Sam Cassell, James Borrego and Chris Quinn for the high-profile job. On the Sunday issue of his substack , Marc Stein reported that the Lakers are leaning towards naming Redick their new coach. The report further named three high-profile assistants earmarked as Redick's potential staff members should he get the Lakers job. \"More smoke to support the idea that ESPN's JJ Redick is indeed the leading candidate to land the Lakers' head coaching job,\" Stein wrote. \"Rumbles about possible staff targets for Redick have already begun to circulate. League sources say fellow Lakers search candidates Sam Cassell [Boston] and James Borrego [New Orleans] would be prime targets for Redick's staff. As well as an expected run at trying to bring Mavericks assistant coach Jared Dudley back to Lakerland.\" The report also cited Dudley's \"strong relationships\" with LeBron James and Anthony Davis as a factor in the Redick-led staff wanting to bring him on board. Dudley played his final two seasons with the Lakers and won a championship with them in 2020. The idea of Redick — who co-hosts a podcast with James — being named Lakers coach has incited polarizing reactions from former NBA players. While Udonis Haslem believes Redick and James' friendship could give birth to a \"cynical locker room,\" Channing Frye has cautioned Redick against taking \"a death sentence\" of a job. Others such as Matt Barnes and Jamal Crawford have expressed confidence in Redick succeeding in the role.",

In this article, we provide an in-depth prediction of the IMX token’s price, giving you valuable advice if you want to invest in this project. Our analysis will help you decide whether it is a good time to invest in the IMX token or if you should hold your horses for a while and wait for the right time to invest. Additionally, we will explore another potential investment option, the 5thScape project, which has been making the rounds on the internet this year. Can the 5thScape project, despite being a new entrant, beat the odds and become a more promising investment opportunity than Immutable X? We will explore both projects’ native token utility and understand how they differ from each other. Unlocking the Future: A Look at Potential Price Paths for IMX Immutable X is an NFT trading project based on Ethereum’s blockchain technology. At the moment, it is addressing issues that are typically related to traditional NFT marketplaces, which include limited scalability and high fees. The project tackles these two persisting issues with its own Layer-2 solution. Based on our analysis, Immutable X’s price forecast is bullish, predicting a jump of 228.5% to $7.85 by June 26th, 2024. While technical indicators suggest a neutral sentiment, the Fear & Greed Index indicates Greed (74). Over the past 30 days, Immutable X has seen 15 green days, i.e. positive days (50%) with its token’s price volatility of 7.04%. Immutable X (IMX) vs. 5thScape (5SCAPE) – Which Holds More Potential? The Immutable X platform is focused on developing a platform designed explicitly for Web3 games. It addresses common issues in these games, such as limited player control over in-game items. With Immutable X, players can own their in-game items as real assets using NFTs (non-fungible tokens). This eliminates the frustration of losing virtual items when you stop playing a game. Its technology tackles slow transactions and high fees but faces competition from similar projects. The IMX token service has a less-than-exciting purpose. Thiss native token of the Immutable X platform only secures the blockchain technology that the platform runs on. It is also used to reward the traders and marketplaces that support the Immutable X network. >>Click Here to Visit 5thScape Presale Page On the other hand, 5thScape has created a unique niche. It is a VR content hub that uses blockchain technology to offer a vast library of VR experiences. It has everything in an immersive setting, from movies and games to educational content. The native token of 5thScape, 5SCAPE, holds a broader use case as it is a golden ticket to explore the 5thScape’s VR universe. 5SCAPE token holders can access the vast library of 5thScape for a heavenly entertainment experience. Additionally, various staking opportunities come with this token. So, IMX is a solid option if you are looking for a hot NFT marketplace. But if you crave unique VR experiences and want to be part of a growing VR community, the 5SCAPE token might be the more promising choice due to its platform’s established position in this innovative field. Know 5thScape – Unlocking New Worlds: 5thScape’s Vision for VR Entertainment As mentioned earlier, 5thScape offers a vast and ever-expanding VR library beyond games. Here, one can dive deep into immersive VR movies, educational content that makes learning engaging, and the latest addition to its library—the exhilarating Cage of Conquest MMA fighter game available on MetaQuest. Everything within the 5thScape platform, from the content library to exciting games, requires the 5SCAPE token as your access ticket. However, the VR experience continues. To truly feel like you have stepped into another world, 5thScape offers a range of physical VR accessories designed for seamless integration with its online platform.

With VR technology rapidly setting its foothold across multiple markets, 5thScape’s comprehensive VR experience positions it as a leader. This makes it a dream destination for VR enthusiasts. With a continuously growing user base, the value of the 5SCAPE token, which fuels this entire ecosystem, is likely to increase, matching the unparalleled growth of VR technology. Why 5thScape (5SCAPE) Might Be a Bolder Investment Than Immutable X (IMX) While Immutable X (IMX) offers a compelling solution for NFT ownership in web3 games, 5thScape (5SCAPE) presents a potentially more groundbreaking opportunity. Here’s a breakdown of why 5thScape might be the stronger investment! The key difference lies in market position. Immutable X faces competition from a growing pool of similar NFT marketplaces. 5thScape, however, carves a unique niche in the booming VR entertainment market. Its VR content hub offers a vast library of experiences (movies, games, education), while Immutable X limits itself to NFT content. Furthermore, the adoption of Virtual Reality (VR) technology is rapidly increasing, driving user growth for platforms like 5thScape. This expanding user base creates a strong foundation for the 5SCAPE token’s value. Although the NFT market holds promise, its long-term trajectory remains to be seen. The utility of the tokens also differs. The IMX token facilitates NFT trading on the Immutable X platform. The 5SCAPE token, however, serves as a gateway to the entire 5thScape ecosystem. Users need 5SCAPE to access the VR content library, creating direct demand for the token and potentially driving its value. Finally, 5thScape is a leader in VR content built on blockchain. This first-mover advantage could solidify its position in developing VR entertainment, attracting users and developers before competitors catch up. Final Thoughts on 5thScape – A Promising Player in VR While Immutable X offers a promising solution for NFT ownership in web3 games, with our analysis suggesting a potential price surge, 5thScape might be a more future-proof option for savvy investors. Unlike IMX, which faces competition in the crowded NFT marketplace, 5thScape has created its prime position in the rapidly growing VR entertainment sector. Its diverse VR library offers experiences beyond games, creating a distinct value proposition. Not to mention, the adoption of VR technology is skyrocketing, driving user bases for platforms like 5thScape. This expanding user base creates a strong foundation for the 5SCAPE token’s value, potentially surpassing the long-term trajectory of the NFT market. Additionally, the IMX token primarily facilitates NFT trading, whereas the 5SCAPE token acts as a gateway to the entire 5thScape ecosystem. It serves more utility than the IMX token. Ultimately, both IMX and 5thScape represent exciting ventures with significant potential. IMX offers a familiar NFT solution with a chance of high returns, while 5thScape presents a lucrative opportunity in the surging VR entertainment space. Further fueling its appeal, 5SCAPE has witnessed a massive price increase since its first presale round, reflecting growing demand for the token. This momentum suggests a strong debut on exchanges, making it one to watch for long-term investors.",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak had a rocky start to his General Election campaign, and the party did not have all its candidates in place when the prime minister announced the July 4 date.",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak’s ruling Conservatives are still scrambling to find candidates in Dundee and Fife five days after he fired the starting gun on the election campaign. The party has until June 7 to submit its candidates to local authorities, but none have been identified for the Dundee Central constituency. Mr Sunak appeared to catch his party by surprise when he announced the election. Tory HQ is searching for candidates in nearly 200 constituencies across the UK. This includes Dundee Central as well as Glenrothes and Mid Fife and Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy. Further vacancies have occurred as veteran MPs announced they would be standing down, including senior minister Michael Gove. It comes after we reported the Conservatives were struggling to find in parts of Fife. Those areas with no candidate are likely to be a two-horse race between the SNP and Labour, but the Conservatives have historically fielded candidates. Sources in the party say members have been unwilling to put their name forward. In a scathing assessment, one insider said: “We know he’s not going to do anything, he’s going to lose. “I couldn’t talk about supporting him as prime minister when I don’t. There’s no integrity in that.” Speaking to The Courier, SNP leader John Swinney said: “It’s pretty clear the Conservatives have shambled their way into this election in the way they’ve shambled their way through government. “They’ve got huge candidate gaps around the country and Conservative MPs are leaving. “It’s illustrative of the fact the Conservatives are an utter shambolic mess. The sooner we are rid of them the better.” The prime minister has had a rocky start to his election campaign, which he announced in the midst of a downpour as activists blasted Labour’s 1997 anthem Things Can Only Get Better by D:Ream. And a memo from Conservative Party head office which was obtained by the revealed MPs had failed to get behind Mr Sunak. Some are said to have gone on holiday while others have refused to campaign in their constituency. A third Tory MP is said to have attended a wedding during a campaign week that focussed resources on his constituency. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said the party would have candidates in all 57 Scottish seats by this week. They added: “In key seats across Scotland, voters know that only the Scottish Conservatives can beat the scandal-ridden, independence-obsessed . “By doing so, we can move the focus away from the nationalists’ fixation with breaking up the UK and on to the public’s real priorities, like fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.”",

(AP) — Police say a Michigan woman was killed when an out-of-control vehicle slammed into her during a drag-racing event, but she was able to push her 2-year-old daughter to safety in the seconds before the crash.

        "description": "European airports with the best and worst pre-flight experiences have been revealed, with Berlin Brandenburg, Munich Airport, Brussels Airport, Hamburg Airport and Stockholm Arlanda Airport making the top five",
        "content": "A major European airport has been named the worst to get stuck in in the Continent. Going on holiday or travelling is normally always exciting, but when travellers get to their airport usually a few hours before their flight, a lot of boredom can kick in. Picture this - you just got to the airport and it is 4am. All you are dreaming of is a good coffee to take the edge off your tiredness. But instead of being greeted by fast wait times and a cosy café, you see a lengthy security queue and no sign of a coffee shop. To try and help reduce airport dismay this summer, the travel experts at eurochange have revealed the airports with the best and worst pre-flight experiences in Europe. Analysing the 40 busiest airports across Europe, airports were scored for their number of flight delays , average security wait times, array of restaurants and shops, the cost of an airport lounge ticket, and even the presence of unique attractions. World's most turbulent flights mapped after passengers injured in terrifying incidents - see list Germany secured two of the top five spots, while London Heathrow missed out on fifth by one point ( Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Henri Coandă, Bucharest At the bottom of the pile is Henri Coandă in Bucharest. The Romanian airport has been ranked as the most ‘boring’ airport on the Continent, it doesn't get better when it comes to prices around the airport. An airport lounge ticket will set travellers back £40 per person making it the second most expensive in Europe for airport lounge tickets, behind Charles de Gaulle in Paris. On review website Skytrax the airport has been awarded a meagre 3/10 from more than 100 reviews. One unhappy customer wrote: \"This is the worst airport. There are no sitting areas at all. People sit on the floors, on rails, stairs. I had a business class ticket but because I arrived too early to the airport I couldn’t use the business class lounge Because the check in for my baggage was an hour before the flight! Shame on you! Total disappointment.\" Another joined in the kicking, adding: \"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience. The airport was eerily empty, creating a rather unwelcoming atmosphere. But the real frustration began with the inefficiency in handling our luggage. It took them over an hour to offload our bags from the plane. \"This caused us to miss our connecting flight. Their lack of urgency and disregard for passengers' schedules was appalling. The entire ordeal was not only time-consuming but also added unnecessary stress to our journey. I strongly advise travellers to consider other options if possible.\" A third wrote: \"Horrible experience, long queuing times especially at security, and rude, unprofessional staff. Flying is already a stressful experience, every time I am at this airport it makes it an absolutely horrible experience. Would definitely not recommend, and a shame for anyone visiting Bucharest to have this as a first point of contact.\" Other travel airports named among the worst were Porto Airport in Portugal, Nice Côte d'Azur Airport in France and Warsaw Chopin airport in Poland. Bristol airport came 38th out of the 40 airports assessed, scoring zero for both kids attractions and unique attractions. 'I'm solo travelling the world in my 70s - it's better than being old and lonely' 'Person behind me demanded I stop reclining my plane seat – I was fuming' Berlin Brandenburg, Germany The number one airport on the list for the best pre-flight experience is Berlin Brandenburg in Germany. The airport has the fewest delays, in fact, you’re least likely to be delayed at this airport in the first place. An impressive 80% of flights depart on time and its average security wait time is just 7 minutes. There is also lots to do at Brandenburg including options for kids, such as an entire playground and a special children’s TV corner. For the art lovers, make sure you look up at the ceiling when they check in — it features a beautiful Magic Carpet art installation. For many, a good alcoholic beverage makes being stuck in that two-hour limbo period waiting to board a place, more bearable. At €4.90 (£4.17) for a large beer, the airport scored full marks for its beer price, compared to Copenhagen , where it will set you back 249 Krona (£18.31). Munich Airport, Munich, Germany Munich airport closely followed behind Berlin Brandenburg, where the average security wait time is just five minutes. Munich also has plenty to offer while travellers wait including the world’s first airport brewery, where you can even get a guided tour before you fly. It also has an observation deck on level five, above the terminal two check-in area. Brussels Airport in Belgium followed in third, Hamburg Airport in Germany fourth and Stockholm Arlanda Airport in Sweden took the fifth spot. London Heathrow narrowly missed out on the top five by just one point, scoring well on its shops, flights departing on time and its average wait times.

        "content": "The Minnesota Twins had a couple of players they could have traded this offseason with an ownership group determined to cut payroll. Max Kepler was among the key names in that group . Ultimately though, Kep stayed and it was Jorge Polanco sent packing, instead. On Opening Day, Max Kepler fouled a ball off of his leg and was clearly in pain. When he attempted to play through it, he went a putrid 1-for-20. Finally, the decision to put him on the injured list was made. After 15 days on the IL, Kepler returned to the Twins’ lineup on April 22nd while manager Rocco Baldelli was searching for answers. As it turned out, Kepler was a big part of what was missing. He posted a 1.089 OPS through his first eight games. And he hasn’t looked back since. Max Kepler has overtaken Ryan Jeffers for the team lead in OPS. Pretty amazing considering Kepler was off to a 1-for-20 start when he went on the injured list in mid-April. Kepler has an OPS well over 1.000 since returning. pic.twitter.com/P7peamblN5 In May, Kepler is slashing .333/.403/.623 with 10 doubles and three homers. His wRC+ this month puts him fourth in baseball behind only Aaron Judge, Shohei Ohtani, and Kyle Tucker. What he is doing has helped to provide a necessary thump for a Twins lineup that couldn’t get out of its own way at the beginning of the year. This to follow up one of the best half seasons of his career to end 2023. Of course, we aren’t even halfway through the 2024 season, but but if Kepler continues to produce like he has for nearly a full year now, the Minnesota Twins will have a big decision to make this offseason. In the final year of his six-year extension (signed before the 2019 season), Kepler is set to become a free agent for the first time in his career, after this season. Next summer, Max will be 32 years old, meaning he’s unlikely to get peak value or length of term on the open market. Should he continue to go like this though, Derek Falvey will be hard pressed not to dabble with a qualifying offer. For 2025, the qualifying offer should be expected to check in around $20 million. While that might seem like a lot for Kepler, keeping him in right field provides a consistency on both offense and defense that the Twins can’t really afford to lose. Minnesota has some emerging stars that can play the outfield, but the other corner position is hardly cemented at this point . And as long as Byron Buxton is the center fielder, they will need help at that position too. And Max has made it clear that CF is not for him. It’s hard to fathom that the guy who struggled to post a league average OPS+ in either 2021 or 2022, and has been a constant source of trade talk throughout his career, would be back (especially at $20M) but that’s where we are.

        "content": "For many users with an adblocker employed, YouTube videos are suddenly starting to skip to the end of the video. Over the past few months, YouTube has been enforcing its rule against the use of adblockers. That started last year with the platform displaying a message that would tell the user to turn off their adblocking, in turn blocking videos from playing after that prompt was ignored. That led to many uninstalling their adblockers , as well as some clever workarounds popping up . This week, many have noticed that YouTube videos are suddenly skipping straight to the end of the video. Even if the video is just replayed, it skips straight to the end almost immediately. It’s a strange phenomenon and one that only appears to be happening for users with an adblocker installed. When the blocker is disabled, everything works as normal. Users also report that this happens when the video is replayed and, if you try to skip to a certain part of the video, it just endlessly loads in some cases. As such, many believe that this is an intentional move on YouTube’s part to discourage the use of adblockers. That’s entirely possible, but it’s equally possible that this is a problem with the adblocker itself. Earlier this year, a bug in AdBlock caused videos to load slowly and also put undue stress on the machine running YouTube. When that issue popped up, many accused YouTube of being the cause. It’s also worth noting that, at least from what we could find, those experiencing this latest problem are using AdBlock, while those on other adblockers aren’t seeing the same behavior. There are some very limited reports of this happening without an adblocker too, though, but they’re in the extreme minority.

        "content": "A former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister and MLA is buying a Winnipeg newspaper. Kevin Klein has agreed to purchase the Winnipeg Sun, where he once was the publisher, Postmedia said on Monday morning. The Klein Group, of which Klein is president and CEO, is also buying the Graphic Leader in Portage la Prairie and the Kenora Miner and News. Postmedia's commercial print division in Winnipeg, including all associated digital properties, contracts and other related parts of the businesses, is also part of the sale to the investment group. Postmedia said all employees are expected to keep their jobs. \"In an age where information is abundant and easily accessible, the role of local journalism is more crucial today than ever before,\" Klein said in a news release. \"We are honoured to take ownership of these local newspapers and are dedicated to preserving their legacy of providing trusted, community-focused news.\" Manitoba voters less informed of election happenings due to Meta's decision to block news, experts say Analysis Who pays the price for the news media's essential political role? Klein has been writing a regular column for the Winnipeg Sun since he was defeated in last fall's provincial election. His LinkedIn account says he was publisher of the newspaper from 2007-13. Klein served as a Winnipeg city councillor for one term, beginning in 2018. He ran for mayor in 2022, but came in third place. Klein entered provincial politics two months later, winning the Kirkfield Park byelection for the Progressive Conservatives. He became the environment minister in early 2023. Klein told CBC News last month that he would likely run for leadership of the PC party. Members will choose their next leader in April 2025. Postmedia stories will remain Staff at the publications were informed of the sale on Monday morning. In the memo to employees, Postmedia called the sale a \"new and unique model,\" as the company will continue to provide support to the new owners, as well as national news stories and opinion pieces to supplement local coverage. \"This is a model that is unique to a distinct market where we have no other geographic presence — the papers were no longer sustainable for us, and we were able to attract a local group with a commitment to keeping operations going.\" The memo described the sale is good for the communities and employees, as the Klein Group is expected to keep running the publications in their current form. It also said while there are benefits to this unique transaction in which ownership is sold but support is still being provided, it isn't indicative of a wider strategy for Postmedia. Last Friday, Klein didn't return CBC News' requests for comments about the pending sale. Postmedia said it doesn't speak about rumours.",

Tehran Brown, 44, of Washington D.C., was charged by the Camp Hill Police with misdemeanor simple assault, and two summary offenses: harassment and disorderly conduct after the incident about 7 p.m. May 24 in the 2300 block of Logan Street. Police said Brown was soliciting in the neighborhood when he had “an altercation” with a driver who passed by. He brandished pepper spray at the driver while shouting obscenities and racial slurs, police said. Officers were called to the scene and they transported Brown to Cumberland County Prison, where he was still being held Monday after being unable to post $10,000 monetary bail. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 30. Last month, Brown was arrested in Illinois and charged with aggravated assault and battery by police. He’s been arrested more than 20 times in eight different states, with offenses ranging from canvassing and peddling to battery and assault.

This would mark a 157 per cent year-on-year increase in the number of Haj pilgrims passing through the CSMIA compared with 2023 when 12,815 faithful had travelled from here. This year’s Haj pilgrimage season commenced with flights departing from May 25 and will continue to leave till June 12, while the return services are slated to start in July, the official said. The CSMIA has a robust schedule to Saudi Arabia with 11 daily flights operated by Saudia Airlines, Air India, IndiGo and Vistara, and during the peak Haj season, Saudia is responsible for handling the official movement of pilgrims from here. The official added that in order to handle the increase in pilgrim traffic, the CSMIA has arranged 101 ferry flights for both departures and arrivals for the convenience of the Haj pilgrims, plus a range of facilities and services for them at Terminal 2. These include a separate approach road, dedicated drop-off point, exclusive parking and lifts, dedicated check-in and immigration counters and an exclusive check-in island, streamlined access, special screening area, dedicated boarding gates, separate seating, wazu (ablutions) and praying arrangements for men and women, and a senior official deployed for managing and coordinating with the Haj volunteers for all the flights.",

Fatalities have been reported in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky on Sunday, as per US media reports. Search and rescue teams, along with law enforcement have been sifting through the debris for survivors and providing medical aid to the numerous injured. Tornadoes and hailstones as large as tennis balls were reported in various locations on Saturday night, reported the US media. Estimates suggest that one of the storms in Oklahoma was at least a level three on a five-point scale, capable of reaching speeds up to 265 kmph. Nearly 50,000 people across nine US states were without electricity on Sunday evening. A state Emergency was declared in multiple areas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott reported over 100 injuries and the destruction of hundreds of homes across the state. Cooke County, located near Dallas, was severely impacted by strong winds that demolished a highway rest area and devastated a mobile home park, leading to the death of seven individuals, including four children, as reported by the local police. Tornado warnings remained in effect in several areas. Experts link the increasing frequency of natural disasters in the US, such as storms, floods and wildfires, to the effects of climate change.",

Abang, who was abducted from his Ebughu Palace, has been released after a ransom of ₦50 million was reportedly paid. Naija News reports that the state police spokesman, ASP Timfon John, confirmed the monarch’s release but did not comment on the ransom payment. According to a community leader who wished to remain anonymous, the kidnappers released the monarch early on Monday morning. “The abductors collected ₦50 million Naira to release him,” the community leader said, expressing the community’s dismay, particularly over the involvement of local youths in the kidnapping. “This whole incident is driven by greed and envy from some mischievous community stakeholders over the exalted stool the Paramount Ruler occupies,” the community leader added, noting that the monarch has been taken to the hospital for medical care. His wife, Obonganwan Okon Abang, who was shot in the leg during the abduction, is also recovering and is expected to be discharged soon. The kidnapping occurred on the evening of May 18, as armed individuals stormed the palace, shooting as they took the monarch.

        "content": "BAKU - Azerbaijan wants to borrow $5 billion from international credit institutions in the coming years for large infrastructure projects, including in territories secured in a lightning military offensive in September, the finance minister told Reuters. Azerbaijani forces took control of the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where ethnic Armenians had enjoyed de facto independence for decades, prompting at least 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee. \"Very big tasks stand before us,\" Finance Minister Samir Sharifov said in an interview. He said the tasks in question were linked with the reconstruction and restoration of land now under Azerbaijan's control, something that would also boost the country's economic growth. Peace talks between Baku and Yerevan are ongoing, with the two sides continuing negotiations on the demarcation of their 1,000 km (620 mile) border, which remains closed and heavily militarised. \"There are a number of large projects in the transport infrastructure field, that could be financed through attracting borrowed resources,\" Sharifov said. \"Overall, we are talking about additional borrowing of $5 billion.\" Azerbaijan's public debt stood at $6.1 billion at the start of 2024. Sharifov said Baku would repay $1.4 billion of this by the end of the year and then ultimately plans to increase public debt to $10 billion. \"We will not issue Eurobonds. Most likely it will be project financing,\" Sharifov said, listing the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank among the possible sources of funds. He said the financing would likely come over the course of four to five years. REUTERS",

        "content": "is the excellent grappling hook side-scroller that . While fans might be disappointed to hear that it isn't receiving a sequel, its upcoming update is big enough to fill a second game and, even better, it's totally free. \"Rusted Moss will not have a sequel,\" its developers wrote in a recent , before adding that the major content update \"might as well be one\" when it drops on June 20, 2024, alongside a full port on Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. The upcoming update is reportedly adding in two new explorable areas, 7-8 hours of new content, over 300 more rooms, a boss rush mode, and a slightly more mysterious Maya mode that will (spoilers!) let you \"play the whole game again as Maya after you beat it the first time.\" For those who fear missing out, the second playable character won't bring any \"new dialogue or ending stuff\" because speedrun mode rules apply here. But it's still worth checking out for \"some nifty new ways to play,\" which begs the question: What could possibly be niftier than a grapple/rifle twin-stick combo? I'm excited to find out. Anyone looking to sling their way into the game now is in luck. Rusted Moss is currently going cheap on Steam with a 40% discount available until June 1. Metroidvanias have swamped most of my playtime this year, with banger after banger releasing seemingly out of nowhere. 's , the psychedelic gardening hybrid Ultros, the , and most recently l have all been major 2024 highlights thus far - and Rusted Moss 1.5 should only keep up that incredible winning streak.",

Follow Us We still don’t have a date for the launch of the Lynk & Co Zero but we do now have a good idea of what the car will look like inside. Thanks to spy shots we know about the screen setup and the general layout of the front of the passenger compartment. - Advertisement - There is a large floating center infotainment system screen which is probably around 15-inches. Behind the steering wheel is a very narrow instrument display screen. Presumably this plays second fiddle to a head up display but the spy shots do not confirm whether there is one or not. The steering wheel is flat bottomed and also has a flat top which doesn’t extend quite as wide as the bottom. Steering wheel mounted controls are quite streamlined indicating that most things are likely controlled either by the screen of voice. Behind the steering wheel is a control stalk for the drive selection indicating the center console is probably uncluttered. From the little that we can see of the console there seems to be wireless charging pads, possibly dual, along with a split opening compartment. Probably the biggest surprise about the Zero interior is how little it looks like that of the Lynk & Co 07 EM-P . One noticeable element of the Zero’s interior is how the lower part of the dashboard comes out towards the occupants. - Advertisement - From previous spy shots we now have a good idea about what the exterior of the Zero looks like. We had thought that the car might have launched by now but it is still on track for the previously announced first half of the year timetable. As the first all-electric car from the Lynk & Co brand the Zero is eagerly anticipated and should launch next month. The Zero should be quite comparable to the Zeekr 001 . It rides on the same 800V architecture SEA (Sustainable Experience Architecture) platform as the Zeekr. It should also have similar dimensions meaning a length of around 5 meters and a wheelbase around 3 meters. While the powertrain is also likely to be similar it is believed that the Zero will have four-wheel steering. The new car will be the new flagship car for the brand and mark a new electrification path. Source: Autohome .

        "content": "CAIRO - An Egyptian court sentenced former presidential hopeful Ahmed Tantawy on Monday to one year in prison with labour on charges of forging election documents, and barred him from standing in elections for the next five years, his lawyer Khaled Ali said. Tantawy was the most prominent politician to challenge President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as he sought a third term last year. Tantawy halted his campaign saying state-linked groups had impeded him from gathering the required number of public endorsements to register as a candidate, and that dozens of his family members and allies had been arrested. Authorities denied foul play, and charged him with violations linked to his campaign's move to distribute their own copies of endorsement forms. Tantawy was found guilty of the charges in a lower court in February and given a suspended sentence that was upheld by on Monday. He was detained in court and transferred to a correctional facility, joining more than 20 members of his campaign who were also sentenced in the case, Ali said. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 20,000 Egyptian pounds ($424) and barred from running in local, parliamentary or presidential elections for five years. \"This is a political liquidation and a targeting of the person of Ahmed Tantawy,\" Rasha Qandeel, Tantawy's wife and spokesperson for his political movement, told Reuters. Ali said Tantawy had the right to appeal but that it could take up to two months to launch the appeal process. Sisi was declared winner of the December election with just under 90% of votes cast, securing a third term that runs to 2030. Rights groups estimate that tens of thousands of people have been jailed for political dissent under Sisi. Egyptian officials have denied holding political prisoners. REUTERS",

        "content": "looked happy as he celebrated his beloved league and cup win with a 'champions' cake. The Hoops-daft rocker was pictured with his wife Penny Lancaster in a dark green suit with white shirt as Penny holds the cake. Written on the cake is \"Congratulations. Celtic Champions 23/34.\" Brendan Rodgers' team lifted yet another trophy on Saturday May 25 following a 1-0 victory at . Celtic went head-to-head with rivals Rangers in a battle to secure the Scottish Cup. However, with an opening Old Firm goal from Abdallah Sima ruled out following a VAR check - the Hoops land their 13th League and Cup double with a last-gasp goal from substitute Adam Idah. This is the first time in 22 years that Celtic have beaten Rangers in a Scottish Cup final. Rod was pictured at Hampden for the game on Saturday. It comes after the Maggie May singer had a few X-rated words to say to football pundit Simon Jordan, earlier this month. The singer is a strong backer of the Scottish game, unlike talkSPORT's Jordan, who has made his views on the game north of the border clear on more than one occasion, the reports. However, this time the rocker had enough and took to his Instagram stories to take aim at the former Crystal Palace chief. He's warned him to back off and 'Shut the f*** up' over his views on Scottish football and made it clear he is sick and tired of the constant disrespect fired towards our clubs north or the border - not just Celtic. Writing on his Instagram stories to his 1.4million followers, Sir Rod said: \"I'm absolutely sick and tired of constant deriding and disrespect of Scottish Football shown down south. Especially by one Mr Simon 'motor mouth' Jordan [who I'm sure has had elocution lessons in the past]. \"It's our game, we know it's not the EPL or La Liga but it's our game and I love it. So back off Mr Jordan, and by the way, what did you achieve at Crystal Palace? With all due respect to Palace of course. \"One thing Graeme Souness quite rightly pointed out the other day on talkSPORT was if Celtic or Rangers were in the Championship with the money that's dished out by Sky etc it would only be a couple of years and we would be able to compete, no doubt about that. So shut the f*** up Jordan, and leave Scottish football alone.\"",

        "content": "BAKU (Reuters) - Azerbaijan wants to borrow $5 billion from international credit institutions in the coming years for large infrastructure projects, including in territories secured in a lightning military offensive in September, the finance minister told Reuters. Azerbaijani forces took control of the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where ethnic Armenians had enjoyed de facto independence for decades, prompting at least 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee. \"Very big tasks stand before us,\" Finance Minister Samir Sharifov said in an interview. He said the tasks in question were linked with the reconstruction and restoration of land now under Azerbaijan's control, something that would also boost the country's economic growth. Peace talks between Baku and Yerevan are ongoing, with the two sides continuing negotiations on the demarcation of their 1,000 km (620 mile) border, which remains closed and heavily militarised. \"There are a number of large projects in the transport infrastructure field, that could be financed through attracting borrowed resources,\" Sharifov said. \"Overall, we are talking about additional borrowing of $5 billion.\" Azerbaijan's public debt stood at $6.1 billion at the start of 2024. Sharifov said Baku would repay $1.4 billion of this by the end of the year and then ultimately plans to increase public debt to $10 billion. \"We will not issue Eurobonds. Most likely it will be project financing,\" Sharifov said, listing the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank among the possible sources of funds. He said the financing would likely come over the course of four to five years. (Reporting by Nailia Bagirova; Writing by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Mark Potter)",

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: As the sizzling weather continues to taking its toll on the people, health experts have called for taking steps to avoid skin ailments during the current weather conditions. Harsh ultraviolet rays and the increasing humidity can lead to a lot of sweating, which in turn results in skin ailments like skin burns and infections, as per the experts. Talking to PTV News on Monday, a renowned skin specialist Dr Mubashir Mushtaq Daha said that skin allergies and heat rashes are most common during the scorching months when the mercury shoots up, adding, that sunburn can increase the chance of skin cancer. However, citizens should protect their skin from harmful rays all year round, but especially in the extra-sunny days of summer, he added. The specialist further explained that the sun and heat can dry out your skin. Dry skin in the summer can occur due to a variety of factors, such as excessive sun exposure, hot showers, and not drinking enough water. The cases of fungal infection are at their peak this summer. The cases are common in all age groups, mostly in the moving population from one city to another, he added. Aloe vera and rose water can soothe the skin, so people can apply them to the skin to bring relief from itching, he advised. Citizens should wear lightweight and breathable fabrics like cotton or linen which allow human skin to breathe and prevent the build-up of moisture. Wearing tight clothes can cause more sweating which creates an ideal environment for growth, increasing the susceptibility to infection, he warned. Insects become more active during the summer, and their stings or bites can cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Bee stings, ant bites, and mosquito bites are common triggers. These reactions can vary from mild redness to severe swelling, Dr Khurram Mushir, another skin specialist added. Seasonal allergies can also affect the skin, especially during the high pollen season. Allergic individuals may experience contact dermatitis. The typical symptom is an itchy rash after contact or indirect exposure to plants or grasses, he mentioned. Additionally, keep in mind that home remedies provide soothing relief for mild reactions, but for severe symptoms, it is best to seek medical attention, the expert added.",

        "content": "If anyone can bring back the bowl haircut, it’s him. Irish star Paul Mescal is reportedly being eyed up to play one of the four Beatles in an upcoming biopic. Spectre director Sam Mendes will direct four separate feature films about each of the members of the Beatles, to be released in 2027. The films will be the first Beatles biopics to have full cooperation from Paul McCartney , Ringo Starr, and the families of John Lennon and George Harrison. The Hollywood Reporter noted that Mescal, who is set to reach a new level of stardom this summer with Gladiator 2, is “top of the list” for major studio roles, including one of the four roles in the upcoming biopics. “Every filmmaker loves Paul Mescal. But audiences don’t [yet] know who he is,” one film executive told the outlet. Paul Mescal eyed up to play one of the Beatles in upcoming biopic Mendes’ four movies will intersect to “tell the astonishing story of the greatest band in history,” leading up to their 1970 breakup. “I’m honoured to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,” the 1917 director said in a statement in Feburary. All four movies will come to cinemas in 2027, with the release strategy said to be “innovative and groundbreaking.” Mescal will definitely be one to watch for one of the roles, particularly after the release of the long-awaited Gladiator sequel this summer, which will mark his first fully-fledged studio film lead. The Kildare native has chosen to keep a distance from Hollywood following his breakout role in Normal People, starring in indie darlings Aftersun and All of Us Strangers. It’s also not the first time the Oscar nominee has been in consideration for a music biopic, with The Hollywood Reporter also stating that he was up for the role of Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming Deliver Me from Nowhere. That role eventually went to The Bear star Jeremy Allen White. Read more: LISTEN: You Must Be Jokin’ with Aideen McQueen – Faith healers, Coolock craic and Gigging as Gaeilge",

        "content": "“Tech bros” such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are “the largest dictators”, Maria Ressa, who won the Nobel peace prize last year for her defence of media freedom, has said. The American-Filipina journalist has spent a number of years fighting charges filed during then president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte’s administration, but said Duterte “is a far smaller dictator compared to Mark Zuckerberg, and now let me throw in Elon Musk”. Speaking at the Hay literary festival in Powys, Ressa said Zuckerberg and Musk have “proven that we all, regardless of culture, language, or geography, have far more in common than we have differences because we’re all being manipulated the same way”. Social media platforms have the ability to “change the way we feel”, she said, which in turn “changes the way we see the world and changes the way we act”. Ressa said conversations about identity politics online have caused similar instances of polarisation across the world. These debates encourage “the kinds of questions that we think are our free will” – but they are not, Ressa said. “In the Philippines , it was rich versus poor. In the United States, it’s race,” she said. “Black Lives Matter ... was bombarded on both sides by Russian propaganda. And the goal was not to make people believe one thing. The goal was to burst this wide open to create chaos.” How to Stand Up to a Dictator by Maria Ressa review – tales of a moral giant Read more The way tech companies are “inciting polarisation, inciting fear and anger and hatred” changes us “at a personal level, a societal level”, she said. She suggested two ways to lessen the control tech companies have over us. Firstly, she said, the US should get rid of section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, “which is what gives these companies impunity”. The section protects internet companies from lawsuits over content posted by their users. “And the other one is, if you have kids, don’t let them on [social media] until they’re old enough,” she said, because it is “mildly addictive”. While she thinks attempts to ban Chinese-owned TikTok in the US and Italy are “great”, it “isn’t just TikTok” we should be worried about, but all social media – and the internet as a whole. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She urged the audience at Hay to “walk into the real world” and organise with their families and friends, “because the information operations target you.

        "content": "Comments READ LATER This refers to ‘Saying no to plastic with bioplastic’ (May 27). Restrictions on the usage of Single Use Plastic (SUP) are all in papers. Few seizures of bulk quantities of raw materials for manufacturing SUP are made here and there, fines imposed but there is noa active follow-up. The quantity of 17.5 lakh tonnes of SUP forming part of 50 per cent of total plastic waste is alarming. Compared to NIOT Chennai’s attempt of using prawn waste and the seaweed based bioplastic as a substitute for the plastic, the experiments of the start up unit of Ukhi India in producing biodegradable and compostable polymer granules with agricultural waste including rice husk, pine needles, nettle and hemp is amazing. RV Baskaran Chennai With reference to the Editorial ‘Knotty rules’ (May 27), SEBI’s investor protection initiative to monitor the exorbitant stock volatility in top 100 listed companies is a good move to shield the investors from market rumours. Though the scheme in fairness largely protects the investment ecosystem, it is also fraught with many challenges, since the ambiguous rules framed, omits to include the unregulated social media influencers, related parties of the companies etc. in the rumour monger list. The new price determination framework would be much more effective with extended scope and simplified rules, to instill high investor confidence. Sitaram Popuri Bengaluru This refers to the ‘Liquidity tight as Centre’s cash balances pile up’ (May 27). The reverse flow of cash into the economy is crucial to easing liquidity in the banking space to help banks cope with the growing demand for credit. Mobilising low-cost deposits is not easy with savers opting for financial assets with attractive in returns. Though banks gain from growing credit demand, using certificate of deposits to mop up funds is uneconomical. The RBI must look to conduct more variable reverse repo operations to enable lenders to have funds at competitive rates to meet the rising demand for credit. VSK Pillai Changanacherry The lead news item reporting lesser voter turnout is really worrisome. That Kerala also figures in low turnout list is cause for concern. Of all the likely causes narrated, “a general sense of electoral apathy” is a pointer to the abysmal standards our politics has fallen to. The absence of merit in candidate choice, the repeat candidature of incumbents, lack of issue-based campaigning lead to voter fatigue. The lack of propriety and decorum from leaders while campaigning is also a worrying factor. A true democracy needs sensible, issue based campaigning, accountability from the elected representatives, strict adherence to code of conduct and a vigilant, non partisan oversight of the election system.

The goal is to improve the country's telecoms sector through 5G tech solutions.The post Asia’s richest man set to invest in Ghana’s telecom market by offering 5G tech solutions appeared first on Nairametrics.",
        "content": "The richest man in Asia, Mukesh Ambani, with a net worth of $92 billion has set his eyes on the African market by moving to invest in Ghana’s telecom market. The move includes a partnership with an indigenous Ghanaian telecom project to improve telecommunications in the country through 5G tech solutions. Radisys Corp., a subsidiary of Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd will enter a partnership with Ghana’s Next-Gen InfraCo (NGIC) where Ambani’s Radisys Corp will supply NGIC with essential network infrastructure, applications, and smartphones a Bloomberg report stated. Related Stories Australian firm developing Ghana’s first lithium mine debuts on Ghana stock exchange Ghana to become Africa’s first blockchain-powered government -VP Bawumi The executive director of NGIC, Harkirit Singh made the development public ahead of the NGIC launch announcement scheduled to be held today in Mumbai which serves as India’s financial hub. NGIC aims to offer 5G broadband services to Ghanaian phone users and internet service providers and is hoping to start operations by the end of this year. Mr. Singh outlined the company’s goal and mission and how it aligns with what it hopes to achieve in Ghana. “The company is based on a premise of building affordable digital services in emerging markets, ” said Singh. Ghana, a country of 33 million people is an emerging market in Africa and as of today has three major telecom operators which include MTN Ghana, Vodafone Ghana, and AirtelTigo which is run by the state. Mr. Singh explained that NGIC is positioned to build broadband services at scale due to its strategic partners, possession of Ghana’s only 5G license, and technological know-how. NGIC is partly owned by two African telecom firms that hold a combined 55% stake in the company. They include Ascend Digital Solutions Ltd. and K-NET Mr. Singh explained. The Ghanaian government has a stake of 10% in NGIC and the rest of the shares are owned by private players and local mobile operators. Mukesh Ambani’s Radisys Corp entering a partnership with Ghana-based NGIC is a strategic business move to grow Indian influence in the African continent and checkmate Chinese near-monopoly at the moment. Nigeria remains the largest telecoms market in Africa with a 7% year-on-year growth rate and could make use of such private investments to stir competition in the country’s telecom space and increase value for end users. Radisys Corp is a subsidiary of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries. Reliance Industries is the largest private-sector company in India. It is involved in the oil refining, petrochemical, gas, retail, textile businesses, and now Telecommunications business. Ghana’s NGIC entering a partnership with Radisys Corp has secured exclusive rights to offer 5G services in Ghana for up to a decade, with license extending to up to 15 years. The Nigerian Telecommunication sector is rife with poor internet services despite claiming to be 5G making users opt for fresh alternatives like Elon Musk’s Starlink and indigenous Internet service providers like FibreOne",

Mike Morgan, 51, was feeding his cattle from a trailer when he was struck and died on the scene despite life-saving efforts, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office said. The lightning bolt struck on wide open pasture outside the town of Rand, about 80 miles northwest of Denver, said George Crocket, the county coroner. The strike also bowled over around 100 head of cattle that had bunched around the trailer loaded with hay, said Crocket. “All but the 34 got up,” he said. Morgan’s father-in-law and wife were nearby but survived the blast, said Crocket. The incident stunned the small, tightknit community where most everybody knows everybody, Crockett said.",

        "content": "teammates Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes while attending the Dallas Mavericks' NBA Western Conference Finals Game 3 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Mavericks over the Timberwolves with a 116-107 win inside American Airlines Center with the reigning Super Bowl champions in attendance. , 34, the boyfriend of superstar singer Taylor Swift, was shown on the big screen first and was resoundingly booed in Dallas. and his wife Brittany were up next and the couple were cheered, most likely due to both being Texas natives. The couple were high school sweethearts and Mahomes is a Texas Tech legend, due to his exploits in college football before his 10th overall selection by the Chiefs in 2017. The quarterback, a three-time Super Bowl winner, three-time Super Bowl MVP, and two-time NFL MVP, then rose to his feet to interact with the crowd. \"Get out of my arena,\" Mahomes also joked to Kelce 24 hours prior as he attended the Dallas Stars' clash with the Edmonton Oilers in the NHL Conference Finals. The trend of the NBA Finals is looking likely to see the Mavs take on the Boston Celtics, who lead the Indiana Pacers 3-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals. But with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving in seemingly unbeatable form, Dallas will fancy their chances at scooping the franchise's first NBA Championship since 2011. Doncic and Irving on the night as the future face of the league, Anthony Edwards, struggled to claw the Timberwolves back into the series, despite putting up 26 points, including a sensational dunk in the third quarter. After the game, Kelce got friendly with Mavs stars, greeting Doncic as the Slovenian headed back to the Mavericks' locker room. \"Atmosphere was crazy tonight! [fire emojis] Go @dallasmavs!!!!!!\" Mahomes tweeted, reacting to the barnstorming win. Should Dallas scoop an NBA Championship, which would be Doncic's first, it could provide further motivation to Kelce, Mahomes, and the Chiefs to retain their NFL title for a record-breaking third season in a row. A three-peat of Super Bowls has never been achieved in the NFL's history, and the Chiefs pushed themselves within one more glittering season of reaching the feat following an overtime win against the San Francisco 49ers at Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas. \"Next year in New Orleans, we're gonna do it again,\" Mahomes said on the \"Impaulsive with Logan Paul\" podcast. \"I'm putting it on the table. We're gonna do it again. I'm telling you now.\" Kelce also inked a new two-year contract extension with the Chiefs this offseason worth a whopping $34.25 million. The tight end will play in the NFL for at least another two seasons - but he won't be facing his older brother Jason Kelce again after the iconic Philadelphia Eagles center retired.",

        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Closer to Joker launch Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League made the decision to delay both the launch of its first season of content, and to break that season up into two separate episodes with content releasing in two batches. About two months ago, we saw the release of The Joker as a new squad member in Episode 1, and now in Episode 2, we have new content and a big new, admittedly very good patch. Did it draw players back in? Well... The Joker season had a peak of 3,049 concurrent Steam players at launch, a not ideal return of 22% of the 13,549 peak players it saw at launch (which was still a poor total initially). But episode 2? It appears to have peaked at 561 players as of yesterday. That is 18% of that Joker debut, and just 4% of launch numbers. With many games this may not matter, but as a live service that needs players to keep coming back, it’s extremely bad. Suicide Squad I maintain that it’s hard to see Suicide Squad committing to getting out an entire year of content at this pace. They have three more planned seasons with actual content made already, at least to some extent, but the trendline is clear, and characters like a gender-flipped Mrs. Freeze and Deadshot’s daughter are going to be way less of a draw than Joker was. And he wasn’t much of a draw at baseline. Some remaining players are holding out hope for Deathstroke, but there’s essentially no chance arrives any soon than six months from now, if not longer, and it does not seem like a guarantee the game will even be around that long. The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1,000: Boost Your Games For Less Fortunately, at least for now, it does not seem like Rocksteady has suffered any publicly announced layoffs from this whole situation in an industry where that has become all too common from both performing and under-performing studios. I’m fully of the belief that they should be given another chance to go back to what they were known for, great single-player superhero adventures, but that does not seem to align with WB’s current goals, despite the failure of Suicide Squad and the huge success of the single-player Hogwarts Legacy. WB has tripled down and said they’re committing to more live services. And hey, maybe that means an extended Suicide Squad run after all. For some reason. As we march forward, I would be amazed if Suicide Squad got even half the players of the Joker’s debut for season 2’s Mrs. Freeze, a character whose design has already been leaked and critiqued by players. And in terms of monetization, all this seasonal content is free, and the game is only making money from cosmetics. Cosmetics which have been obscenely poor since launch despite so much comic source material to choose from. Everything about this entire enterprise remains bizarre.

The hat is worn during the Grammy winner's performance of her track, \" ,\" the fourth single to be released from the album. 📲| Taylor Swift giving a fan the \"22\" hat tonight — The Swift Society (@TheSwiftSociety) During each Eras tour show, Swift walks up to a fan waiting at the end of the stage and gifts them the hat. In a video of Friday's gig, Swift trots up to a young fan belting out the lyrics After giving the girl a hug, Swift hands her the coveted trilby, causing the fan to burst into happy tears.

        "content": "New Delhi: A court here on Monday dismissed the bail plea of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's close aide Bibhav Kumar who is accused of assaulting AAP MP Swati Maliwal at the CM's residence. Additional Sessions Judge Sushil Anuj Tyagi of Tiz Hazari court rejected the bail plea of Kumar, a personal assistant of the CM, after hearing arguments from both sides. A detailed order on the matter is awaited. During the proceedings, Rajya Sabha MP Maliwal told the court that there was a threat to her life and “grave danger” to her family if Kumar was released. She claimed that a “one-sided video” about the incident \"was made by a YouTuber\", following which she started receiving the threats. A couple of videos from the chief minister's residence from the day of the incident on May 13 have surfaced on social media, one showed Maliwal having an argument with security personnel, while the other showed her walking out of the CM's residence in the Civil Lines. Maliwal's advocate said that despite the fact that Kumar was in jail, Maliwal was receiving threats. He questioned Kumar's innocence, alleging that Kumar had formatted his phone and deleted the CCTV footage of the incident. Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Srivastava said that Maliwal did not trespass the CM's residence. He also said that Kumar was an “influential” person despite the termination of his services. Kumar's counsel sought bail, saying his client fulfilled the “triple test” for bail -- he was not a flight risk, nor is likely to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. Claiming that Kumar was arrested despite cooperating with the police, Kumar's counsel said that the FIR in the case was registered after a delay of three days as an “afterthought.” Kumar was sent to four days of judicial custody on Saturday and is expected to be produced in the court on Tuesday. His anticipatory bail plea filed on May 18 was observed as becoming “infructuous” by the court after his arrest. PTI",

        "content": "NEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump, at his rally this week in the Bronx, invited two rappers on stage who have been charged in a sweeping gang case, with one of them facing attempted murder charges. Michael Williams, better known as Sheff G, is a 25-year-old rapper whose songs and videos have millions of YouTube views and Spotify streams. He's also a central figure in the gang case unveiled by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez over a year ago, while he was serving a separate attempted weapons possession sentence. Tegan Chambers, 24, who raps as Sleepy Hallow, has close to 11 million monthly listeners on Spotify. He faces conspiracy charges in the gang case. Both he and Sheff G have pleaded not guilty. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee's appearance with suspected gang members comes as Trump is on trial himself in his New York hush money case and as he recurringly slams New York and other Democrat-run cities as crime-ridden. Trump has railed against the Manhattan district attorney who is prosecuting him for “letting violent crime run rampant all over our city.\" Challenging the reelection of President Joe Biden, Trump is trying to make inroads with Black Americans, who are traditionally supportive of the Democratic Party. AP VoteCast found Trump won just 8% of Black voters nationwide in 2020 versus 91% who voted for Biden. He has claimed that his criminal indictments have boosted his support among Black voters, comparing his legal challenges to anti-Black prejudice in the U.S. legal system. At a rally on the Jersey Shore earlier this month, Trump was joined on stage by NFL Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who pleaded guilty in New York in 2011 to misdemeanor criminal charges of sexual misconduct and is a registered sex offender. Taylor said he had always been a Democrat until he met Trump. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat who represents the Bronx in Congress, said it is an offensive strategy for Trump to associate with people who are accused of violent crimes in order to appeal to Black voters. “The conflation of communities of color with criminality is a racist trope that Donald Trump repeats,” said Torres, who is Black. Images captured on Thursday show Sheff G walking into the park where the rally took place with cameras following him as teenage boys seem visibly excited at spotting the rapper. One of them said, “Oh my God. It's Sheff G.” Toward the end of his speech on Thursday, Trump asked his supporters, “Does everybody know Sheff G? Where is Sheff G?” before also introducing Sleepy Hallow. “President Trump, my man,” Sheff G was heard saying before Trump gestured to him to approach the microphone. “One thing I want to say: They are always going to whisper your accomplishments and shout your failures. Trump is going to shout the wins for all of us,\" Sheff G told the crowd before Sleepy Hallow moved to the microphone to utter Trump's slogan “Make America Great Again.” A spokesman for Trump’s campaign was asked about whether the campaign knew about the charges and whether it was the former president who sought the rappers’ support or the other way around. “As Sheff G said: ‘They always whisper your accomplishments and shout your failures.’” campaign spokesman Steven Cheung responded in an email. A spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for Trump and secures his rallies, did not respond to a request for comment about Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow's appearance on stage. Trump called other speakers to the stage Thursday, including Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and the Rev. Ruben Diaz Sr., a former Democratic city council member in New York and state senator. Both Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow are due back in court next month. Sheff G’s attorney, Arthur Aidala, said Friday that “intense litigation” was ongoing and “we’re cautiously optimistic that Mr. Williams will be exonerated.” A message seeking comment on the case was left with Sleepy Hallow’s attorney. After being paroled in his weapons case in June 2023, Sheff G was held on the new charges until last month, when a judge set bail at $1.5 million cash. Sleepy Hallow was released on $200,000 bail in May 2023. Prosecutors say Sheff G’s money fueled and rewarded multiple shootings as members of the 8 Trey Crips and affiliated 9 Ways gangs affiliates battled foes. He treated Sleepy Hallow and others to a steak dinner to celebrate an October 2020 shooting that killed a purported member of a rival gang and injured five others, prosecutors say. “It is how, in part, Sheff G and Tegan Chambers — Sleepy Hallow — assert influence, right? Because they take people out, and they’re able to spend money, and they’re able to encourage others to do some of the gang violence that’s just critically important to them and their status in the community,” Gonzalez said at a May 2023 news conference with New York Mayor Eric Adams. Both are Democrats. Prosecutors have said they have surveillance video, text messages, social media posts, cell phone data and more to back up the allegations. While Gonzalez has noted that the rappers’ songs refer to gang retaliation and some of their rivals, he has said the lyrics weren’t used as evidence. Prosecutors also say Sheff G chauffeured three co-defendants to and from an April 2021 shooting that targeted a gang rival but instead hit two bystanders. The DA’s office declined to comment Friday on the case. Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.",

        "content": "The Conservatives have admitted mistakenly sending out an email which reportedly accused MPs and ministers of failing to \"get behind\" the party's election campaign. Staff at Tory headquarters accused some MPs of focusing too much on ministerial business and said some were refusing to knock on doors or were away on holiday, The Times reported. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior figure in the campaign, the newspaper said. Politics live: Sunak defends 'bold' national service policy Responding, a Conservative Party spokesperson said: \"The email was sent in error and immediately recalled. Those who received it have been contacted with an apology\". Party sources said not all of the information in the memo related to general election campaigning, as parts of the document detailed past concerns. Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Rishi Sunak has experienced several setbacks in the first few days of the campaign, including getting drenched in Downing Street while announcing the election and asking voters in Wales whether they were looking forward to the Euro football tournament when their country's team had not qualified. National service: What's the actual Tory plan and would there be exemptions? Sunak's Number 10 is much better at keeping secrets than others Rishi Sunak says he will bring back National Service if Tories win general election Some of the concerns detailed by the Times include a reference to the Plymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer, where an issue with \"MP cooperation\" was noted. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Sarah Atherton, the MP for Wrexham, was accused of \"refusing to engage\" with a note saying she \"wants to cancel this week's campaigning sessions\". Sky News has contacted both MPs for comment. A Liberal Democrat source said: \"This embarrassing leaked memo shows even Conservative MPs are refusing to get behind Rishi Sunak's botched campaign\".",

        "description": "Israel faces new condemnation over strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials say killed at least 45 Palestinians.",
        "content": "Israel faced new condemnation Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world's top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war's deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. \"We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. \"We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.\" The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was \"outraged\" by the violence. \"These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,\" President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. In a separate development, Egypt's military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas' last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. \"Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,\" he told Italy's SKY TG24 news channel. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could \"complicate\" talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas' demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a \"new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.\" Jordan's Foreign Ministry called it a \"war crime.\" The Israeli military's top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur \"in a war of such scope and intensity.\" Speaking to an Israeli lawyers' conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of \"violence, property crimes and looting\" were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Delhi recorded its highest maximum temperature on Sunday (File) The national capital stayed under the grip of searing heat as maximum temperatures in parts of the city crossed 48 degrees Celsius on Monday with no respite from the heatwave condition in sight for the next few days. The Safdarjung observatory, considered the official marker of the city, recorded its second-highest maximum temperature of the season at 45.1 degrees Celsius, 4.7 notches above the normal, while the minimum was 29.2 degrees Celsius. The Palam observatory recorded a high of 46 degrees Celsius, five notches above normal. Delhi recorded its highest maximum temperature on Sunday with the mercury searing to 45.4 degrees Celsius, marking the first heatwave day in the city. On Monday, Najafgarh in southwest Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 48.6 degrees Celsius, eight notches above the normal while the minimum settled at 31.4 degrees Celsius, five degrees above the season's average. The Mungeshpur weather station recorded a high of 48.8 degrees Celsius, eight notches above the normal. It recorded a minimum temperature of 27.6 degrees Celsius, a notch above the season's average. Kuldeep Srivastava, the regional head of IMD said Najafgarh and Mungeshpur recorded such high temperatures since these were on the outskirts of the city. \"The second reason is wind direction. When wind blows from the west, it affects those areas first. As they are on the outskirts, temperatures rise rapidly,\" he said. Srivastava said heatwave in the city will persist for the next few days. According to the weather department, maximum temperatures in Delhi this week will range between 44 degrees Celsius and 48 degrees Celsius. The city was on red alert on Monday and will remain so for the next three days, it said. In 2023, Delhi did not have a single day of heat wave during May whereas in 2022, there were four heatwave days.

Karembeu, who is Kanak, grew up on the island of Lifou in New Caledonia. After moving to France as a teenager, he went on to win two Champions League titles with Madrid as a midfielder. He started for France in the 1998 World Cup final and was also part of the team that won the 2000 European Championship. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon’s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after the Second World War, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Karembeu’s great-grandparents were shipped to Paris in 1931 from the French Pacific territory and exhibited as “cannibals”.",

        "content": "Jesse Marsch’s first Canada selection for high-profile June friendlies against the Netherlands and France shows while you can change the coach, the talent at your disposal remains the same. Marsch’s 26-man roster contains 20 of the 23 players called up by interim coach Mauro Biello for Canada’s last outing — a 2-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in a Copa America playoff March 23 in Frisco, Texas. The three players who have not carried over to Marsch’s squad are 22-year-old goalkeeper Jonathan Sirois and 28-year-old defender Joel Waterman (both of CF Montreal) and 21-year-old forward Jacen Russell-Rowe (Columbus Crew). The additions are goalkeeper Thomas McGill, defenders Kyle Hiebert, Richie Laryea and Dominick Zator and midfielders Charles-Andreas Brym and Junior Hoilett. Laryea, a 48-cap veteran who missed the March game after undergoing hamstring surgery, is expected to return to action this week with Toronto FC. The 33-year-old Hoilett, who played most recently for Scotland’s Aberdeen, has already won 62 caps for Canada and captained the side. Other familiar names include Tajon Buchanan, Jonathan David, Alphonso Davies, Stephen Eustáquio, Alistair Johnston, Jonathan Osorio and Samuel Piette, among others. As with the March roster, there is no place for veteran goalkeeper Milan Borjan, defender Steven Vitoria, midfielder Mark-Anthony Kaye and forward Lucas Cavallini. Goalkeeper Grégoire Swiderski, who plays for Girondins de Bordeaux’s B team in France, will join the Canadian camp as a training player. “I am extremely excited to get these players into camp together,” Marsch said in a statement. “I have had many discussions with the players over the last weeks and it is clear that we have an exceptional group of men playing for this country. “Now the work gets started for us all to come together to become the team that we know this country deserves.” Marsch was named Canada coach on May 13. The 50-year-old American’s coaching resume includes Leeds United, RB Leipzig, Red Bull Salzburg, New York Red Bulls and the Montreal Impact (now CF Montreal). His last job was at Leeds, which fired him in February 2023 after a year in charge. Biello, an assistant coach, had been in charge since John Herdman stepped down last August to take over Toronto FC. Canada, ranked 49th in the world, plays the seventh-ranked Netherlands on June 6 in Rotterdam and No. 2 France on June 9 in Bordeaux. The Canadian players are due to gather in Rotterdam on June 3. The fixtures mark Canada’s highest-ranked opponents since the 2022 World Cup when the Canadian men lost 1-0 to second-ranked Belgium. The games are preparation for Canada’s campaign at Copa America, where it will face top-ranked and World Cup champion Argentina, No. 32 Peru and No. 42 Chile in Group A play. Canada is one of six CONCACAF guest teams at the 16-team tournament that runs June 20 to July 14 across the U.S. The Netherlands and France are prepping for Euro 2024, which kicks off June 14 in Germany. The Dutch and French have been drawn in Group D with No. 28 Poland and No. 25 Austria. The Canada roster draws on 10 players from Major League Soccer including CF Montreal’s Mathieu Choiniere and Piette and Toronto’s Osorio. The rest play in Europe. Canada has played the Netherlands just once before, with the Dutch winning 3-0 at Toronto’s Varsity Stadium in June 1994 in the run-up to the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the U.S. Frank Rijkaard, Marc Overmars and Dennis Bergman scored that day. The Dutch went on to make the ’94 World Cup quarterfinals, losing to eventual champion Brazil. The Dutch have qualified for 11 editions of the FIFA World Cup, finishing as runner-up in 1974 (to West Germany), 1978 (Argentina) and 2010 (to Spain). They made it to the quarterfinals in 2022 in Qatar, losing to Argentina in a penalty shootout The Canadian men have faced France just once before, in their first-ever game at the FIFA World Cup in 1986 in Mexico. A star-studded French side needed a 79th-minute goal by Jean-Pierre Papin to win 1-0. France won the World Cup in 1998 and 2018 and finished runner-up in 2006 and 2022 in 16 tournament appearances. Canada was forced into the March Copa America playoff by losing — on the away goals rule — to Jamaica after their two-legged CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal finished tied at 4-4 in November. Canada Soccer says Marsch is set to finalize the rest of his team staff this week.

        "description": "Adedeji's principles of taxation anticipate economic boom, and discourage tax hikes in times of economic depression.The post Zacch Adedeji’s Principles Of Taxation: A Pathway To Nigeria’s Economic Growth first appeared on Prompt News.",
        "content": "Since the assumption of , Ph.D to office as the Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), I have followed keenly his enunciation of his principles of taxation, which, to my mind, can translate to a pathway to Nigeria’s economic growth. To be sure, Adedeji’s principles of taxation embody some of the normative principles of taxation which are certainty, flexibility, equity, simplicity, and utmost good faith. At every given forum, Adedeji does not fail to reify his wholesome principles of taxation. He is wont to say that, “we will tax the fruit, not the seed; we will prosperity, not poverty”.These are statements of certainty, and equity, which are altogether refreshing and reassuring. The reassurance in his statements is underlined by his insistence that his tax principles are focused on encouraging taxpayers to grow their investments or income so that they can yield enough taxable dividends or profits. In his most philosophical best, he icompares taxpayers to gardeners and the taxman as one who waters the garden. He says it is the duty of the government to create a conducive environment for taxpayers and their businesses to thrive in the hope that once they have a fulsome yield, they will gladly pay their taxes. That is why he says the taxman is not aiming to tax poverty but prosperity. Adedeji’s principles of taxation anticipate economic boom, and discourage tax hikes in times of economic depression. The flexibility principle provides that the amount of tax charged should not be the same all year round; and, that tax rates should be lowered for other social benefits during economic boom, while during economic depression tax rates may be raised to raise maximum funds for developmental projects. Adedeji’s taxation principle does not support tax hikes that will become a burden on the taxpayers or the citizenry. Thus, it is obvious that Adedeji’s taxation principle takes cognizance of the fact that taxation is the lifebuoy of the economy, it is the fecund source of economic development. It follows then that when taxes are collected and properly utilized in grooming businesses, empowering citizens through access to low interest loans and grants, diversification of business activities like the creation of value chains, and provision of critical social amenities, there will be enough income in the pool to tax. In other words, there will be enough fruit from which to pick. Recently, the Federal Government took the right step in the right direction by establishing the Consumer Credit Scheme which guarantees access to loans facility for the citizenry to grow their business activities. The logic here is that once there is a boom in economic activities in the informal sector of the economy, there will be a corresponding widening of the tax net without complaint from the tax paying community. It is this veritable connection between taxation and economic growth that Adedeji’s principles of taxation seek to highlight, making them the pathway to Nigeria’s economic growth. In concrete terms, Adedeji’s unwavering commitment to expounding his taxation principles has already raked in more than Three Trillion naira in tax revenue in the first quarter of 2024 for the three tiers of government in aid of the execution of the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. In addition to raising this much revenue, Adedeji has also reorganised the structure of the Service to reflect his taxation principle of customer-centricity. He believes that taxpayers should form the focal point of the operations of the Service, and that regard, they be treated with due diligence. Presently, the Service is structured based on the category of taxpayers: Large Taxpayers Group, Medium Taxpayers Group, and Small Taxpayers Group; as well as five other services groups, viz, Corporate Services Group, People Services Group, Support Services Group, Compliance and Enforcement Support Group, and the Special Duties. This taxpayers-based operational categorisation is purposely to simplify tax payment processes, which is made moreso by the introduction of the various automation platforms. And so, it is always both refreshing and reassuring to listen to Adedeji marshals his thoughts around the issue of making taxation the pivot of national development. He often couches his statements in literal parallelism, metaphor and humour. This rare sagely gift sets him apart as a conscientious taxman. Beneath his jocular mien lies a determination to set Nigeria’s fiscal trajectory and tax system on the pathway of sustainable economic growth.",

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A group of investors will put up $6 billion to fund development of artificial intelligence by Elon Musk’s xAI. The company said on its website Sunday that the Series B funding round will be used to take xAI’s first products to market and speed up research. xAI said it has made “significant strides” during the past year in developing the technology, which will continue in the coming months.

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea's state media said a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded in mid-air on Monday. State media said the explosion was possibly caused by engine failure. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: North Korea launched a rocket likely carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night, hours after its announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center in the northeast at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket” during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea's state media said a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded in mid-air on Monday. State media said the explosion was possibly caused by engine failure. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: North Korea launched a rocket likely carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night, hours after its announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center in the northeast at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket” during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

        "content": "There has been a lot of concern lately among us flag folk about the fact that Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. has been flying various standards. “He is putting the vex in vexillology,” we have said to one another. “But not the lol.” (We vexillologists have few pleasures in life and making such simple jokes is one of them.) Alito and his family’s flag-flying has raised lots of questions, such as, “Should he recuse himself from cases involving punishments for the other people who enjoy flying flags the same way?” and “What is the Appeal to Heaven flag?” Fortunately, I have the answers. Below is a simple guide to the meaning of what your Supreme Court justice happens to be flying over their home at any given moment: U.S. flag, right side up: This is a Supreme Court justice who has a flag at his house. U. S. flag, upside down: Like poor, put-upon Macbeth and Adam before him, the Supreme Court justice has been led astray by his wife. This is so often the reason a flag is wrongly hung: the frailty of Woman. U. S. flag, sideways: The justice purchased a defective flag whose misplaced grommets leave its politics unclear. Flag of Maryland: The justice lives in the Washington suburb of Chevy Chase. Flag of Virginia: The justice wants an excuse to fly a visible breast over his house. Yellow flag: The justice has committed a penalty. Red flag: The justice wants to date me. Blue flag: The justice loves France but only one-third of it. Checkered flag: The justice has crossed the finish line! Rainbow flag: The justice promises not to destroy the Earth *by flood.* Swiss flag: The justice loves to add. Jolly Roger: Pirates have seized the justice’s house! Orange-white-and-green flag: The justice either loves the Ivory Coast or thinks the Irish election was rigged. Green-white-and-orange flag: The justice either loves Ireland or thinks the Ivorian election was rigged. Semaphore flags, drooping: These flags are not sending a message. Don’t Tread On Me flag: The justice is worried someone will step on his snake. Thin Blue Line flag: The justice’s wife loves the police. Trump 2024 flag: The justice’s ... wife ... loves Donald Trump. Confederate flag: The justice’s wife is out of control! Confederate flag, sideways: The justice’s wife purchased a defective flag with misplaced grommets. Politics remain clear. Union Jack: The justice thinks originalism is not enough and longs to return to monarchy. Habsburg flag: The justice longs to return to monarchy but believes the country would be best served by putting a member of the ancient House of Habsburg on the throne. Six flags, over a long period of time: The justice is pretending to be the state of Texas. Six flags, all at once: The justice is operating a theme park. Green flag: The justice was just kidding with all those other flags! Appeal to Heaven flag: The justice supports or is at the very least sympathetic to the campaign to elect Trump, to the 2021 attempt to overthrow the U.S. government and to efforts to remake the country as a Christian nationalist state. White flag: The justice is surrendering to demands that he recuse himself from Supreme Court cases regarding supporters of the Appeal to Heaven flag or has picked a new favorite thing about France.

        "content": "On Sunday, Saudi Arabia Dr Faisal Al-Mujfel as its first ambassador to Syria since relations were severed in 2012. This appointment comes after Saudi Arabia reopened its embassy in Syria earlier this year. The diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Syria initially deteriorated following the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, sparked by the crackdowns on popular protests. The war has since seen millions and catalyzed humanitarian and economic crises in Syria. Saudi Arabia, along with several other Arab nations, cut diplomatic relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government in 2012. In 2023, Saudi Arabia agreed to its embassy in Damascus as part of an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, whose strained relations have played out in the war in Syria. Syria was subsequently readmitted into the Arab League as part of a broader initiative by certain Arab countries to normalize relations with Assad’s regime. Normalization efforts have led to increased for Syrian refugees to return. Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch have also raised about the implications for accountability based on serious human rights violations committed by the Syrian government against citizens during the war.

        "content": "FOND DU LAC, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge has sentenced a man to almost 20 years in prison in connection with a 2016 firebombing incident. Online court records show Fond du Lac County Judge Anthony Nehls sentenced 26-year-old Elliot Schneider on Friday to 18 years behind bars on felony counts of being a party to property damage by means of explosive and reckless endangerment. Nehls also sentenced Schneider to three years in prison for bail jumping. That sentence will be served simultaneously with the firebombing sentence. Schneider recently started a separate 12-year prison sentence after he was convicted of child sexual assault in December. His firebombing and bail jumping time will begin after that sentence ends. Prosecutors accused Schneider of building a bomb and paying another man to plant it at the Fond du Lac home of a man whom Schneider believed had stolen money from him in a drug deal, WTMJ-TV reported . The bomb exploded in a mailbox, injuring one person. Assistant District Attorney Catherine Block told Nehls on Friday that the blast sent debris into the home’s living room and started a fire in another room. Schneider pleaded no contest to the firebombing charges, a legal maneuver in which a defendant doesn’t admit guilt but doesn’t fight charges in order to resolve the case. He told the judge on Friday that he wasn’t involved in the incident in any way. His attorney, Tsz-King Tse, said the incident happened when Schneider was 18 and he was a different person then.",

        "content": "SERENA Williams' childhood home looks doomed after her stepmom racked up $620,000 in debt on it - now creditors are demanding their money back . Lakeisha Graham’s desperate attempt to keep hold of the family home looks in vain - as her main creditor is demanding the sale to pay back her colossal debt . The property is worth $1.4 million and has been in the Williams family since 1995 when the tennis star’s father Richard purchased it with Serena’s mom Oracene for $355,000. But former stripper Lakeisha faked Richard’s signature on the title deeds to transfer the four-bedroom mansion in Palm Beach, Florida , into her name - and then took out a $279,000 loan from “hard lender” David Simon, which she blew on a failed trucking business. The debt at one point reached $620,000, including legal fees and interest, but Lakeisha has since then repaid some of it - and it’s now thought to be around half a million. She’s tried three times to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, and the last bid was thrown out when she failed to keep up with a repayment plan. Now Simon has sent a notice to the judge involved in his lawsuit, which states that the latest bankruptcy has failed. This means that Lakeisha will lose court protection - which stopped the property from being foreclosed - with Simon gaining most of the monies from the sale and the rest being split by more than 20 other creditors. But there is one sliver of hope - there’s currently nothing to stop her from immediately filing for Chapter 13 again, but this would add on more in legal and court costs. She’d also have to prove that her situation has changed and can afford to keep up with a repayment plan. If Lakeisha refiles, her automatic stay - protection from creditors - will only last 30 days. Yet increasing costs and more legal wrangling don’t seem to fear the 45-year-old, who is almost half the age of legendary tennis coach Richard, 81. \"King\" Richard , who’s suffered two strokes and dementia, filed for divorce after allegedly realizing that his house had been “stolen” - although that was recently dismissed from court, as speculation mounts whether the pair are back together. In Simon's deposition, he revealed Lakeisha approached him initially for a loan after seeing a “for sale\" sign on his $79,000 Volvo semi truck tractor. Simon testified he would only sell the truck to Lakeisha if he had property as collateral, which was in Richard's name, so Lakeisha allegedly transferred the deeds into her name by faking her husband's signature. She then borrowed further amounts. But the truck was repossessed by Simon in June 2018 after it split in half in Long Island City, 1,200 miles from their home, causing $30,000 damage. Photo credit: Getty Richard Williams has been keen to finalize his divorce from Lakeisha Graham for years but their case has dragged out amid a fight over their marital home. The couple married in 2010 when Lakeisha was 32 and Richard was 69. Williams is a hands-on father to their young son, Dylan, known as Junior, and has tried to maintain a good relationship with his ex despite the court case. May 2017 March 2020 February 2022 June 2022 July 2022 January 2023 August 2023 April 2024 The case, which has been ongoing since April 2017, revealed jaw-dropping allegations about Lakeisha and Richard’s tumultuous marriage. Court docs from Lakeisha’s deposition showed that she'd forged Richard's signature once before, so that she could sell his 1999 Bluebird Wanderlodge Motor Coach, worth $45,000, to buy food for herself and their son Dylan, now 8. \"Mainly, I was broke by my husband [who] did not help me. It was my son and I not getting any money, so I had to sell it so I can eat and my son can eat... we didn’t have anything,\" she said. She claimed to have no inkling that Richard wanted a divorce, saying they were living together as a married couple until May 2017 when he suddenly served her “dissolution papers.\" She reveals that on the day he filed the divorce petition, he even gave her a kiss and prayed with her in the morning. \"He just came and gave me a kiss actually that morning, the morning of — and he will always, would share with me to pray, you know, to always pray for our family and then he left with Chavoita,” she said in her deposition. In his divorce petition, Richard accused Lakeisha of stealing his social security checks and forging his signature to take ownership of numerous vehicles. Richard’s son Chavoita Lesane has threatened for the last year to file an elder abuse suit, which is yet to materialize. He told The U.S. Sun in an exclusive interview, \"I can't remember how long it was into the relationship as far as my dad starting to have financial headaches, like, 'What's going on with my social security checks?' \"Lakeisha took the Mercedes, she took the bus, she took money, what else was it? The motorcycle. \"There are so many things that she stole or forged documents for him. That's considered elder abuse. \"We're just putting all of it together, it's a lot. This whole situation has been frustrating.”",

Rangers suffered a 1-0 loss to their rivals at the Hampden Park on Saturday. Dessers was replaced in the 25th minute of the encounter due to injury. It was an agonising end to the season for the Gers, who also lost the Scottish Premiership title to Brendan Rodgers’ men. The Nigeria international said the Gers will use the defeat as a motivation to do better next season. “Everybody is devastated. We were close and we played a good game. It wasn’t an easy game and if you lose it that way in the end then obviously it hurts,” Dessers was quoted by Football Scotland. “It’s been a heavy season, that’s for sure in all kinds of ways. It’s easy to all go down now in energy and everyone needs to take a rest. But to see them celebrate today and 10 days ago gives me a lot of energy to go again this summer. ” It maybe seems weird to say now but I cannot wait for pre-season to start again and to do better than this season. I’m looking forward to that.” Related Topics: celtic Dessers rangers Don't Miss EPL: Romano reveals manager in advance talk to replace Pochettino at Chelsea You may like Rangers’ remaining games cup finals – Ilechukwu Europa League: Celtic boss Rodgers happy for Atalanta hero Lookman Dessers can be hero for Light Blues in Scottish Cup final – Rangers legend, Numan President Federation Cup: Rangers GM urges Kwara United to go for victory against Warri Wolves Rangers sweats on Balogun’s fitness ahead Scottish Cup final Scotland: Dessers on target in Rangers’ defeat to Celtic Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

        "content": "It’s that point of the offseason when national media outlets rank players at each position. Thomas Valentine of Pro Football Focus recently ranked the top 32 running backs ahead of the 2024 season, and he had Jaylen Warren ahead of Najee Harris. Valentine tabbed Warren as the 19th-best running back in the NFL, while Harris came in at No. 22. That’s not really a bold take, as many believe Warren is a better running back than Harris, especially pundits at PFF. Valentine said Warren provides “more dynamism compared to Harris‘ bruiser style of play.” Warren earned a 78.6 PFF grade in 2023, rushing 149 times for 784 yards and four touchdowns at a clip of 5.3 yards per carry — fourth in the NFL. In addition, Warren forced 0.35 missed tackles per attempt, the highest rate in the NFL, and his 56 total missed tackles forced ranked seventh. Najee Harris had a 78.1 PFF grade (career-best mark), which ranked 15th among running backs. Harris became the first player in Steelers history to run for 1,000 or more yards in each of the first three seasons of his career. In 2023, Harris had the best season of his career in terms of yards per carry as he rushed 255 times for 1,035 yards — a 4.1 yards per carry average — and he scored eight touchdowns. Valentine believes that Harris’ efficiency has risen with his workload dropped. Harris averaged more yards after contact per attempt, more missed tackles forced per attempt and more explosive runs per game than ever before in 2023. This will be by far Harris’ best offensive line that he’s ran behind since joining the Steelers. Likewise for Warren. New offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has dynamic run schemes that should benefit both running backs. Smith is known to run a lot of wide zone, but I imagine he’ll still have the gap schemes that Harris excelled at under Matt Canada. Mike Tomlin said the Steelers’ decision to not place the fifth-year option on Harris was more about the business side of things and the positional value of the running back position than being unhappy with Harris as a player. “It could reflect a lot of things, but there’s probably some depth to those waters,” Tomlin said at Day 1 of OTAs. “Sometimes, it’s position-related, and things of that nature. There’s a business component of this and of all decisions that we make. There’s layers to it. I’m not going to try to characterize it in simplicity. That would probably be inappropriate.” This article first appeared on Steelers Now and was syndicated with permission.",

And it's home to the most expensive residence on the market in Scottsdale — a mega-mansion listed for $54 million . The village is in the 4,400-acre residential community of DC Ranch . Last month, I got an exclusive tour of the entire neighborhood's four villages, and Silverleaf stood out as the most elite, with custom estates and an exclusive clubhouse.

Celta Vigo and Valencia played out a 2-2 draw to finish their respective campaigns. Carlos Dominguez’s own goal and an Alberto Mari penalty twice put Valencia ahead, with Iago Aspas’ spot-kick and Anastasios Douvikas levelling on each occasion.",

        "content": "Amid mounting outrage over high grocery prices, a retail expert says there's a solution to fostering more competition in the country. Given that only three retailers (Loblaw Companies Limited, Metro Inc., and Sobeys Inc.) dominate 70 per cent of Canada's grocery market, Doug Stephens said the country must look at \"all avenues\" to raise the competition level in the country and give consumers more choice. \"At the end of the day as much as I love this country, we are small,\" Stephens, a retail expert from St. Catharines, Ont., told CTV's Your Morning on Monday. \"We are about the same population as California, and so it's a difficult job to entice a specialty retailer like a grocer into a country that has a relatively small market that is already dominated by three major incumbents.\" One solution is for Canada to create a structure that promotes domestic competition, boosting small- to medium-sized retailers and specialty grocers, he said. This would give them a framework for growing homegrown competition, he explained. The big grocers say they want to give consumers better prices but blame too many government restrictions that prevent them from offering competitive prices, while the government says it wants to introduce a foreign competitor. The dispute over grocery prices between the Canadian government and big grocers has been like a \"ping pong match,\" but the actions of consumers, including the monthlong Loblaws boycott, are making an impact, says Stephens. \"What we're starting to see is consumers actually taking action and shifting their consumption from one retailer to another and in some cases actually looking for options outside of the big three,\" Stephens said. \"So it's this kind of pressure that I believe is bringing companies like Loblaws now to the table to discuss or at least begin these discussions on what they can do to ameliorate the solution.\" The Competition Bureau began investigating the owners of grocery chains Loblaws and Sobeys for alleged anticompetitive conduct on March 1, The Canadian Press reported on May 24. Sobeys' owner called the inquiry \"unlawful.\" The bureau said it's investigating whether the firms' use of so-called property controls limits retail grocery competition. Stephens believes the Competition Bureau's focus with its investigations is on restrictive covenants, which have existed in retail for decades. This is when a large retailer like a Loblaws or a Sobeys takes space in a commercial property and often builds into its leasing agreement a \"restrictive covenant\" that tells the landlord that no one else can compete directly or even indirectly with it. For example, the landlord can't lease out space to a butcher or bakery in the same mall the retailer occupies. \"The position of the Competition Bureau is – and it's a fair position -- is this really does have a dampening effect on competition,\" Stephens said. While Sobeys' owner pushed back agains the investigation, calling it \"unlawful,\" Loblaws' parent company George Weston Ltd. is co-operating with the bureau's review. \"Restrictive covenants are very common in many industries, including retail. They help support property development investments, encouraging opening of new stores and capital risk-taking,\" Sobeys' owner told The Canadian Press.",

        "content": "By Abhinav Parmar and Supantha Mukherjee (Reuters) - Nokia is set to win a contract to supply 5G radio equipment to Portuguese telecoms operator MEO, according to an internal Nokia blog post and two sources familiar with the matter. Nokia is set to secure the deal even though China's Huawei has been MEO's sole supplier of 2G, 3G and 4G Radio Access Network (RAN) equipment. The contract has been agreed upon but not yet signed, and an announcement is likely to come as early as next month, according to the sources. MEO is one of Portugal's leading mobile operators formerly known as Telecom Portugal and now owned by France's Altice. \"In recent years, MEO ... has been supplied in RAN only by Huawei. In other words, Huawei has had a 100% market share in 2G/3G/4G. We have now been selected to replace Huawei in some of the key markets in Portugal,\" Tommi Uitto, president of Nokia's mobile networks, wrote in an internal blog seen by Reuters. A Nokia spokesperson declined to comment, as did Huawei. MEO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RAN equipment has generated the bulk of telecom sales for the likes of Huawei, Nokia and its Swedish rival Ericsson but a fall in demand for new equipment from telcos since last year has hit Nokia and Ericsson, prompting them to cut thousands of jobs. The global RAN market is expected to decline 5-8% in 2024, according to research firm Dell'Oro. Huawei, which was banned in the U.S. and several European countries over security concerns, still has some presence in Europe and a major share in the fast-growing telecom market in China. The deal would mark Nokia's return to Portugal's RAN market after it lost market share there to Huawei many years ago and has not supplied any communications service providers with RAN in the country since then, Uitto wrote in the internal blog seen by Reuters.

        "content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) -European Union foreign ministers urged Hungary on Monday to stop blocking measures to provide billions of euros in military aid to Ukraine, as long-simmering tension with Budapest boiled over. Even before a meeting of the EU's 27 foreign ministers began, Lithuania's top diplomat Gabrielius Landsbergis accused Hungary of systematically blocking EU foreign policy positions. \"Almost all of our discussions and needed solutions and decisions by (the) EU are being blocked by just one country,\" he told reporters as he arrived at the meeting in Brussels. \"We have to start seeing this as a systematic approach towards any efforts by (the) EU to have any meaningful role in foreign affairs.\" Estonia and Italy also expressed dissatisfaction before the meeting with Budapest's blocking tactics. Diplomats say Hungary's stance is often in line with Russia's interests but Budapest insists it is advocating for peace. Inside the room, diplomats said, ministers vented their frustration and called on Hungarian colleague Peter Szijjarto to lift Budapest's blocks on measures that amount to some 6.5 billion euros ($7.06 billion) in military aid to Ukraine to help fight Russia's invasion. \"Tempers ran quite high,\" said one diplomat briefed on the discussions. Multiple officials said the exchanges were among the most heated in years among EU foreign ministers. EU decisions on foreign policy require the unanimous backing of all 27 member states. In comments on Facebook, Szijjarto said: \"German, Irish, Polish colleagues created a scene, but that could not change our position, regardless of what the war-favouring politicians are shouting.\" Lithuania's Landsbergis said Hungary was blocking decisions on EU military aid to Ukraine, the start of EU membership talks for Kyiv, and on Georgia and Armenia. \"We looked into this and apparently about 41% of resolutions by (the) EU on Ukraine have been blocked by Hungary,\" he said. \"It has gone very, very far,\" Landsbergis added. \"We have to find a way, really, as a community to work around this.\" Diplomats say Budapest is blocking a variety of measures linked to the European Peace Facility (EPF), an EU-backed fund that has provided billions of euros in military aid to Ukraine. \"This is crucial now for Ukraine, and also for Europe, to use these EPF funds,\" Estonian Foreign Margus Tsahkna said. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told reporters: \"We are against the blocking. We want to move on.\" ($1 = 0.9211 euros) (Additional reporting by Boldizsar Gyori, Tassilo Hummel and John IrishEditing by Gareth Jones)",

However, a closer look at their financials reveals another side of the story.According to the company report, Mondelez's profit nearly doubled in 2023 compared to 2022, with figures at $4.9 billion versus $2.7 billion. This significant increase in profit, which coincided with the period of price hikes, raises questions about the actual reasons behind the price increases and whether they are solely due to inflation and other external factors.Adding to the complexity, Mondelez was fined €337.5 million ($365.7 million) by EU antitrust regulators for obstructing cross-border trade of chocolate, biscuits, and coffee products within the EU. This sanction is part of the European Commission's broader efforts to crack down on companies that impose territorial supply constraints on distributors and retailers.

This significant increase in profit, which coincided with the period of price hikes, raises questions about the actual reasons behind the price increases and whether they are solely due to inflation and other external factors. Adding to the complexity, Mondelez was fined €337.5 million ($365.7 million) by EU antitrust regulators for obstructing cross-border trade of chocolate, biscuits, and coffee products within the EU. This sanction is part of the European Commission's broader efforts to crack down on companies that impose territorial supply constraints on distributors and retailers. This practice limits competition and can lead to higher consumer prices.

A startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban and opens a round for regular investors at $250. The Commission found that Mondelez engaged in anti-competitive practices and abused its dominant market position, violating EU antitrust laws. Interestingly, Mondelez's fine was reduced by 15% after the company acknowledged its wrongdoing. \"We are determined to uphold fundamental freedoms in the European Union and to ensure that European citizens have access to the biggest variety at the lowest prices that the market can offer,\" stated EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager during a press conference. These developments paint a more intricate picture of the factors influencing Oreo's pricing. While Mondelez cites external economic pressures, their financial gains and legal challenges suggest additional underlying reasons for the increased costs passed on to consumers. This is crucial information for all consumers, as it helps with understanding the dynamics of the market and the factors affecting the prices of popular snacks and other consumer products.

Corporate Price Gauging: The Hidden Driver Behind Rising Grocery Bills Corporate price gouging has become a pressing issue. Major grocery chains and major corporations use inflation as a cover to increase consumer prices and boost their profits. This practice impacts the wallets of everyday Americans and contributes to the nation's soaring inflation. This directly affects people's purchasing power and the country’s overall economic stability. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a prominent advocate for consumer rights, has accused Kroger, P&G, and Tyson Foods of leveraging inflation as an excuse to raise prices on essential goods, thereby fattening their profit margins. Her efforts to expose and combat this practice emphasize the seriousness of the issue and the need for regulatory intervention. \"The nation is dealing with inflation at its highest level in decades, much of it driven by corporate greed and anticompetitive behavior, and the federal government must use every tool available to prevent price gouging and reduce prices for Americans,\" the senator wrote to the Department of Justice, urging them to take action against corporations hiking consumer prices. The actions of these corporations highlight a disturbing trend in which the guise of inflation is used to mask opportunistic price hikes. This has led many people to change their consumer practices. For example, up to 73% of Gen Zers have adjusted their spending habits in response to rising prices, with no end in sight. This behavior undermines consumer trust and contributes to the broader issue of economic inequality as these companies report soaring profits, the average American faces escalating costs for everyday necessities.

        "content": "A man was arrested at a birthday party in Taytay, Rizal for allegedly raping a minor nine years ago. In Emil Sumangil’s \"24 Oras\" report, the Special Maritime Response Team first asked for the 55-year-old man’s ID before handcuffing him as he was drunk. “Actually may warrant of arrest ito, since 2015 pa, base sa krimen na kanyang nagawa na rape,” Philippine National Police Maritime Group Director Police Brigadier General Jonathan Cabal said. (Actually, there is a warrant of arrest since 2015, based on the crime he did, which was rape.) The victim, who was minor at the time of the crime, is the suspect’s neighbor in Balangiga, Eastern Samar. “Nabutis ito, at ngayon ang bata is 8 years old,” Cabal said. “Meron naman pag amin itong suspek. Hindi nga niya alam, na meron siyang anak na 8 years old.” (The victim got pregnant and the child is 8 years old now. The suspect somehow admitted. He did not even know that he has an 8-year-old kid.) According to the suspect, he did not force the victim since they have a relationship. “Maganda ang pagsasama namin, hindi ko hinalay o hindi ko ni-rape,” the suspect said. (We have a good relationship. I did not rape her.) The sibling of the victim contradicted the suspect’s claim. “Bago siya nagsabi sa akin, mga ilang months muna. Natatakot daw siya at baka magalit. Sunod nagsabi siya sakin na, ganito ginahasa ako ng isang lasing pangalan niya ganyan,” the sibling of the victim said. (Months passed before my sister told me of the incident. She is afraid that the man may get mad. She then told me that she was raped by a drunk man and then named him.) She added that the incident happened after the victim was buying cigarettes. “Hinawakan daw yung kamay niya tapos tinutukan daw siya ng kutsilyo,”the sibling of the victim said. (She told me that the suspect held her hands and pointed a knife at her.) The suspect is set to be taken to Eastern Samar. —Mariel Celine Serquiña/LDF, GMA Integrated News",

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea's state media said a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded in mid-air on Monday. State media said the explosion was possibly caused by engine failure. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: North Korea launched a rocket likely carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night, hours after its announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center in the northeast at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket” during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",

Lindsey Michelle Horan of the US, Spanish Barcelona’s Patricia Guijarro and her teammate Aitana Bonmati of Italy were named in the midfield. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The defence comprises French player Selma Bacha of Lyon, English player Jess Carter of Chelsea, Irene Parades Fernandes and Barcelona’s English player Lucia Roberta Bronze and Chilean Claudia Endler of Lyon is the goalkeeper. In an interview, Tabitha who was on loan at PSG Feminine and has six-month remaining on her contract said she was excited with the development. “This is the icing on the cake for a season to remember in France. It has proved that with God everything is possible,” she said. Her feat is no surprise as she was named the fastest player of the Uefa Women’s Champions League and her record was not broken despite that her team lost to local rivals Lyon in the semi-finals of the competition. Chawinga also won French Player of the Year sharing it with former PSG’s Men world star Kylian Mbappe, who has since left the club. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); She also won the Golden Boot with 18 goals as well as the team’s Player of the Year.

        "content": "United’s 2023-24 promotion bid ultimately went to the play-offs in which Leeds suffered yet more heartache as Sunday’s Wembley final against Southampton ended in a 1-0 defeat. Southampton now join Championship champions Leicester City and runners-up Ipswich Town in being new to the Premier League next term. Leeds, though, will remain in the second tier which will feature six new teams in relegated trio Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton Town plus League One’s promoted sides of champions Portsmouth, runners-up Derby County and play-off winners Oxford United.

        "content": "Unai Emery has committed his long-term future to Aston Villa by signing a five-year contract extension. In his first full season at Villa Park, Emery led his side to a top four finish, securing qualification for the Champions League in the process. His work in the Midlands had seen him emerge as a potential contender for the Bayern Munich job, but Emery has now decided to remain in his current post. Villa confirmed the news in a statement. It read: \"Aston Villa are thrilled to announce Manager Unai Emery has agreed a new five-year contract. The Spaniard guided the Club to a fourth-place finish in the Premier League last season, securing Champions League football for the first time in our history. \"Completely transforming the fortunes of the Club since his arrival in 2022, Unai steered the side from 17th in the table to 7th during his first campaign in charge, bringing European football back to Villa for the first time in 13 years.\" Champions League top seeds confirmed as Arsenal face potential nightmare Ex-Liverpool star Philippe Coutinho in 'advanced talks' to re-sign for old club Emery replaced Steven Gerrard in the Villa dugout back in November 2022, winning 44 of his 83 games in charge. He has the best win percentage of any manager in Villa's history and also led them into the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League this season. Their qualification for the Champions League means Villa will play in Europe's premier competition for the first time since 1983. The Spaniard revealed his delight at the news. “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club. Since I came to Villa with Wes and Nassef we found always the best environment and structure to develop a project with the highest ambition,\" Emery said. Emery guided Villa into the top four this season ( Image: Offside via Getty Images) “All the football structure with Monchi and Damian and the owners, we share the same vision and same goals. There’s a great chemistry in Aston Villa. And the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams.” Villa are also pleased to tie down their boss until at least 2029. Chairman Nassef Sawiris pointed to the project that Villa are building under Emery's management as one of the key reasons behind rewarding the manager. “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029,\" he said. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "description": "One loyal customer said they were 'absolutely gutted' that their 'favourite restaurant in Manchester' was closing",
        "content": "The owner of a popular restaurant in the city centre has issued a desperate plea for help after announcing its shock closure. Peru Perdu, which is situated within the Whitworth Locke hotel’s Cotton Factory on Princess Street, will permanently close at the start of June after being given notice by the building owners. Run by owner Jennifer Hughes, the venue has become just as known for its quality of food as it has for its strong pink décor. The South American restaurant, which serves small plates, including sea bass ceviche and Chimmi chicken wings, alongside mains like Argentine Red Prawns, charcoal marinated half chicken, and pastel de papas - a dish comprising sweet potato in a filo pastry, has been running for five years and regarded as one of Manchester's 'best kept secrets' by diners. READ MORE: Mystery as beloved Manchester bar with historic past closes suddenly without notice Posting on social media, Jennifer said she had now been asked to vacate the premises, which is situated opposite the Gay Village and the Kampus neighbourhood, with June 6 being their last day in operation at the site. She described the move as the 'final nail in the coffin' for the business. “Our little South American haven has survived many a Covid lockdown, the rising costs of raw materials, heating and power, staff wages increasing, general supplier costs increasing, rent increases and much much more that we can't disclose just yet,” Jennifer posted on Instagram. “But unfortunately the 30 days notice we were given to vacate has been the final nail in the coffin. The South American restaurant has been a big hit with diners since first opening five years ago (Image: Peru Perdu) “We would like to thank all of our amazing, hardworking and dedicated staff members as well as our incredibly loyal customers who continued to return. Thanks to our suppliers, our corporate friends, our event agents who always saw value in what we did and every single person who walked through those pink doors in the last 5 years.” The news was met with disappointment from some of Peru Perdu’s loyal customers. One person replied: “Damn this one really hurts, always one of my favourite places in town.\" Another said: “So proud of you and what you have created with Peru Perdu! We had the absolute best time here - the food, service and pink décor are perfection.” Another posted: \"My favourite restaurant in Manchester, absolutely gutted.\" Peru Perdu owner Jennifer Hughes One other person said: “I’m devastated!! It’s been one of my favourite things about visiting Manchester.” Another added: “YOU should be so, so proud of our perfect little pink place, @jejehughes. Your team went above and beyond to deliver incredible hospitality to Manchester; despite all the adversities and making PP one of the city’s most loved restaurants.” Speaking to the Manchester Evening News , Jennifer said Peru Perdu will close on June 6 with a closing party featuring a live DJ to celebrate the restaurant’s legacy over the years. But she hopes that the party won’t be the end of the restaurant for good - and has launched an appeal to help the venue's staff. “We are so grateful to our incredible staff - who have been the constant heartbeat of our pink restaurant,” Jennifer said. “Therefore, we’re asking for one last hand from the supportive community of Manchester’s great hospitality industries. Loyal diners of the restaurant and cocktail bar said they were 'devastated' over the news of its upcoming closure (Image: Peru Perdu) “So we can serve our team their notice, we would like to hear of any pop-up opportunities who might be in need of some quality steak, ceviche and cocktails. We had been working on some exciting menu developments recently, and we’d love the chance to showcase these dishes. “We started our journey as a three-month pop-up, but after such a warm and successful beginning, we threw our roots down for five amazing years. It now seems we must come full circle.” Jennifer has asked any ideas and enquiries on pop-up opportunities to be sent to hello@cotton-factory.com, or to send a message to @peruperdu_mcr on Instagram. Tables for Peru Perdu can be booked before it closes online here .",

        "content": "RIYADH, May 27 — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) today launched the Neo Space Group to work on the kingdom’s nascent satellite and space industry, its first investment in the sector. One of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, the PIF has already invested heavily in sports, gaming and so-called Saudi giga-projects including Neom, a US$500-billion (RM2.3-trillion) futuristic megacity under construction in the desert. The Neo Space Group or NSG is the “PIF’s first investment focused on the space industry”, the sovereign wealth fund said in a statement. It “aims to develop and enhance commercial space operations in Saudi Arabia, providing innovative satellite and space solutions locally and globally”, the PIF said. It will also “invest in localisation, technology, start-ups, and knowledge in the space and satellite sector in Saudi Arabia” in the latest bid to boost economic diversification. Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler, Saudi Arabia has sought both to open up and diversify its oil-reliant economy. From world-class footballers to a new national airline and even a speciality shop serving camel milk gelato, the PIF has splashed billions on acquisitions intended to support diversification. The fund has also made high-profile investments in foreign firms including stakes in Uber, electric car maker Lucid and video game company Activision Blizzard. Domestic investments constitute the vast majority of its portfolio, however. “The establishment of NSG marks an important milestone in the development of the growing satellite and space sector in Saudi Arabia,” said Omar Al-Madhi, PIF’s co-head of Mena Direct Investments. Last year, Saudi Arabia sent its first two astronauts into space, including Rayyanah Barnawi, the kingdom’s first female astronaut. — AFP",

        "description": "The 2024 Stratford Festival season officially opens Monday with Shakespeare's Twelfth Night",
        "content": "The inspiration for the 2024 Stratford Festival season, like so much in recent years, can be traced back to the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. But artistic director Antoni Cimolino wasn’t so much thinking about the virus itself when he began thinking about the Festival’s 2024 playbill as he was musing on our collective desire to discover “A World Elsewhere.” After months of lockdowns and gathering restrictions, there was, for many, a yearning to escape from our suddenly diminished environs. “I was noticing people were so desperate to go on vacation again after the years of lockdown, but I also noticed people leaving jobs — you know, deciding ‘I’m not going to do that anymore. I’m going to do something else,” Cimolino said. “So this idea became, ‘what happens when we go somewhere else — when we unplug and become a new person?’” With theatre providing a similar sort of invitation — to enter and journey into new worlds — Cimolino looked for plays that would reinforce this sense of A World Elsewhere. Some choices were obvious — Peter Pan’s Neverland, for example — while the worlds elsewhere in other plays were more indefinite or abstruse. Whatever the circumstance, however, the idea of a journey is central to each of this season’s dozen productions. Twelfth Night, this season’s opening-night production, is another where the World Elsewhere is obvious. Directed by acclaimed actor Seana McKenna, this Shakespearean comedy involves a tangle of mistaken identities and a love triangle after a shipwreck leaves twin siblings stranded on the mysterious island of Illyria. (McKenna) is one of the best actresses in the world,” Cimolino said, “and she has directed from time to time, but I wanted to give her an opportunity to really bring forward a lifetime of experience — a lifetime of learning — in terms of the work.” With a gifted cast of Stratford stars, including Jessica B. Hill, Laura Condlin, André Sills, Vanessa Sears, Deborah Hay, Scott Wentworth and Rylan Wilkie, McKenna has set her interpretation of this romantic comedy in 1967, just weeks before the “Summer of Love.” “She’s found a very rich time,” Cimolino said. “It’s delightful and (McKenna’s) wealth of experience is just such a help to the cast. I think this is going to be one of the major hits of the season.” Unlike Twelfth Night’s Viola and Sebastian, the characters in another of the season’s major Shakespearean productions, Romeo and Juliet, never actually reach a world elsewhere. The doomed lovers, though, “desperately want a different world — a better world — for themselves,” Cimolino said. Starring Sears and Jonathan Mason as the famous young lovers from two warring houses, this production of Romeo and Juliet will embrace their romance in a way that reinforces the tragedy of their eventual loss. While director Sam White has chosen to leave the play in Shakespeare’s original Renaissance setting, Cimolino promised “different elements” that will make for a powerful production. The season’s final Shakespearean production, the rarely staged Cymbeline, is one of The Bard’s later works and offers an unexpected fusion of romance, comedy and tragedy. In this Esther Jun-helmed production, Cymbeline, an ancient British queen, exiles her commoner son-in-law, Posthumus, to Italy since she needs her daughter, Innogen, to produce a fully royal heir. This banishment to a world elsewhere prompts a series of villainous schemes that involve gender-swapping disguises, attempted assassinations and what Cimolino called a “hard-fought happy ending.” “Late in Shakespeare’s life, he was interested in what happens if we get behind the misunderstandings and the anger to actually discover we aren’t entirely right,” the artistic director said. “We haven’t totally been betrayed. There is second chance at love and relationships.” With a “fantastic cast” that includes Lucy Peacock, Jordin Hall, Allison Edwards-Crewe and Jonathan Goad, Cimolino promised that audiences will be “laughing and crying” by Cymbeline’s final act. While Shakespeare didn’t pen the play, he is the inspiration — and a main character — for Something Rotten, one of this season’s two blockbuster musicals. Directed and choreographed by a returning Donna Feore, Something Rotten is about the creative journey of the Bottom brothers, two struggling playwrights who find themselves overshadowed by the charismatic William Shakespeare. Desperate to escape The Bard’s looming shadow, the brothers — played by Henry Firmston and Mark Uhre — attempt to invent a strange new theatrical genre in which the actors unaccountably break into song and dance. “Donna has just filled this production with hugely talented actors, great gags . . . and wonderful dance,” Cimolino said. “It’s kinetic. They just never stop. Donna is at the height of her powers. “It’s about musicals – it’s about the creation of musicals – and it’s so irreverent. If you love Shakespeare, you’ll love it. If you love musicals, you’ll love it.” The world elsewhere in the season’s other musical, La Cage Aux Folles, is just as conceptual as the vision within Something Rotten. That world, Cimolino said, is one of “acceptance and independence” where people are able to put aside their differences and embrace our common humanity. A musical based on a hit French play, La Cage Aux Folles features a nightclub and drag cabaret of the same name that’s headlined by Albin, the longtime romantic partner of the club’s owner, Georges. When Georges’ son, Jean-Michel, introduces his parents to the family of fiancée Anne, the daughter of an ultra-conservative couple who want to shut down St. Tropez’s drag clubs, Albin is asked to play “butch” as “Uncle Al” for the duration of the visit. “(Director) Thom Allison and his entire creative team are hugely dedicated to this piece,” Cimolino said. “They are treating it with great care and love, with a fantastic cast that includes Steve Ross and Sean Arbuckle, among many others. With the talent on the stage through to the joyful material that is there, I think this play is going to be something to remember.” This season’s Schulich Children’s Play, Wendy and Peter Pan, is an affectionate adaptation of J.M. Barrie’s classic novel that will introduce audiences to a more daring Wendy Darling. Directed by Thomas Morgan Jones, the play shares the journey of Wendy and her brothers to Neverland, where they help Peter Pan and the Lost Boys battle the sinister Captain Hook. Starring Cynthia Jimenez-Hicks, Jake Runeckles and Condlin, Wendy and Peter Pan remains largely faithful to the source material while playwright Ella Hickson adds in a few new wrinkles. “These seemingly modest changes make an enormous difference,” Cimolino said. It’s one of the few times when a retelling of a classic tale actually makes it stronger. “I find this version to me much more emotionally moving. It’s Peter Pan, but it’s Peter Pan in an emotionally deep and beautiful way.” In Hedda Gabler, the Henrik Ibsen classic that’s only been performed once before on a Stratford stage, the world elsewhere is one in which women aren’t constrained by social convention. Unfortunately, this world is out of reach for Hedda, a brilliant young woman who is forced into the respectable life of a housewife. In her anger, Hedda shows an indomitable will that she asserts by manipulating the people around her. “This is one of the great plays in theatre history,” Cimolino said. “It’s about a woman who is extremely intelligent and capable but has nowhere to put her energy, her mind, her ability.” Helmed by Molly Atkinson, the Stratford production also welcomes back Sara Topham, who’s returning to Stratford for the first time since starring as Juliet in 2013. “She has been in New York and has performed and taught in many places,” Cimolino said, “so it’s wonderful to have her back home.” Written by Leanna Brodie and Jovanni Sy, Salesman in China will be making its world premiere when it opens at the Avon Theatre this season. Inspired by the memoirs of playwright Arthur Miller and actor Ying Ruocheng, the play recounts a historic collaboration intended to symbolize a new era of friendship between the American and Chinese governments. “The play is based on a real event,” Cimolino said. “China was beginning to open up in the early 1980s, so a very famous actor, Ying Ruocheng, decided to seize the moment and reach out to Arthur Miller, who’d written Death of a Salesman. ... He invites Arthur Miller to come over to direct (Death of a Salesman) and Miller came with a desire to prove that we’re all people – that all of our stories interconnect.” Starring Tom McCamus and Adrian Pang, the play delves into the challenges faced by Miller, Ruocheng and their collaborators at Beijing’s People’s Art Theatre. “This is the kind of quintessentially American play that seemed to define the challenges of capitalism,” Cimolino said. “You’re doing a play about a travelling salesman in a country where they don’t have travelling salesman. He is contemplating suicide so his family can get the insurance money in a country where they did not have insurance. “So what is the essence of being American? What is the essence of being Chinese? These are the kinds of questions that (director Sy) is examining in this piece.” In The Diviners, another 2024 production enjoying its world premiere, the world elsewhere is one that exists in the mind of Morag, a novelist struggling to finish her work-in-progress. Isolating herself from family and friends in her rural cabin, Morgan muses on the past and future, exploring her dreams and memories, and her own past journey into her Indigenous heritage. Adapted by Vern Thiessen and Yvette Nolan from Margaret Laurence’s final novel, The Diviners tells an epic story that spans centuries of Canada’s past while being firmly rooted in a family that’s navigating its own identity. Starring Irene Poole as Morag and Julie Lumsden as Pique, The Diviners, Cimolino said, will be “something very memorable.” “It’s about a woman who wants to find her own voice as a writer, her daughter who’s trying to find her own identity,” Cimolino said about the Krista Jackson and Geneviève Pelletier-directed play. “It explores the divide between Indigenous, Métis and Settler communities. “It was a novel that was well ahead of its time.” Another work considered well ahead of its time when it opened on Broadway in 2002, The Goat, or Who is Sylvia? is an unconventional tale about a successful architect who shocks his wife and son when he falls in love with a goat. “This is arguably (playwright) Edward Albee’s greatest achievement,” Cimolino said. “It basically asks questions: What is the end of tolerance? What is the nature of love? A lot of questions that don’t have easy answers.” While the subject matter is unsettling – and the play veers toward the tragic – The Goat, or Who is Sylvia? is also uproariously funny, Cimolino said. “You’re laughing right from the start,” the artistic director said. “He has you laughing and then he shocks you. You think you’re in control – you think you know what’s going on – and then something powerful and unexpected happens.” Directed by Dean Gabourie and starring Peacock, Rick Roberts, Matthew Kabwe and Anthony Palermo, The Goat, or Who is Sylvia? can be considered a late-career distillation of Albee’s thematic preoccupations, Cimolino noted. “This play is about who Albee was as a person and whether that was acceptable in the world,” Cimolino said. “It’s a great piece.” The third world premiere of the Festival’s 2024 season, Get That Hope, was inspired by Stratford’s 2018 production of Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey Into Night. Written by the “phenomenally gifted” Andrea Scott, Get That Hope takes place in a crowded apartment in Toronto’s Little Jamaica while family patriarch Richard Whyte is planning an ambitious Jamaican Independence Day party. Richard’s wife and adult children, though, are dealing with their own emotional struggles, which makes for an often fraught day of disagreements and resentments that slowly fracture the family’s upbeat facade. “(Scott) was determined to write a play from her own perspective,” Cimolino said. “It is very funny. You love the characters. . . . It’s what we all know about families. We love each other. We want to be together but, at the same time, there are challenges.” Directed by Sills, Get That Hope stars Celia Aloma, Conrad Coates, Savion Roach, Kim Roberts and Jennifer Villaverde. The final big comedy of the 2024 season, London Assurance, presents a contrast between city sophisticates of the upper classes in Victorian England and their more rural counterparts. Penned by Dion Boucicault, one of the most celebrated playwrights of the mid-1800s, London Assurance follows Sir Harcourt Courtly, an aging London fop, as he attempts to court a scandalously younger bridge with a substantial inheritance during a visit to her family’s country estate. “What I love about the play is that it has a main character who is somewhat ridiculous – a dandy at the height of fashion – who is very vulnerable because of what he values and how he lives his life,” said Cimolino, who is also directing the play. “But at the same time, he has the ability to change – the ability to learn and grow.” For London Assurance, Cimolino assembled a cast featuring longtime collaborators like Geraint Wyn Davies and David Collins and younger stars like Austin Eckert and Marissa Orjalo. “It’s a great group of people,” Cimolino said about the London Assurance actors. “It’s important that there’s trust in a company – that you have the talent and people ager to work – and I feel we have all of those elements in London Assurance.”",

        "content": "OPPOSITION leader Nelson Chamisa is still maintaining pressure on SADC, nine months after last year’s disorderly general elections, revealing in a statement Monday that the regional body had said it was giving the matter “due consideration”. Chamisa managed close to two million votes in a heavily contested Presidential race marred by irregularities that included delayed delivery of voting material to perceived opposition strongholds and voter intimidation in scattered outposts. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission’s (ZEC) handling of the poll was criticised by Election Observer Missions (EOM) from Europe, America, the African Union and SADC leading Chamisa to write in protest to the regional body. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Chamisa said despite having received a response on the matter late last year, he had written a follow-up letter with the hope SADC could facilitate an end to Zimbabwe’s political crisis. This was Chamisa’s first public address since resigning from the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) party over claims it had been infiltrated. “Our request to SADC was and remains very simple, that, as the regional body which Zimbabwe has signed up for membership and vested some authority in the supranational intergovernmental organisation, we require their facilitation to peacefully resolve the issues around the irregular and disputed elections,” said Chamisa. “We want this issue resolved as soon as possible. We cannot be the world’s laughing stock, a country which never has credible elections. Remember the 2018 elections were disputed and so were the 2023 polls. “There is no other election in the history of elections in this country that has invited resounding and universal condemnation as the August 2023 elections. “This matter must be resolved so that the country can have proper elections that produce a proper government from the citizens.” Chamisa’s first letter to SADC was on the 26th of September, a month after ZEC declared Mnangagwa the winner of the elections. SADC responded on the 23rd of October before his follow-up this year, on April 29 which according to Chamisa had been necessitated by silence at its Troika meetings, particularly the one held in Zambia in March. “We wrote to our regional body, SADC, the guarantor of the values and principles of the aspirations of the common agenda” and “common will” of the people of Southern Africa,” he said. SADC became the centre of attention after delivering, for the first time, a damning report on Zimbabwe’s elections, falling short of declaring it a sham. State actors hounded the head of its delegation Dr. Nevers Mumba whom they accused of colluding with the President of Zambia, Hakainde Hichilema to condemn them. Added Chamisa: “The current challenges of failing to resolve the huge national debt, high inflation, currency distortions, drought, starvation, poverty, poor income, the hostile political environment, an air of sadness and brain drain are all symptoms of a government without a proper mandate.” Zimbabwe is expected to host the 44th SADC Heads of State and Government Summit this August.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email Food packaging does much more than just wrap up food content. It keeps food safe and fresh while traveling long distances, sometimes across the world, before finally reaching hungry customers. Careful packaging balances easy access and communication with protection from damage, germs, oxygen, light, and pests. Good packaging also reduces food waste by extending shelf life. However, too much plastic packaging pollutes landfills and oceans. So, companies now aim to use renewable materials like plant fibers as alternative plastics. These new solutions can decompose back into nature over time. As passionate innovators develop safer and more eco-friendly food packaging , they open up a better future that balances food preservation with environmental protection. This introduces new compostable, recyclable, and biodegradable options to help secure healthy foods and ecosystems ahead. The Importance of Food Packaging Core functionalities underpinning why proper packaging holds immense strategic value include: Protection and Preservation Successful containment shields foodstuffs against physical damage, oxygen, light, moisture, microbes, and vermin exposure. If left unprotected, this can degrade nutritional quality and dramatically shorten consumable lifespans. Information and Marketing Labels convey compliance codes, ingredient lists, preparation guidance, and branding, distinguishing offerings competitively as products travel remote distances far from the points originally manufactured or grown. Packages represent essential real estate around messaging and decor, creatively targeted to attract consumers. Convenience and Portion Control Single-serve packets, resealability, and lightweight handling simplify usage across settings, from packing lunches comfortably to reducing preparation workload or eliminating contamination risks by reusing bulk items repeatedly. This expands access occasions into new settings quickly. Product Identification & Tracking UPC barcodes plus traceability data sets allow inventory management, monitoring product genealogy, and ensuring accountability across supply chains. This enables rapid issue isolation or recall execution if ever required. Food Waste Reduction Optimized protective properties directly combat product losses accumulating from premature spoilage; otherwise, there is an inevitable absence of containment solutions. These solutions shield goods sufficiently through last-mile deliveries and home kitchen cabinet conditions, keeping nutrition viable for the longest possible time. This counters gratuitous waste directly. Every item protected from perishing equals less environmental impact. Careful packaging considerations spanning the above-interrelated dimensions prove indispensable for successfully shepherding products intact through complex value chains until they are conveniently placed in consumers’ hands efficiently without excessive ecological burdens historically incurred under outdated legacy models. Types of Food Packaging Materials Primary containers leveraged across food applications include: Glass Chemically non-reactive and sterilizable, but heavier weight challenges transport efficiency despite being highly recyclable. Metal Strong barrier against light, gases, and moisture but rarely recyclable or reusable while risking flavor transfer between production cycles without vigilant sanitation. Significant insulation properties are beneficial for preserving chilled/frozen contents. Paper and Cardboard Economical options with custom printability enable lightweight shipments, improving sustainability profiles, although limited moisture protection requires additional safeguards shielding contents sufficiently across high humidity supply lanes. Recyclability eases renewability but is commonly difficult to decontaminate for direct food contact compared to costlier plastic-coated papers uniquely engineered to uphold purity with recyclability largely maintained. Plastics Lightweight, shatterproof, low cost, and diverse barrier strength adjustability optimizes shelflife custom-tailored against oxygen, UV light, or moisture, securing even delicate perishables over prolonged durations unpreserved otherwise. However, plastic waste accumulation and petrochemical footprint tarnish viability, requiring responsible recovery, substitution, and end-of-life handling, mitigating unchecked dumping as global adoption widens, outpacing waste mismanagement currently. Balancing factors across substrates demands careful alignments, choosing ideal enclosures, maximizing merchandise integrity and distribution efficiencies sought while minimizing cumulative environmental impacts over full lifecycles assessed holistically from origin through disposal. Innovative Packaging Technologies Several contemporary advances expand preservation possibilities: Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) Altering internal gas concentration ratios (like higher nitrogen or CO2 proportions) slows and produces ripening processes, almost suspending time, keeping natural freshness, locking in flavor, otherwise quickly escaping without intervention. Vacuum Packaging Evacuating air inside packages virtually eliminates oxygen, rapidly accelerating food decay once opened subsequently. This substantially extends unopened food life multi-fold using sound barrier pouches preventing reintroduction lengthening usable product viability additionally. Active & Intelligent Packaging Incorporating humidity regulators, CO2 emitters, oxygen scavenging films, and time/temperature deterioration sensors enables dynamic food preservation longevity fine-tuned responses to changing transit conditions in real-time. The future potential seems limitless, sensing & automatically adapting storage to counter degradation factors, maximizing merchandise stability. Edible Packaging Nature-sourced transparent seaweed extract or algae pouches encasing contents entirely edible, while home compostable alternatively represents fascinating enclosures preventing residual waste, unlike disposable wrappers, which ultimately require recycling or disposal once the goods inside are emptied completely. These self-contained all-inclusive parcels elegantly charm consumer simplicity desires. Ongoing Science expanding food lifetime pathways signals fruitful decades ahead, optimizing preservation through chemistry and responsive sensor innovations once only recently imaginable. Environmental Impact of Food Packaging However, ecological considerations around material selections and renewability grow in importance, facing waste accumulation threats globally: Waste and Pollution Single-use plastics accumulating across poorly managed landfills and pervading oceans require responsible sourcing policies plus consumer behavioral shifts limiting uncontrolled dumping practices through Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) illuminating renewability constraints packaging imposes at conclusion life each choice entails. Recycling and Biodegradability The transition toward recyclable substrates , higher recycled content integration, and most optimally compostable/biodegradable materials returning nourishment into soils rather than persisting indefinitely represents a pivotal direction gaining momentum as consumers demand ethical value chains demonstrating eco-credentials quantifiably through trusted sustainability audits exposing genuine impact reductions rather than marketed facades alone. This revolution gains momentum daily. Sustainable Packaging Innovations Numerous ingenious eco-conscious packaging solutions utilize agricultural crop residual waste streams like rice husks, wheat chaff, or coconut fibers homogeneously distributed throughout molded trays, sustainably biodegrading back into soils across home composts. Additional emerging options zone in on recycled paper composites, polylactic acid (PLA) from fermented plant starches, and mycelium foams clinically proven to disintegrate naturally across backyard compost piles forgivingly. Brands proactively adopting renewables steal wider margins before external forces necessitate change unwillingly later. Future Trends in Food Packaging Several intriguing developments lie ahead: Innovative Packaging Increasingly interconnected packs embed digital freshness sensors monitoring internal/external environments, altering consumers if deterioration changes temperature, humidity, or oxygen composition parameters, indicating the food is unsafe any longer. This eliminates reliance on guessing arbitrarily food viability based on labeled dates crudely estimating thresholds, after which microbiome proliferation risks accelerate beyond usability periods conservatively. Sustainable Materials As next-generation biopolymers utilizing crops like corn emerge, competing performance and pricing profiles against conventional polymers today, material sciences point to brighter futures derived sustainably as petrochemical dependencies decline mid-century onward, responding to climate realities afoot globally, mandating accelerated decarbonization nearly universally across societies. Customization Digitally printed packaging allows personalized messaging tailored to smaller production batches, preventing excessive generalized overruns once necessary, amortizing setup fees only justified more giant cube runs primarily. This opens doors to localizing offerings resonating with customers uniquely through targeted customization, lowering barriers to reaching niche demographics broadly once unfeasible economically years prior. Challenges in Food Packaging However, thoughtful strategies confront known hurdles creatively: Balancing Functionality and Sustainability Extending merchandise lifespan with minimal ecological burden demands a delicate equilibrium often solely achieved by iterating generations balancing barriers and protection capacities initially lacking biodegradable substrates, subsequently enhanced over time through creative coatings until reaching parity and meeting demands equally across metrics holistically. But meaningful progress is seen daily. Regulatory Compliance As governance expectations tighten around responsible sourcing, recyclability thresholds, and food-grade safety precautions, continually evolving best practices and testing protocols ensure packaging choices meet the newest criteria before regulations potentially limit fewer alternatives later should more reactive approaches persist shortsightedly. However, when organizations proactively adopt emerging safety science before enforcement, this leadership earns customer trust through evidence-based, freely transparent supply chains. Cost Considerations Methodical migration coordinating supplier and manufacturer partnerships incentivizes investments into innovative equipment and smarter materials, benefiting entire value ecosystems and multiplying returns over enough time that initial financial risks dissipate as scales rise and conversion barriers reduce integrating renewability more wholly across time.

Driven by maturing agricultural bioplastics matching performance profiles affordably against conventional predecessors, passionate industry pioneers now illuminate brighter packaging futures safeguarding merchandise effectively while advancing holistic value chain renewability . People and the planet will thank us all for instituting responsibly ahead through this pivotal eco-innovation frontier now in reach, benefiting universally.

        "description": "Field trials are going on and the indigenous technology is expected to be launched in August",
        "content": "By T E Raja Simhan Comments READ LATER It’s now Aatmanirbhar in the dairy industry in the form of sex sorting technology for bovine. Field trials of indigenously developed technology on this are underway and the results are expected by August. At present, there are two technologies — both from the US — through which the sorting happens with samples sold to farmers at around ₹1,000 per sample. However, through the indigenous technology, the cost will be reduced to nearly one-third, and the technology in turn will help in milk production due to higher number of female calves, Meenesh Shah, Chairman, National Dairy Development Board & NDDB Dairy Services, told businessline. At present, two US-based companies — ST and ABS — are supplying the sex semen sorting machines. In total artificial insemination, the sex sorted semen is used less than 1 per cent. With this indigenous technology, more female calves will be produced, leading to increased milk production, he said at the Alamadhi Semen Station. “We started the trial run of the technology from March 2024 at Alamadhi. Till date, 5,000 doses of sex sorted bovine semen have been produced. Post the review of the trial results, the technology can be dedicated to the nation,” Shah said. “Initial results are good in terms of conception rate and purity. we are getting the desired results, either equal or better than the technologies which are available. If everything goes as planned in two months time, we will be ready to roll out,” he added. “It is a 100 per cent Aatmanirbhar story and we would like to dedicate it to our farmers. We want to give them at a cost between ₹300 and ₹500 or one-third of what is available in the market now,” he said. There are 67 semen stations in the country. They will get the technology developed through a supplier. “We are yet to finalise the commercial terms. We don’t want to have a monopoly like the existing companies do,” Shah said. With new technologies, including the sex semen sorting, in a few years the milk production, which is about 231 million tonnes or one-fourth of the global milk production now, will increase to 300 million tonnes by 2030 or 2032 with a share of 33 per cent of global production, he said.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by NASA Assembled at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, the spacecraft arrived at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 23 for launch preparations. NASA's Europa Clipper, a spacecraft designed to investigate Jupiter's icy moon Europa and its potential to support life, arrived in Florida on Thursday, May 23. The spacecraft, assembled at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, landed aboard a United States Air Force C-17 Globemaster III aircraft at the Launch and Landing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The mission aims to gather detailed measurements of the moon's surface, interior, and space environment by performing approximately 50 close flybys, some as low as 16 miles (25 kilometers) from the surface of Europa, which holds a global ocean underneath its ice shell. \"My job for Europa Clipper is to ensure the team meets all the ground and flight requirements to place the spacecraft in the proper orbit to initiate the long journey to Jupiter,\" said Armando Piloto, Europa Clipper mission manager for NASA's Launch Services Program. \"The team is excited that the spacecraft is in Florida for processing. We're pairing Europa Clipper with a fully expendable SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket to ensure it provides the required performance to explore a destination very far away from Earth.\" Teams at Kennedy spent several hours offloading Europa Clipper before transferring it to the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility, where they will process the spacecraft and perform final checkouts as part of prelaunch preparations. Europa Clipper joins the spacecraft's two five-panel solar arrays that arrived at Kennedy in March. The arrays, each 46.5 feet (14.2 meters) long, will collect enough sunlight to power the spacecraft on its way to Jupiter's moon. Technicians will install the arrays on the spacecraft before launch. The spacecraft was designed to withstand the pummeling of radiation from Jupiter and gather the measurements needed to investigate Europa's surface, interior, and space environment. Europa Clipper has nine dedicated science instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, a magnetometer, and an ice-penetrating radar. These instruments will study Europa's icy shell, the ocean beneath, and the composition of the gases in the moon's atmosphere and surface geology, and provide insights into the moon's potential habitability. The spacecraft also will carry a thermal instrument to pinpoint locations of warmer ice and any possible eruptions of water vapor. Strong evidence shows the ocean beneath Europa's crust is twice the volume of all the Earth's oceans combined. The Europa Clipper mission demonstrates NASA's commitment to exploring our solar system and searching for habitability beyond Earth. The data will contribute to our understanding of the Jovian system and will help pave the way for potential future missions to study Europa and other potentially habitable worlds. Europa Clipper is expected to reach the Jupiter system in April 2030, and it will accomplish a few milestones along the way, including a Mars flyby in February 2025 that will help propel the spacecraft toward Jupiter's moon through a Mars–Earth gravity assist trajectory. \"After two years of painstaking work on the spacecraft here at JPL, with the help of our partners, it was bittersweet to see the spacecraft encased in its shipping container and on its way to Florida,\" said Jordan Evans, Europa Clipper project manager at JPL. \"But we already have Europa Clipper engineers and technicians at Kennedy who are welcoming this precious cargo and are set to accomplish the final assembly and testing so that we're ready for launch.\" NASA and SpaceX are targeting launch aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy later this year. The launch period opens on Oct. 10. After testing and final preparations are complete, the spacecraft will be encapsulated in a protective payload fairing and moved to the SpaceX hangar at the launch complex. Provided by NASA",

        "content": "The Atlanta Braves reinstated catcher Sean Murphy from the 10-day injured list on Monday, one day after losing reigning National League MVP Ronald Acuna Jr. for the season with a torn left ACL. In addition to placing Acuna on the IL, the Braves recalled fellow outfielder J.P. Martinez from Triple-A Gwinnett and designated recently signed infielder Joey Wendle for assignment. Murphy, 29, has been out since suffering an oblique strain on Opening Day in Philadelphia. The former All-Star and Gold Glove winner batted .278 (5-for-18) with two homers and four RBIs during a four-game rehab assignment at Gwinnett. Murphy is a career .239 hitter with 67 home runs and 215 RBIs in 439 games with the Oakland Athletics (2019-22) and Braves. Acuna, 26, finishes the 2024 season with a .250 batting average, four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 stolen bases through 49 games. The four-time All-Star injured his left knee during a delayed steal attempt in the first inning of Sunday's 8-1 win against the host Pittsburgh Pirates. Martinez, 28, made his major league debut with the Texas Rangers last season and batted .225 with one homer and four RBIs in 17 games. He is hitting .265 with three homers, 12 RBIs and 14 steals in 45 games at Gwinnett this season. Wendle, 34, signed with the Braves on Friday but did not appear in a game for Atlanta. He was released by the New York Mets on May 20 after batting .222 with no home runs and one RBI in 18 games. He is a career .262 hitter with 32 homers and 220 RBIs in 667 games with four teams.

        "content": "Hyderabad: Telangana's Drugs Control Administration has suspended the licenses of six wholesalers for 30 days for illegal procurement of insulin injections, it was announced on Monday. The DCA said that this licence suspension is due to their illegal procurement of insulin injections (pre-filled pens) without purchase bills. The regulator has also initiated prosecution proceedings against the wholesalers. DCA Director General V. B. Kamalasan Reddy said during raids conducted from March 15 to March 20 at six medical distributors in Hyderabad, DCA detected that insulin injections, sourced from New Delhi without purchase bills, were being sold at substantial discounts of more than 40 per cent by these wholesalers. Drug Hub, Sree Thirumala Pharma, Shree Paras Medical Agencies, Sri Ganesh Pharma Distributors, Sree Raja Rajeshwara Distributors, and Sri Balaji Agencies are the wholesalers whose licenses have been suspended. During these special raids, DCA officials seized stocks worth Rs 51.92 lakh, which were illegally procured from Delhi and are suspected to have been illegally diverted from the supply chain, the DG said. Procuring medicines illegally without purchase bills is a violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Illegal procurement of medicines without purchase bills is deemed fraudulent primarily because it involves health and safety risks and tax evasion. The DCA, in addition to launching prosecution against the wholesalers, has taken stringent departmental action by suspending their drug licenses for 30 days, he added.",

Parmita Katkar took to social media to share tips and tricks to make people appear instantly more youthful, recommending one exercise in particular - applying light to the inner eye corners and rocking them back and forth with your finger for about five seconds.

        "description": "If Mitchell Starc decides to drop ODIs from his schedule, it could lead to more appearances in franchise cricket, including the IPL.The post KKR Star Mitchell Starc To Retire From ODIs For Australia? appeared first on News24.",
        "content": "Australia fast-bowler Mitchell Starc hinted at his potential ODI retirement after winning the IPL trophy with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). The left-arm pacer mentioned that with a significant gap before the next one-day World Cup, he might shift his focus to franchise cricket around the world. Mitchell Starc “There is an Impact Player Rule here and not in the T20 World Cup,You cannot put your batting all-rounder at number 8,like you do in the IPL,you will see these kinds of high scores in the T20 WC,purely because there will be one less batter” pic.twitter.com/9j6MPXJJ90 — Sujeet Suman (@sujeetsuman1991) May 27, 2024 Starc’s return to the IPL has been remarkable, culminating in a title win with KKR. After prioritizing international cricket for many years, his decision to rejoin the lucrative league proved beneficial, leading him to consider changing his cricketing commitments and possibly stepping away from ODIs. “The last nine years, I’ve prioritised Australian cricket. I have given myself a chance to give my body a break and spend some time away from cricket with my wife as well, so that’s certainly been where my head’s been for the last nine years,” Starc said at a press conference. “Moving forward... look, I am certainly closer to the end of my career than the start. One format may drop off. There is long time before the next one-day World Cup and whether that format continues for me or not... it may open doors for more franchise cricket.” he added. Starc, who had avoided the IPL during his peak years to concentrate on national duties and manage his workload, shared his thoughts on this shift at a press conference following KKR’s decisive victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the IPL 2024 final. KKR clinched their third IPL title, with Starc playing a crucial role. If Starc decides to drop ODIs from his schedule, it could lead to more appearances in franchise cricket, including the IPL. Despite being the most expensive player in IPL auction history, bought for Rs. 24.75 crore by KKR, Starc had a challenging start to the season, conceding 100 runs in his first two games without taking a wicket. However, his performance improved dramatically as the tournament progressed. Starc’s match-winning figures of 3-34 in Qualifier 1 and 2-14 in the final against SRH highlighted his ability to deliver under pressure. His efforts were key to KKR’s dominant campaign, culminating in a resounding victory in the final. Also Read: SRH Owner Kaviya Maran Addresses SunRisers Hyderabad Dressing Room After Final Loss",

        "content": "magazine described as the \"coolest mum in Cannes\" and it's clear to see why. The 66-year-old actress, most famous for her role in , has been in Cannes hitting the red carpet with style and grace. As well as being the coolest mum in Cannes, she's also the proudest mother, too! The former model's daughter, Margaret Qualley, is having an exceptional Cannes Film Festival after her movie - a grisly horror comedy starring - gained critical acclaim. As well as inheriting beauty, Margaret Qualley also inherited her mother's screen acting talents. On drawing inspiration from her mother, Margaret recently told : \"I was always super proud of my mom. Her job always mattered a lot to her. She’s a really hard worker. And I think it’s part of the reason why I’ve always been able to dream so big is because of her success. It made me believe that the sky’s the limit.\" In recent years, Andie's grey hair has often been the topic of discussion. \"I think it’s more interesting to see me like this,\" MacDowell said back in 2021, when she was discussing her decision to 'embrace' her natural greys on the red carpet at Cannes. \"I suffered in this business as an actress always having people wanting me to look younger. For me, it kind of hurts my heart that I can’t embrace where I am because, honestly, I feel like I am enough right where I am. I don’t want people to have the expectation that I need to look younger to have value, or to be beautiful or desirable.\" In a recent conversation with Katie Couric, the Groundhog Day actress shared her refreshing perspective on ageing in Hollywood. She revealed that since deciding to let her hair go grey, she feels more authentically herself, regardless of public opinion. \"How old do you think I look?\" she asked Katie, \"I'm going to be 65. What do you think I look, 75, just because I let my hair go grey? I don't care. I want to be old.\" \"I'm tired of trying to be young. I don't want to be young, I've been young,\" the actress confessed, expressing that the effort of maintaining a youthful appearance in the midst of other health and beauty routines was simply too much hard work. \"To be an older person trying to be young, what an effort,\" she said. \"I just can't keep up the charade! I can't!\" Andie revealed that embracing her natural salt-and-pepper hair had surprising benefits. \"As it was growing out, my eyes popped and the colour of them looked a little different. My skin looked better,\" she noted. \"It empowered me more. I felt more powerful and I felt more genuine and I felt more myself.\" She also confessed that she had been considering this move for quite some time, but had often been discouraged from showcasing her natural hair colour. \"It was something I wanted young, at a younger age, I thought that it would suit me,\" she shared, \"I thought it would look good on my face. \"And when it started growing out during COVID, I saw I was right...It looks good on me.\" Whilst open to changing her mind in the future, Andie highlighted the fantastic aspect of beauty, stating, \"We have a lot of options.\"",

        "description": "The Filipino citizenship of Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo lies with the nationality of her mother Amelia Leal Guo, a retired justice of the Supreme Court said on Monday.",
        "content": "The Filipino citizenship of Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo lies with the nationality of her mother Amelia Leal Guo, a retired justice of the Supreme Court said on Monday. According to Joseph Morong's report on \"24 Oras,\" retired Associate Justice Vicente Mendoza said it was enough for Guo to have a Filipino mother under the 1987 Constitution. Guo had declared in Senate hearings that her father was Chinese and that her mother was a Filipino. \"(Under the 1987 Constitution)... it is enough that a person was born of a Filipino mother. Tama na 'yun. Hindi na kailangan siya'y nag-elect ng Filipino citizenship,\" Mendoza told GMA Integrated News. (That is enough. One doesn't have to elect Filipino citizenship.) In a statement, Guo had said that she was a love child of her parents after her father made her mother, a house helper, pregnant. Records of the Senate inquiry showed that both father and mother do not have birth records with the Philippine Statistics Authority. He added that it was important to establish Guo’s citizenship because of national security concerns. \"In the first place, totoo bang Pilipino ang nanay niya? Kasi pwedeng 'yan ay planted lamang,\" Mendoza said. \"Meron ba siyang Filipino mother? Or siya ba’y isinulpot lamang at dayuhan talaga sya? ‘Yung nanay ba nya’ ipinanganak doon? Bakit walang record 'ata?” she added. (Is it true that her mother is Filipino? She could have been just planted. Does she have a Filipino mother? Or did she just appear and is actually a foreigner? Was her mother born there? Why doesn't she have any record, it appears?) The Office of the Solicitor General is investigating if there are sufficient grounds to file a quo warranto proceeding against Guo. Guo's lawyer Stephen David said the mayor's camp would answer the question in the OSG's investigation. He added that the camp would release photos of the mayor's mother to prove that she is a Filipino. \"Pilipino ang nanay n'ya; iniwan lang sya,\" David told GMA Integrated News. (Her mother is Filipino, she just left Mayor Guo.) \"Naghahanap s’ya. ‘Yun nga ‘yun sabi ko sa next hearing ilabas lahat ‘yang mga ‘yan. Meron, may mga albums,\" he added. (I told her to release her mother's photos in the next hearing. There are photos in the albums. She is looking for it.) David said the problem was Guo had yet to meet her mother. \"Kaya sana lumabas 'yung mother niya para ma-DNA natin,\" David said. (We hope her mother would surface so we can subject her to a DNA test.) —Celine Serquiña/NB, GMA Integrated News",

        "content": "The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Monday, has affirmed Usman Ododo as the authentic Governor of Kogi state. The tribunal dismissed the petition filed by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its governorship candidate, Murtala Ajaka. The verdict was passed by the three-member panel of the tribunal, led by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu. Related Stories Money laundering: Court blocks Yahaya Bello’s move to stop arraignment, knocks former governor WHO to commence HPV vaccination in Kogi state on May 27 Nairametrics previously reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared the candidate.of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Usman Ododo, as the winner of the keenly contested November 11, 2023 Kogi State Governorship Election. The state Returning Officer, Prof Johnson Urama, who is the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academics) of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, announced Ododo as the winner at 10:23 pm on Sunday, November 12, 2023. According to the announced results, Ododo polled 446,237 votes, to beat his closest rival, Murtala Ajaka of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), who scored 259,052, while Dino Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) polled 46,362 votes. However, the petitioners approached the tribunal seeking an overturn of the election results and an order directing INEC to conduct a fresh election in about five LGAs. If the tribunal agrees with the petitioners to order a rerun, it implies that taxpayers’ money will be used in conducting fresh elections. Ajaka’s legal team led by Joseph Okutepa(SAN) had challenged the poll on the grounds of alleged forgery, voting and non-compliance to the Electoral Act. The petitioner called 25 witnesses from the five Local Government Areas including Adavi, and Okene LGAs, and they challenged the results from the disputed polling units. The petitioners alleged that over-voting occurred in 5 local government areas of Kogi state including Adavi, Okene, Okeyi, and LGAs. They claimed that Ododo tendered false information to INEC. However, the APC legal team led by Emmanuel Ukala challenged the competence of the witnesses presented by the petitioner. Counsel for INEC, Kanu Agabi (SAN) maintained that the witnesses presented by the petitioner are incompetent because “they are not the makers” of the electoral documents submitted as exhibits. The respondents maintained that the exhibits touching on forgery and overvoting are “mere photocopies” that cannot be relied upon by any court. But Pius Akubo, who represented the petitioners during one of the proceedings, argued that the allegation that his clients did not call the makers of the exhibits is misleading, adding that the documents are certified true copies from respective institutions including INEC. Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu held that from the decisions of the Supreme Court on the 2023 presidential and governorship elections, statements of witnesses must be filed along with a petition, not during a petition. “The petitioners have failed to file their witness statements (of PW1) on oath along with the petition, within the given time,” the judge said while expunging the exhibits tendered by the petitioners. He added that “the piece of oral evidence made by the petitioner’s witnesses are “hearsay evidence” as they are not the makers of the exhibits tendered before the tribunal. The tribunal dismissed the petition and affirmed the election of Ododo while holding that the petitioner could not prove that the governor presented a forged certificate. The judge held that the witnesses presented by the petitioners were not polling unit agents or INEC presiding officers. A governor is an elected official who is in charge of the state affairs including its internally generated and federally allocated revenues. By the judgment of the tribunal, Ododo has been backed by the tribunal to continue discharging his duties as Kogi State governor. Ododo took over from ex-governor Yahaya Bello and he served as former Local Government Auditor-General in Kogi state.",

        "content": "In a shocking development, the prestigious Dalton School in the US is embroiled in controversy after a former student accused a high school teacher of sexual abuse. The accused teacher, Mara Naaman, has tendered her resignation four days after The Dalton School received a letter regarding the alleged misconduct. According to the report published by the , the 50-year-old English teacher allegedly abused the former student between 2020 and 2022. The Dalton School took immediate action by holding an assembly to inform high school students about the ongoing investigation. An email from Principal Jose De Jesus emphasised the importance of verifying the claims and identifying any other potential victims. ''We are only providing the name of the teacher so anyone with relevant information can provide such information. Our priority is determining the veracity of these claims and determining whether there are other allegations of abuse from other members of the community,\" an email from Principal Jesus said. The school filed a police report and hired a specialised firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations of harassment and sexual abuse. Before joining The Dalton School in 2017, Mara Naaman was a tenured Assistant Professor of Arabic and Comparative Literature at Williams College in Massachusetts. Her scholarly work has been published in various journals, including the Journal of Arabic Literature. At The Dalton School, Naaman taught English literature to students in grades nine through 12. The prestigious institution charges a hefty tuition fee of USD 61,000 per year. This is not the first time The Dalton School has faced controversy. In 2018, former headmaster Gardner Dunnan was accused in a federal lawsuit of sexually abusing a 14-year-old student who lived with him and his wife in 1986. The school gained further notoriety during the trial of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier and convicted sex offender. Epstein worked as a physics and math teacher at The Dalton School in 1973.",

        "content": "South Lake Tahoe residents will vote on a measure to tax property owners who leave homes empty for more than half a year. (Dreamstime/TNS) Owning a vacation home in South Lake Tahoe could get more costly if residents approve a ballot measure that imposes a tax of up to $6,000 on housing units left vacant for more than half a year. The measure, dubbed the “South Lake Tahoe Vacancy Tax,” aims to penalize homeowners who leave thousands of homes empty in the mountain resort town; the tax penalties would go toward affordable housing, road repair and public transportation. The measure is an attempt to incentivize homeowners to rent properties out rather than leaving them vacant. Locals for Affordable Housing, the nonprofit leading the initiative, said it collected nearly 2,500 signatures to place the tax measure on the November ballot — more than the 1,159 needed. “Since January, we have connected with thousands of community members outside local grocery stores and in neighborhoods across the city and were met with widespread support and gratitude that something was being done to address the skyrocketing cost of housing,” said Nick Speal, co-founder of the nonprofit. “The housing crisis has reached a tipping point, with locals forced to leave the community due to a critical shortage of affordable housing.” South Lake Tahoe is the latest California city to consider a vacancy tax as a way to address a housing shortage. Oakland, San Francisco and Berkeley have approved similar initiatives; voters in Santa Cruz rejected one two years ago. Los Angeles considered a vacancy tax four years ago, but it went nowhere. Amelia Richmond, who founded Locals for Affordable Housing with Speal, said the tax proposal in South Lake Tahoe is modeled after Berkeley’s initiative. If approved, the city would impose a $3,000 tax on homes that are left unoccupied for more than six months in a year, and $6,000 every year thereafter for repeat offenders. The law, which would go into effect in 2026, would exempt properties under renovation, seasonal cabins, homeowners who are in elder care facilities, those who work as wildland firefighters and residents on military deployments. In South Lake Tahoe, a little more than 40% of housing units are used as vacation homes or rentals. In all, there are 16,275 units, and 7,150 sit vacant for most of the year, according to the 2022 American Community Survey and city records. Proponents say that if 20% of those homes were sold or rented to local residents for six months or more, about 1,430 housing units would be added, while taxes on the remaining vacant homes would generate more than $34 million each year for affordable housing, road repair, and essential services. A 2022 survey by the Tahoe Prosperity Center, a nonprofit that conducts economic and development research on the Lake Tahoe Basin, found that median home prices had tripled in nine years, from $345,000 in 2012 to $950,000 in 2021, far above what people in the region can afford. In South Lake Tahoe, the median household income is $67,686, below the state’s $91,905, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Researchers with the center noted in 2021 that the region had seen a drop in the number of year-round residents and school enrollments, and a less young workforce. They correlated those decreases to the housing crisis. But the proposed tax measure has created a rift among the townspeople, especially between owners of second homes and young workers who say a lack of housing options, low wages and high living costs are pricing them out of the region. In an effort to defeat the measure, a coalition of residents, small business owners and real estate agents have formed a coalition called Stop the South Tahoe Vacancy Tax. “After all the promises from the backers of this measure, voters will be shocked to hear that nothing in this proposal requires the city to produce a single new unit of affordable housing, or even to spend a single penny on housing affordability at all,” the group’s website reads. “We all want to address housing affordability in South Tahoe, but this measure is not the answer, and will likely make things worse.” Steve Teshara, co-founder of the coalition, said construction of affordable housing in South Lake City has been limited by development standards that dictate where and how much of the area the city can build on. Teshara said a 248-unit affordable housing project now under construction was made possible only because of an executive order by Gov. Gavin Newsom that opened some types of state land for the development of affordable housing. Teshara believes city leaders are doing their best to provide housing. “But simply throwing money at the problem when there’s not enough land zoned property or not enough density allowed in certain areas isn’t really going to solve the problem, and that’s our principal concern,” he said. He and others say the measure is a form of taxation without representation, because homeowners who don’t live in South Lake Tahoe won’t be allowed to vote on the measure in November. Opponents also question the city’s ability to enforce the new law. Richmond said she is worried that second-home owners may try and register to vote using their South Lake Tahoe addresses, even though they don’t live there full time — a violation of election laws. The division over the measure was visible when residents spoke during a three-hour City Council meeting in February. “This town has and always will be 40% owned by second-home owners,” Dan Brown, a longtime resident, told the council. “This is what this town has been for [a long] time.” Dan May, another longtime resident, said he supported the initiative because it seemed fair. “It gives homeowners a choice, a choice to either live here and participate in our community or pay additional taxes to help support the community that they love,” he said. “And if they don’t agree with it, they have the ability to sell it to someone who does agree with those options.” Some speakers said the measure put an unfair burden on them to fix the region’s housing crisis. They urged city leaders to find alternative options, such as loans and tapping into state programs to renovate abandoned buildings. Christopher Rowe, a buyer for a large outdoor store who has lived in South Lake Tahoe for more than 30 years, said that while he understood both sides, he supported the measure. “The Tahoe property you [bought] 30 or 50 years ago, if the vacancy tax passes, which I hope it does, it will cost you a little more to keep it as an empty,” Rowe said. “But if you really care about South Lake Tahoe, you should be fine chipping in a little bit, because you have an empty house, and there’s no real way to deny keeping a house empty is chipping away at the community and causing a slight detriment. “When you get 40% of the houses doing that, it makes a difference,” he added. Richmond said the measure is not meant to divide the town but rather is an effort to preserve what she considers to be a more livable mountain resort than others where residents and workers have been priced out, such as Aspen, Colorado, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “This isn’t about residents versus second-home owners,” she said. “This is about making it a community for all of us and to make it sustainable and not follow in the trajectory of these other resort towns.”",

The Duke of Sussex, who will be turning 40-year-old on September 15, is all set to mark his life's major milestone with his wife Meghan Markle, kids and his cousins, claimed a royal expert. In a conversation with The Mirror , Tom Quinn said, \"If any of key members of the Royal Family are involved in Harry's 40th birthday celebrations it will be Beatrice and Eugenie, but this presents a problem for Harry.\" The royal commentator added, \"He would love to have his cousins, but he will draw the line at Prince Andrew and that upsets Beatrice and Eugenie who are loyal to their father and desperate to see him brought in from the cold in some way. Harry needs all the friends he can get but there are limits.\" Notably, Tom also mentioned that Harry's alliance with Beatrice and Eugenie might leave Prince William and Kate 'worried.' The expert shared that the Prince and Princess of Wales \"sense that Beatrice and Eugenie feel that, as virtual outcasts themselves, they have far more in common with Harry and Megan than with any other part of the family.\"",

        "content": "NEWS In a statement released on Monday , the department urged members of the public who experience suspected symptoms of Mpox to visit their nearest healthcare providers for screening and testing to ensure early diagnosis and effective treatment, preventing further spread of the disease. The warning follows the country's second laboratory-confirmed case of Mpox. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. READ: Big legal battle ahead over NHI It can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and a fever. Most people fully recover, but some can become very ill. Mpox can spread through contact with infected persons via touch: According to the department, the new patient is a 39-year-old male admitted to Addington Hospital in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, with no travel history to regions currently experiencing an outbreak. The department said that it was collaborating with the province and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) to activate contact tracing and case finding to identify and assess people who have been in contact with the patient, aiming to prevent further transmission, particularly at the household and community levels. The statement read: According to the WHO, the multi-country outbreak of Mpox resulted in a total of 466 laboratory-confirmed cases and three deaths across 22 countries in March 2024, indicating that low-level transmission continues globally. The health organisation adds that the most affected regions include Africa, Europe, the Americas, the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia. The WHO said: The department said stigma and discrimination could prolong a disease outbreak by preventing people from seeking information, testing or care, thus undermining public health efforts. The WHO recommends that people at high risk of contracting the disease get vaccinated to prevent infection with Mpox, especially during an outbreak. READ: Foot and mouth disease threatens emerging farmers in Eastern Cape's Kouga municipality High-risk groups include health workers at risk of exposure, men who have sex with men, people with multiple sex partners and sex workers. \"Persons who have Mpox should be cared for away from other people,\" the WHO stated. The department of health urged the public and communities to support those who test positive for Mpox and to encourage those with suspected symptoms to go for screening and testing instead of discriminating against them. In the same statement, the department noted that the country was currently experiencing its annual influenza (flu) season, which began in the week of 22 April 2024. The statement read: It added that the most commonly detected and circulating influenza subtypes were A(H1N1) pdm09, previously known as \"swine flu\", followed by influenza B/Victoria and influenza A(H3N2). The statement added that the Influenza A virus was more severe in adults. \"About 8-10% of patients hospitalised for pneumonia and 25% of patients with flu-like illness (fever and cough) will test positive for influenza during the flu season in South Africa.\" READ: SA on track to eliminate malaria by 2028, despite climate challenge According to NICD surveillance data, the number of influenza cases and positivity rates are increasing rapidly, but the transmission and impact remain at a moderate level of activity for both outpatient and hospitalised cases. \"This means that while there is a lot of influenza circulating, it is still within the expected range for a normal influenza season,\" the department concluded.",

        "content": "To improve your local-language experience, sometimes we employ an auto-translation plugin. Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. In Brief Ethereum Layer 2 rollup Taiko deployed its protocol on mainnet, enabling users to transfer ETH to Taiko through its official bridge. Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution (TAIKO) disclosed the deployment of its protocol on the Ethereum mainnet. Now, users can transfer ETH to Taiko through its official bridge. Currently, there are 15-minute quotas for bridging back from Taiko to Ethereum, with plans for gradual increments and eventual removal in the future. Transitioning from Layer 1 to Layer two does not entail any quotas. Additionally, regular users can engage with decentralized applications (dApps) by exchanging, borrowing, or staking ETH, with the promise of more projects slated for deployment in the coming times. Furthermore, developers are encouraged to operate a node or suggest and prove blocks within the Taiko network. Proposing and validating blocks is a crucial and permissionless process that ensures its vitality and security. However, during the initial weeks, only the Taiko team will handle block proposing and proving. This approach aims to ensure the network is stabilized before opening up the process for wider participation. Furthermore, Taiko has launched the allocation checker for the forthcoming TAIKO token distribution. The utilization of this allocation checker may potentially augment users’ TAIKO allocation, as stated in the announcement on social media platform X. Taiko has deployed a based contestable rollup (BCR) on Ethereum’s mainnet. BCR is a type of rollup that merges based sequencing and a contestation mechanism with multi-proofs, a concept introduced by the project in December last year. At present, Taiko’s Raiko multi-prover system incorporates SGX proofs, which are fine-tuned to achieve proof (ZKP) speeds akin to those of optimistic rollups. Looking ahead, the project aims to introduce additional validity proofs utilizing systems such as Risc0-zkVM, SP1 zkVM, and similar technologies. Dear Taiko Community, We are beyond excited to announce that after two years of hard work, the Taiko protocol has been deployed on Ethereum mainnet! 🥳 Let's look at how you can start exploring Taiko today: 1/ Taiko operates as a based rollup, leveraging Ethereum block validators to sequence transactions, drawing advantages from the liveliness and security guarantees offered by the underlying layer. Initially, Taiko’s rollup protocol contracts on Ethereum are managed through a multi-signature arrangement. The protocol mandates SGX proofs at the initial phases, while its future roadmap aimed at transitioning to requiring 50% of blocks to use ZKPs as part of its extended scaling and security approach. Additionally, Taiko integrates a Type-1 zero-knowledge virtual machine engineered to mimic the architecture and integrates a multi-proof proving system. This mechanism bolsters security by facilitating the submission and contestation of various proof types. Taiko plans to introduce its native token, TAIKO, in the coming weeks following the mainnet launch. Additionally, the project plans to roll out a points incentive program known as Trailblazers. This initiative aims to foster community engagement by incentivizing users for task completion and network interaction. Recently, the project announced a genesis airdrop, with plans to distribute 5% of its total token supply, amounting to 1 billion tokens, to community members.

        "content": "The Elden Ring: DLC story trailer left us with more questions than answers, but some things are starting to become clearer. Spoilers for the base game lurk below. With Elden Ring’s DLC now only a matter of weeks away, the story trailer has given us some more clues as to what’s going on – and it seems to be much more than simply a battle between and the fiery new villain, . The trailer seems to suggest that Messmer has always been an important figure in the story of . However, both Shadow of the Erdtree trailers have implied that everything about this figure has been scrubbed from the historical record – and we’re likely about to find out why. New Elden Lord Miquella has always been a wild card in the Elden Ring story. After all, if you kill every major boss in the game, then he’s the only demigod child of Marika left alive. This led many fans to correctly assume he’d play a major role in the DLC. However, many of us believed he’d be a vengeful figure, seeking retribution on the Tarnished for , while simultaneously attempting to wrestle power from them. We were led to believe that Miquella had mutated into a twisted, misshapen creature, languishing in a cracked egg in Mohg’s palace, tragically destined to never reach his potential. This is typical grimdark FromSoft storytelling. Miquella was touted as the best of Marika and Radagon’s children, and a truly benevolent figure who aimed to heal the world and everyone in it. Sadly, his dreams were cut short by the Shattering War and being kidnapped by his ambitious half-brother. However, the Shadow of the Erdtree story trailer suggests that much of what we know of Miquella’s fate was a ruse, and that he’s still very much working towards healing the world. He’s also trying to save it from being consumed by something worse than or the other fallen demigods, something locked away by his family – Messmer. Related: The trailer suggests that the Tarnished may actually be an ally to Miquella, with the “Will you walk with us?” question being the main indicator. It’s also entirely possible that the creature in the egg in Mohg’s Palace is a reborn Messmer rather than Miquella. The claw certainly looks like it could be one of Messmer’s appendages, but this raises the question of where Miquella has been all this time. Marika’s dark past While the trailer ramps up the intrigue regarding Miquella and Messmer it also focuses heavily on Marika, the goddess of the Lands Between, whose shattering of the Elden Ring began the story, and the mother of the various demigods. The Shadow of the Erdtree story trailer all but confirms that Messmer is also one of Marika’s children. Not only is this indicated by Messmer’s design and name (also beginning with an M), but the trailer mentions “The Seduction and the Betrayal”, not to mention an “affair from which Gold arose”. The gold is likely a reference to The Golden Order, the official name of Marika’s dynasty, religion, and overall way of life in the Lands Between. However, in the trailer, we can see Marika pulling golden strands from a rather suggestive opening, which may be from another defeated godlike figure she has usurped in some way. It’s also worth pointing out that these golden strands can be seen on her hammer much later, once she has seized power and become a goddess. The implication here is that Marika’s power has been taken by force or subterfuge. Marika has had two consorts in the Elden Ring backstory, each one becoming Elden Lord upon marrying her. The first was , who she had her first round of children with, and the second was , her former general with whom she had more children after Godfrey was no longer of use to her. The big twist at the end of Elden Ring is that Radagon and Marika are the same person, with Radagon essentially being a male avatar of Marika (and one she’s able to breed with), meaning his children with his first wife are all technically Marika’s demigod offspring too, rather than her adopted step-children. Messmer: The forgotten son Our theory is that Messmer is the result of an earlier “affair, seduction, and betrayal” with a previously unknown consort. We suspect that this series of events led to the creation of Messmer, but the character later led some form of revolt against Marika and he was ultimately imprisoned and expunged from the record. The trailer also says, “And so too was Shadow born”, suggesting that Marika’s affair led to the creation of the Land of Shadow – where the DLC will be set. One guess is that the Land of Shadow is where Messmer is imprisoned or was ravaged by the war seen in the trailer, becoming a lost realm. The narrator in the trailer says, “What followed was a war unseen. One that could never be put to song. A purge without Grace or honor. The tyranny of Messmer’s flame.” This “flame” could imply that the character has allied himself with those who are loyal to the Frenzied Flame – a faction that wants to bring about the end of the world. Or he could have allied himself with the , a race who also went to war with Marika during her conquest of the Lands Between. Either action would likely have seen Messmer banished or locked away somewhere, unable to return. Messmer could be motivated by Marika’s earlier betrayal, or he could be the betrayer. After all, this wouldn’t be the first time Marika had abandoned one of her less-than-perfect children, with Mohg and also being shunned, but this was due to their deformity from the Omen curse rather than their actions. And that was to two loyal sons, imagine what she’d do to a disloyal one. Where does Miquella fit in? Miquella’s plan in the base game of Elden Ring was to find a way to cure his siblings of their various afflictions and create the Haligtree to replace the Erdtree as a safe haven for those unwelcome in Marika’s Golden Order. This always suggested that Miquella wasn’t fully behind Marika, and that he had his own vision for the Lands Between. As Miquella and Messmer seem to be being pitted against one another in Shadow of the Erdtree, it may be the case that Miquella learned about Marika’s shameful secret involving the “seduction, affair, and betrayal”, which could be the reason why he set out on his own. If the creature in Mohg’s egg is indeed Messmer, then this could have been either his or Marika’s plan to get rid of the fallen demigod. Whatever the case may be, the , likely involving the creature in the egg in some way. While that creature could be Miquella or Messmer, the story trailer gives us some small insight into what’s happened in the past. But in true FromSoftware fashion, the whole story will only become clear from in-game storytelling and clues. And even then, this may only be one interpretation. Until the DLC arrives, here’s . There’s also a regarding the Sites of Grace to consider, and why we think when it comes to Elden Ring,",

        "content": "NAGS HEAD — The weight of a plastic shopping bag may seem inconsequential, but across the Outer Banks the past few years, women have diligently collected, weighed and shipped off 3,500 pounds of plastic bags for their conversion into weather-resistant outdoor benches. “That’s a lot of plastic that didn’t go into the environment,” said Dawn Bratburd, who co-chairs the Outer Banks Woman’s Club’s environment committee with Deb Howell. On April 25, the fog and chilly breeze did nothing to dampen the spirits of event attendees at the club’s sixth bench dedication. This most recent bench, representing 1,000 pounds of plastic, is now at the Community Care Clinic of Dare, located at 425 Health Center Drive in Nags Head. “We are so grateful to you all,” Lyn Jenkins, executive director of the Community Care Clinic, said in her event remarks. “We have a lot of people that need a comfortable bench.” Jenkins said some patients at the clinic, which serves the uninsured and the under-insured, are dropped off and can find themselves waiting for five hours for the county’s medical transportation to pick them back up. The bench could also be useful for “someone at the dental clinic with a child, or maybe someone who doesn’t like to hear dental drills wants to wait out there.” The gray bench is situated under a roof that covers the outside walkway area on the dental side of the clinic. The Outer Banks Woman’s Club distributed its first five benches to locations from Southern Shores to Nags Head in recent years. While other community groups have since begun using the Trex program to convert bags to benches, the 93-member-strong Outer Banks Woman’s Club was the first local organization to do so, according to Bratburd. They maintain bins at the Thomas A. Baum Senior Center in Kill Devil Hills, the Outer Banks Family YMCA in Nags Head and Coldwell Banker Seaside Realty in Kitty Hawk. Club members collect the plastic bags a couple times a week, weigh and record the poundage and take the bags to Harris Teeter in Kill Devil Hills. Harris Teeter sends the bags to Trex, and the club is “very thankful” for the store’s assistance, Bratburd said. Club member Janet Barker had worked with the program in Virginia before she moved here and introduced the club to the program, according to Jo Williams, a former environment committee chair. Williams wasn’t sure they’d be able to collect the necessary 500 pounds of plastic in six months when they first began. “I mean, it sounded like a lot, but we had no problem doing that,” Williams said. “And we’ve gotten more and more and more as time has gone by.” Other local groups started collected bags, and about 12 benches in total have come to the community, Williams said. “Everybody loves this project; everybody wants to bring their plastic in...and it it’s really grown,” Jo Williams said. The benches are like Trex railings and deck furniture and withstand the elements well, she noted. “They’re made for the beach, so hopefully they’ll be around for a long, long time,” Williams said.",

        "content": "TOKYO - The Japanese government has agreed to consider extending its current visa exemption for Thai nationals as the exemption is set to expire soon. Japan has been offering visa exemptions for Thai visitors since July 2013 to revive its tourism industry which was badly hit after the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster. The country extends this temporary measure every three years with the latest visa exemption validity set to expire in 2025, prompting fears that the policy might not be renewed. A fresh meeting in this regard has proven to be fruitful as Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa and his Japanese counterpart Yoko Kamikawa met in Tokyo this week and discussed the issue. The focus of the meeting was investment and trade; however, visa exemption was also brought under discussion with the Japanese side assuring Thailand that it would consider extending the visa exemption. The policy in place permits Thai tourists to enter Japan without a visa for up to 15 days and a visible effect of the policy is that over 900,000 Thais visited Japan last year and contributed to its economy besides cementing people-to-people contact. The government of Thailand and especially Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin are making every possible effort to ink visa-free agreements with other countries. A notable success in this regard is the visa-free agreement inked with China on a permanent basis; the agreement is effective from March this year. Thailand has been progressively easing visa regulations for travelers from various countries, including Russia. The government recently announced a 60-day visa-free policy for Russian visitors, effective from May 1 to July 31, 2024. This new policy replaces the previous arrangement, which allowed Russian citizens to stay in Thailand for up to 90 days, from November 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024. Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has gone a mile more and has also advocated for a joint visa program with five neighboring countries to attract long-haul and high-spending travelers. Leaders from Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Vietnam have explored plans for a Schengen-style visa though nothing official has been announced as of now. The pro-tourism measures of Thailand are bearing fruit as during the first quarter of 2024, the country hosted over nine million tourists.",

        "content": "The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Thursday seeking to break up Live Nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster, alleging it has hurt consumers and violated antitrust laws by exercising outsize control over the live events industry. The suit, filed in the Southern District of New York and backed by attorneys general for 29 states plus Washington, D.C., alleges that Live Nation has engaged in practices that harm the entire live entertainment industry — from artists and fans to venues and startups seeking to break into the business. It says Live Nation directly manages more than 400 musical artists, controls 60% of concert promotions at major venues and, through Ticketmaster, controls roughly 80% or more of major concert venues' ticketing — plus a growing share of the resale market. \"Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news release. \"The result is that fans pay more in fees, artists have fewer opportunities to play concerts, smaller promoters get squeezed out, and venues have fewer real choices for ticketing services. It is time to break up Live Nation.\" Among the accusations against Live Nation: That it has worked with a venue management firm called Oak View Group to steer clients to sign exclusive agreements to use Ticketmaster.

        "content": "Two years ago, many Taylor Swift fans launched an online campaign with one big goal: break up Ticketmaster. After news broke that the Justice Department sued Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, some Swifties said they felt like their mobilization efforts paid off. \"It shows the power of bringing people together who have something in common, and it might not be what you would expect they have in common,\" said Stephanie Aly, a writer and digital organizer in New York. The 34-year-old was among the Swifties who banded together in 2022 to collect thousands of survey responses from fellow fans who shared negative similar experiences with Ticketmaster. Swifties are \"out there getting people to vote in the VMAs and buy albums on release day and all that kind of stuff,\" Aly said. \"So what if we could point that energy towards something that can make a bigger difference than just album sales?\" Frustration over the ticketing company began to boil over in late 2022 after overloaded presale queues for the domestic leg of Swift's 2023 \"Eras Tour\" caused the site to crash and led Ticketmaster to cancel the sale. The fiasco soon drew the attention of Swift herself, who called it \"excruciating\" to watch. It prompted an apology from Ticketmaster and a promise to grant a second opportunity for some fans to snag the tickets they missed. For years, fans have complained about Ticketmaster, which has effectively become the default ticketing platform for many artists. Live Nation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, controls an estimated 70% of the ticketing and live-event venues market, though the companies have disputed that figure. Many artists have also pushed for ticketing reform at a federal level with no luck. Pearl Jam tried to push the issue forward 30 years ago when the rock band's members testified before Congress, saying Ticketmaster had... Angela Yang",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES — When \"Red, White & Royal Blue\" debuted last summer, it did so without fanfare or spectacle, landing squarely amid historic Hollywood strikes that precluded its stars from lending their press-friendly faces to promote the movie. But the lack of publicity surrounding the Amazon Studios rom-com's premiere didn't deter it from becoming a hit with audiences. The streaming service said it was the top watched film on its platform for weeks, and that it brought in a surge of subscribers. As a further testament to the movie's success, the studio recently announced — amid a determined Emmy campaign — that a sequel was in the works, which is no small feat given the slowed production that has followed the resolution of the strikes. For stars Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez, watching the film gain that kind of organic fanbase was particularly meaningful because of the role \"Red, White & Royal Blue\" plays in queer storytelling. \"After filming and kind of getting some space from it is when I really realized what this was going to do for the community.

Fans will know the Mexican American comedian from his Showtime stand-up special \"Stay at Home Son\" and the web series \"Tacos Con Todo,\" where he meets celebrity guests at popular taquerías in Los Angeles. He was also a staff writer for Hulu's highly praised comedy series \"This Fool.\" Jesus Trejo said his \"rich upbringing as a Mexican American in Long Beach with immigrant parents is the basis for my storytelling.\" Courtesy of PBS SoCal Now, Trejo wants to carry over that authenticity as the host and executive producer of the new documentary series \"Roots of Comedy,\" which premieres on the PBS website and app on Friday, and on broadcast on June 21. The series profiles six up and coming comics. Trejo says viewers will be able to meet their diverse families, see how they live, and share in the experiences that feed into their jokes...

But the lack of publicity surrounding the Amazon Studios rom-com's premiere didn't deter it from becoming a hit with audiences. The streaming service said it was the top watched film on its platform for weeks, and that it brought in a surge of subscribers. As a further testament to the movie's success, the studio recently announced — amid a determined Emmy campaign — that a sequel was in the works, which is no small feat given the slowed production that has followed the resolution of the strikes. For stars Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez, watching the film gain that kind of organic fanbase was particularly meaningful because of the role \"Red, White & Royal Blue\" plays in queer storytelling. \"After filming and kind of getting some space from it is when I really realized what this was going to do for the community.

        "content": "Two years ago, many Taylor Swift fans launched an online campaign with one big goal: break up Ticketmaster. After news broke that the Justice Department sued Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, some Swifties said they felt like their mobilization efforts paid off. \"It shows the power of bringing people together who have something in common, and it might not be what you would expect they have in common,\" said Stephanie Aly, a writer and digital organizer in New York. The 34-year-old was among the Swifties who banded together in 2022 to collect thousands of survey responses from fellow fans who shared negative similar experiences with Ticketmaster. Swifties are \"out there getting people to vote in the VMAs and buy albums on release day and all that kind of stuff,\" Aly said. \"So what if we could point that energy towards something that can make a bigger difference than just album sales?\" Frustration over the ticketing company began to boil over in late 2022 after overloaded presale queues for the domestic leg of Swift's 2023 \"Eras Tour\" caused the site to crash and led Ticketmaster to cancel the sale. The fiasco soon drew the attention of Swift herself, who called it \"excruciating\" to watch. It prompted an apology from Ticketmaster and a promise to grant a second opportunity for some fans to snag the tickets they missed. For years, fans have complained about Ticketmaster, which has effectively become the default ticketing platform for many artists. Live Nation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, controls an estimated 70% of the ticketing and live-event venues market, though the companies have disputed that figure. Many artists have also pushed for ticketing reform at a federal level with no luck. Pearl Jam tried to push the issue forward 30 years ago when the rock band's members testified before Congress, saying Ticketmaster had... Angela Yang",

In 2023, making their first appearance in the TBL postseason, the Rebels fell to the Patroons 111-96 at the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany. Reading finished the 2024 regular season with its best record (19-5) to date and finished second in the Atlantic Northeast division behind the Frederick Flying Cows (20-4).

Reading split the regular season series against Albany with each team winning its respective matchup at home. Aquille Carr leads the Rebels in scoring and is averaging 22.2 points per game. Javon Adams, a 6-9 power forward who is a Reading native, is averaging 18.4 points per game and is second on the team in rebounds with 7.4.

Quadir Welton, a 6-8 forward from Philadelphia and St. Peter’s University graduate, leads the Rebels in rebounds with 12.2 points per game and is averaging 18.1 points. In the regular season finale on Thrusday, Lee scored a team-high 34 points and made four 3-pointers, while Adams scored 26 points and had 10 rebounds.

        "content": "By MARYCLAIRE DALE AP Legal Affairs Writer PHILADELPHIA — The family of the youngest person ever executed in the state of Pennsylvania — a Black 16-year-old sent to the electric chair in 1931 and exonerated by the governor in 2022 — is suing Delaware County, which prosecuted him. Alexander McClay Williams was convicted of murder in the October 1930 icepick stabbing of a white woman in her cottage on the grounds of his reform school. Vida Robare, 34, had been stabbed 47 times. Her ex-husband, who also worked at the school, reported finding the body, and a photograph of an adult’s bloody handprint, taken at the scene, was examined by two fingerprint experts. But that wasn’t mentioned at the trial, nor was the fact that she had been granted a divorce on the grounds of “extreme cruelty.” The 5-foot-5, 125-pound Williams instead quickly became a suspect, even though his hands were smaller, there were no eyewitnesses and no evidence linked him to the crime. He was held for days of interrogation without his parents or a lawyer on hand, and ultimately signed three confessions, researchers found. He was convicted by an all-white jury on Jan. 7, 1931, and executed five months later, on June 8. “They murdered him,” Susie Williams Carter, 94, of Chester, the last surviving sibling in the family of 13 children, said at a press conference. “They need to pay for killing my brother.” She was only about a year old at the time, and her parents, devastated, did not talk about it much. They had run a boarding house in Coatesville, but abandoned the business and left town as the scandal garnered national attention, she said. “This tragedy haunted the family, haunted the parents, haunted Susie, haunted (trial lawyer) William Ridley and his family,” said Philadelphia lawyer Joseph Marrone, who filed the federal lawsuit on Friday against Delaware County and the estates of two detectives and a prosecutor who had pursued the case. “There was nothing to connect him to the murder. He was a convenient Black boy at the hands of these detectives and this prosecutor,” Marrone said. Gov. Tom Wolf apologized on behalf of Pennsylvania when he exonerated Williams, and called his execution “an egregious miscarriage of justice.” District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said the teen’s constitutional rights had been violated, and a Delaware County judge vacated the conviction. Williams had been sent to the Glen Mills School for Boys for starting a fire that burned down a barn, Carter said. The 193-year-old school closed in 2019 after a Philadelphia Inquirer investigation into decades-long allegations of child abuse. Author and educator Samuel Lemon had known about the case since he was a child because Williams was defended at trial by his great-grandfather, William H. Ridley. The only Black lawyer in Delaware County at the time, Ridley had been paid $10 for the trial, with no support for investigators or experts. He faced off against a team of 15. Lemon researched the case, tracking down the 300-page trial transcript, and found problems with the evidence, including documents that show Williams’ age incorrectly listed as 18, not 16, along with the husband’s history of abuse. “As I unpeeled the layers, it became quite evident to me that Alexander McClay Williams was innocent,” Lemon said. “This was kind of a legal lynching.” Carter said the truth about her brother might never have been known if not for the work by Lemon and others. “My mother kept saying, ‘Alex didn’t do that. There’s no way he could have done that.’ She was right. But it affected us all,” she said. Osceola Perdue, a 57-year-old niece of Alexander Williams, said the story pained her when she learned of it, and still resonates today. “It cut deep because, if you think about it, it’s still going on to this day. You get pulled over by police, you’re scared to death, even me as a woman,” Perdue said. “I still go back to my uncle, thinking how he felt ... This keeps happening. It doesn’t stop.” The Williams family, Marrone said, has the same right to pursue damages as more recent exonerees, nine of whom, all Black men, joined the family at the podium Monday. Exonerees Jimmy Dennis and Michael White of Philadelphia said there should be “collective outrage” over how innocent people are treated by police, prosecutors and others in the justice system, whether today or a century ago. “We are deeply disgusted by the behavior of the state, but it is emblematic of what we also have went through, so we came here today to stand up with the family and stand for what we see as our little brother,” said Dennis, who last month was awarded $16 million by a jury after spending 25 years on death row, the largest exoneree verdict in Philadelphia history.",

He landed hard on his back and reportedly injured his leg - but still claimed he could have got his hands on the 3kg Gloucester Cheese. Speed, 19, told the BBC : \"You see that blood right there? I have a lumbar infarction.\" He added: \"It bruises and swells up. So I have to go to the hospital after.\" But the YouTube star said the cheese rolling was worth it despite his injuries. Speed said: \"Hell yeah! It looks scary but once that first slide is done, you're like, 'You know what, I can do this'. \"I want to do it again because I know how to win now. I won fourth place my first time with no technique, with no videos.\" It comes after Speed was a special guest at Manchester United's after party following the team's FA Cup triumph. Speed, who has 16.5 million followers on Instagram, brought his own flair to the party. He was seen doing a handshake celebration with Alejandro Garnacho before hitting Cristiano Ronaldo 's signature \"Sui\" celebration. Speed then performed an overhead kick - perhaps to recreate Garnacho's Goal of the Season against Everton . He also grabbed snaps with Kobbie Mainoo, Marcus Rashford, Erik Ten Hag, Andre Onana, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Sofyan Amrabat. Speed had Onana in stitches as he showed him an edited photo of his face on top of a photo of the goalkeeper. The pair joked Speed was a better goalkeeper than 28-year-old Onana.",

        "content": ", a tech giant renowned for its innovation, has ventured into the competitive smartphone market with its Pixel series. Despite its efforts to challenge industry leaders like Apple and Samsung, Google faces a significant challenge in retaining its existing user base. The launch of the , a more affordable version of its flagship models, aimed to attract new users with AI-driven software. However, the company’s focus has shifted towards addressing the loyalty issues among its current smartphone users. Loyalty Concerns and Market Dynamics Data from a Statista Consumer Insights survey a concerning trend for Google, with over half of its current smartphone users in the United States expressing a strong inclination to switch to another brand at the next opportunity. This loyalty dilemma poses a substantial risk to Google’s market share, as 57% of existing users consider switching brands, indicating significant dissatisfaction with their Pixel devices. Despite Google’s collaboration with various hardware manufacturers and the introduction of the “made by Google” Pixel smartphones in 2016, the company has struggled to gain a significant foothold in the smartphone market. Compared to industry leaders like Samsung, Apple, and Xiaomi, Google’s market share remains relatively small, reflecting its challenges in competing with established players. Gizchina News of the week The recent release of the Pixel 8a, positioned as a more budget-friendly alternative to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, marked Google’s latest attempt to broaden its user base. Priced at $499 in the United States, the Pixel 8a leverages AI-driven software to appeal to a wider audience. However, Google faces a critical issue as its current smartphone users exhibit significant dissatisfaction with their devices, leading many to consider switching to other brands. Comparing Google’s loyalty metrics with industry giants Apple and Samsung reveals a stark contrast. Google’s loyalty problem is evident as it has 23% more dissatisfied smartphone users than Apple and Samsung. While 34% of old users from both Apple and Samsung are willing to switch to another brand, Google’s loyalty figures paint a challenging picture for the tech giant. Apple emerges as the leader in tech brand loyalty, with 50% of iPhone users expressing a strong reluctance to change their smartphone brand. In contrast, Samsung, while not reaching Apple’s loyalty levels, still maintains a solid 44% of users committed to sticking with the brand in the future. Google’s struggle to retain its smartphone users underscores critical loyalty issues that could impact its market position. As the company navigates the competitive landscape dominated by Apple and Samsung, addressing user dissatisfaction and enhancing brand loyalty are paramount. The launch of the Pixel 8a signifies Google’s ongoing efforts to attract new users, but the challenge lies in retaining its existing customer base amidst growing competition and shifting consumer preferences.",

        "content": "Former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani on Monday stressed that grand intra-institutional dialogue should be held to create harmony and let the institutions agree on \"not to transgress into each other’s domain\". Highlighting that the public exhibition of contradictions among institutes was casting long shadows on already fragile political system, Rabbani said, “The way forward is a grand intra-institutional dialogue, wherein, each institution agrees not to transgress into each other’s domain, respecting the trichotomy of power envisaged in the Constitution.” In a press statement, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader said Pakistan was engulfed in multiple crises, one being contradiction within ruling elite. The conflict of the ruling elite emanated from within and it had historical roots, he maintained. He alleged that Pakistan’s establishment had, in history, been taking support of the judiciary. “The extreme polarised political atmosphere has affected this equation within the ruling elite. This intra-class contradiction within the elite, is vitiating the functioning of state institutions,” he said. Rabbani said in a democratic federal parliamentary system, parliament was the final arbiter for intra-elite disputes. Hence, he said, parliament should refrain from becoming a party to the intra-elite disputes. “The Committee of the Whole of the Senate of Pakistan should play its role in healing the situation,” he suggested. Taking a dig at non-implementation of the Constitution in its true spirit, the politico said the Constitution was being treated as a \"nose of wax\". “It is molded to legitimise the unconstitutional transgression of one institution into the affairs of the other.” The PPP leader said all this had created a situation “where rule of law has ceased to exist and there appears to be a rule by law”. It had shaken the constitutional foundations of the state, created structural and political instability, he said.",

        "content": "Running a roadside farmers’ market in the country is a dream many of us indulge in. The idea of a quiet life on a country road, being a staple in your community, and enjoying nature is an appealing one. It’s so appealing that it’s exactly what Samantha and Paul did in small hamlet of Thomasburg, Ontario. The two moved there to start Our Neighbours’ Farm & Homestead, a local roadside market on their 42-acre garlic farm. As lovely as all that sounds, it was a lot of work for that couple. That’s why they called in Bryan Baeumler , to help them elevate their open-air farmers’ market. Catch Bryan’s All In on HGTV Canada, available to stream Live or On-Demand with STACKTV.

Farmer Sammy had been earning her name, working on the garlic farm, managing the animals, and connecting with other farmers and growers to sell at their stand. Her stand had already been built, a great start, but there was still a lot to do. The property was beautiful, but they needed to create spaces conducive to customers so they could properly enjoy it. Related: Bryan Baeumler Spruces Up a Coldwater Sugar Shack HGTV Canada Nature Business One of the biggest draws to a farmers’ market is, well, the farm. As much as the fresh produce draws in people, so does the scenery. That’s why it was so important to Bryan that they also add an open-air farmers’ market to the stand. Not only does it add to the aesthetic, but now all the bases are covered. In inclement weather guests can simply shop inside the stand, but on those nicer days they can shop for their supplies out in that fresh country air.

        "description": "The rule relies on “carbon capture” technology that hasn’t been proven to work — and may introduce other dangers.",
        "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced standards to cut greenhouse gasses from power plants. The rule requires coal power plants with a retirement date far in the future and new gas power plants that operate for prolonged periods to install carbon capture technology. Coal power plants with impending retirement dates are required to blend fracked gas with coal to reduce emissions, and gas power plants that operate intermittently to address spikes in demand are merely required to make incremental efficiency improvements. In principle, this is welcome news. The electric power sector is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the United States after transportation, accounting for 25 percent of U.S. emissions . Power-sector emissions aren’t falling fast enough to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius , which the global scientific community has identified as the maximum allowable temperature increase to limit the worst-case climate catastrophes. Unfortunately, the new rule issued by EPA still won’t get us there. It will fail to cut greenhouse gas emissions adequately — and will perpetuate the legacy of treating communities as sacrifice zones based on race and class by continuing the use of polluting fossil fuels. The rule covers existing steam power plants (usually coal-fired, but sometimes oil or gas-fired), and new or reconstructed gas turbine power plants. For existing coal plants scheduled to retire in 2039 or later, the rule sets a target of 88.4 percent reduction of greenhouse gasses by 2032. Likewise, for many new gas turbine power plants, the rule requires a 90 percent reduction. The problem isn’t with these goals, although the reduction goals for coal plants closer to retirement are far too modest, at only 16 percent. The problem is with how the rule prescribes meeting them. Instead of simply emitting less carbon, the rule directs power plants to “capture” it through carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which purportedly removes carbon dioxide from smokestacks using chemical solvents, and then transports it via pipelines in order to bury it underground. But the technology simply doesn’t work: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , one of the most authoritative sources on climate science, CCS is one of the least effective and most expensive options for mitigating power-sector emissions. Further, data from already-operating CCS power plants also confirms this conclusion. An International Energy Agency database shows only three operating power plants with CCS worldwide. The largest of these, the Boundary Dam power plant in Canada, has been beset by mechanical failures, leading to only about only one third of its emissions being captured in 2021 — far short of the 90 percent capture rate the system was designed for. The only operating power plant with CCS in the U.S. was shut down indefinitely after a history of failure — despite collecting nearly $200 million in federal subsidies. Around the same time that the EPA announced their rule, news emerged that another CCS project in Illinois had failed , capturing only about 10 percent of the emissions from a corn ethanol facility, in spite of receiving more than $280 million in public subsidies. Despite the overwhelming evidence that CCS is a failing technology, there is bipartisan support for it in Congress, and it has been pushed by both Democratic and Republican administrations. The primary tax credit for CCS, known as the 45Q tax credit, was expanded as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, in spite of an investigation by the Treasury Department’s Inspector General that found rampant abuse of the tax credit. The political support for CCS in spite of evidence of failure is likely because of the influence of the fossil fuel industry , which supports CCS as a way to continue producing and burning fossil fuels in spite of concerns about climate change. But beyond CCS’s failures and politicized funding, the technology has other harmful effects as well. It increases the water consumption of power plants by between 25 and 200 percent , which will divert water needed for drinking and growing food in an age of increasing water scarcity attributable to climate change . CCS also doesn’t capture toxic air pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and mercury, which are responsible for health impacts such as asthma , heart disease , and neurological illnesses . Moreover, because of their higher-energy consumption , power plants with CCS will burn more fuel, potentially increasing particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and other toxic emissions. This is terrible news for the often racially and economically marginalized communities who live in the vicinity of power plants. These aren’t the only legacy environmental injustices that will continue with adoption of CCS. Because adding CCS to a power plant increases its energy consumption, it will require more fuel, such as coal or fracked gas. Now, imagine widespread adoption of CCS in the US power plant sector as a consequence of the EPA rule. Perversely, that would lead to more coal mining and fracking than today. The well-known health and environmental impacts of coal mining and fracking , which disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities , would get even worse. Besides potentially worsening current environmental hazards, CCS creates new hazards. Pipelines that transport carbon dioxide are susceptible to catastrophic fractures , which could release clouds of asphyxiating gas. There have already been two carbon dioxide pipeline ruptures in the U.S. in recent years , one of which led to 49 people being hospitalized with severe respiratory distress. The CCS requirement for some power plants isn’t the only flaw in the EPA rule either. For coal-fired power plants retiring before 2039, the rule requires fracked gas co-firing. Fracked gas emits less carbon dioxide than coal when burned, but its complete lifecycle climate impact may be comparable to coal when leaks of methane — a short-lived but powerful greenhouse gas — are accounted for. Multiple studies show that the EPA underestimates upstream methane leakage from oil and gas drilling. Instead of relying on an unproven technology that only enables continued fossil fuel pollution, we need a real transition to clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar. In the power sector, that would require closing down fossil fuel power plants on an accelerated timeline and replacing them with renewable generation, while ensuring a just transition for impacted workers and communities. We need to get serious about cutting greenhouse gasses and toxic pollution from power plants. The rule issued by the EPA doesn’t help us get there — and may even make things worse.",

        "content": "FIRST minister John Swinney has sympathy with calls for a “Shetland tariff” – but he says reform of the UK energy market is required. Speaking on Friday after a planned visit to Shetland fell foul of the weather , the SNP leader suggested it is “absurd” for an area involved in generating energy to have high levels of fuel poverty. Although there are community benefit schemes for onshore wind farms, reduced energy costs are seen as one other way of compensating local people for having to live in an increasingly industrialised landscape – and for islanders to directly benefit from renewable energy projects on their doorstep. Shetland is set to host what is expected to be the UK’s most productive onshore wind farm when the 103-turbine Viking Energy project goes live later this year . Smaller wind farms are planned for the outskirts of Lerwick and Yell, while hydrogen production is mooted – as are offshore wind farms to the east of Shetland. On top of this is Shetland’s long-standing role in the oil and gas industry through Sullom Voe Terminal and the nearby gas plant. Despite this Shetland has one of the highest levels of fuel poverty in the country, with the colder climate, some poor insulation and lack of availability of cheaper energy options seen as reasons why. All this combined has led to calls – including from Shetland Islands Council – for a special “tariff” for the isles to compensate. When asked by Shetland News if he sympathises with the idea, Swinney said he did – but conceded it would all have to come down to change at a UK level. Matters relating to the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of energy is reserved for decision making at a UK level. “It’s one of the absurdities of the UK energy market that the areas that are now generating – well, Shetland’s always had a significant contribution towards the generation of energy within the United Kingdom – but in terms of the electricity market, the areas of the country that are now formidably contributing towards the electric market are actually paying very high fuel costs and have high levels of fuel poverty,” Swinney said. “I am very sympathetic to the points that are advanced but what this requires is reform of the United Kingdom energy market, and that is long overdue.” The first minister said he does not feel the market reflects that energy is now coming from a wide range of sources compared to the past. “If you go back 30 years or so, most of the electricity in the country came from large power stations, and now our electricity largely comes from a diffuse range of renewable energy projects around the country,” Swinney said. “That is going to get more diffuse in the years to come, and Shetland is making a significant contribution towards that not least from the Viking Energy project but from a range of other ventures that will contribute to that diverse energy mix. “So I think it’s [the ‘Shetland tariff’] a really substantial idea.”",

        "content": "An Egyptian soldier has been killed in a shooting along the border of Gaza, following reports of exchanges of fire between Israel and Egypt. Egypt’s military spokesperson confirmed that a member of its security forces had been killed near the Rafah border crossing. The Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian troops. “A few hours ago [Monday], a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,” the Israeli military said. The Egyptian military said in a statement: “The Egyptian Armed Forces are conducting an investigation through the competent authorities regarding a shooting incident in the border area in Rafah, which led to the martyrdom of one of the personnel.” Israeli army sources told Haaretz that several others were wounded during the gunfire exchange, with initial testimonies from combat soldiers indicating that an Egyptian soldier fired first toward the IDF forces. However, the circumstances have not yet determined, the sources said. Tensions around the Rafah border have risen in recent weeks, and Israel seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing during its military offensive. Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and have worked together on security issues around their borders since, collaborating on a blockade of Gaza after Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. But in June 2023, three Israeli soldiers and an Egyptian security officer were killed in a clash at the border. In October, two weeks after the start of the war in Gaza, Israel said one of its tanks had accidentally hit an Egyptian position, with several Egyptian border guards sustaining minor injuries. Read Next How wars in Ukraine and Gaza could affect the general election It comes after at least 45 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Rafah on Sunday night , according to Palestinian health workers, with dozens wounded and more feared trapped in flaming debris. The attacks came just hours after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets from Gaza towards Tel Aviv for the first time in months. Israel said the airstrike was against Hamas commanders , with precise munitions and led by intelligence, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later called the strike a “tragic error”. Many of the casualties in Rafah are people who have been living in tents at a camp in the Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, with a fire believed to have broken out after the attack. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it was “aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.” The airstrikes came despite the UN’s top court calling for the country to “immediately halt” its strikes on the city. This story is being updated .",

        "content": "As Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has pushed school choice initiatives, leading to a spike in charter and private school enrollments, public schools are shutting down. Across the state, public school enrollment is . Duval County Public School District, the school district in Florida and 20th largest in the country, is now considering campus due to dramatic dips in their enrollment. Broward County Public Schools, Florida’s second largest school district, has plans to close up to 42 campuses over the next few years. Miami-Dade county has also experienced a substantial decline in enrollment rates. Of the roughly 68,000 privately enrolled students from 2019-2023, more than a third of them came from Duval, Broward and Miami counties, according to from the Florida Department of Education. “If your product is better, you’ll be fine. The problem is, they are a relic of the past — a monopolized system where you have one option,” Chris Moya, a Florida lobbyist representing charter schools, told Politico. “And when parents have options, they vote with their feet.” In March of 2023, DeSantis signed promoting school choice for parents and students. The bill restrictions based on financial eligibility and got rid of school enrollment caps. Gov. DeSantis Signs School Choice Legislation — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) In 2023, private school enrollment from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade increased by nearly 29,000 students from 2022, according to from the Florida Department of Education. In 2023, 31 Florida school districts had 10% or more of their total pre-kindergarten to 12th grade students enrolled in according to the same report. School choice and private school enrollment has been steadily rising over the last decade. Since 2013, over 600 new private schools were established in Florida, and about 120,000 students opted for private education over public, according to the Florida Department of Education. Florida public schools, including Duval County schools, have faced scrutiny for promoting unpopular social causes like and graduation ceremonies from being held in churches. In February 2023, Duval County had to that asked students as young as 10 years old about their sexual activity and gender identity. In 2022, five public school boards were by conservatives in Florida. As a result, Miami-Dade County, Sarasota County, Duval County, Martin County and Clay County then had conservative majorities on their school boards.

The state is witnessing a four-cornered fight with AAP, Congress, BJP and SAD.

        "description": "In a decisive move, the government blacklisted eight entities responsible for over 10,000 fraudulent SMS messages, bolstering citizen protection.",
        "content": "Latest News In a significant move to combat SMS-based scams, the Indian government has taken stringent measures by blacklisting eight major entities responsible for sending over 10,000 fraudulent messages in the last three months. This action was announced in an official statement detailing the collaborative efforts between the Department of Telecom (DoT) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) under the Sanchar Saathi initiative. The crackdown aims to shield citizens from the growing menace of SMS frauds that have been on the rise. The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the MHA played a crucial role by identifying the misuse of eight SMS headers used in these deceptive practices. As a result, all eight principal entities, along with their 73 SMS headers and 1,522 content templates, have been barred from use by any telecom operator. This decisive step prevents these entities from sending any further messages that could potentially harm citizens. Principal entities, as defined in telecom terminology, are businesses or legal entities that dispatch commercial messages to telecom subscribers via SMS. A header is an alphanumeric string that identifies these principal entities for sending out commercial communications. The DoT's action to blacklist these entities underscores its dedication to protecting citizens from cybercrime and ensuring the secure use of telecom resources. Citizens are encouraged to report any suspicious or fraudulent communication to the Chakshu facility on Sanchar Saathi. This platform aids the DoT in its efforts to prevent the misuse of telecom resources for cybercrime and financial frauds. The government's initiative also includes a stern warning against the use of mobile numbers for telemarketing activities, which are strictly prohibited. Violators risk having their connection disconnected upon the first complaint and may face blacklisting for up to two years. Furthermore, the official release clarifies that telemarketing calls are identifiable by specific prefixes such as 180 and 140, while emphasizing that 10-digit numbers are not allowed for such purposes. To combat spam, individuals can dial 1909 or utilize the Do Not Disturb (DND) service. This comprehensive approach by the DoT and MHA showcases their commitment to safeguarding citizens against fraudulent activities and ensuring a safer telecommunications environment.",

        "description": "\"Americans think we have one accent.\"",
        "content": "They may be Oscar winners, but some actors’ attempts at Irish accents are so bad it’s physically painful. That’s according to movie reviewer Sue Murphy after Irish author Marian Keyes begged for her TV adaptation to use authentic Irish accents. Her 2020 novel Grown Ups is being adapted into a Netflix series and she said earlier today she hopes the show hits the mark on accents. Ms Keyes’ fears are not irrational, as Ms Murphy notes cinema’s long history of American and British actors failing to capture the voice of the Irish. “It's because Americans think we have one accent,” she told Lunchtime Live . “Even within Cork, there’s a bunch of accents - it's all the different dialects within each of those dialects.” In many ways, the patient zero of failed Irish accents comes from Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Far and Away . Ms Murphy noted both of their attempts are horrible, but Cruise seems to get the brunt of the criticism. “He gets all the blame for this and she's just as bad,” she said. “She’s desperate... the reason I remember it so much is because I watched it with my dad and he looked physically pained the whole through it because [the accent] is so bad.” Presenter Andrea Gilligan’s worst experience of a failed Irish accent is Julia Robert’s performance as Kitty Kiernan in Michael Collins . Ms Murphy said Roberts actually trained to perfect the accent – but just couldn’t get the hang of it. “It just feels like it's the American interpretation of what our accent sounds like,” she said. Brad Pitt also tried his hand at one of the trickier Irish accents in The Devil's Own . “He was another person that went to train,” Ms Murphy said. “He went to Belfast to make sure he would nail the accent. “You're used to his gruff voice, but this just sounds so desperate, I feel bad for him.” More recently, we were shown that it’s not just Americans who struggle to capture the Irish accent through Scottish actor Gerard Butler’s role in P.S. I Love You . Even within Ireland, actors can struggle to capture another dialect, such as Belfast actor Jamie Dornan’s role in Wild Mountain Thyme – although more people were less impressed by Emily Blunt and Christoper Walken. Ms Murphy pointed out that not all actors fail to imitate the Irish, such as Daisy Edgar Jones in the 2020 TV series Normal People , where many were shocked to learn the London actress did not from the west of Ireland.

        "content": "Hadebe’s Tomusan Konyaspor finished on position 16 in a 20 team league with 41 points despite suffering a 3-1 to champions Galatasaray on the final day. They were one point above Ankaragucu (40 points) and four adrift Pendikspor (37 points) who got relegated along Intabuspor who had a paltry 16 points. The 28-year-old Warriors vice captain started in the match but was subbed off in the second half. Hadebe’s future at Konyaspor remains unknown whether he will renew or part ways with the club when his contract expires this month (May). He joined Konyaspor at the start of February, signing a short stint with the club which strengthened its defense seeking to survive relegation. Then in Italy, Udinese who are home to another Warriors star Jordan Zemura also escaped relegation on the final day. Their narrow 1-0 win against Frosinone courtesy of Keinan Davies’ 76th minute strike, helped them to survive demotion from the Italian Serie A. Zemura who started on the bench, played the last three minutes, replacing Cote d’Ivoire international Hassane Kamara. Udinese ended the campaign in 15th place on 37 points. They finished two points above 18th placed Frosinone, seven above 19th positioned Sassuolo and 20 adrift the log table anchors Salernitana. Zemura joined Udinese in 2023 from Premier League side Bournemouth. Meanwhile, both Hadebe and Zemura will be part of the Warriors squad to do duty in the World Cup qualifiers next month (June) in South Africa. Zimbabwe will play Lesotho on 7 June before facing off rivals South Africa on June 11.",

        "content": "Paris, May 27 (AP) Former soccer player Christian Karembeu, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, says two of his relatives have been killed during the unrest in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia that has left seven people dead. Speaking during an interview with Europe 1 radio on Monday, the former Real Madrid midfielder said his two relatives were shot in the head by snipers. “I've lost family members, that's why I've kept quiet,\" Karembeu said. “Because I'm in mourning.” Asked if these were assassinations, Karembeu replied: “I didn't want to, because the word is strong, but ... it's true that, yes, it's an assassination and we hope that there will be inquiries and investigations into these murders.” French President Emmanuel Macron decided on Monday to lift the state of emergency that was imposed earlier this month. Deadly violence erupted in the French Pacific territory after protests kicked off against the French government's attempts to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia, where pro-independence Indigenous Kanaks have long pushed to be free of France, amid sharp economic disparities. Karembeu, who is Kanak, grew up on the island of Lifou in New Caledonia. After moving to France as a teenager, he went on to win two Champions League titles with Madrid as a midfielder. He started for France in the 1998 World Cup final and was also part of the team that won the 2000 European Championship. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon's nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Karembeu's great-grandparents were shipped to Paris in 1931 from the French Pacific territory and exhibited as “cannibals.” (AP)",

Through them, you can come to understand how a game is played and what matters the most within it. Each sport has its statistical guidelines, its must-win categories and its unbreakable records. And throughout what will end up going down as about a 23-year career, as was breaking geometry and was breaking the laws of flexibility and fitness -- and , pushing so hard to reach the top of the sport, ended up breaking himself -- Nadal made absolute nonsense out of the numbers that define tennis. Nadal will retire in the coming days, weeks or months. He has committed to playing in the Laver Cup this fall. He has suggested he is hoping to participate in the Paris Olympics this summer in some capacity. We don't know where the end will come, exactly, but for every tournament he enters, he's almost certainly doing so for the last time. And with the French Open starting Sunday, that means that the greatest clay-courter of all time, who has won at Roland Garros an utterly impossible 14 times, is playing there for the last time, too. It makes me want to reflect a bit. And that means talking about numbers. You'd love to hit more winners than your opponent. Suffer fewer errors. Land more unreturnable first serves. But while tennis' most prevalent statistics mostly track how points ended, tennis players are far more concerned with how points are constructed. That can mean moving your opponent around as much as possible, or targeting your opponent's weaknesses, whatever they might be. But at a macro level, point construction can often simply mean setting yourself up to hit more forehands than your opponent. Even if your backhand is excellent, and even if your forehand is merely average, the backhand is still a more awkward stroke, and it usually behooves you to manipulate the court in a way that keeps you swinging from the forehand side. Nadal was never the biggest hitter or most aggressive player on tour. His serve speed never went too far beyond 110 mph. Whereas a big server such as or Pete Sampras would hit aces about 13-15% of the time, Nadal was at about 4%. Whereas a big hitter like or might hit winners on 34-35% of points, Nadal was around 28-29% -- better than most but not a statistical standout. But because of his left-handedness, and because he had the best wrists in the history of the sport and could generate absurd torque with his topspin, he could put opponents in backhand jail for as long as he wanted. Tennis Abstract's amazing has collected manual data from more than 13,000 matches and eight million total shots. It gives us a look under tennis' hood, and it reveals one of Nadal's superpowers. In 641 charted matches, Roger Federer hit forehands for 48.8% of his groundstrokes. In 533 matches, Novak Djokovic was at 48.9%. In 302 matches, Andy Murray was at 49.1%. Three of the best players the sport has ever produced were just looking for a 50-50 split here. In 478 charted matches, meanwhile, Nadal hit forehands 55.0% of the time. In a sport in which even winning one more point for every 50 you play can make you skyrocket in the rankings, that is a of difference. Nadal had plenty of ways to win a point. His defense was second to none -- well, maybe second to only Djokovic -- and we all have a nightmare list of otherworldly running passing shots Nadal hit against our favorite player of choice. You don't win 22 Slams if you aren't ridiculously well-rounded. But when in doubt, Nadal could simply whip nonstop forehands into the backhand corner against right-handed opponents (and most opponents are right-handed). Whereas most players find a repeatable edge by figuring out how to win quick points -- more than two-thirds of all points last four shots or fewer, after all -- Nadal won only 51% of points with 0-4 shots. But he won 54% of points with between 4-6 shots, 55% of points with 7-9 shots and 54% of points with 10-plus shots. He would lean on you, and you would eventually fall. You can almost blame Nadal for the demise of the one-handed backhand, too. With the torque and height that his forehand generated, even Federer, with just about the most aesthetically-pleasing one-hander of all time, could neither generate proper power with a topspin backhand nor kill the pace and reset the point with a slice backhand. Nadal hit a higher percentage of forehands than Federer in 25 of the 35 matches charted at Tennis Abstract, and while Federer would typically slice about 37% of his backhands, he was lucky to hit 20% against Nadal. In those 35 matches, Federer went 5-5 when he was able to slice at least 20% of the time and 8-17 when he wasn't. And if Federer couldn't counter this weapon, then what chance did one-handed backhand artisans like (2-7 all time against Nadal) or (1-14) have? That one-hander was able to go 6-10 against Nadal was remarkable, but (a) he was only 1-5 in best-of-five matches, and (b) the spin Thiem generated in response was uncommon. It might not be a total surprise that he ended up with the wrist problems that are ending his career this year. It goes beyond rallies, though. Think of what it means to be able to pull an opponent off the court with your absurd lefty kick serve on the ad court, where a vast majority of break points you face will come. While right-handers can do that in the deuce court, they're at less of an advantage in the ad court. And while all points matter, in tennis some matter more than others. : Nadal 60%, Federer 47%, Djokovic 46%, Murray 42% : Federer 67%, Nadal 66%, Djokovic 65%, Murray 62% With a serve far slower than Federer's, Nadal was almost equally adept at saving break points. Nadal will likely finish his career with 92 ATP titles. That's obviously an awesome number, but it ranks a mere fifth all time behind Jimmy Connors (109), Federer (103), Djokovic (98) and Ivan Lendl (94). But that lefty kick was patently unfair on clay courts, where he set records that might never be broken. He hasn't just won the most French Opens; he has won more than twice as many as anyone else in the Open era. Bjorn Borg, the single most dominant figure during tennis' explosion in popularity in the late-1970s, won six titles at Roland Garros. On the women's side, Chris Evert won seven. If you go back to the early-1900s, long before there was any sort of tour formality in tennis, a man named Max Decugis won eight. Nadal won . Since the 1910s, only one man has won more than three Monte Carlo Open titles: Nadal, who won , including a stretch of eight in a row. Only two people have won more than three Italian Opens: Djokovic has six, and Nadal has . He has the most Madrid Open titles, too, but somehow the fact that he won only five of those feels underwhelming. That's what he did to title math. \"Five titles at one of the sport's preeminent clay-court events? I guess that's decent.\" As he heads into his final French Open, Nadal is 539-66 all time on clay. That's a win percentage of 0.891, which is pretty ridiculous in itself. But it includes going 72-25 from 2001-03 and going 5-3 this year. In between the start and (presumable) finish of his career, he went 462-38, a win percentage of . He was unbeaten on clay in 2006 and 2010, lost just once five times (2007, 2008, 2012, 2017 and 2018) and lost just twice five times (2005, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2022). Quick reminder: He played in the same era as what might have been the two greatest men's tennis players of all time. And he still owned about one-third of the tennis calendar for nearly two decades! Indeed, when we talk about any one of the Big Three -- Federer, Nadal and Djokovic -- it's easy to get caught up in the sheer volume of their individual achievements. But the fact that they achieved all these things despite having to share the stage with each other is almost disorienting. And it leads us to some spectacular what-ifs. Nadal is going to retire with the second-most men's Slam titles ever (22). But he lost four Slam finals to Federer and four more to Djokovic. He also twice lost to Djokovic in the semifinals of a Slam that Djokovic ended up winning. Federer won 20 Slam titles but lost six Slam finals to Nadal -- four at the French Open, plus one each at Wimbledon (you might remember ) and the Australian Open -- and another four to Djokovic. He also lost to one of them seven times in the semifinals of a Slam the victor would go on to win. With 24, Djokovic will end up winning the career Slam titles race. But he still lost four finals to Nadal and one to Federer, and he still lost five semis to the eventual Slam winner. To be sure, each of these titans had an effect on each other. Nadal had to aspire to the level Federer first set and then craft a game that could top him. Then Djokovic did the same. That they all had to figure out ways to beat each other inevitably raised each of their individual games. But it's impossible not to think of the totals one of these players might have generated had one of the others decided to take up, say, basketball or golf or something. Math can be awfully cold. I can use stats to point out just how much Nadal's immortal return game and defense have fallen off during his latest comeback from his latest round of injuries. Back in 2018, when he went 26-1 on clay, he broke serve an otherworldly 47% of the time and won 48% of return points; this year he's at 30% and 40%, respectively. He still spends a lot of points looking like the version of himself we grew accustomed to, but the cumulative effects of age and injury are pretty clear. And the fact that he drew in the first round is rather cruel. Zverev has won three of the past four complete matches the two have played, including one on clay. He lands the most first serves of any top-50 player and holds serve more than anyone besides (the best player of 2024 so far) and , who blew Nadal off the court 6-1, 6-3 in Rome last week. Math tells us pretty dire things about what will probably happen when Zverev and Nadal meet. But if there's any hope in seeing Nadal make one last run in Paris, it stems from a pretty obvious place: Math has never mattered much when Nadal's involved.",
