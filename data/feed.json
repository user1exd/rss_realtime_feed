        "content": "Valeura Energy Inc. is a Canada-based public company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of petroleum and natural gas in Turkey. CALGARY, Alberta, May 28, 2024 (Korea Bizwire) – Valeura Energy Inc. (TSX:VLE, OTCQX:VLERF) (“ Valeura ” or the “ Company “), an upstream oil and gas company with assets in the Gulf of Thailand and the Thrace Basin of Türkiye, is pleased to announce the successful completion of an infill drilling campaign at Nong Yao A and the start of development drilling on the Nong Yao C extension, both part of the Nong Yao oil field (90% operated working interest), offshore Gulf of Thailand. Sean Guest, President and CEO commented: “I am pleased with the results of our new Nong Yao A wells, which further illustrate the potential of our assets to add volumes through ongoing infill drilling. Drilling these wells now was a nimble move by our team to shore up production rates just before dedicating our rig to the Nong Yao C development drilling programme. The start of drilling operations at our brand new Nong Yao C infrastructure marks a significant milestone for our Company. This will be the first new development for Valeura in Thailand, and is expected to serve as a substantial source of production growth in the second half of this year. We remain focused on safe and sustainable growth, and I am pleased to note that our drilling operations have achieved an important safety record, logging one full year of work without a lost time injury. We remain committed to delivering a top tier health, safety, and environmental performance across all our operations.” Nong Yao A Infill Wells Valeura has drilled two production-oriented horizontal wells at the Nong Yao A wellhead platform, which were both successful and have been brought online as producers. The 37H well culminated in a horizontal section within the primary target H12.5 reservoir. That zone has been completed for production and is currently contributing approximately 500 bbls/d of oil ( 1) , based on performance over the past ten days. In addition, the well encountered 68 feet of net oil pay across eight separate appraisal target intervals. These zones will now be further evaluated as targets for potential future development wells, and once developed, may add further producible volumes to the asset. The 38H well has been completed as a horizontal producer in the H4.3 reservoir interval and is currently contributing approximately 1,000 bbls/d of oil ( 1) , based on performance over the past five days. A thin oil-bearing sand was encountered in the shallower H2.0 sand interval and will also be studied to determine additional producible volumes. Nong Yao C Development The Company’s contracted drilling rig has moved to the Nong Yao C mobile offshore production unit where it has commenced batch drilling operations to develop the Nong Yao C field extension. The drilling campaign is anticipated to take approximately four months and will be comprised of up to nine gross wells, being six producer wells and up to three water injectors. Valeura anticipates first oil from the Nong Yao C development in Q3 2024, and thereafter is targeting aggregate peak oil production rates from the expanded Nong Yao field of 11,000 bbls/d, approximately a 50% increase over the 7,307 bbls/d reported for Q1 2024 (1) . (1) Working interest share production before royalties.

        "content": "Bedford Metals Corp., a mineral exploration company, creates value for our shareholders by identifying and developing highly prospective mineral exploration opportunities. (Image from the company webpage) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 28, 2024 (Korea Bizwire) – Bedford Metals Corp. (TSX-V: BFM) (the “Company” or “Bedford”) is pleased to announce its proposed multi-phase work program for its Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project , situated on the lip of the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. Phase 1 of the program calls for an airborne VTEM (Time Domain Electromagnetic) survey of the project, aimed at further identifying subsurface features such as faults and folds, which may be controls of historic radioactive anomalies. Concurrently, an airborne radiometric survey will be conducted to provide additional insights into the project’s geology. Phase 2 will implement a comprehensive ground program that includes field mapping, soil sampling, and a systematic ground radiometric survey to identify new and historic anomalies. Shaw drills will be utilized in this phase. Additionally, selected features identified through prospecting and interpretation of airborne survey data will undergo further examination with a ground IP (Induced Polarization) survey to refine targets for diamond drilling. Peter Born, President of Bedford commented “We appreciate the effort by the team in designing this comprehensive exploration program for our Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project. We are excited about the potential of this project and look forward to advancing it through the proposed work program.” Bedford remains committed to conducting all exploration work to the highest environmental standards and in collaboration with local communities and indigenous nations. Environmental stewardship is a core value of the company, and it will continue to prioritize responsible resource development. As the exploration program progresses, Bedford will keep stakeholders informed with regular updates on its website and through other communication channels. About Bedford Metals Corp . Bedford Metals Corp. is a mineral exploration company. We create value for our shareholders by identifying and developing highly prospective mineral exploration opportunities. Our strategy is to advance our projects from discovery to production, allowing Bedford to achieve significant shareholder value through the entire mining life cycle. Close Lake Uranium Project lies on the eastern side of the Athabasca Basin, adjoining claims held by Cameco Corporation, the largest uranium producer in the world. The claim is approximately 245 hectares and lies within the primary exploration corridor, which hosts the Keys Lake mine, the Cigar Lake Mine and the McArthur River Mine. The property can be accessed through a network of roads and trails. Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project , covering 1382 hectares, lies just south of the bottom lip of the Athabasca Basin, adjacent to ALX Uranium’s Carpenter Lake Project to the east. Situated near the Cable Bay Shear Zone, parallel to the Virgin River Shear Zone, which hosts Cameco’s Centennial uranium deposit, the project holds immense potential. Furthermore, it is located 100 km west of Cameco’s past-producing Key Lake uranium mine, underscoring the strategic significance of its location.

        "content": "A YouGov Plc study commissioned by Bankrate reveals 39% of adults in the United States have a side hustle. Two in five surveyed generate additional income apart from their main job or any other primary income source, such as family assistance or trust funds. Side hustles are particularly prevalent among younger demographics. Half of millennials and just slightly more members of Gen Z take on extra jobs for extra spending money. Similarly, an online LendingTree survey from November reveals 40% of Americans say they need more money to combat inflation, while 38% point to the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, amidst this surge in freelance activity, the market has become increasingly saturated, making it a challenge for people to establish and maintain profitable businesses. NetCredit seized the opportunity to trawl through thousands of publicly available job ads on the gig platform Fiverr to find the most efficient, highest-paying single-day jobs in every country. Website design ranks as one of the top side hustles , with some designers earning more than $100 per gig. Location influences freelance web designers’ rates — those in the U.K. can earn an average of $220.15 per day, $405 per day in the Netherlands, and an estimated $350 per day in Italy. According to the London School of Economics, project-based side hustles contribute to around 73% of the estimated $184 billion economic output generated by U.K.-based freelancers. This figure surpasses that of designers engaging in repetitive tasks or gigs for a single client. Design roles account for 50% of the 20 highest-earning side hustles for a single day's work. Marketing strategy is one of the highest-paid side hustles in the United States, with an average pay of $178.08 daily. An influential strategist’s contributions include increased brand visibility, generating new customers, increasing revenue, and nurturing existing client relationships. Companies looking to engage with marketing experts aim to reap profitable returns on their marketing investments, which can influence the consultant's fee structure. Freelancing writing gigs, like resume construction, seem commonplace, but those with more social media savvy can lean into their skillset by pursuing professional profile creation. LinkedIn profile writing has proven a lucrative niche, with contributors scoring about $110 daily. Though making a social media profile seems simple, skillful execution requires freelancers to understand various industries and ensure that contents cater to a client’s potential employers or target audience. LinkedIn profile creation also demands the incorporation of text that withstands the stringency of many employers’ AI recruitment tools. Much like a resume, a LinkedIn profile serves as a sales pitch, establishing the client's skills, experience, and personality while addressing the criteria sought by recruiters. Internet content growth and millions of new business applications currently drive designer demand, with presentation design standing out as one of the highest-paying roles — up to $168 daily. Pitch decks are presentations for prospective investors that guide them through a company’s vision, offer, and market potential. These are often arranged as PowerPoint or Apple Keynote presentations and must be striking and informative. The freelancer will work with the hiring company to produce the cards, but some clients may expect the designer to advise on the structure of the pitch itself. For this reason, it is essential that the freelancer clearly expresses their offerings and skill set. Designers can expect to make more as they hone and develop their skills. Data dashboards are digital interfaces arranged like car dashboards, depicting valuable data and processes in real-time. These require patient and technical side hustlers, as these data-driven pieces often require more time than other gigs. Whether designing a data dashboard from scratch or entering and processing data on an existing system, freelancers can average $120.86 per day. Such tech may intimidate professionals outside of the industry, so bringing in a freelancer can help explain the lay of the land. “Often, if they have some data and they think they can do something interesting or of value with it — rather than hiring a data scientist — it makes more sense to bring in someone for a few weeks or a month to explore the data, understand the business challenges and opportunities and what’s feasible,” explains Matt Johnson , former COO of data science consultancy Data Mettle. One of the most lucrative side hustles in the U.S. is creating AI spokesperson videos. They pay an average of $131 per job. Several services offer the ability to use AI tools to create virtual video avatars. Similar to what you'd find in a video game, you can animate the AI characters and have them say or do just about anything. However, it's not as easy as just plugging in the words for the virtual narrator to \"read.\" Recruiters pay reasonable rates for freelancers to not only create but edit together the video so it doesn't look generic but really represents the client that needs the video. You can sign up for various services that offer the AI spokesperson creation interface, but be sure to factor in the cost of that service when charging the client, especially if it requires a periodic subscription to maintain. Engaging in a side hustle can be a strategic move for individuals looking to leverage underutilized skills or expertise while supplementing their income and enhancing their overall professional performance. By dedicating a few hours a week to a side hustle, individuals can bolster their financial stability and gain valuable experience and insights that may benefit their primary job. However, selecting the right side hustle is crucial; it should be a service that aligns with your strengths and abilities while offering lucrative compensation. This ensures that your time and effort yield maximum financial and professional returns. Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Kumbaga if I don't do these things, my son won't, hindi niya ako susundan,” sabi niya.Pagpapatuloy niya, na-realize din niya kung gaano kahirap ang pagkakaroon ng 9 to 5 na trabaho, at kung papaano pinagdadaanan 'yon ng ordinaryong mga tao.“'Yung tipong you wake up for your son, you do all these things, tapos at the end of the day, uuwi ka, hinihintay ka pa rin. All the joys, 'yung purpose ko sa buhay, nabuo,” sabi niya.RELATED CONTENT: Get to know Raffa Castro, the mother of Joaquin Domagoso's child Ngunit nang tanungin siya tungkol sa kaniyang lovelife, ang sagot lang ni Joaquin, “I don't wanna say anything too much, but right now, I'm in a very happy place.”“I'm happy where my son is, he started school officially, so congrats to Little Scott.

        "content": "'We have nothing.' As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and searching for food DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Over the past three weeks, Israel’s offensive in Rafah has sent nearly a million Palestinians fleeing the southern Gaza city and scattering across a wide area. Most have been displaced multiple times already during Israel’s nearly 8-month-old war in Gaza. With the amount of aid arrivals plummeting, Palestinians have largely been on their own to resettle their families and find the basics of life. Their tent camps stretch for 10 miles along Gaza's coast where families search for food and wood. A schoolteacher living with his wife, children and extended family in a tent says they have nothing and it's destroying them mentally. Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a 'tragic mishap' TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a “tragic mishap” was made in an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah that set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Spain and Norway formally recognize a Palestinian state as EU rift with Israel widens BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway have moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Relations between the EU and Israel have nosedived Monday with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez’s government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” At least 22 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 22 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. In Trump's hush money trial, prosecutors and defense lawyers are poised to make final pitch to jury NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors and defense lawyers in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial are set to deliver closing arguments. Each side wants to score final points with the jury Tuesday before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president charged with felony crimes. The arguments are expected to last the entire day. They'll give the attorneys one last chance to address the jury hearing the landmark case. After four weeks of testimony, the lawyers’ arguments set the stage for deliberations in the case charging Trump in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter. The Republican ex-president denies wrongdoing. Voter outreach groups targeted by new laws in several GOP-led states are struggling to do their work WASHINGTON (AP) — Laws passed in several Republican-controlled states after the 2020 presidential election have criminalized much of the work done by voter outreach groups. Advocates are finding it difficult to adapt as they try to register and educate potential voters with just months to go before this year's presidential election. In-person activities have been eliminated or severely cut back, and staffing has been reduced. Voting rights experts say it's another tactic to strip access to the ballot box, especially for minority voters, who mostly benefit from third-party voter registration. What to know about Mexico's historic elections Sunday that will likely put a woman in power MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexicans will vote Sunday in historic elections weighing many of the core issues facing the country including gender, violence and populism. Mexico could elect its first female president. The election is also the biggest in the country's history with more than 20,000 congressional and local positions are up for grabs. The campaign season has been marred by a wave of electoral violence and concerns that Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has undermined the country's democracy by attacking independent institutions. Fears rise of a second landslide and disease outbreak at site of Papua New Guinea disaster MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Authorities fear a second landslide and a disease outbreak are looming at the scene of Papua New Guinea’s mass-casualty disaster. U.N. official Serhan Aktoprak said Tuesday the mass of debris that devastated Yambali village in the South Pacific nation’s remote highlands when a limestone mountainside sheared away Friday is becoming more unstable with recent rain and streams trapped between the ground and rubble. The United Nations’ migrant agency has officials at the scene in Enga province helping shelter 1,600 displaced people. The agency estimates 670 villagers have died, while Papua New Guinea’s government has told the United Nations it thinks more than 2,000 were buried. Last year's deadly heat wave in metro Phoenix didn't discriminate PHOENIX (AP) — The victims of last summer's staggering 31-day streak of daily temperatures reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit and over were old and young, male and female, homeless and well-to-do, Black, white, Hispanic, Asian American and Native American. There was a 19-year-old man addicted to fentanyl who collapsed in a roasting alley. A 96-year-old military veteran died in the hospital after being found unresponsive in his home without air conditioning. More than 400 of the 645 heat-related deaths Maricopa County public health officials have confirmed for 2023 were during that wave stretching from the last day in June through all of July. Celtics rally late again to close out Pacers for 4-0 sweep in Eastern Conference finals INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Derrick White’s tiebreaking 3-pointer with 43 seconds left gave Boston the lead and the Celtics closed out a four-game sweep of the Indiana Pacers 105-102 to reach the NBA Finals for the second time in three years. White finished with 16 points and only two 3s in the game. Jaylen Brown led Boston with 29 points while Jayson Tatum added 26 points. Indiana, which again played without two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton, lost its second straight at home — both in the final minute after giving up leads. Andrew Nembhard had 24 points, 10 assists and six rebounds but missed a potentially tying 3-pointer in the closing seconds and the Pacers never go the ball again.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Closing arguments in Donald Trump 's historic hush money trial are set to begin Tuesday morning, giving prosecutors and defense attorneys one final opportunity to convince the jury of their respective cases before deliberations begin. Jurors will undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as “legal expenses” to hide the true nature of the transactions. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. He pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records , charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. Closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday. The case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. The other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It’s unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election. Currently: — Here’s what every key witness said at Donald Trump’s hush money trial — As Trump’s hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside — Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms — Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events — Key players: Who’s who at Trump’s hush money criminal trial — Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump’s trial Here's the latest: With closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them — deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with. To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime . Any verdict must be unanimous. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven’t proved Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. New York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump’s case and will not be considered by jurors. For many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life. For others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out — including professional line sitters with pup tents — for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal. Though most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump’s entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public. The former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners. Closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April. Prosecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony. Following the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president’s guilt or innocence. Jurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.",

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Authorities fear a second landslide and a disease outbreak are looming at the scene of Papua New Guinea’s mass-casualty disaster because of water streams and bodies trapped beneath the tons of debris that swept over a village, a United Nations official said Tuesday. A mass of boulders, earth and splintered trees devastated Yambali in the South Pacific nation’s remote highlands when a limestone mountainside sheared away Friday. The blanket of debris has become more unstable with recent rain and streams trapped between the ground and rubble, said Serhan Aktoprak, chief of the International Organization for Migration’s mission in Papua New Guinea. The U.N. agency has officials at the scene in Enga province helping shelter 1,600 displaced people. The agency estimates 670 villagers died, while Papua New Guinea’s government has told the United Nations it thinks more than 2,000 people were buried. Five bodies had been retrieved from the rubble by Monday. “We are hearing suggestions that another landslide can happen and maybe 8,000 people need to be evacuated,” Aktoprak told The Associated Press. “This is a major concern. The movement of the land, the debris, is causing a serious risk, and overall the total number of people that may be affected might be 6,000 or more,” he said. That includes villagers whose source of clean drinking water has been buried and subsistence farmers who lost their vegetable gardens. “If this debris mass is not stopped, if it continues moving, it can gain speed and further wipe out other communities and villages further down” the mountain, Aktoprak said. Scenes of villagers digging with their bare hands through muddy debris in search of their relatives’ remains were also concerning. “My biggest fear at the moment is corpses are decaying, ... water is flowing and this is going to poise serious health risks in relation to contagious diseases,” Aktoprak said. Aktoprak’s agency was raising those concerns at a disaster management virtual meeting of national and international responders Tuesday. The warning comes as geotechnical experts and heavy earth-moving equipment are expected to reach the site soon. The Papua New Guinea government on Sunday officially asked the United Nations for additional help and to coordinate contributions from individual nations. An Australian disaster response team was scheduled to arrive Tuesday in Papua New Guinea, which is Australia’s nearest neighbor. It will include a geohazard assessment team and drones to help map the site. “Their role will be particularly helping perform geotechnical surveillance to establish the level of the landslip, the instability of the land there, obviously doing some work around identifying where bodies are,” said Murray Watt, Australia's minister for emergency management. Australia's minister for the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said the government would also provide long-term logistical support for clearing debris, recovering bodies and supporting displaced people. The government announced an initial aid package of 2.5 million Australian dollars ($1.7 million). “This is an incredibly inaccessible part of Papua New Guinea and it’s a really challenging process for everyone involved,” Conroy said. Earth-moving equipment used by Papua New Guinea’s military was expected to arrive soon, after traveling from the city of Lae, 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the east, said Justine McMahon, country director of for humanitarian agency CARE International. The landslide buried a 200-meter (650-foot) stretch of the province's main highway. But the highway had been cleared from Yambali to the provincial capital Wabag through to Lae, officials said Tuesday from Enga. “One of the complicating factors was the destruction of parts of the road plus the instability of the ground, but they have some confidence that they can take in heavy equipment today,” McMahon said Tuesday. An excavator donated by a local builder Sunday became the first piece of heavy earth-moving machinery brought in to help villagers who have been digging with shovels and farming tools to find bodies. Heartbroken and frustrated Yambali resident Evit Kambu thanked those who were trying to find her missing relatives in the rubble. “I have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I'm standing on,” she told Australian Broadcasting Corp. through an interpreter. “But I can't retrieve the bodies, so I'm standing here helplessly,” she added. Papua New Guinea is a diverse, developing nation with 800 languages and 10 million people who are mostly subsistence farmers. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "description": "Abha Club head coach Pitso Mosimane has reacted to arguably the biggest setback of his career as his side suffered relegation from the Saudi Pro League.",
        "content": "At the beginning of the year, the former Bafana Bafana mentor accepted the task of attempting to save the side from the dreaded drop to the Saudi First Division League, having signed a four-month contract. In the end, it was a valiant effort as Abha went down 2-1 to already relegated Al-Hazm on the final day of the season on Monday evening, in a match where they needed to win at all costs to secure their top-flight status. Mosimane’s charges found the opener two minutes into the second half, courtesy of an Ahmed Abdu Jaber goal, before the home side equalised 11 minutes later via the boot of Muhammed Badamosi. That set up a tense finish to the match, with Al-Hazm eventually netting the winner in the 80 minute. To compound the visitors’ woes, Abha missed a penalty kick towards the end of the encounter, minutes after receiving a red card. It just was not to be. “I am sad about the situation we are in, but this is football and everything must be accepted, and although we scored first, we were not able to win, and we got a penalty kick and missed it,” said the Kagiso-born coach, speaking at the post-match press conference. “I took a risk and came to a team at the bottom of the league, and I knew that it is a difficult task, but I had hope when we got out of the danger zone three times, and my contract with Abha expires today,\"he added. What happens next in the career of the celebrated coach is anyone’s guess, but what’s certain is that Mosimane won’t be short of suitors should he decide against staying on at Abha.",

        "content": "China and Central Asian countries will explore establishing a scientific earthquake investigation mechanism together, aiming to integrate, share earthquake information, disaster mitigation decisions and technological resources. The mechanism will be based on studying the Tianshan Seismic Belt which is a major seismic belt in Central Asia and one of the regions with strong seismic activities in China. The junction of Xinjiang, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan is a key area of plate interaction, traversed by the Tianshan Seismic Belt, a major seismic hazard area and a key area for the international community to study the frontier issues of continental geodynamics and inland earthquake disasters, explained Zhu Fangfang, deputy director of Science, Technology and International Cooperation Department, China Earthquake Administration at a press conference held by the Ministry of Emergency Management on Monday. Zhu said China and Central Asian countries have successfully carried out a number of scientific and technological projects, such as GPS joint observation in the Tianshan region of Central Asia and the construction of seismic and geomagnetic monitoring networks. \"These projects have provided valuable basic information and scientific and technological support for earthquake prevention and disaster reduction work in China and Central Asian countries, and are of great significance to ensuring the security of the strategic corridor in western China and the sustainable development of the regional economy,\" Zhu said. Monday's conference also announced that on Thursday the China-Central Asia Emergency Management Ministerial Meeting will be held in Urumqi to discuss practical cooperation and channels for safe development. During the ministerial meeting, parties are expected to sign the Memorandum of Understanding on the Establishment of China-Central Asia Emergency Management Cooperation Mechanism, which will mark the official establishment of China-Central Asia emergency management cooperation mechanism. The mechanism was initiated by China back in 2022 and over recent years, the countries involved have made a series of preparations to build up the mechanism, reflecting the positive momentum of wider regional cooperation. During this ministerial meeting, a drill on emergency response of oil and gas pipeline accidents will be conducted. According to Chen Yihui, the deputy director of the National Production Safety Emergency Rescue Center, more than 100 rescue and safety personnel will participate in the five-day drill. A total of 10 subjects are set up including risk analysis for emergency disposal of oil and gas pipelines, pressurized plugging of crude oil pipelines, fully automated welding of natural gas pipelines, and emergency repair.",

(Photo/China News Service) (ECNS) -- Track laying has begun on the Tieli to Yichun section of China's Harbin-Yichun high-speed railway in Heilongjiang Province on Tuesday, laying a solid foundation for official operation. The Harbin-Yichun high-speed railway is an extension of the Beijing-Harbin high-speed and Beijing-Hong Kong-Macao railway channels, part of China's \"Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal\" rail network. It is the first high-speed railway in the country constructed as such a high latitude, with the largest annual temperature difference and crossing permafrost regions. The 318-kilometer-long railway connects Harbin, Suihua and Yichun with a designed speed of 250 kilometers per hour and nine stations including Harbin, Harbin North, Hulan North, Xinglong Township West, Suihua South, etc. China's self-developed CPG 500 seamless long rail laying machine is adopted to ensure on-schedule construction. Travel time from Harbin to Yichun will be shortened from 7 hours to 2 hours after the rail line is put into operation, building a \"one-hour, two-hour\" commute circle with Harbin at its center.",

        "content": "A woman died and around 187 people were hospitalised after they suffered food poisoning at a Thrissur hotel, recently. The villain in the story is yet again, the much-loved Yemeni - Kerala dish kuzhimandi. While there are reports that the mayonnaise served with it was also spoilt, many fingers are being pointed exclusively at this delicacy, which has faced the blame for similar incidents in the past too. Mandi cooked inside a clay oven or a small pit. When the delicacy reached Kerala, it became kuzhimandi as 'kuzhi' in Malayalam means a pit. The dish also has a distinctive taste and is considered less calorific. Its ingredients are biriyani rice, large chunks of chicken or mutton, mandi condiments (Arabian spices) dried lemons and saffron. In Kerala's version, to enhance the taste, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, cumin, bay leaf, and some coriander powder are also added. When does mandi turn stale? To prepare mandi, rice is slow-cooked in the marinated meat stock immersed in a clay pit. Chicken or mutton is kept on top and the cooked rice goes to the bottom. As the meat gets cooked, its juice drips down and flavours the rice. But you need to be careful while preparing the dish. Arabian grilled dishes require a certain temperature while cooking. And you can’t grill them at high temperatures as only the exterior will be cooked. If the meat is not fresh, that can cause problems for your health. Hygiene is extremely important while cooking non-veg food items. Sometimes, at eateries, they use grills to cook the meat one batch after the other. Often, they don’t remove the fat that drips from the meat before going for the second batch of grilling. They also don’t clean the grills when they start it all over again the next day. The food prepared in such conditions can be toxic and result in food poisoning. Mayonnaise is yet another villain. Since it is made of raw eggs, there are more chances of mayonnaise causing food poisoning. To avoid salmonella, eggs should be washed properly while preparing the mayonnaise.",

        "content": "KARACHI : The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) spokesperson on Tuesday announced that Pakistan’s Multi Mission Communication Satellite PAKSAT MM1 will be launched on Thursday. The Suparco scientists and engineers were examining the PAKSAT MM1, said the spokesperson. The launch will take place from XiChang Satellite Launch Centre (XSLC), China, the national space agency said, adding that the project is part of the National Space Programme 2047. According to a statement by the Suparco, the PAKSAT MM1 was conceived as a joint venture between Suparco and Chinese aerospace industry, keeping in sight the growing needs of the country in the broad-spectrum of communication and connectivity. “This satellite project is a hallmark of technological cooperation between Peoples’ Republic of China and Pakistan,” the statement read. It added that the satellite, based on advanced communication technologies, will play a pivotal role in the socio-economic uplift of the country. “It will prove to be a stepping stone in the transformation of the country into Digital Pakistan,” Suparco said. The research commission stated that the launching ceremony will be shown live for media from its establishments in Karachi and Islamabad. It should be noted that, so far, Pakistan has sent at least six assets in space such as BADR-A, BADR-B, PAKSAT 1-R, PRSS-1, PakTes 1-A and iCube Qamar. Earlier this month, iCube-Qamar, Pakistan’s first satellite mission to the moon, sent the first-ever images of the moon captured in the lunar orbit following its ascent in space. Making this a groundbreaking development, according to IST, Qamar became the first Pakistani satellite to enter the lunar orbit and completed its rotation in 12 hours.

        "content": "To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Robson Green has given a glimmer of hope to fans that he could reunite with Jerome Flynn for the 30th anniversary of their hit single. Together, the actors formed the pop duo Robson & Jerome, after their characters Dave Tucker and Paddy Garvey on the ITV drama Soldier Soldier sang a cover of Unchained Melody. They performed the single during a plot where the entertainment failed to appear at a wedding, which led to viewers trying to buy the music. Simon Cowell discovered the interest and convinced them to record the song. Months later, their cover was released as a double single with White Cliffs of Dover. It reached number one in the charts, stayed there for seven weeks, and became the best-selling single of 1995. They went on to release covers of I Believe, and What Becomes of the Brokenhearted, which also hit number one. In total, they sold seven million copies of their two albums, and five million copies of the three singles released but decided to call it a day in 1997. With the 30th anniversary of Unchained Melody coming up, fans are naturally curious if they could reunite. Ranvir Singh asked Robson, 59, directly if it was a possibility when he sat down on the Lorraine show sofa. ‘Money talks,’ he simply replied before laughing. The host also enquired if Robson and Game of Thrones actor Jerome, 61, ever hum the song at each other during phone conversations. ‘We don’t no. We chat about it. It’s fond memories,’ he clarified. ‘We hung the microphone up a long time ago.’ Although the dabble in the music industry happened nearly three decades ago, Robson still recalls some of the impact. ‘People named their pets after Robson & Jerome,’ he stated. Earlier in the show, his appearance was teased with a short audio clip of Unchained Melody. Robson, who was promoting his travel series, Into the Amazon, quipped that he had done other stuff since the 90s. As well as acting in Wire in the Blood and Grantchester, Robson also presents travel documentaries including Extreme Fishing, Tales from Northumberland and Tales From The Coast, in which he reunited with Jerome, who showed his former singing partner around his home, Pembrokeshire. Robson & Jerome’s time releasing music was never a planned career move, but rather a vision orchestrated by Simon. The 64-year-old has since admitted that he was so passionate about convincing the men to record their cover that he received a legal letter. 7 sex scenes and filthy innuendos in Disney films you know you didn't imagine 90s music legend looks impossibly youthful at 60th birthday bash Dame Helen Mirren, 78, will leave you speechless in youthful punk photo shoot Nineties R&B star has barely aged a day 25 years after finding fame in hit group ‘It took me seven months to persuade these two to sign a recording contract with me,’ Simon said on Oprah Winfrey’s Masterclass show in 2011. ‘But I drove them so mad that I actually got a solicitor’s letter from one of them saying I had to stop harassing his client. ‘The reason I kept doing it was a) I knew I could persuade them to do it and b) I knew it would be successful.’ What I Own: My partner and I bought our own home before we were 30 — through a loophole I pay £395 a month to live in an underground doomsday bunker 'Magical' town with two castles named best place to live in the South West What I Rent: 'I pay £1,925 for a one bed flat but it revived my social life after divorce' Someone is literally renting out their garden shed – for £1,300 per month Lorraine airs weekdays from 9am on ITV1 and ITVX.

        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Analysis: All we know about Rafael Nadal's future is that we really know nothing at all PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal has not announced his retirement just yet. It's really not clear what comes next for him after he exited the French Open in the first round on Monday. The owner of 22 Grand Slam titles turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time. He probably won't be back at the tournament where he’s collected a record 14 trophies, but he would not completely rule out the possibility immediately following the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts. He probably won't enter Wimbledon in July. He hopes to go to the Olympics later that month but needs time to figure that out, too. Celtics rally late again to close out Pacers for 4-0 sweep in Eastern Conference finals INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Derrick White’s tiebreaking 3-pointer with 43 seconds left gave Boston the lead and the Celtics closed out a four-game sweep of the Indiana Pacers 105-102 to reach the NBA Finals for the second time in three years. White finished with 16 points and only two 3s in the game. Jaylen Brown led Boston with 29 points while Jayson Tatum added 26 points. Indiana, which again played without two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton, lost its second straight at home — both in the final minute after giving up leads. Andrew Nembhard had 24 points, 10 assists and six rebounds but missed a potentially tying 3-pointer in the closing seconds and the Pacers never go the ball again. Longtime umpire Ángel Hernández retires. He unsuccessfully sued MLB for racial discrimination NEW YORK (AP) — Longtime umpire Ángel Hernández, who unsuccessfully sued Major League Baseball for racial discrimination, is retiring immediately. During a career that lasted more than three decades, the 62-year-old Hernández was often scorned by players, managers and fans for missed calls and quick ejections — some in high-profile situations. Hernández issued a statement through MLB on Monday night saying he has decided he wants to spend more time with his family. Newgarden salvages his season with an Indy 500 win on a last-lap defeat of a heartbroken O'Ward INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. One way to ensure a new contract is in your future is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O’Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. O'Ward, meanwhile, was devastated by his near-miss. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Closers Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have Mavs on verge of sweeping Wolves in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have been the closers for the Dallas Mavericks, who have a chance to sweep Minnesota in the Western Conference finals. The Dallas co-stars are coming off another big fourth quarter in a victory that gave the Mavs a 3-0 series lead. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. The Mavs can reach the NBA Finals for the first time since winning their only title 13 years ago. Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and the Timberwolves face some long odds. No team has rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the NBA playoffs. Fifteen of the 20 teams that have lost the first three games while starting the series at home have been swept. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Shohei Ohtani lost sleep after translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from him NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. Counsell's return to Milwaukee includes thank-you message and chorus of boos MILWAUKEE (AP) — Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the Chicago Cubs hired him away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos. A brief pregame video showcased some highlights from Counsell’s tenure as Milwaukee’s manager before displaying him wearing a Brewers cap alongside the message, “Thank You No. 30.” Brewers fans booed throughout the video, and then booed again when he was introduced as the Cubs’ manager.",

        "content": "A fire has broken out at a landfill site in the popular holiday destination of Lanzarote , Spain . It started on Monday night after 7pm at the Zonzamas environmental complex, near Costa Teguise, and pictures from the scene show fire and smoke billowing out from the area. The fire then quickly spread to other areas of the complex before emergency services were called. The Government of the Canary Islands has activated the Civil Protection Territorial Emergency Plan, according to the Canarian Weekly . This means people are urged to stay away from the landfill site for safety reasons. Residents in the area have also been told to close doors and windows and avoid going outside as a precaution against smoke inhalation. Firefighters are also attempting to extinguish the fire this morning with helicopters from the air. Fire services and voluntary fire services were called from the island’s main fire station and the airport fire station.

        "content": "Virgil van Dijk says it’s ‘obvious’ new Liverpool manager Arne Slot will make ‘a lot of changes’ and has provided an update on his own future at Anfield. When Jurgen Klopp announced that he was leaving Liverpool at the end of 2023-24, Van Dijk raised alarm bells by suggesting he could follow him out the door . Captain Van Dijk only has a year left on his current Liverpool deal and could decide to move on next summer if he cannot agree a fresh contract with the Reds. But Van Dijk is one of four players Slot is keen to build his team around and the pair have already sat down for talks as Liverpool prepare for a new area. ‘I congratulated him of course and I’m really pleased for him and his family,’ Van Dijk said of his chat with Slot. ‘We spoke about the team and the future, but now my focus is fully on the national team. ‘I still have a year left on my [Liverpool] contract. I am club captain and I have made it clear I am there for the new coach and enthusiastic over the next season. ‘Obviously, there will be a lot of changes but I am confident we will make a big success of it.’ Slot arrives at Liverpool with a glowing reputation and fellow star Trent Alexander-Arnold has ‘total trust’ that the Dutchman is the right man to succeed Klopp. ‘I have trust in the club and who we’ve appointed,’ the Englishman recently told Sky Sports.

But he faces a tough task in matching Klopp’s reign at Liverpool – with the German winning seven major trophies – including the Premier League and Champions League during his time at Anfield.

        "content": "The 22-time grand slam winner has not closed the door completely on a return next year but maintains there is a “big chance” he will end his career after the Olympics, which will also be played at Roland Garros. Nadal was unseeded in Paris due to his prolonged injury absence which left him susceptible to a nightmare draw, which is exactly what he got. The Spaniard was beaten 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 by in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev in the first round. But three-time former champion Mats Wilander believes Nadal showed enough against Zverev to prove he can still compete at the top, even though he turns 38 next week. “Obviously the Olympics are huge and for him to have the chance to play on Phillipe Chatrier is amazing and could be an unbelievable end to his career,” Eurosport expert Wilander said. “But he’s too competitive, he’s playing too good. I think he beats 90 per cent of the draw. There’s only a few guys that would beat him playing this well. “And Zverev was the worst opponent possible in the first round, worse that playing (Novak) Djokovic, worse than playing (Carlos) Alcaraz. “Also the circumstances; it’s indoor, cold outside, the ball doesn’t travel. So I think all that, and still being so close – it’s all positive for Rafa and with that passion, why not? He knows how to win big matches on this court.”",

        "content": "A huge project to create one of the biggest reedbeds in the UK at a quarry site is more than half complete. The RSPB said work to expand its Ouse Fen nature reserve, north of Cambridge, started in 2001. New wetland is being carefully created by the phased restoration of Needingworth Quarry, where sand and gravel are extracted for use by the construction industry. Around 16 million tonnes of aggregates have been quarried from the site to make way for wetland habitat, and the reserve will grow to the size of nearly 980 football pitches by the end of the project. The quarry operator, initially Heidelberg Materials (formerly Hanson UK) and now Brice Aggregates, is gradually handing the restored wetland over to the RSPB. In the last 20 years the site has become a habitat for bitterns, marsh harriers and bearded tits as well as otters, water voles and 22 different species of dragonfly. Volunteers have been helping to plant reeds, and those in nearby villages have created walking routes. When the project is completed, Ouse Fen along with its neighbouring RSPB nature reserves – Fen Drayton Lakes and the Ouse Washes – will form a near continuous 3,000 hectare wetland habitat – around half the size of nearby Ely. Chris Hudson, senior site manager at RSPB Ouse Fen said: “We have achieved such a lot here, and we are over the moon at how this long-term project has nurtured endangered wildlife populations, but there is still much more work to do. “As we move through the final decade of the project, working with our new partner Brice Aggregates, we plan to build on the outstanding legacy of work with Heidelberg Materials, to finalise our conservation ambition at Ouse Fen – to create one of the biggest reedbeds in the UK and a wonderful wetland wilderness for both wildlife and people to enjoy.” Oliver Brice, managing director of Brice Aggregates, said: “The quarrying operations at Needingworth provide vital raw materials to the construction industry across the East of England and East Midlands whilst supporting jobs and economic activity locally. “What differentiates this site however is the focus on restoration from the outset and the proactive collaboration between industry and the RSPB. “The ongoing creation of Ouse Fen is a long established and exemplary quarry restoration scheme providing a new large scale and nationally significant wetland habitat. “We are pleased to be taking over the project from the capable stewardship of Heidelberg Materials and look forward to working with the RSPB to continue delivering benefits for vulnerable wildlife species and local communities alike. “It is a harmonious scheme delivering for its many stakeholders.”",

        "content": "'We have nothing.' As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and searching for food DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The tent camps stretch for more than 16 kilometers (10 miles) along Gaza’s coast, filling the beach and sprawling into empty lots, fields and town streets. Families dig trenches to use as toilets. Fathers search for food and water, while children look through garbage and wrecked buildings for scraps of wood or cardboard for their mothers to burn for cooking. Over the past three weeks, Israel’s offensive in Rafah has sent nearly a million Palestinians fleeing the southern Gaza city and scattering across a wide area. Most have already been displaced multiple times during Israel’s nearly 8-month-old war in Gaza, which is aimed at destroying Hamas but has devastated the territory and caused what the United Nations says is a near-famine. The situation has been worsened by a dramatic plunge in the amount of food, fuel and other supplies reaching the U.N. and other aid groups to distribute to the population. Palestinians have largely been on their own to resettle their families and find the basics for survival. “The situation is tragic. You have 20 people in the tent, with no clean water, no electricity. We have nothing,” said Mohammad Abu Radwan, a schoolteacher in a tent with his wife, six children, and other extended family. “I can’t explain what it feels like living through constant displacement, losing your loved ones,” he said. “All of this destroys us mentally.” Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a 'tragic mishap' TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that a “tragic mishap” was made in an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah that set fire to a camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night there was a tragic mishap,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Spain and Norway formally recognize a Palestinian state as EU rift with Israel widens BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” At least 22 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 22 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. A tornado watch was issued from North Carolina to Maryland. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that five people had died in his state. The fifth death was a 54-year-old man who had a heart attack while cutting fallen trees in Caldwell County in western Kentucky, the governor’s office said. The death toll of 22 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. In Trump's hush money trial, prosecutors and defense lawyers are poised to make final pitch to jury NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors and defense lawyers in Donald Trump's hush money trial are set to deliver closing arguments to the jury Tuesday, each side looking to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president to be charged with felony crimes. The arguments, expected to last the entire day, will give the attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury hearing the landmark case. After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial. After the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked. Voter outreach groups targeted by new laws in several GOP-led states are struggling to do their work WASHINGTON (AP) — During the presidential election four years ago, the Equal Ground Education Fund hired over 100 people to go door-to-door and attend festivals, college homecomings and other events to help register voters across Florida. Their efforts for this year's elections look much different. A state law passed last year forced them to stop in-person voter registration, cut staff and led to a significant drop in funding. Organizers aren't sure how robust their operations will be in the fall. Genesis Robinson, the group's interim executive director, said the law has had a “tremendous impact” on its ability to host events and get into communities to engage directly with potential voters. “Prior to all of these changes, we were able to operate in a space where we were taking action and prepare our communities and make sure they were registered to vote — and help if they weren’t,” he said. Florida is one of several states, including Kansas, Missouri and Texas, where Republicans have enacted voting restrictions since 2021 that created or enhanced criminal penalties and fines for those who assist voters. The laws have forced some voter outreach groups to cease operations, while others have greatly altered or reduced their activities. What to know about Mexico's historic elections Sunday that will likely put a woman in power MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexicans will vote Sunday in historic elections weighing gender, democracy and populism, as they chart the country's path forward in voting shadowed by cartel violence. With two women leading the contest, Mexico will likely elect its first female president – a major step in a country long marked by its “macho” culture. The election will also be the biggest in the country's history. More than 20,000 congressional and local positions are up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute. The number of contested posts has fed bloodshed during the campaigns, as criminal groups have used local elections as an opportunity to exert power. A toxic slate of cartels and gangs have battled for turf and more than 20 people seeking political office have been killed just this year. Also at play is the political legacy of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Mexico's often tumultuous relationship with the United States. Candidate Claudia Sheinbaum, the former mayor of Mexico City, has maintained a comfortable double-digit lead in polls for months. She promises to be a continuation of populist leader López Obrador and is backed by his ruling Morena party. Trained as a scientist, Sheinbaum has had to walk a fine line to carve out her own image while highlighting her connection to López Obrador, though she lacks the charisma that attracted many to her political ally. Fears rise of a second landslide and disease outbreak at site of Papua New Guinea disaster MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Authorities fear a second landslide and a disease outbreak are looming at the scene of Papua New Guinea’s mass-casualty disaster because of water streams and bodies trapped beneath the tons of debris that swept over a village, a United Nations official said Tuesday. A mass of boulders, earth and splintered trees devastated Yambali in the South Pacific nation’s remote highlands when a limestone mountainside sheared away Friday. The blanket of debris has become more unstable with recent rain and streams trapped between the ground and rubble, said Serhan Aktoprak, chief of the International Organization for Migration’s mission in Papua New Guinea. The U.N. agency has officials at the scene in Enga province helping shelter 1,600 displaced people. The agency estimates 670 villagers died, while Papua New Guinea’s government has told the United Nations it thinks more than 2,000 people were buried. Five bodies had been retrieved from the rubble by Monday. “We are hearing suggestions that another landslide can happen and maybe 8,000 people need to be evacuated,” Aktoprak told The Associated Press. “This is a major concern. The movement of the land, the debris, is causing a serious risk, and overall the total number of people that may be affected might be 6,000 or more,” he said. That includes villagers whose source of clean drinking water has been buried and subsistence farmers who lost their vegetable gardens. Last year's deadly heat wave in metro Phoenix didn't discriminate PHOENIX (AP) — Priscilla Orr, 75, was living in her old white Kia in a supermarket parking lot last summer after telling her family she lost her money and home to a romance scam. But the car broke down, and the air conditioner stopped working, leaving her vulnerable to the dangerous desert heat. Orr collapsed last July as she walked on the lot’s scalding asphalt, which registered 149 degrees Fahrenheit (65 C) as the air temperature topped the triple digits. She was dead by the time paramedics arrived. Orr was among over 400 people who died last year in metro Phoenix from heat-associated causes during a 31-day streak of sizzling days of 110 F (43.3 C) or higher that stretched from the last day of June through all of July. That's about two-thirds of 645 heat-related deaths confirmed from the whole year in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and Arizona's most populous county. No other major metropolitan area in the U.S. has reported such high heat-associated death figures. Celtics rally late again to close out Pacers for 4-0 sweep in Eastern Conference finals INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Derrick White stood stoically at midcourt as his teammates celebrated Monday night. He saw Jayson Tatum toss the ball high into the air, Al Horford run toward the coaching staff and looking for his son long before Jaylen Brown hoisted the Eastern Conference finals MVP trophy. Even coach Joe Mazzulla shared the moment with his wife. White, meanwhile, seemed ready to get back to work after making the tie-breaking 3-pointer with 43 seconds left, giving the Boston Celtics a 105-102 victory and their second trip in three years to the NBA Finals with a 4-0 sweep over the Indiana Pacers. “Great shot. We work on that all the time, two-on-one reads,” Brown said after scoring 29 points, grabbing six rebounds and blocking a key shot with 65 seconds left to preserve the lead. “Before that, I told D White just to stay ready and that was a big shot, a big shot to send us to the finals.” White scored just 16 points and made just 1 of 8 3s before making the decisive shot from the corner. Until then, he seemed to have taken a back seat to Brown, Tatum, who had 26 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists, Jrue Holiday and even the 37-year-old Horford.",

        "description": "For millions of Americans, the definition of retirement has changed.",
        "content": "A new report from Fidelity shows that most Americans are thinking more about the active lifestyle they want during their retirement. While prior generations' most popular perception of life in retirement involved days of leisure and relaxation, the COVID-19 pandemic made many people rethink their priorities for making the most of their golden years. Now, retirement is seen as a time for fun, adventure, and possibly part-time work. Travel, overseas relocation, and entrepreneurship are all par for this adventurous retirement course. Americans now view retirement less as a fixed destination and more as a gradual process involving multiple phases. A clear cross-generational majority of respondents say they look forward to pursuing work for pleasure after concluding their corporate careers. They also hope for a phased retirement, whereby their workload gradually declines instead of stopping altogether. \"As more people rethink retirement, with new goals such as living abroad or starting a business, we're encouraged to see a growing understanding of the value in creating a retirement plan early,\" explains Rita Assaf, Vice President of Retirement Products at Fidelity Investments. How can retirees plan for this active approach to retirement? As the cost of hiring a financial advisor declined in recent years, more Americans now seek professional guidance to craft a plan for their ideal retirement journey. “If you’re financially independent, focus on what you’re good at, love, and the world needs. If that happens to earn income, all the better,” says Kevin Estes, Financial Planner and Founder of Scaled Finance . “I suggest everyone explore their passions. What energizes you? How could you do more of what you love and less of what you don’t,” he adds. The rise in phased retirements, alongside fears of diminishing Social Security benefits, spells drastic changes to the retirement landscape. Financial advisors are proactively planning for this active retirement paradigm shift, with some even acting as recruiters for their clients. While some \"phases\" work to mitigate boredom, others’ economic positions thrust them back into the workplace. From 2000 through 2015, the labor force participation rate for American men in their mid-to-late-60s rose from 30% to 37%, according to the Social Security Administration . For women, participation rose from 19% to 28%. The COVID-19 pandemic unleashed a wave of disruption across the workplace; T. Rowe Price reports that approximately 1.5 million retirees re-entered the workforce by March 2022, though work-from-home arrangements allow retirees to re-enter their former roles remotely. The same study states that in 2024, one in five retirees will work full-time or part-time, while 7% will actively seek employment. While varying factors contribute to one’s decision to return to work post-retirement — or not step away from the office at all — rising numbers of older employees mean employers and workers must increasingly consider health and safety. \"Health is a critical factor in retirement planning,\" says Ryan Furlong, Certified Financial Planner at Purpose Path Capital. \"For clients with health concerns, or when one or both spouses may not be in sufficient health, we emphasize the importance of comprehensive health insurance planning, including Medicare, long-term care insurance, and emergency funds specifically allocated for health-related expenses,\" Furlong adds. For baby boomers wishing to tiptoe into retirement, experts suggest leaning into hobbies or other special interests to maintain a source of income. \"The number one retirement regret is boredom,\" says Jon McCardle, President of Summit Financial Group of Indiana . \"Those who exchange their job for their hobbies, volunteerism, or non-profit work don't have regrets, versus others who do because their identities are usually misplaced, and now they have nothing to do.\" McCardle continues, \"For those interested in the phased approach to retirement, we help them identify potential jobs and connect them within our network to companies or contacts that would allow them to pursue their potential. We also help them understand how the new income will impact their plan and taxes.” As expectations around modern Americans’ twilight years continue to change, experts stress the importance of flexibility and openness. “Retirement has become a stepping stone towards new opportunities,” says Jorey Bernstein, CEO of Bernstein Investment Consultants . “Retirement is no longer a static concept, but a dynamic phase of life. The evolving landscape of retirement reflects changing perspectives and longer lifespans.” Wise retirees-in-waiting have already begun preparations. Fidelity reports that the average baby boomer kickstarted their retirement planning at age 43, while the average Gen Z respondent began planning at age 20. Some are even planning their post-work life before entering their prime working years by reading retirement planning books and enlisting the help of financial advisors. Americans no longer perceive retirement as Adirondack chair-sitting and trips to the local golf course. Many modern Americans consider retirement an opportunity to pursue special interests and stay active. Whether traveling, starting a business, or working part-time, many options can lead to fulfilling golden years. By planning and consulting financial advisors, Americans can enjoy the retired life of their dreams filled with joy, adventure, and purpose.",

As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and searching for food DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The tent camps stretch for more than 16 kilometers (10 miles) along Gaza’s coast, filling the beach and sprawling into empty lots, fields and town streets. Families dig trenches to use as toilets. Fathers search for food and water, while children look through garbage and wrecked buildings for scraps of wood or cardboard for their mothers to burn for cooking.

The island nation’s Elections Commission earlier this month said the presidential election would be conducted between September 17 and October 16.

The nation faced economic adversity, but resolute measures were taken to steer it away from the brink. These efforts yielded significant victories,” Bandara told reporters here. “We have regained international trust, stabilised the economy, and provided relief to our citizens. Administrative reforms have streamlined governance, and the education system has returned to normalcy,” he asserted. Range Bandara attributed these achievements to the current President’s leadership and underscored that the country’s current needs do not align with an immediate Presidential or Parliamentary election. “Instead, he called upon all members of parliament to rally behind a proposal: extending the current President’s term by two years (or potentially five), along with a corresponding extension of the current parliament’s tenure,” the news portal said. Range Bandara urged unity across party lines, including opposition leader Sajith Premadasa’s support, the news portal said. The Government has reached agreements with the IMF, World Bank and other donors on economic reforms and it is essential to extend the terms of the President and Parliament to make this exercise a success, another news portal, Daily Mirror, said quoting Bandara. “Stabilising the economy is more important than anything,” Range Bandara told the media and added, “We propose a referendum to extend the terms of the President and Parliament as it is the most democratic way to do it.” Incidentally, President Wickremesinghe, 75, last week reiterated his intention to hold the next presidential election this year ahead of the parliamentary election. He had told the Cabinet meeting that day that financial allocations have only been reserved so far for the conduct of the presidential poll. Wickremesinghe succeeded Sri Lanka People’s Front – commonly known by its Sinhalese name Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) – elected president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to become president for the rest of the term when the latter was ousted, after the island nation declared first international default, during street protests which lasted between April and July of 2022. Rajapaksa gave in to calls for his resignation due to his inability to handle the unprecedented economic crisis. Wickremesinghe since taking over has steered the economy to safety by securing an IMF bailout. Analysts, however, feel that Sri Lanka is not completely out of the woods yet. Minister of Fisheries and the leader of the Eelam People’s Democratic Party Douglas Devananda on Tuesday said President Wickremasinghe’s experience and performance, as well as his management ability, cannot be matched with any other politician in Sri Lanka Addressing the opening ceremony of the Training and Research building of the Medical Faculty of Jaffna University, the Sri Lankan Tamil minister said that because of the current economic crisis and the great instability in the country, it was his opinion that Wickremasinghe should continue to be the president and the people of the country should also have the same opinion. Meanwhile, Island.lk news portal reported that a new political alliance ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ was launched in Colombo Monday with seven political parties joining forces to contest the forthcoming elections. The new alliance includes Dilith Jayaweera’s Mawbima Janatha Party (MJP), MP Wimal Weerawansa’s National Freedom Front (NFF), MP Udaya Gammanpila’s Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (JHU), MP Vasudewa Nanayakkara’s Democratic Left Front, the Communist Party, MP Gevindu Kumaratunga’s Yuthukama National Organisation (YNO) and a collective of ‘independent’ MPs, led by MP Channa Jayasumana. An agreement on the formation of the new alliance was signed Monday as the new alliance announced a 10-point programme, the portal said. “At a time when the country is facing an unprecedented crisis, those of us coming together as ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ recognise the need to move beyond criticism to find solutions, and to formulate a strategic plan that goes beyond empty promises,” Jayaweera said on X.

        "description": "Former West Ham and Bolton attacker Dapo Alofayan has enjoyed a fine season out in Germany with St Pauli after helping them to promotion back to the Bundesliga",
        "content": "English forward Dapo Alofayan is relishing the chance to pit his wits against the likes of Harry Kane and Bayern Munich next season after his historic promotion with St Pauli. Alofayan, 26, has enjoyed a terrific first full season in the second tier of German football having joined St Pauli from Bolton for £500,000 in January 2023. He helped the club win the Bundesliga 2 title, scoring 10 goals in 34 appearances across the campaign. St Pauli topped the table after fending off second-placed Holstein Kiel and Fortuna Dusseldorf in third, winning 20 and drawing nine of their 34 league matches. It means the Hamburg-based outfit will play in the Bundesliga for the first time in 13 years. Speaking to Mirror Football , Afolayan said: \"It has been amazing to be honest from start to finish. We set our targets at the beginning of the season based on what we knew we could achieve and the quality within the squad. Saying it [winning it] is one thing, but going out there and doing it is another. It’s a remarkable achievement and I am really proud.\" Arsenal's summer transfer plans made clear by sporting director Edu Chelsea told Enzo Maresca is 'far better' than Mauricio Pochettino and Jose Mourinho Afolayan had been a key figure in their success for the majority of the season, but his most valuable contribution came when they officially secured promotion to the German top flight. Earlier this month, he scored twice and set up another to help St Pauli beat Osnabruck 3-1, sparking wild scenes including a pitch invasion at Millerntor-Stadion. \"For me on a personal note, it was great,\" he said, recalling the match. \"I went into the game wanting to help the team as best as I could and the ball has dropped to me twice in good positions and I have put them away. Yeah, it has helped us get over the line. \"It has been a nervy couple of months really because we knew we were quite close and the way we had been playing all season I felt like we deserved it. After that, I was lucky as I had quite a lot of family over there as well. So, for everyone to be able to witness that with the pitch invasion that ensued afterwards was so special.\" St Pauli forward Dapo Alofayan is set to play in the Bundesliga next season ( Image: Getty Images) Although St Pauli played against some powerhouses in the form of Schalke, Hamburg and Hertha Berlin last season, they are now set to go head-to-head with the creme de la creme of German football. When asked about who he is most looking forward to facing next season, Afolayan replied: \"The easy answer is Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund or Bayer Leverkusen. Those three in particular are going to be special games because of the history and what Leverkusen have achieved this season. \"I was hoping we could play them in the cup, but we got knocked out in the round before that, so we were unable to test ourselves against them. I think I am looking forward to testing myself and the team against some of the best in Europe. Again, it will be special, especially the home games.\" Afolayan, born in Harrow, London, is one of several English players to go and play in Germany over the past couple of years. Jadon Sancho made the step when he swapped Manchester City for Borussia Dortmund in 2017, while Jude Bellingham , Harry Kane, Reiss Nelson, Emile Smith Rowe and Callum Hudson-Odoi are among the others to have played in the Bundesliga. Dapo Alofayan in action for St Pauli ( Image: Getty Images) Dapo Afolayan left Bolton to join St Pauli in January 2023 ( Image: Getty Images) His move raised eyebrows at the time, but Afolayan is grateful and glad he made the decision to swap Bolton for St Pauli. \"It has been great,\" he added. \"It has been a good opportunity to broaden my horizons and to understand European football, especially at this level as it is very different to what the Championship would be like. \"Speaking to lads who have played in both they would say it's very different but the level here is quite high, it's closer to what top European football is like. Now, we are going to get the chance to experience that next season going into the Bundesliga. Look, it's been a great move for me, I have learnt so much and I have grown as both a player and a person.\" Afolayan continued: \"For me, I have seen what international and European football is like and I know the standard is good - a lot better than what we would think back home. Coming out here for me has shown that. For young English players I would 100 per cent recommend going to other European leagues - not just Germany - because there are good opportunities and some good clubs.\" Having started his senior career out in Canada with Toronto FC, Afolayan has had a remarkable ride since. He moved back to England at the age of 18 to study a civil engineering degree and play non-league football at Loughborough University. Dapo Afolayan has scored 13 goals in 50 appearances for St Pauli ( Image: Getty Images) However, midway through the 2016/17 season, Afolayan signed for National League side Solihull Moors and turned fully professional at the club that summer. He swapped his engineering degree at university for an online course and also spent time in Jamie Vardy's JV9 Academy. After scoring 15 goals in 50 appearances for Solihull, Afolayan secured a life-changing move to West Ham in February 2018, signing a three-and-a-half year contract. Unfortunately for him, that was the start of the toughest period of his career as he battled injuries and fitness concerns for the majority of his time at the London Stadium. In fact, Afolayan spent time out on loan at Oldham and Mansfield, and made just one senior appearance before finding his feet and his golden touch at Bolton. He initially joined the League One club on loan before making the move permanent in May 2021. Reflecting on his unusual footballing path, Afolayan admitted: \"It's hard for me because very rarely do I look back on my journey and say 'I have come so far' as at that point sometimes you feel like you have achieved something and I don't think I have achieved much. \"There are players in the game who have achieved a lot more, I have worked as hard as I can to get to the position I am at and that is all I want to keep doing. My family and friends who were with me in the Loughborough [University] days sometimes mention to me how far I have come. But for me, I try and keep myself in the present and I think that has been the best way for me and that has helped me get to where I am today. \"I wasn't at Loughborough saying I want to go and play somewhere higher, I was at Loughborough saying 'tomorrow we have got a game against Shepshed Dynamo and I have got to go and play that'. I am going to continue doing that next season.\" At 26, Afolayan still has plenty of time to go in his career and he has not given up on his dream of playing in the Premier League in the future. Outlining his ambitions, he finished: \"Me and my girlfriend are both from England and both of our families live there, so eventually we will move back, whether that be at the end of my career or during my career, you just never know what opportunities might arise. \"Playing in the Premier League has been a dream of mine and it’s something that one day I want to achieve and something I am always working towards. For now, especially in the near future, I see myself playing for St Pauli.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "content": "Mashudu Mambo TWO men from Bulawayo who appeared in court for armed robbery and carjacking following allegations that they stole a motor vehicle and threatened the taxi driver with a knife and an axe have been slapped with an effective 20-year jail sentence. Talent Tshange (31) from Cowdray Park suburb and Luckson Mlilo (29) from Nkulumane suburb pleaded not guilty to the charges before Bulawayo regional magistrate, Joseph Mabeza. The duo was found guilty and sentenced. The court heard that on 22 March 2024 at around 11pm, the duo met a taxi driver, Titus Masiya and requested to hire his vehicle to Pumula South suburb. Masiya agreed and the duo together with their other accomplices Hluphekile Nkomo and Bhekimpilo Nkomo whose case had already been finalised before the courts proceeded to Pumula South. The gang paid Masiya US$20 and when they got to Emthunzini suburb they ordered him to turn into an unnamed road and stop the vehicle. One of the culprits grabbed Masiya by his neck and searched him. They took his cellphone, US$20, driver’s licence and a Bulawayo City Council badge. Masiya was dragged out of the car and they threatened him with an axe and a jungle knife. The victim was tripped to the ground, they used pepper spray on his face and covered his mouth with a mutton cloth. They proceeded to tie his hands with a mutton cloth and they used his jacket to tie his legs and then sped off in his vehicle. The victim managed to untie himself and got help from a nearby resident who contacted his employer and the matter was reported to the police. On 23 March 2024, police received information leading to the recovery of the vehicle, which was parked opposite a church in Cowdray Park suburb and the vehicle number plates had been removed and placed behind the front passenger’s seat. Investigations were carried out, leading to the arrest of the duo and Tshange led the police to where he had hidden the knife. The value of the stolen car and goods was US$4 132 and value of the recovered car was US$4 000.",

Rose arrived in the ITV soap in April , having abandoned Dawn when she was a child. Dawn was raised by her father Will Taylor before being placed into foster care and had a troubled life until she found stability at Home Farm with Will, his wife Kim Tate and her husband Billy Fletcher. Dawn initially wanted nothing to do with Rose, but following her baby son Evan's diagnosis with Leukaemia, she asked her mother to stay in Emmerdale. Rose has clashed with Kim on a number of occasions, and her behaviour has been suspicious at times. It has been revealed that Rose has been planted in the village by Ruby Fox-Miligan, who's working on a secret masterplan to destroy Kim Tate. Rose is living at Home Farm and reporting back to Ruby as part of the ruthless scheme, although she already has doubts about betraying her daughter.

        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong police on Tuesday arrested six people accused of publishing seditious social media posts, in what are the first publicly known arrests under the city’s new national security law . Police said in a statement that a woman in custody, with the help of five others, had used a social media page to anonymously publish the posts starting in April. “(They) provoke hatred against the central government, the Hong Kong government and the city's judicial institutions, and aim to incite netizens to organize or participate in illegal activities during a later period,” the police statement said. The statement did not include other details on the social media page or the content of the posts, and it did not identify the six people, aged between 37 and 65, who were arrested. The introduction of the new security law in March — four years after Beijing imposed a similar law that had all but wiped out public dissent — has deepened worries about the erosion of the city's freedoms. The new law, known locally as “Article 23,” has expanded the government’s power to deal with future challenges to its rule, punishing treason and insurrection with up to life imprisonment. Under the legislation, offenders who commit sedition offenses face harsher penalties than before. They face a maximum jail term of seven years if convicted for committing seditious acts or uttering seditious words — up from the previous maximum sentence of two years. Authorities raided the homes of five of the suspects and seized items including electronic devices that officers suspect were used to publish the seditious messages, police said. When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, Beijing promised to retain the city’s Western-style liberties for 50 years. However, since the introduction of the 2020 law, Hong Kong authorities have severely limited free speech and assembly under the rubric of maintaining national security. Many activists were arrested, silenced or forced into self-exile. The Beijing and Hong Kong governments say the China-imposed law helped return stability following huge anti-government protests in 2019. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Kanis Leung, File) HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong police on Tuesday arrested six people, including a former organizer of the city’s decades-long annual vigil that commemorated China’s Tiananmen Square crackdown, for allegedly publishing seditious social media posts, in what were the first publicly known arrests under the city’s new national security law . Secretary for Security Chris Tang said Chow Hang-tung, a former leader of the group behind the vigil, alongside five others, used a social media page to anonymously publish the posts. Police said their acts began in April and that the suspects were targeting a “sensitive date.” The authorities have not detailed the content of the posts. But the page started publishing a series of posts to mark the upcoming 35th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown, a politically sensitive topic in Hong Kong and mainland China, on April 30. “(They) provoke hatred against the central government, the Hong Kong government and the city’s judicial institutions, and aim to incite netizens to organize or participate in illegal activities during a later period,” the police statement said.

        "description": "Hong Kong police have arrested six people accused of publishing seditious social media posts, in what are the first publicly known arrests under the city’s new national security law",
        "content": "Hong Kong police on Tuesday arrested six people, including a former organizer of the city’s decades-long annual vigil that commemorated China’s Tiananmen Square crackdown, for allegedly publishing seditious social media posts, in what were the first publicly known arrests under the city’s new national security law . Secretary for Security Chris Tang said Chow Hang-tung, a former leader of the group behind the vigil, alongside five others, used a social media page to anonymously publish the posts. Police said their acts began in April and that the suspects were targeting a “sensitive date.” The authorities have not detailed the content of the posts. But the page started publishing a series of posts to mark the upcoming 35th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown, a politically sensitive topic in Hong Kong and mainland China, on April 30. “(They) provoke hatred against the central government, the Hong Kong government and the city’s judicial institutions, and aim to incite netizens to organize or participate in illegal activities during a later period,” the police statement said. The statement did not include other details on the social media page or the content of the posts, and it did not identify the six people, aged between 37 and 65, who were arrested. The introduction of the new security law in March — four years after Beijing imposed a similar law that had all but wiped out public dissent — has deepened worries about the erosion of the city’s freedoms. The new law, known locally as “Article 23,” has expanded the government’s power to deal with future challenges to its rule, punishing treason and insurrection with up to life imprisonment. Under the legislation, offenders who commit sedition offenses face harsher penalties than before. They face a maximum jail term of seven years if convicted for committing seditious acts or uttering seditious words — up from the previous maximum sentence of two years. Authorities raided the homes of five of the suspects and seized items including electronic devices that officers suspect were used to publish the seditious messages, police said. When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, Beijing promised to retain the city’s Western-style liberties for 50 years. However, since the introduction of the 2020 law, Hong Kong authorities have severely limited free speech and assembly under the rubric of maintaining national security. Many activists were arrested, silenced or forced into self-exile. The Beijing and Hong Kong governments say the China-imposed law helped return stability following huge anti-government protests in 2019.",

        "content": "Pharmacist George Sandhu has explained how much sleep you should be getting, and detailed a number of simple ways to help beat insomnia. Mr Sandhu, pharmacist at Well Pharmacy, said the average amount of recommended sleep for adults is between seven to nine hours a night, with children and babies sleeping more - ranging from 11 to 14 hours for very young children to eight to 10 hours for teenagers. He said: \"Stress and anxiety are the main reasons people struggle to sleep. Often people with too much to think about are still consumed by thought when they lay down their head at night, preventing them from falling asleep or getting the adequate amount.\" Mr Sandhu added: \"Lack of sleep can also affect mental health with two thirds of adolescents saying poor sleep has a negative impact on their mental health.\" According to Mr Sandhu, the top six major factors that cause insomnia are: Mr Sandhu, Deputy Pharmacy Superintendent, said: “Community pharmacy teams can offer valuable advice to customers on improving sleep hygiene and managing stress using the following strategies: “Establish a Consistent Routine - suggest maintaining a regular sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends. “Create a Relaxing Sleep Environment - encourage customers to keep their bedrooms cool, dark, and quiet. Advise them to invest in comfortable bedding and consider using white noise machines, an eye mask or earplugs if needed. “Practice Relaxation Techniques - recommend relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to help unwind before bedtime. “Limit Screen Time Before Bed - advice against using electronic devices like smartphones, computers, or tablets before bedtime as the blue light emitted can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. “Opt for Relaxing Activities - Encourage customers to engage in calming activities before bed such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or listening to soothing music to help signal to the body that it's time to wind down. “Avoid Stimulants - Advise customers to limit the consumption of caffeinated or sugary drinks in the hours leading up to bedtime and instead opt for caffeine-free herbal teas or warm milk drinks. “Limit Alcohol and Nicotine - Explain that while alcohol may initially induce drowsiness, they can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to fragmented or poor-quality sleep. “Manage Stress - Offer strategies for stress management such as mindfulness techniques, journaling, or seeking support from a therapist or counsellor if stress is impacting sleep. “Promote Healthy Lifestyle Habits - Emphasise the importance of regular physical exercise and a balanced diet in promoting overall well-being and better sleep quality. However, advise against exercising vigorously close to bedtime as it may interfere with sleep. “Know When to Seek Help - Inform customers that if they continue to experience difficulty falling or staying asleep despite implementing these strategies, they should consult their doctor. “Your local pharmacist can offer various options for treating stress and insomnia, such as over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, natural remedies, and self-care advice. “OTC medications like tablets or liquids containing ingredients such as valerian or lavender for relaxation, or antihistamines like diphenhydramine for inducing drowsiness, can be provided. However, these should be used cautiously for short-term relief, typically limited to 1 to 2 weeks. “They can also offer self-care advice, including relaxation techniques and lifestyle modifications to promote better sleep and stress management. “Pharmacists provide personalised consultations, advising on safe usage and potential interactions, ensuring individuals receive appropriate treatment.”",

It was replying to The Straits Times’ queries regarding a circular it had sent to all doctors on April 22 reminding them of their professional obligations when issuing medical certificates (MCs). MOH had sent the circular after receiving feedback from employers, government agencies and schools that with the advent of telemedicine, there has been “excessive” MCs issued. The feedback also mentions MCs given to people who were not sick and to malingerers who get repeated MCs through teleconsultation, without any physical check by a doctor. In the circular, MOH also said that it plans to amend the Healthcare Services Act to require that every MC issued for a patient must include the name and medical registration number of the issuing medical practitioner. ST had asked the ministry on May 9 if it had data on the alleged abuse of MCs or if it was purely anecdotal feedback. Without knowing the size of the problem, it is difficult to decide what action, if any, needs to be taken, ST said in a commentary on May 27. ST also asked if MOH had proof of MCs that were issued by people who were not doctors or dentists. Responding on May 28, the ministry said: “The MOH has received feedback on the manner that medical certificates have been issued. The feedback came from various employers, government agencies and schools.” It added: “MOH is reviewing the feedback and will take enforcement or regulatory action if any licensee is found to be in contravention of the Medical Registration Act, the Dental Registration Act or the Healthcare Services Act, regulations and/or licence conditions.” Explaining its proposed amendment to the Healthcare Services Act that will require a doctor or dentist to have “provided medical or dental care... to the patient” when issuing an MC, the ministry said: “The proposed new requirement will encompass any form of medical or dental care provided to the patient and is not limited by the mode in which it is provided.” The news that MOH plans to tighten the rules on the issuance of MCs has resulted in much heated debate among employers and employees alike. Some people said they fear those who are really ill might not be given sick leave as a result, while employers, who have to accept MCs, said teleconsultations have resulted in a lot more MCs being issued. Others implied that staff might seek MCs when not sick because of poor workplace conditions.",

        "content": "Premier League side Liverpool have entered the race to sign Atalanta midfielder Ederson, according to reports in Italy. The Reds are hoping to begin the Arne Slot era on a strong footing, and the 24-year-old Brazilian would represent an ideal first signing for the Dutchman, who has been chosen as Jürgen Klopp’s successor after his nine-year reign at Anfield came to an emotional close, himself leaving Feyenoord. His final campaign saw Liverpool beat Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley in February. Ederson has been previously linked with Newcastle, but the Reds will hope to steal in and secure his services after his impressive display in Atalanta’s 3-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League final last week. The Italian club knocked Liverpool out of the competition on their way to success in Dublin, and Ederson’s performances caught the eye in particular. Reds want more midfield reinforcements In Klopp’s final summer, the focus of their transfer dealings was on revamping the midfield. While the likes of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho departed, Alexis Mac Allister, Wataru Endo, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch joined. Endo’s signing from Stuttgart was seen as the most defensive, and therefore most similar to the profile Ederson, who is six years younger.

The links made sense because he had played under incoming boss Slot at AZ Alkmaar, but with Ederson in sight on Merseyside, Juventus are said to now have a free run at Koopmeiners. Reds scouts had been watching him, but shifted their attention with Ederson’s performances impressing. Ederson joined Atalanta in 2022 from Salernitana and has since played 70 league games for the club. His performances this season also helped them finish in the top four, meaning they qualified for the Champions League through their league position having already secured it with their Europa League triumph. Ederson has not been selected for Brazil’s Copa America squad, having not yet made his senior debut for the Selecao. In fact, he has only played once for the under-20 side. Were he to join Liverpool in the summer, he would also get the chance to play Champions League football after the club secured their place after a year away. But there will be hope that Slot can build on the final season under Klopp and challenge for the Premier League title again.

        "content": "Refusing to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election has become a litmus test for Republicans jockeying to become former President Trump’s running mate, but that’s making their Senate GOP colleagues uncomfortable about the prospect of another Jan. 6-style standoff if Trump loses. A group of Senate Republicans are rejecting the idea that a victory for President Biden in November would likely be the result of fraud, sending a clear message to Trump and his allies that any attempt to challenge the results without clear evidence of misconduct won’t find much support in Washington. While Trump has refused to accept the election results in advance, many GOP lawmakers aren’t willing to go down that same road — except for a handful who are trying to rise to the top of his VP shortlist. And these ambitious Republicans jockeying to ingratiate themselves with Trump are putting themselves on an island within the GOP. “What happened in 2020 was something that most people never thought was possible — not only challenge the outcome of the election, question the legitimacy of the president and then work to stop the certification,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) about lingering anxiety from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. She said Republicans are being asked whether they will accept the results of November’s election because of how Jan. 6 still weighs on the nation. “It’s not a question that’s out of the blue. It’s something that’s important for people to know,” she said. Murkowski and other Republicans say Trump or Biden have the right to challenge the election results in court but that once a court rules and without clear and compelling evidence of widespread fraud, the losing candidate must accept the outcome. “I want us to be in a place where we accept the outcome of fair and legitimate elections,” she said. “What I don’t like is the suggestion months and months and months prior to an election that there might be something nefarious at play.” Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.), who helped lead the opposition to Trump’s effort to block the certification of Biden’s victory on the Senate floor, said this week he would accept the results if they are validated by the courts — taking the same position that he and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) took after the 2020 election. “I’m all for, in any election if there are concerns about the election, whether or not there were fraudulent aspects to it, to allow all the mechanisms under the law — whether it’s recounts or audits or lawsuits, etc. — but when those are all done and settled, it’s over,” Thune said. Thune famously predicted that an attempt to block the certification of the 2020 election on the Senate floor would go down “like a shot dog.” That was after Trump’s own attorney general, Bill Barr, announced in December 2020 that the Justice Department had found no evidence of widespread fraud in the election and multiple challenges by Trump’s allies to overturn state results failed in court. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said he’s going to look carefully at the election results and claims of fraud, but he expects to certify the election results like he did in 2021. “I’m going to follow the same process I have in the elections of the past. I’m going to look at the process ... And I would expect more likely than not I’m going to vote to certify the election results like I did in 2020,” Tillis said. Tillis said he called legislative leaders in 2020 to follow up on fraud claims and felt reassured there was not widespread fraud, despite Trump’s claims at the time. Asked whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) answered simply: “I don’t know why you wouldn’t.” “The results are the results,” he said. But Trump is now again regularly raising doubts about the fairness of the 2024 election — about once a day, according to an analysis by The New York Times published Friday. And the tactic is being copied by Republican senators vying to be his running mate or trying to appeal to the GOP base for their own reelection races. Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who are said to be on Trump’s vice-presidential shortlist, have declined in nationally televised interviews to commit to accepting the election results. Scott, who is viewed as a front-runner for the VP slot in the Senate GOP conference, repeatedly declined to make any commitment when “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker asked him six times whether he would accept the results of the November election. Rubio deflected a question on NBC’s “Meet the Press” this month about accepting the results of the election by insisting: “You’re asking the wrong person.” “You have Democrats now saying they won’t certify 2024 because Trump is an insurrectionist and ineligible to hold office. So you need to ask them,” he said. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is up for reelection and led a push to delay the certification of the 2020 election results, bristled when asked in a CNN interview last week whether he would accept the election results, calling it a “ridiculous question.” “If the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I’m not going to ignore fraud,” he said. Cruz still claims there was “significant voter fraud in 2020.” Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), a possible VP pick in the GOP conference, said he would have declined to certify Biden’s victory in January 2021 if he was serving in the Senate at the time. He didn’t come to the upper chamber until January 2023. Vance hedged slightly when asked recently whether he would commit to accepting the election results, qualifying his pledge to accept the results if the election is “free and fair.” “If it’s a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results,” he told CNN’s Dana Bash . “And again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president.” Vance, however, cautioned that if there are claims of fraud, “you have to be willing to pursue those problems and prosecute the case.” “Certainly, if we have a free and fair election, I’ll accept the results,” he said. Cramer, the North Dakota GOP senator, said colleagues who are declining to commit to accepting the election results are sending a message to Trump, possibly in hopes of being tapped for the ticket. “I imagine they’re messaging to the person who will make the decision about who the running mate is,” he said. “The results are the results. Short of some catastrophic or obvious case of fraud or abuse, I’m not much for fighting the election results beyond the legal norms,” he explained. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who is challenging Thune to succeed McConnell as Senate GOP leader in 2025, said he would defer to the courts if the election results are challenged. “There’s a process by which any irregularities can be challenged, and that is typically in court, and I’ll inspect the final judgment of the court if there’s any kind of contest,” he said. Cornyn said “a lot of states have come a long way in tightening things up, but I think it’s still an issue,” referring to the concerns that many Republican politicians, pundits and voters had about state election law changes during the pandemic to make it easier to vote by absentee ballot. Cornyn has worked to appeal to conservative colleagues such as Cruz and other conservative members of the Senate Steering Committee in his leadership campaign. Several states, including Georgia, North Carolina and Texas have since tightened their absentee voting rules. Georgia, for example, has passed a law to curtail the mass mailing of absentee ballots, and North Carolina has passed a new law requiring mail-in ballots to be received by Election Night.",

        "content": "Bhadrak: Union Minister Amit Shah criticized the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) on Tuesday, accusing the regional party of neglecting Odisha’s people and failing to develop the state over the past 25 years. He was addressing a public meeting in Chandbali, Bhadrak district. “Naveen babu is trying to impose a Tamil chief minister on you. You’ve tolerated Naveen babu, but we won’t tolerate this Tamil babu,” Shah said. Shah expressed confidence over BJP’s victory in the Lok Sabha polls by claiming that the party has already secured 310 seats after the fifth phase of polling. “By the sixth and seventh phases, we aim for over 400 seats. Additionally, we need to win 17 Lok Sabha seats in Odisha and form a BJP government here by securing over 75 seats. On June 4, the results will be announced, and Naveen Patnaik will become the former chief minister. After 25 years, Odisha will have an Odia-speaking CM,” Shah said. He alleged that despite Odisha’s wealth in natural resources, its people remain poor, blaming Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik for the situation. “Vote BJP into power, and we will ensure no youth has to leave the state in search of work,” he promised. Shah also questioned the whereabouts of the Ratna Bhandar keys of the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri. “I want to ask CM Naveen Patnaik what happened to the original keys of Ratna Bhandar? Duplicate keys were made, and Naveen babu needs to explain why the probe report isn’t public. Who is the BJD government protecting? Vote for BJP, and we will reveal the report within a month,” Shah asserted. Furthermore, Shah criticized the state’s refusal to implement the Ayushman Bharat scheme. “PM Modi pledged to provide drinking water, yet millions here are deprived. We will meet the demand for a medical college in Bhadrak within four months of forming the government and grant autonomous status to the college here,” he added.",

Vance hedged slightly when asked recently whether he would commit to accepting the election results, qualifying his pledge to accept the results if the election is “free and fair.” “If it’s a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results,” he told CNN’s Dana Bash . “And again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president.” Vance, however, cautioned that if there are claims of fraud, “you have to be willing to pursue those problems and prosecute the case.” “Certainly, if we have a free and fair election, I’ll accept the results,” he said. Cramer, the North Dakota GOP senator, said colleagues who are declining to commit to accepting the election results are sending a message to Trump, possibly in hopes of being tapped for the ticket. “I imagine they’re messaging to the person who will make the decision about who the running mate is,” he said. “The results are the results. Short of some catastrophic or obvious case of fraud or abuse, I’m not much for fighting the election results beyond the legal norms,” he explained. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who is challenging Thune to succeed McConnell as Senate GOP leader in 2025, said he would defer to the courts if the election results are challenged. “There’s a process by which any irregularities can be challenged, and that is typically in court, and I’ll inspect the final judgment of the court if there’s any kind of contest,” he said. Cornyn said “a lot of states have come a long way in tightening things up, but I think it’s still an issue,” referring to the concerns that many Republican politicians, pundits and voters had about state election law changes during the pandemic to make it easier to vote by absentee ballot. Cornyn has worked to appeal to conservative colleagues such as Cruz and other conservative members of the Senate Steering Committee in his leadership campaign. Several states, including Georgia, North Carolina and Texas have since tightened their absentee voting rules. Georgia, for example, has passed a law to curtail the mass mailing of absentee ballots, and North Carolina has passed a new law requiring mail-in ballots to be received by Election Night.",

        "content": "Eva Darren (second from left) in scenes from “Pangako Sa’yo” and “Brides of Blood.” Images: Courtesy of ABS-CBN Entertainment, IMDb Eva Darren has been gracing TV screens and cinemas for more than five decades, lending support roles to up-and-coming artists, to screen veterans. A familiar face to many, Darren’s acting prowess transcended generations. She started her acting career as a film star in the early 1960s, starting with the groundbreaking afternoon drama, “Hiwaga sa Bahay na Bato” (1962). Since then, she had provided the perfect foil for the lead stars. Her scene-stealing performances have bagged her several acting nominations and awards from the Gawad Urian Award, the Manila Film Festival, and the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) Awards, which is now at the center of controversy after she was dropped as one of the presenters in last awarding on May 26. Darren’s own performance fetched her a Best Supporting Actress award from FAMAS in 1970 for her performance in the Luis Nepomuceno-helmed film “Ang Pulubi,” which tells the story of an imprisoned woman who lost her sons and bright future. She also received a FAMAS nomination for her work in the films “Ang Langit Sa Lupa” and “Igorota.” Check out the highlights of Darren’s most prolific work in film and on television below. The film is a heartbreaking tale of an imprisoned woman who goes mad after losing her sons, breathtaking beauty, and the successful future that awaits her. Also joining Darren in the cast were Charito Solis, Fred Galang, Gloria Sevilla, Anita Linda, Verna Gaston, and Elvira Manahan. Not much is known about “Ang Pulubi” due to much of it being lost in the archives. But it was for this film that earned Darren her first FAMAS win and a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Manila Film Festival. Many 90s kids will remember Darren as Belen Macaspac in the 2000 drama “Pangako Sa’yo,” who raised Yna Macaspac (Kristine Hermosa) as her daughter and was even willing to defend her from her abusive adoptive brother Caloy (Jay Manalo). This was evident in the drama’s fifth episode where she stopped an angry Jay from blaming Yna after their house was destroyed by the fire. Holding the pain of a mother, Darren cried, “Caloy, tama na! Tama na! Sige, kung papatayin mo siya, patayin mo na rin ako. Patayin mo na kaming lahat (Caloy, stop it! Stop it! Okay if you’re going to kill her, kill me too. Kill us all)!” Darren also had the chance to star as John Arcilla’s protective onscreen mother Gunda in the 1997 film “Ligaya ang Itawag Mo sa Akin.” The movie centers on Ligaya (Rosanna Roces), a prostitute who enters into a relationship with the farmer Polding (Arcilla), whom she believes is her ticket to a better life. Gunda, however, is against their relationship, having been made aware of the woman’s reputation. One of the highlights of the movie was Darren’s exchange of lines with Roces as the latter’s character desperately tried to get Gunda’s approval. Darren also showcased her skill in “underacting” in the 2000 film “Mila” where she starred as the mother of the titular Mila Cabangon (Maricel Soriano). While Mila is determined to keep going with her teaching job while fighting for proper wages, her resigned mother (Darren) goes against her teaching career, hinting that she has always voiced her dislike for her daughter’s chosen industry.

The screen veteran also starred in several episodes of the anthology series “Maalaala Mo Kaya,” but one of her standout appearances was in the family-centered “Bisikleta.” Darren took on the role of Maria, the mother of Grace (Devon Seron and Assunta De Rossi), who staunchly disapproved of her daughter’s relationship with Robert (Joshua Dionisio and Cris Villanueva). Maria’s clear dislike towards Robert started when Grace was young after he impregnated her. Even though Robert asserted that he could take care of her multiple times, Maria forced her daughter to marry Chris (Ramon Christopher). This led to Claire, Grace’s daughter, discovering that her grandmother had a hand in hiding her true identity. One of Darren’s most well-known film appearances was in the 1968 film “Brides of Blood,” where she portrayed the seductive yet two-faced Alma, the granddaughter of the tribe leader Arcadio (Andres Centanera). The Eddie Romero and Gerardo de Leon-helmed film tells the story of Dr. Paul Henderson (Kent Taylor), Carla Henderson (Beverly Powers), and Jim Farrell (John Ashley) who find themselves in the mysterious Blood Island while in search of a radioactive material that would be crucial in Henderson’s bomb tests. They soon cross paths with Arcadio and Alma, the latter of which acts as an interpreter between the explorers and the tribe. But Alma doesn’t reveal to the explorers that the island hides a sexually frustrated beast who’s hungry for women before mutilating them into pieces. We would love to hear more from you!

        "content": "Celtic are ready to back Brendan Rodgers and sign Adam Idah on a permanent deal. The Irishman has been in superb form for the club since joining on loan from Norwich in January and scored some vital goals in the title run-in before making himself a Celtic hero by scoring a last-gasp winner in the Scottish Cup final against Rangers last weekend. Rodgers has made it clear that he is keen to sign Idah on a permanent deal. His teammates have given the Corkman their backing as well, and the Daily Record is now reporting that the Celtic board is set to sanction a big money move for the Irish international.

That might yet complicate matters if their new gaffer decides to take a look at the Cork-born striker before the new season. But Celtic are working on the assumption they will have Idah back helping to lead their attack as they take on the cream of Europe in the Champions League . That will delight Rodgers , who could not have been any more fulsome in his praise of the frontman after watching him snatch the Hampden headlines. He said after the 1-0 win over Rangers: “The board knows how I feel about Adam, that was the reason for bringing him in. “He’s been a real catalyst for us, especially over the last few months. He’s a big game player. In so many big moments, he’s stepped up to the plate for us. “I’m so happy for him - a boy from Ireland, a striker scoring the winning goal in the Scottish Cup Final against Rangers. Wow. What a summer he’ll have. “I don’t know if we’ll get him in the summer, the board will look at it. My talks with Adam will remain private because there’s a lot of work to do. But he knows my feelings and so does the club so we’ll see what happens.” Get the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts .",

        "content": "WhatsApp , the globally recognized messaging app, is reportedly working on a new facility that will enable users to personalize their chat themes and accent colors. This feature is currently being fine-tuned in the WhatsApp beta for iOS 24.11.10.70 version. It will provide users with the option to customize their chat bubble colors as well as wallpapers, moving away from the company's traditional green theme that has been a constant since its inception. Four additional chat themes coming to WhatsApp According to a report from WABetaInfo , WhatsApp plans to introduce four additional chat theme options in an upcoming update. This new feature was discovered during the TestFlight beta program and is currently under development. Users will be able to choose from five themes - the default green, as well as blue, gray, red, and purple. The selection of a new chat theme will automatically adjust the user's wallpaper and bubble color, to align with the chosen theme's color palette. WhatsApp to enable accent color customization In addition to chat themes, WhatsApp is also developing a facility that will allow iOS users to modify the app's accent color. This customization will impact the look of in-app buttons and will be restricted to the same color choices as the chat themes. Another feature spotted in a recent beta update for Android version 2.24.11.17 is an AI image generator for profile pictures, which creates personalized images based on user-provided text prompts.",

        "content": "Astronomers have made a groundbreaking discovery, finding strong evidence of a vast ocean of liquid water hidden beneath the icy surface of Pluto. The research, published in the scientific journal Icarus , offers new insights into the composition of this distant celestial body. The study was led by Alex Nguyen, a graduate student in Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. Unraveling Pluto's subsurface ocean using NASA's images Nguyen's team employed mathematical models and images from NASA 's New Horizons spacecraft to investigate Pluto's subsurface ocean. The study, co-authored by Patrick McGovern of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, sheds light on a long-standing debate about the existence of liquid water on Pluto. This research marks a significant step forward in understanding the dwarf planet's composition. Pluto's hidden ocean: A closer look Nguyen and McGovern further explored the properties of Pluto's hidden ocean. They created mathematical models to explain the cracks and bulges in the ice covering the Sputnik Platina Basin. This massive basin, formed by a meteor impact billions of years ago, suggests an ocean below. Their models indicate this ocean is shielded by a 40-to-80-kilometer-thick shell of water ice. Estimating the density of Pluto's hidden ocean By analyzing surface fractures, the researchers were able to estimate the ocean's potential density or salinity. According to Nguyen, they determined a zone similar to Goldilocks, where the density and shell thickness find an optimal equilibrium. The findings suggest that Pluto's ocean is about 8% denser than Earth's seawater, comparable to Utah's Great Salt Lake. If humans could somehow reach Pluto's ocean, they would effortlessly float. Facts about Pluto Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was initially hailed as the ninth planet in our solar system. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified it as a dwarf planet. Pluto traverses its orbit around the Sun at an average distance of 5.9 billion kilometers, requiring roughly 248 Earth years to complete a single revolution. Measuring approximately 2,372 kilometers in diameter, it is smaller than Earth's moon.",

        "content": "West Indies and USA will co-host the 2024 edition of the ICC T20 World Cup . The ninth edition of the global tournament will get underway on June 1. 20 teams will feature in the competition. Meanwhile, England will enter as defending champions, having tasted glory in 2022. Here we present the notable records from the 2022 edition, which took place in Australia. Kohli becomes the highest run-getter in T20 WC history Indian ace Virat Kohli displaced Mahela Jayawardene (1,016) as the highest run-scorer in T20 WC history. The former now has 1,141 runs in 27 games at an average of 81.50. Kohli also became the first batter to score 250+ runs in a T20 WC edition thrice (2014, 2016, and 2022). The tournament also saw Kohli become the first player to complete 4,000 T20I runs. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan's stellar partnership record During the New Zealand vs Pakistan semi-final, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan became the first pair to record three century partnerships in T20 WCs. While the duo added 105 runs against the Black Caps, they recorded scores of 152* and 113 against India and Namibia in 2021, respectively. Their tally of 636 runs is also the highest for any pair in the tournament's history. Two hat-tricks in the tournament UAE's Karthik Meiyappan became the first associate-team bowler to scalp a hat-trick in T20 WC, against Sri Lanka. Ireland pacer Joshua Little was the other bowler with a hat-trick in the tournament, against NZ. Little's feat made Ireland the only team to have two bowlers with T20 WC hat-tricks. Curtis Campher took four wickets off as many balls against Netherlands in 2021. Player of the Tournament - Sam Curran England's Sam Curran was named both the Player of the Match in the final and the Player of the Tournament. He recorded 3/12 against Pakistan in the summit clash. Overall, the left-arm pacer finished as the joint-second-highest wicket-taker with 13 wickets in six games. Curran, who conceded runs at 6.41, was the only bowler to claim a five-fer in the tournament, 5/10 vs Afghanistan﻿. Most runs - Virat Kohli Kohli finished the tournament as the highest run-scorer, having scored 296 runs. While his average was just under 100, he struck at 136.41 in the competition. Kohli's tally of four fifties was also the highest in the competition. Netherlands' Max O'Dowd (242), India's Suryakumar Yadav (239), England's Jos Buttler (225), and Sri Lanka 's Kusal Mendis (223) were the others with 220-plus runs. Most wickets - Wanindu Hasaranga Wanindu Hasaranga once again finished the tournament as the highest wicket-taker, having scalped 15 wickets in eight games. While the Sri Lankan leg-spinner conceded runs at a paltry rate of 6.41, his strike rate was 12.4. Curran and Netherlands's Bas de Leede were the joint-second-highest wicket-takers with 13 scalps apiece. Zimbabwe's Blessing Muzarabani is next on the list with 12 scalps. Here are the other notable records Kohli became the first player to score 300 runs against a team in T20 WC, 308 vs Pakistan. Rohit Sharma became the most capped player in T20 WC, having played 39 games. Ireland's Campher became the first all-rounder with a fifty and hat-trick in T20 WCs. Scotaland's Michael Jones recorded the highest score by an Associate player in T20 WCs, 86 versus Ireland. Two centurions in the competition SA's Rilee Rossouw was the first centurion of the competition. He mustered 109 off 56 balls against Bangladesh. The only other century that year came from NZ's Glenn Phillips 's blade. He made 104 off 64 balls against SL. Meanwhile, SA's 205/5 against Bangladesh was the highest team total that year. NZ were the only other side to touch the 200-run mark, 200/3 versus Australia.",

Musk had previously stated on X , \"WhatsApp exports your user data every night. Some people still think it is secure.\" In response, Cathcart emphasized that WhatsApp prioritizes security and does not 'export' users' data. He reiterated, \"We take security seriously and that's why we end-to-end encrypt your messages. They don't get sent to us every night or exported to us.\" Cathcart clarifies WhatsApp's stance on user data backup Cathcart further clarified WhatsApp's policy regarding user data, particularly message backups. He stated that if users wish to backup their messages, they can use their cloud provider and even apply end-to-end encryption for the same. The ongoing public feud between Musk and Meta (WhatsApp's parent company) has been a topic of discussion since Musk took over X in 2022. Musk reignites cage fight challenge amid Meta rivalry The rivalry between Musk and Meta has been escalating, especially after the launch of Meta's Threads app, which directly competes with X. The tension heightened when Musk challenged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight, a proposition that Zuckerberg dismissed as not serious. Recently, however, Musk reignited the cage fight talks on X by stating, \"I'm ready to fight Zuck anywhere, anytime with any rules. LFG!!!\"",

        "content": "The film Hamare Baarah , starring Annu Kapoor , Ashwini Kalsekar, Manoj Joshi , and Parth Samthaan among others, has stirred controversy due to its provocative teasers. The movie's depiction of a specific religion has been met with disapproval from a section of society, allegedly resulting in death threats against the team. In response to these threats, veteran actor Kapoor released a video message urging viewers to watch the film before forming their opinions. Why does this story matter? Initially titled Hum Do Humare Baraah , the film was renamed following a directive from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The drama was first announced in 2022, and since then, it has created an uproar online for its alleged Islamophobia. Makers, including director Kamal Chandra, have claimed that the movie doesn't target any one community but highlights \"the most important and crucial problem of our country,\" population explosion. 'The film advocates women's empowerment...' Kapoor addressed the threats in a video message, emphasizing their seriousness and calling for police protection for the film team. He urged viewers to watch the film before lambasting it, stating, \"The film advocates women's empowerment and talks about the rights of women. First, watch the film and then give your verdict.\" Kapoor clarified that the movie's intention was not to offend any caste or community but to discuss women's empowerment and population boom. Kapoor urges audiences to reserve judgment, engage with story Kapoor revealed people were giving death threats on social media and via calls. \"Please don't abuse, don't give us threats because we are not afraid. I request Maharashtra Police and the Home Ministry to perform their duty and provide protection to every member of the team who's getting death threats. The seasoned actor concluded his message by saying, \"If you try to disrupt the peace, then we will also not sit silently.\" Hamare Baarah will be released on June 7.

        "content": "Fashion and art have long been intertwined, reflecting the cultural zeitgeist and individual creativity. This article explores how to translate iconic art movements into everyday wear, offering a fresh perspective on personal style. By understanding the essence of each movement, you can curate outfits that are not only stylish but also carry a deeper artistic significance. Impressionism in apparel To embody the essence of Impressionism in your wardrobe, choose garments in soft pastels and incorporate lightweight fabrics that feature dappled prints.

Aim to replicate the movement's delicate brushstrokes and nuanced play of light through your clothing selections, embracing the artistry in everyday fashion. Cubist couture To channel Cubism's essence in your wardrobe, select structured garments that feature bold, angular patterns. A jacket with pronounced shoulders or accessories adorned with cube or pyramid motifs can reflect Cubist influences. Additionally, combining different textures in your outfit can mimic the collage techniques prominent in Cubism, offering a modern twist on this art movement's distinctive style. Surrealist statements Surrealism's dream-like quality translates into whimsical accessories and unexpected combinations in fashion. Incorporate Salvador Dali-inspired elements, like melting clocks on a handbag or shoes adorned with optical illusions. This approach adds a surprising element to your outfit, sparking conversations. It's about embracing the surrealists' vision by integrating the extraordinary into everyday wear, making each piece a statement of artistic expression and individuality. Pop art popularity Embrace Pop Art's essence with vibrant colors and bold graphics. Opt for attire featuring comic prints or iconic pop culture imagery, like a Warhol-esque T-shirt. When paired with solid-colored pants, this combination becomes an eye-catching ensemble that pays homage to Pop Art's explosive movement. This approach brings the dynamic visual style of Pop Art into everyday fashion, celebrating this iconic art movement. Minimalist mode For those drawn to Minimalism, focus on monochromatic outfits, clean lines, and simple silhouettes. Quality over quantity is crucial; invest in well-crafted basics that last. This approach reflects the minimalist art movement's emphasis on simplicity and longevity. By choosing pieces that embody these principles, you create a wardrobe that mirrors the timeless elegance of minimalist art.",

        "content": "The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart, Tasmania , is set to publicly debut the \"only\" physical copy of Wu-Tang Clan's album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin . This rare album was secretly recorded between 2006 and 2013 and was previously owned by pharmaceutical entrepreneur Martin Shkreli. It is now on loan from digital art collective Pleasr for Mona's upcoming exhibition Namedropping , which explores status, celebrity, and notoriety. Know more about the group Established in 1992, Wu-Tang Clan stands as a legendary American hip-hop collective. Comprising iconic figures like RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa, alongside the late Ol' Dirty Bastard until 2004, they reshaped the landscape of East Coast hip-hop. Renowned for their influence and innovation, Wu-Tang Clan is hailed as one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time. What makes the album unique? Often referred to as the \"most valuable ever made due to its rarity,\" the album features contributions from all surviving members of the Wu-Tang Clan group and includes two appearances from songstress Cher. It is housed in an ornate silver box and was intended as a statement about the impact of streaming and piracy on the value of music. Producers Cilvaringz and RZA described it as \"400-year-old Renaissance-style approach to music\"—aiming to inspire urgent debates about the future of music. Album cannot be used for commercial purposes until 2103 A single two-CD copy of the album was pressed in 2015, with all digital master files subsequently \"deleted.\" A unique legal agreement stipulates that the album cannot be used for any commercial purpose until 2103 or 88 years after its creation. RZA explained that this number was chosen because there were eight original Wu-Tang Clan members—the numbers of the year 2015 added up to eight, and a rotated eight is the symbol for infinity. Album's journey from Shkreli to Pleasr and Mona Museum In 2015, a 13-minute medley of the album was played at New York's MoMa to about 150 art experts, rap fans, and prospective buyers. Shkreli later attempted to sell the album on eBay where bidding reached $1.2M—but failed to complete a sale. After his conviction for securities fraud in 2018, Shkreli was forced to surrender the album along with other assets totaling $7.4M. In 2021, Pleasr acquired it from the US Department of Justice for $4M to cover Shkreli's debts. Public debut of Wu-Tang Clan's album at Mona Museum Mona will hold free ticketed listening sessions from June 15-24 where attendees can hear a curated 30-minute mix of the album played from a personalized Wu-Tang PlayStation 1 inside Mona's recording studio, Frying Pan. This marks the first time that this unique album has been loaned to a museum since its original sale. \" Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is more than just an album, so... I knew I had to get it into this exhibition,\" said Mona director.",

        "content": "Kaftans, celebrated for their flowing elegance and comfort, have crossed borders to become a global fashion staple. Originating from ancient Mesopotamia, these garments have been embraced by various cultures and continue to evolve in contemporary fashion. This article aims to explore accessorizing kaftans for a chic and personalized look, highlighting their versatility and enduring appeal across different fashion landscapes. The art of accessorizing Accessorizing is crucial for elevating the simple elegance of a kaftan into a statement outfit. The correct selection of accessories can highlight the kaftan's unique features, enhancing its design while adding sophistication. From selecting the right belts to choosing complementary jewelry, each accessory plays an essential role in crafting an ensemble that reflects personal style and elegance. Choose complementary jewelry Jewelry must enhance the kaftan without dominating it. For patterned kaftans, select simple jewelry like delicate chains or stud earrings. Solid-colored kaftans invite bolder choices, such as chunky necklaces or layered bracelets, adding texture and interest. Always consider the kaftan's neckline when selecting neckpieces to ensure the jewelry complements the outfit appropriately, maintaining a balanced and elegant look. Define your waistline Belts can be transformative when paired with kaftans, as they define your waistline and add structure to the garment. Opt for a thin belt in a matching color for a subtle approach. For a bolder statement, choose a wide belt or one adorned with embellishments. It's crucial to balance proportions to maintain an elegant silhouette, ensuring the belt complements rather than overwhelms the kaftan. Footwear matters The choice of footwear significantly influences your outfit's overall vibe. Sandals bring a casual ease, perfect for a laid-back look, while heels can elevate the ensemble, making it suitable for more formal occasions. For those donning longer kaftans, opting for strappy sandals or peep-toe heels is advisable. This choice helps to avoid a cumbersome appearance and maintains an airy, elegant feel throughout. Finishing touches with bags Complete your accessorized kaftan look with the right bag choice. A clutch is perfect for evening affairs, adding elegance, while tote bags fit daytime outings, offering practicality. Consider the texture and color—woven bags introduce rustic charm, and metallic clutches inject glamour. It's vital to ensure your bag complements other accessories for a cohesive and stylish ensemble, maintaining the outfit's overall elegance and personal flair.",

Fortunately, no injuries were reported as everyone present was safely evacuated from the premises. An official from Delhi Fire Services stated that six fire tenders have been pressed into service to douse the flames. 2 days after fire at children's hospital This comes just two days after the fire at a private children's hospital in east Delhi's Vivek Vihar, which led to the death of seven newborns.

        "content": "The Mexican elote bowl is a vibrant, vegetarian dish inspired by traditional elote—grilled corn slathered in mayonnaise, cheese, and spices. This bowl adaptation offers these classic flavors in a hearty, healthy meal for vegetarians. It's an ideal choice for anyone looking to experience the essence of Mexican culture at their dining table. Let's begin cooking this colorful and nutritious meal. Gather the following ingredients For this dish, gather two cups cooked quinoa, four ears fresh corn, one cup rinsed and drained black beans, one sliced large avocado, one cup halved cherry tomatoes, half a cup finely chopped red onion, and a quarter cup chopped fresh cilantro. Dressing requires three tablespoons vegan mayonnaise, two tablespoons lime juice, one teaspoon paprika, and salt to taste. Prepare your ingredients Start by cooking your quinoa according to package instructions; this usually involves rinsing it thoroughly before boiling in water for about 15 minutes until it becomes fluffy. While the quinoa cooks, grill or broil your corn until slightly charred on all sides. Once cool enough to handle, cut the kernels off the cob and set aside. Assemble your elote bowl Begin assembling your elote bowl by placing a base layer of quinoa in individual bowls or a large serving dish. Next, evenly distribute the grilled corn kernels on top of the quinoa. Continue with the black beans, then add slices of avocado and halves of cherry tomatoes on top. Finish by sprinkling finely chopped red onion and fresh cilantro over the entire assembly. Prepare the dressing In a small bowl, whisk vegan mayonnaise and lime juice until smooth. Add paprika, blending for color and flavor, then season with salt to taste. This dressing combines all elements with its creamy, tangy, and spicy profile, perfectly complementing the elote bowl's ingredients. It's designed to bring a harmonious flavor to every bite, making the dish both vibrant and delicious. Final touches Before serving, lavishly drizzle the prepared dressing over each bowl to infuse every bite with flavor. For an extra dimension of taste and texture, adding crumbled vegan cheese or a dash of chili powder as optional garnishes is recommended. These additions not only elevate the dish's flavor but also its visual appeal, ensuring a delightful and comprehensive eating experience with every spoonful.",

        "content": "Milos, a volcanic island in the Cyclades, offers an array of stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters. Unlike its more famous neighbors, Milos retains a laid-back charm and unspoiled landscapes. It's the perfect destination for travelers seeking tranquility and natural beauty. The island's unique geological formations create breathtaking coastal scenery, making it an ideal spot for beach lovers. Sarakiniko Beach: Moon on Earth Sarakiniko Beach is famed for its moon-like landscape, with white volcanic rocks curving around a turquoise bay. This otherworldly scene provides not just a beach day but an experience unlike any other. The smooth, bone-white rocks are perfect for sunbathing or exploring small coves. Early morning or late afternoon visits offer softer light for photography and cooler temperatures for exploring. Kleftiko Caves: Nature's artwork Accessible only by boat, the Kleftiko Caves are a must-visit in Milos. Once a hideout for pirates, these sea caves and rock formations rise majestically from the emerald waters. Swimming or kayaking through the caves reveals hidden beaches and snorkeling spots teeming with marine life. Boat tours often include stories of pirate lore, adding a layer of intrigue to the natural beauty. Firiplaka Beach: A colorful retreat Firiplaka is one of Milos' most picturesque beaches, characterized by its towering cliffs and vibrant turquoise waters contrasted against soft white sands. The beach is partly organized with sunbeds and umbrellas but retains much of its natural charm with unspoiled sections ideal for relaxation. Its shallow waters make it perfect for families or those looking to wade into the Aegean without venturing too deep. Tsigrado Beach: An adventurous escape Tsigrado Beach offers an adventure before you even touch the sand—access involves descending a ladder and rope through a narrow cliff opening. This secluded cove rewards your efforts with crystal-clear waters surrounded by dramatic cliffs. Its remote nature means fewer crowds, providing a peaceful haven for swimming and soaking up the sun in relative solitude, making it a unique escape.",

        "content": "Rome , a city deeply rooted in history, is renowned not only for its ancient ruins and art masterpieces but also as a sanctuary for food enthusiasts. Many travelers, however, arrive with misconceptions regarding what constitutes authentic Roman cuisine. This guide is dedicated to dispelling prevalent culinary myths and directing you toward the true delicacies of Roman culinary tradition. Espresso etiquette in Rome Visitors often think that Italians drink their espresso any time of day. While it's true that coffee is a beloved beverage here, ordering a cappuccino after 11 a.m. might earn you some raised eyebrows. Romans typically enjoy milky coffees in the morning and stick to espresso or caffe normale post-lunch or dinner for its digestive properties. Pizza perceptions The myth that all Italian pizza resembles the thick-crusted American variety couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to Rome. Roman pizza is thin-crust and crispy, almost cracker-like in texture. It's baked quickly at high temperatures, resulting in a light base perfect for simple yet flavorful toppings like tomato, mozzarella, basil (pizza Margherita), or just olive oil and rosemary (pizza bianca). Gelato guidelines Many believe brighter gelato means better flavor. However, in Rome, the reality is different. Authentic gelato prioritizes natural ingredients over artificial colors or flavors. Seek out gelaterias where the gelato has muted colors. This usually means they're made with real fruits and natural ingredients, signaling quality. In Rome, this authenticity in gelato is a true sign of excellence.",

        "content": "Utility wear has evolved beyond gender-specific boundaries, heralding the rise of unisex fashion . This movement signifies a shift toward clothing that emphasizes both function and comfort for everyone, regardless of gender. Through this article, we delve into the emergence of unisex utility wear, highlighting its primary features and offering insights on seamlessly integrating it into your daily routine for improved efficiency. The rise of unisex fashion Unisex clothing has been around for decades, but its mainstream acceptance is recent. This shift, driven by desires for equality and practicality, has led designers to create garments that challenge traditional gender norms. This movement aligns with societal trends toward inclusivity and versatility in fashion, reflecting a significant change in how apparel is viewed and designed. Defining utility wear Utility wear is clothing designed for practicality, featuring multiple pockets, durable fabrics, and adjustable features. It marries form with function, creating garments that serve the wearer's needs without sacrificing style. This fashion is for those who value both efficiency and elegance, proving that clothes can be both functional and fashionable, working as hard as the wearer does. How to style utility pieces Styling unisex utility wear focuses on balance. Combine robust items like cargo pants or a utility vest with simple, basic garments such as plain tees or sweaters. For footwear, choose sneakers or boots that enhance the functional aesthetic. The aim is to achieve effortless efficiency, allowing the utility elements to stand out as the main feature of your outfit. Sustainability meets function Unisex utility wear transcends mere practicality, emerging as a sustainable fashion choice. By prioritizing durable quality over fleeting quantity and versatile design over momentary trends, these garments foster reduced consumption and encourage the cultivation of more deliberate, thoughtful wardrobes. This approach not only benefits your daily efficiency but also significantly contributes to environmental sustainability—a dual victory for personal convenience and global health. Cross-cultural appeal Utility wear's global appeal crosses cultural boundaries with its adaptability and practicality. From Tokyo 's streets to Toronto 's urban landscapes, utility pieces integrate into local styles while maintaining core functionality. This universal appeal shows practical fashion knows no limits, resonating across cultures worldwide. It proves utility wear's versatility and ease of use, making it a truly borderless fashion choice.",

        "content": "Saag paneer is a celebrated vegetarian dish from the Indian subcontinent, known for its creamy texture and rich flavors. It features paneer , fresh cheese, and saag , usually mustard leaves or spinach. This dish is significant in Indian culture, often served during festivals and special occasions. Deeply rooted in tradition, saag paneer is favored for its taste and nutritional benefits. Let's get cooking! Gather the following ingredients To prepare this delightful dish, you will need 250 grams of paneer (cubed), 500 grams of spinach (washed and chopped), two tablespoons of vegetable oil, one large onion (finely chopped), one tablespoon ginger-garlic paste, two green chilies (chopped), one teaspoon cumin seeds, half a teaspoon turmeric powder, one teaspoon coriander powder, half a teaspoon garam masala powder, salt to taste, and one cup water. Preparing the spinach puree Begin by blanching the spinach in boiling water for two minutes to preserve its vibrant green color. Immediately after, transfer it to ice-cold water to stop the cooking process, ensuring nutrients and color are retained. After cooling in cold water for about five minutes, thoroughly drain the spinach. Then, use a blender or food processor to blend it into a smooth puree. Cooking the base gravy Heat oil in a pan over medium flame. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding chopped onions. Saute until golden brown, then mix in ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Cook until the raw smell fades, about three minutes. Finally, stir in turmeric and coriander powder, blending them well into the mixture. Adding spinach puree and paneer Add the spinach puree to the pan with your base gravy and season with salt to taste. Allow this mix to simmer on low heat for 10 minutes, enabling the flavors to blend well. If necessary, incorporate up to one cup of water to adjust the consistency as preferred, ensuring the mixture achieves a smooth and desirable texture. Final touches and serving suggestions Gently add the cubed paneer to the simmering saag mixture, cooking for five minutes. Avoid a vigorous boil to prevent the paneer from hardening. Sprinkle garam masala over the dish before turning off the heat. Carefully mix, ensuring not to break the paneer cubes too much. This step ensures flavors meld without compromising the paneer 's texture.",

        "content": "The 2024 ICC T20 World Cup is set to begin on June 1. Like the recently-concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) season, batters will be looking to cash in during the mega ICC tournament. However, slow and dry pitches in the Caribbean might give them a run for the money. Here are the batters with most fifty-plus scores in a T20 WC edition. Virat Kohli: 14 Virat Kohli holds the record for scoring the most runs in T20 World Cup history. He owns 1,141 runs from 27 games at an incredible average of 81.50. Notably, Kohli remains the only player with more than 10 fifty-plus scores in the tournament. He has recorded 14 such scores as of now. Notably, three of those half-centuries have come in the semi-finals. Chris Gayle: 9 West Indies veteran batter Chris Gayle has nine 50+ scores in the T20 World Cup. Universe Boss Gayle is the only player to have scored multiplte centuries in the tournament (2). His tally also includes seven fifties. Gayle has slammed 965 runs from 33 T20 World Cup games at 34.46. He has a strike-rate of 142.75 in the tournament. Rohit Sharma: 9 Like Gayle, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma owns nine fifty-plus scores in the T20 World Cup. However, he is yet to score a century in this regard. Rohit has scored 963 runs from 39 T20 WC encounters at an average of 34.39. However, his strike-rate of 127.88 is on the lower side. His highest score of 79* came against Australia at Bridgetown in 2010. Mahela Jayawardene: 7 Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene remains the only other batter with more than six fifty-plus scores in the T20 World Cup. He owns seven such scores. The former batter guided Sri Lanka to 21 wins, also tallying a ton. Notably, Jayawardene also starred in Sri Lanka's title-winning run in 2014. Overall, he owns 1,016 runs at 39.07 in the T20 World Cup.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday criticized the opposition's handling of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir . In an interview with news agency ANI , PM Modi claimed that the article was not an issue for the people of Jammu and Kashmir or India, but was manipulated for the benefit of a select few. \"Article 370 was the agenda of only 4-5 families,\" Modi stated, taking a veiled jibe at the opposition. Modi highlights unity post Article 370 abrogation Modi further stated that the removal of Article 370 has fostered a greater sense of unity and belonging among the people of Kashmir. Article 370...was neither the agenda of the people of Kashmir nor the agenda of the people of the country...Today it has become true that after the removal of 370, there is a feeling of more unity. The feeling of belongingness is increasing among the people of Kashmir...its direct result is also visible in elections, tourism,\" he said. Record voter turnouts post Article 370 abrogation According to reports, following the abrogation of Article 370 by Modi's government in August 2019, record voter turnouts were observed in several parliamentary constituencies during the Lok Sabha polls held earlier this month. Srinagar , Baramulla , and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded polling percentages of 38.49%, 59.1%, and 51.35% respectively—the highest rates since 1989. \"When the common man votes there, it is not just to make someone win, voting means that the voter accepts the Constitution of India,\" he said. Modi's statement on voter turnout in Kashmir \"As a result, voting records of 40 years have been broken. It is a matter of greatest satisfaction for me that my brothers and sisters from Kashmir came forward to vote with great enthusiasm,\" PM Modi said. \"By voting, they have given a message to the world and to those who used to have doubts,\" he further said. 'Decision of government always for good cause' The PM added that the decisions of his government were always for a good cause. I would like to pray to the justice system of our country that if...government wants to do any work, they have a...strategy to do that work...Sometimes I had to shut down the internet...Some NGO went to court and it became a big issue in the court...but today the children there proudly say...we have been getting all the facilities for the last 5 years,\" he said.",

        "content": "Edinburgh , the picturesque capital of Scotland , is steeped in history and charm. It's also famously known as the birthplace of the Harry Potter series, where J.K. Rowling penned much of her early work. For fans of the series or those curious about its origins, a tour around Edinburgh's historic Harry Potter landmarks offers a unique and enchanting experience. The birthplace of Harry Potter The Elephant House Cafe claims fame as the spot where J.K. Rowling spent many hours writing over cups of coffee. With views overlooking Edinburgh Castle, it's easy to see where she might have found some of her inspiration for Hogwarts. Visitors can enjoy a warm beverage and soak in the atmosphere that helped birth one of the most beloved book series in history. A real-life Diagon Alley Just a short walk from the cafe is Victoria Street, widely believed to be the inspiration for Diagon Alley. This colorful and winding street is lined with independent shops that could easily belong in the wizarding world. From boutiques selling quirky items to specialty food stores, it's a must-visit for anyone wanting to step into a real-life magical shopping street. Where Tom Riddle rests Greyfairs Kirkyard is not just any cemetery; it serves as the resting place for Thomas Riddell's grave. Fans widely speculate that this inspired the name of Rowling's character, Tom Riddle. A walk through this historic graveyard does more than connect visitors with Edinburgh's ancient past; it also provides a tangible link to one of Harry Potter's most notorious characters, enriching the experience. Hogwarts' inspiration George Heriot's School, with its four distinctive towers and central courtyard, strikingly resembles Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is not open for public tours on a daily basis as it remains an operational school. However, the exterior view still captivates fans and onlookers from a distance, igniting imaginations about the mysteries that lie within its walls, much like the fictional Hogwarts.",

        "content": "Under Rohit Sharma 's leadership, India will fight for their second title in the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup . The Men in Blue have been placed in Group A alongside arch-rivals Pakistan, hosts USA, Ireland, and Canada. Notably, India have been away from the glory since lifting the trophy in the inaugural edition in 2007. Here we decode India's worst T20 WC campaigns. Super 8 ouster in 2009 Defending champions India endured a forgettable campaign in the 2009 edition in England. They comfortably advanced to the Super 8 stage after defeating Ireland and Bangladesh in the league round. However, MS Dhoni's were eliminated after losing all their three Super 8 matches, against South Africa, West Indies, and England. The team would have been gutted as all three games were pretty close. Another terrible show in 2010 India's campaign in the 2010 competition was no better. They again won both their league matches, against South Africa and Afghanistan. The SA game saw Suresh Raina score a stunning hundred. However, Dhoni's men yet again lost all their three Super 8 fixtures. While they couldn't compete much against Australia and hosts West Indies, Sri Lanka beat them in a last-ball thriller. Missed semi-final berth in 2012 India's 2012 T20 WC campaign was an interesting one. The Men in Blue thrashed England and Afghanistan in the league round. They even defeated Pakistan and SA in the Super 8 stage. However, India's only defeat in the competition cost them. Australia severely dented their NRR by chasing down 141 against them in 14.5 overs. India hence missed the semi-final berth. Forgettable campaign in 2021 Virat Kohli 's only T20 WC campaign as a captain was a forgettable one. India's tournament opener saw Pakistan beat them for the first time in a WC match. They further lost their next fixture against New Zealand. The two successive defeats virtually knocked India out as they missed out on a semi-final berth despite beating Afghanistan, Namibia, and Scotland in their remaining league games.",

        "content": "A three-year collaborative research project between US scientists and the University of Cape Town in South Africa has revealed that the rate of plastic degradation is color-dependent. The study, spearheaded by the University of Leicester , discovered that red, blue, and green plastics become \"very brittle and fragmented\" over time. Conversely, black, white, and silver plastics were found to remain \"largely unaffected.\" Retailers are advised against using brightly colored plastics In light of these findings, retailers are now being encouraged to avoid using brightly colored plastics for everyday items such as drinks bottles, outdoor furniture, and toys. This advice stems from the research conclusion that colored plastics break down into microplastics faster than their less vibrant counterparts. Microplastics have been found in various environments, including human testicles, where they have been potentially linked to declining sperm counts. Research methodology and findings across continents The study involved US researchers placing bottle lids of various colors on a university rooftop for three years to expose them to sun and weather. Simultaneously, scientists in South Africa examined plastic items found on a remote beach. Both studies revealed significant differences in microplastic formation based on the color of the plastic. Dr. Sarah Key, who led the project, found it amazing that samples from a Leicester rooftop and a windy beach in Africa showed similar results. Brightly colored plastics: A concern for short-lived products Key added that even in a relatively cool and cloudy environment for only three years, significant differences can be seen in microplastic formation. This pioneering field study suggests that retailers and manufacturers should reconsider using brightly colored plastics, particularly for short-lived products. The results have been published in the journal Environmental Pollution . Co-author of the study, Professor Sarah Gabbott, shared her curiosity about why microplastics in beach sand frequently exhibit a rainbow of colors. Colored plastics: A barrier to recycling Initially, Gabbott believed she was noticing more colorful microplastics due to their visibility, but she later discovered that brightly colored microplastics are genuinely more common. This is due to red, green, and blue pigmented plastic items being more susceptible to fragmentation into millions of tiny yet colorful microplastic particles. Adam Herriott from Wrap, an anti-waste charity organization explained that colored plastics have traditionally been used to make products stand out. However, Wrap now advises manufacturers to avoid using pigments. Why do colored plastics degrade more quickly? The study unveiled that black, white, and silver pigments provide protection to plastics against detrimental ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV exposure induces structural alterations in plastics, resulting in brittleness and susceptibility to fragmentation. However, these particular pigments serve as effective shields, safeguarding the plastic polymers from UV-induced damage. Consequently, they maintain the structural integrity of plastics, mitigating the adverse effects of UV exposure on their composition and durability.",

        "content": "Liverpool has already made the change. Chelsea is closing in on its new guy. Manchester United has yet to decide whether to stick or twist. There is unprecedented managerial upheaval in the English Premier League at the moment, with five of the top 11 teams potentially having new coaches at the start of next season and another of them having changed managers only a few months ago. Liverpool and West Ham have acted quickly, replacing Jurgen Klopp and David Moyes with Arne Slot and Julen Lopetegui , respectively. Chelsea is reportedly in negotiations with Enzo Maresca, who has just led Leicester back into the Premier League, about replacing Mauricio Pochettino after he left his position last week. Brighton is looking for a new manager to take over from Roberto De Zerbi , while Man United is conducting a review to assess whether or not to keep Erik ten Hag, who won the FA Cup last weekend but oversaw the team’s worst league season in 34 years. As for Crystal Palace, manager Oliver Glasner has been in place for only three months after coming in for Roy Hodgson . Here’s a closer look at some of the changes that could be happening over the next few days and weeks: GUARDIOLA DISCIPLES Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is set to be facing off against another of his former assistants. Maresca was the No. 2 to Guardiola at City for the 2022-23 season, only to choose to make his own way in coaching and — while playing a distinctly Guardiola style of play — guide Leicester back to the Premier League in his first year in charge. Now Maresca appears to be on his way to Chelsea, which reportedly made an official approach on Monday to talk to Maresca. Neither Chelsea nor Leicester has officially commented on the move but sections of the British media are reporting that a deal could be reached this week. Chelsea owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali will hope Maresca fits into the team’s leadership structure better than Pochettino, whose relationship with the hierarchy appeared to break down by the end of his one and only season in charge of a club that has spent more than $1 billion on new players in the new regime. Guardiola is already pitting his wits against Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager who was at City under Guardiola from 2016-19. UNITED’S BIG DECISION Ten Hag hasn’t waited for United to make a decision. He has already gone on vacation, content with winning a trophy for the second straight season in his time at Old Trafford — even if, for many, that doesn’t make up for a woeful Premier League campaign that saw the team finish in eighth place. Still, finishing the season strongly — United also won its last two league games — has given Jim Ratcliffe, the club’s new co-owner and in charge of football operations, some thinking to do. Especially with the FA Cup victory coming over Manchester City, of all clubs, and perhaps swaying fans’ opinions of Ten Hag. United has been linked with De Zerbi, former Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel as well as Kieran McKenna, a former United assistant coach who has just led Ipswich to the Premier League after back-to-back promotions. McKenna has also been linked to the Brighton vacancy, with De Zerbi having already left Amex Stadium after two years in charge. PLAYER TRADING Managerial moves may yet be more interesting than those involving players during this offseason. English clubs are having to be more careful than ever in the transfer market, given the Premier League is clamping down harder on its financial rules that limit teams to a loss of no more than 105 million pounds ($133 million) over a three-year period. Everton and Nottingham Forest have already fallen foul of those regulations and received points deductions last season, while the likes of Aston Villa, Newcastle and Man United might be needing to tread carefully over the next year. In January, Premier League teams spent less than 100 million pounds ($127 million) combined on new signings — the lowest total outlay in three years in that winter window — most probably because of the financial rules hurting their spending power. ACROSS EUROPE It’s not only in England where big managerial jobs are up for grabs. Bayern Munich is looking for a new coach — and has reportedly set its sights on Vincent Kompany, the Man City playing great who recently led Burnley into the Premier League only to get relegated after one season. In Spain, Barcelona has just fired Xavi Hernandez to leave a vacancy open. In Italy, AC Milan and Juventus are without coaches. AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "content": "The Indian government is planning a significant skill upgrade for its professional workforce. This initiative aims to meet the anticipated demand for jobs in developed economies over the next five years. The official projections suggest that 3.58 million job vacancies will be available in 16 countries, including the US, Saudi Arabia , UAE, Canada , and others. These estimates are based on a study done by the National Skill Development Corporation International (NSDCI), under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). Strategy to boost international mobility for Indian workers The NSDCI study, titled 'International Workforce Mobility,' is designed to develop a strategy that enhances international mobility for Indian employees in the target countries. It is estimated that 68% of India's total population is between 15-64 years of age. This large working-age population presents India with a chance to create a high-quality skilled workforce for the world. Professionals are encouraged to register on the MSDE portal, where they will be scrutinized and provided with essential skill upgrade training by NSDC. Government coordination for deployment of skilled professionals Following the skill upgrade, the Indian government will coordinate with various partner countries to facilitate the deployment of the candidates. The skill upgrading process is tailored to refine professionals' skills to meet certain standards and practices of respective countries. For instance, a path lab attendant or an electrician, would need to know about the latest requirements of their prospective country. This strategic approach will ensure that Indian professionals are well-equipped and ready for their roles in foreign job markets. Experts' views on projected job opportunities Despite the government's projections, some experts have expressed reservations. The Vice-Chancellor of Dr B.R. Ambedkar School of Economics University in Bengaluru , N.R. Bhanumurthy, stated, \"These numbers are slightly lower than our expectations.\" He added that Indians are highly sought after in many countries where skilled labor is required, and that demand for the Indian workforce has grown significantly. Projected job openings in various sectors and countries The NSDCI study indicates demand for workforce in healthcare, manufacturing, and IT sectors across Europe , Asia, and Australia . In Gulf nations, job openings are projected in construction, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing. The highest vacancies are projected at one million each in UAE, Saudi Arabia, followed by 390,000 in the US and 320,000 each in Canada and Qatar. Australia should have 54,000 job openings, while Germany is anticipated to have 37,000 openings for Indian workers over next five years.",

        "content": "Lima , the capital of Peru , is a vibrant city that boasts a rich history and a dynamic culinary scene. Known as the gastronomic capital of South America , Lima offers an array of dishes that reflect its diverse culture and heritage. From street food to fine dining, the city's food landscape is as varied as it is delicious. Ceviche: Peru's national dish Ceviche is arguably the most iconic dish in Peru. This refreshing dish consists of fresh ingredients marinated in citrus juices, typically lime, and spiced with chili peppers. It's often accompanied by sides of sweet potato and corn. The acidity from the lime juice \"cooks\" the ingredients without heat, resulting in a light and flavorful dish that perfectly captures the essence of Peruvian cuisine. Lomo saltado: A fusion favorite Lomo Saltado represents the fusion of Peruvian and Chinese culinary traditions. This stir-fry combines marinated strips of soy sauce-seasoned tofu (a vegetarian twist on the traditional beef), onions, tomatoes and peppers served with rice and crispy potatoes. The result is a savory dish that showcases Peru's ability to blend different culinary influences into something uniquely its own. Quinoa salad: Andean superfood Quinoa has been cultivated in the Andes for thousands of years and has gained international recognition for its health benefits. In Lima, you'll find quinoa salad made with this nutritious grain mixed with fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, avocados seasoned with lime juice and herbs. It's not only healthy but also incredibly tasty—a testament to Lima's ability to make even simple ingredients shine. Picarones: Sweet finish Picarones are Peru's answer to doughnuts but made from sweet potato flour mixed with squash flour, which gives them their unique taste. These rings are deep-fried until golden brown then drizzled with chancaca syrup—a sweet concoction made from unrefined sugar cane juice spiced with cinnamon and cloves. Enjoying picarones under Lima's sky makes for an unforgettable dessert experience.",

        "content": "India 's IT sector has been hit by a wave of 'silent' layoffs between 2023 and 2024. The All India IT & ITeS Employees's Union (AIITEU) reports that approximately 20,000 tech professionals lost their jobs in this period. The AIITEU suggests the actual number could be higher but remains unreported. These layoffs have occurred across IT services firms of all sizes. Silent layoff practices and their impact in 2024 Silent layoffs are a common practice among firms, discreetly letting go of employees. The most prevalent method involves giving a worker 30 days to secure a new role within the same firm. If unsuccessful, the employee is asked to leave. In 2024 alone, between 2,000-3,000 employees lost their jobs at top Indian IT services companies, according to Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). Major companies implementing silent layoffs US-based Teradata, a cloud analytics and data platform company, axed around 35-40 employees from its Hyderabad campus at the end of 2023. This followed a global layoff of approximately 1,100 employees in 2022. Boston-based financial services firm State Street took over Atos Syntel's operations here last year, and reportedly let go of around 400-500 employees in March 2024, as part of streamlining operations. Layoffs continue across major IT firms Reports indicate that similar layoffs are occurring across Accenture , Infosys , and Cognizant. In 2024, Infosys reportedly asked nearly 200-500 employees to voluntarily resign. However, both Infosys and Atos Group have denied these allegations of layoffs. Industry experts have labeled this period as one of the highest layoff years post the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Expert insight on the current layoff scenario Yugal Joshi, leader of technology services research at Everest Group, attributes challenging macroeconomic scenarios as a contributing factor to the layoffs . He stated, \"All of them promised to maintain or increase operating margin and for a service company beyond people reduction there are not many credible levers.\" Joshi expressed concern about service providers trimming their smaller-sized clients, as lost clients are rarely regained.",

        "content": "Holland & Barrett, a leading health food chain in the United Kingdom , has come under fire for its new product—a dark chocolate bar that claims to alleviate menopause symptoms. The 75g bar, retailing at £3.79, is marketed as a soothing aid contributing to \"the regulation of hormonal activity.\" It contains vitamin B6, typically found in almonds. However, this product has been met with strong disapproval from menopause campaigner Kate Muir who called it a \"ridiculous money-making product.\" Accusations of exploitation, insensitivity Muir accused Holland & Barrett of exploiting vulnerable women, emphasizing the need for proper medical help from the NHS. She highlighted the alarming increase in suicide rates among perimenopausal women. This sentiment was mirrored on social media , where users dismissed the product as \"insulting\" and \"patronizing profiteering tosh.\" The controversy escalated when it was revealed that these chocolate bars contain a woman's entire daily allowance of saturated fat. Holland & Barrett defends their product In response to the backlash, a spokesperson for Holland & Barrett defended the product—stating that their food range aims to offer functional alternatives to popular snacks. The company emphasized that the chocolate bar and its contents contribute to a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. They described it as a small indulgence with added benefits compared to other bars. They assured customers of guidance from trained advisors in their stores on how vitamins or herbal supplements may aid with menopause symptoms.",

        "description": "There is unprecedented managerial upheaval in the English Premier League. Five of the top 11 teams potentially will have new coaches at the start of next season and another of them changed managers just three months ago.",
        "content": "Liverpool has already made the change. Chelsea is closing in on its new guy. Manchester United has yet to decide whether to stick or twist. There is unprecedented managerial upheaval in the English Premier League at the moment, with five of the top 11 teams potentially having new coaches at the start of next season and another of them having changed managers only a few months ago. Liverpool and West Ham have acted quickly, replacing Jurgen Klopp and David Moyes with Arne Slot and Julen Lopetegui , respectively. Chelsea is reportedly in negotiations with Enzo Maresca, who has just led Leicester back into the Premier League, about replacing Mauricio Pochettino after he left his position last week. Brighton is looking for a new manager to take over from Roberto De Zerbi , while Man United is conducting a review to assess whether or not to keep Erik ten Hag, who won the FA Cup last weekend but oversaw the team’s worst league season in 34 years. As for Crystal Palace, manager Oliver Glasner has been in place for only three months after coming in for Roy Hodgson . Here’s a closer look at some of the changes that could be happening over the next few days and weeks: GUARDIOLA DISCIPLES Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is set to be facing off against another of his former assistants. Maresca was the No. 2 to Guardiola at City for the 2022-23 season, only to choose to make his own way in coaching and — while playing a distinctly Guardiola style of play — guide Leicester back to the Premier League in his first year in charge. Now Maresca appears to be on his way to Chelsea, which reportedly made an official approach on Monday to talk to Maresca. Neither Chelsea nor Leicester has officially commented on the move but sections of the British media are reporting that a deal could be reached this week. Chelsea owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali will hope Maresca fits into the team’s leadership structure better than Pochettino, whose relationship with the hierarchy appeared to break down by the end of his one and only season in charge of a club that has spent more than $1 billion on new players in the new regime. Guardiola is already pitting his wits against Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager who was at City under Guardiola from 2016-19. UNITED’S BIG DECISION Ten Hag hasn’t waited for United to make a decision. He has already gone on vacation, content with winning a trophy for the second straight season in his time at Old Trafford — even if, for many, that doesn’t make up for a woeful Premier League campaign that saw the team finish in eighth place. Still, finishing the season strongly — United also won its last two league games — has given Jim Ratcliffe, the club’s new co-owner and in charge of football operations, some thinking to do. Especially with the FA Cup victory coming over Manchester City, of all clubs, and perhaps swaying fans’ opinions of Ten Hag. United has been linked with De Zerbi, former Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel as well as Kieran McKenna, a former United assistant coach who has just led Ipswich to the Premier League after back-to-back promotions. McKenna has also been linked to the Brighton vacancy, with De Zerbi having already left Amex Stadium after two years in charge. PLAYER TRADING Managerial moves may yet be more interesting than those involving players during this offseason. English clubs are having to be more careful than ever in the transfer market, given the Premier League is clamping down harder on its financial rules that limit teams to a loss of no more than 105 million pounds ($133 million) over a three-year period. Everton and Nottingham Forest have already fallen foul of those regulations and received points deductions last season, while the likes of Aston Villa, Newcastle and Man United might be needing to tread carefully over the next year. In January, Premier League teams spent less than 100 million pounds ($127 million) combined on new signings — the lowest total outlay in three years in that winter window — most probably because of the financial rules hurting their spending power. ACROSS EUROPE It’s not only in England where big managerial jobs are up for grabs. Bayern Munich is looking for a new coach — and has reportedly set its sights on Vincent Kompany, the Man City playing great who recently led Burnley into the Premier League only to get relegated after one season. In Spain, Barcelona has just fired Xavi Hernandez to leave a vacancy open. In Italy, AC Milan and Juventus are without coaches. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Mike Tyson 'doing great' after falling ill during weekend flight from Miami to Los Angeles LOS ANGELES (AP) — Mike Tyson is recovering after falling ill during a weekend flight from Miami to Los Angeles. His representatives say in a statement Monday that the 58-year-old boxing legend “became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing” on Sunday. The statement says Tyson is doing great. American Airlines says flight 1815 was met by first responders upon landing at LA International Airport “due to the medical needs of a customer.\" Tyson is preparing to fight the 27-year-old social media star-turned-boxer Jake Paul this summer at the 80,000-seat home of the Dallas Cowboys. 3 players quit Argentina women's team in dispute over pay and conditions BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Three players have quit Argentina's women's soccer squad in a dispute over not being paid and conditions in camp ahead of two friendlies. Goalkeeper Laurina Oliveiros, defender Julieta Cruz and midfielder Lorena Benítez are regular starters and announced their move on Monday. They say the Argentine Football Association told them they won't be paid for the friendlies against Csota Rica on Friday and Monday because the games are at home in Buenos Aires. They add their family members are being charged to go to the game. They also consider a lunch of a ham and cheese sandwich and a banana inadequate for high-performance athletes. Nobody hurt after plane's engine catches fire at Chicago O'Hare airport CHICAGO (AP) — The Federal Aviation Administration says a commercial airliner’s engine caught fire at Chicago O’Hare International Airport. The FAA says United flight 2091 to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport aborted takeoff after flames were reported around 2 p.m. Monday while the aircraft was still on the taxiway. The airline said the plane, an Airbus A320, was towed to the gate. There were no injuries. All 148 passengers were put on a different plane to make the trip, and delays were minimal, United says. Popular California beach closed for the holiday after shark bumped surfer off his board SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) — Authorities have closed a 2-mile stretch of a popular Southern California beach for the Memorial Day holiday after a shark bumped a surfer off his board the night before. Authorities announced the 24-hour closure at San Clemente after the surfer came out of the water and reported the shark’s aggressive behavior to lifeguards around 8 p.m. Sunday. San Clemente Marine Safety Lt. Sean Staubenbaur says the surfer, who wasn’t hurt, was bumped after seeing a large, dark object swimming toward him. The sand remained open to the public, but beachgoers were warned to stay out of the water until 8 p.m. Monday. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. The dreams of a 60-year-old beauty contestant come to an abrupt end in Argentina BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — A 60-year-old Argentine woman has watched her dreams to become the oldest Miss Universe contestant in history melt away in a haze of sequins and selfies at Argentina’s annual beauty pageant. Alejandra Marisa Rodríguez's bid had been cheered as a triumph over ageism in a youth-obsessed world but she failed to win the Miss Argentina crown Saturday. She did win the title of “best face,” one of several pageant categories including best evening gown, best swimsuit and most elegant. The Miss Universe pageant's decision to open the competition to all ages was just the latest for an event that long has been a lightning rod for feminist criticism.",

        "content": "South Africa’s informal economy is estimated to be worth around R750 billion, hidden from many economic indicators and even the taxman. Informal economy expert GG Alcock told delegates at the recent Biznews Conference in London that South Africa’s economy is much healthier than indicators suggest. He highlighted a widely held misconception that South Africa suffers from pervasive poverty and inequality. This view is reinforced with photos of large townships with shacks. The reality is that there has been a housing transformation in townships across South Africa, with impressive formal houses being built. He added that there are more houses worth over R1.5 million in former rural homelands than in Cape Town and surrounding areas. Alcock’s views are backed up by data from property educator Khali Masooane, who said the Soweto market has doubled in price in the past decade. A four-room house in Soweto was valued at around R150,000 ten years ago. Today, a similar house would be valued at R400,000 to R500,000. She said this growth is not confined to Soweto but is a phenomenon that can be observed in townships across the country. South African townships have booming construction, back-room rentals, and spaza shop rentals sectors. A prominent trend is that people move from their communal households into their own homes, creating a large sector of backroom rentals. The backroom rental economy in South African townships is worth an estimated R20 billion to R40 billion annually. The township housing market has not been the only one to experience strong growth. Numerous vibrant business sectors exist in the informal economy. Spaza shops, taverns, fast food outlets, salons, and auto repairs are among the rapidly growing business sectors. Alcock said there are around 50,000 out-of-home fast food outlets in townships, which generate around R90 billion in revenue. There is a misconception that people support these outlets because they are cheaper than well-known fast-food brands like KFC, Nando’s, or Steers. “People don’t buy this food because it is cheaper. It is generally more expensive, but people prefer that food,” he said. The spazarette market, which offers clients products through an informal superette, is another booming sector. A recent Nielsen survey estimated that the spazarette sector achieved an annual spend of R189 billion across 100,000 outlets. “The growth in the informal spaza sector has been around 24% per year compared to 15% in the formal sector,” he said. These spaza shop owners, often foreigners, pay around R25 billion in rent to South Africans who own the properties they operate from. Alcock said South Africa’s informal economy is worth R750 billion annually and is one of the country’s fastest-growing sectors. He dismissed the narrative that South Africa needs to start more businesses and create more entrepreneurs. “The businesses and entrepreneurs exist already. We have hundreds of thousands of them but don’t recognise them,” he said. “We do not need to start new businesses. We need to help them scale up. We need to give them the resources and support they need.” He urged formal businesses to partner with the informal sector to help them grow and benefit the South African economy. One of the reasons why the sector does not receive much recognition is that it is seldom counted in official economic indicators, and there is not much tax collected. The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has virtually no presence in the informal economy. Investec said informal businesses and entrepreneurs typically do not contribute directly to the fiscus through taxes. Many informal businesses pay value-added tax (VAT) on purchases, but that is where the taxman’s reach stops. UCT researcher Luvuyo Mncanca added that businesses operating in the informal economy do not want to be regulated or registered for tax. Despite not paying much tax, it remains a valuable economic sector that creates jobs and provides food for millions of South Africans. Alcock provided an overview of the size of different parts of the informal economy to illustrate its importance. He said these businesses should be celebrated and supported to further drive growth in the township and rural economies.",

        "description": "Only ten of Italy's Euro 2020 squad have made the cut this time around as Luciano Spalletti looks to retain their title.",
        "content": "For , it seems as if have gone for a different approach: out with the old and in with the new. Since their European Championships triumph in 2021, when they beat England in the final on penalties, Roberto Mancini has been swapped out for Luciano Spalletti and widespread changes have been made to the bulk of the squad as a result. In an attempt to retain their title as European champions, the former Napoli chief has made some big calls. Europa League winner Gianluca Scamacca is likely to lead the line, will be tasked with commanding the back line and Nicolo Barella will man the midfield unit – but who misses out? Focused around the ‘art of defending’ and playing with undying passion, can Spalletti guide Italy to an international triumph after they failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup? If so, he’ll have to do it without the following ten stars – all of whom have been snubbed from his 30-man provisional squad. , who was one of his nation’s pivotal figures three years ago, kicks off the star-studded bunch of names who have missed out. Having scored 17 goals in his 57-game Italy career, the Lazio skipper has proven himself to be a sharpshooter, though his inconsistency has seemingly become an issue for Spalletti and his entourage. In the 2023/24 Serie A campaign, the centre forward scored just seven goals – and notched the solitary assist – in 31 appearances, with him often finding minutes harder to come by. In his last two outings for Italy, he has managed to score twice, though he hasn’t featured in their last seven games. Ciro Immobile - Italy Statistics Debut March 5, 2014 Appearances 57 Wins 30 Goals 17 Assists 8 Issued his debut by Mancini back in September 2020, Manuel Locatelli was a regular under his tenure and notably scored a brace against Switzerland in the last tournament’s group stage fixtures. Able to offer engine room versatility, too, it may come as a massive shock that Spalletti and co have snubbed the former talent. The 26-year-old earned himself a move to Serie A juggernauts Juventus on the back of his Euro 2020 campaign but has not managed to paint himself in the best light, it seems, three years on. For the Turin-based outfit in 2023/24, Locatelli has been pervasive from start to finish, playing north of 3,000 league minutes – but he won’t be adding to his tally of 28 international caps in Germany this summer. Manuel Locatelli - Italy Statistics Debut September 7, 2020 Appearances 28 Wins 20 Goals 3 Assists 2 Only 10 players who helped Italy win Euro 2020 have been included in Luciano Spalletti's 30-man provisional squad. Since Spalletti took charge of in August 2023, has not had a sniff at action. The veteran midfielder left Paris Saint-Germain for pastures new in the summer, leaving for Qatari side Al-Arabi SC – meaning that he is no longer in view for the new boss. A cool and collected figure for the French side, he has remained the same at his new employers – but it’s not enough to see him earn a spot on the plane this summer. Pescara-born Verratti has plenty of experience on the international stage, featuring 55 times since making his debut over a decade ago. Underrated in some respects, what the 31-year-old may lack in goal involvements, he certainly makes up for in his calmness on the ball. Marco Verratti - Italy Statistics Debut August 15, 2012 Appearances 55 Wins 31 Goals 3 Assists 4 Currently on loan at Aston Villa from Galatasaray, has endured a campaign to forget with him widely considered as one of . He weighed in with just two goals in 830 minutes of league action, highlighting Unai Emery’s reluctance to give him regular game time. That combined with Italy’s plethora of options means that Zaniolo has not been picked. A 19-cap Italy international, the 1999-born ace has not shown his worth in the England top flight, hence his exclusion, courtesy of Spalletti. Interestingly, the Fiorentina academy graduate has been a regular for Italy in recent times, playing for them as recently as March, totting up 76 minutes against Ecuador in a friendly. There’s always next time, Nicolo. March 29, 2019 19 12 2 1 Leaving someone of ’s calibre and expertise at home is a bold move. Ever since making his Italy debut in September 2012, the Napoli-born winger has been ever-present for his nation, appearing on 54 occasions and recording ten goals and assists apiece. But despite all of that, Spalletti has excluded one of from the provisional squad. Domestically this season, Insigne has endured his fair share of troubles. Having notched three goals and a further three assists in 520 minutes, the fact that the winger has just two full 90-minute cameos under his belt could have played its part in Spalletti’s thinking. The decision could backfire, what with the lack of experience in the squad. Lorenzo Insigne - Italy Statistics Debut September 11, 2012 Appearances 54 Wins 29 Goals 10 Assists 10 The aforementioned quintet aside, Spalletti’s new ideas have meant that many top-level players have been forced to watch this summer’s tournament from the comfort of their own home. Stephan El Shaarawy is one of them and so is Juventus’ , who has scored four times in 15 Italy appearances. Destiny Udogie, who has cemented himself as one of , will miss Euro 2024 through injury, while Napoli’s Matteo Politano and Domenico Berardi of Sassuolo – whom both are right-wingers – will miss out thanks to the emergence of youth in their position.

        "content": "It is somehow fitting that the International Criminal Court prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants against leaders of both Hamas and Israel in connection with mass slaughters carried out since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and Israel’s response. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. All parties unsurprisingly expressed outrage that they would be deemed equally complicit in an endless war that in its latest iteration has resulted in the deaths of more than 30,000 noncombatants. Linking Israeli and Palestinian leaders in this fashion is a tragic and thoroughly depressing reminder that there once were more hopeful times. In 1994, their predecessors — Israeli leaders Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat — were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for moving from avowed eternal enmity and armed force to attempted reconciliation. “We who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you today, in a loud and clear voice, enough of blood and tears,” Rabin said to Arafat in a 1993 White House ceremony. “Enough!” The Oslo Accords intended to pave the way to Palestinian statehood were never fully embraced. Arafat was discredited by Islamic activists for making peace, and his successors lost control of Gaza to Hamas. Rabin was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli claiming to be acting on orders from God, and his successors encouraged continued Jewish settlement on Palestinian lands in the West Bank. Before Oslo, there were the Camp David Accords, which resulted in mutual recognition of Egypt and Israel, return of the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt and a commitment to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The notion of “land for peace” became current. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat were awarded the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. Sadat was assassinated in 1981. Begin, Peres and Rabin, Arafat and Sadat — they were spokesmen for bitter enemies who attempted to destroy the other, much as Netanyahu and Gallant promise to destroy Hamas and Sinwar, Deif and Haniyeh vow to destroy Israel. They all succeeded at killing tens of thousands of people, including their own. After doing so, the earlier generations of warriors and terrorists turned into peacemakers, but they are now gone, and the momentum for destruction remains. Enemies who once were connected by peacemaking efforts are now enemies who may be linked soon in arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The important point is not legalistic arguments over who bears the greatest moral or legal responsibility. The point is that they are linked. Neither side earns a Nobel Peace Prize or an arrest warrant without the other, nor are they ever likely to. However committed each is to eliminating the other from the face of the Earth, neither has much chance of success. They will remain linked, forever, as neighbors at war or — if they ever decide that this time they really have had enough blood and tears — neighbors at peace. — Los Angeles Times",

        "content": "Jim Antoniono’s travels have taken him from Cold War-era Germany to the Westmoreland County Courthouse, through thousands of miles of mountain trails and into courtrooms and boardrooms. After a more than a half-century, Antoniono, 78, of Unity, will return to his roots in county government when on Tuesday he begins work as the court-appointed conservator to oversee the Register of Wills office. Common Pleas Judge Harry Smail Jr. this month appointed Antoniono to oversee the courthouse office that processes and files adoption records, guardianships, wills, estates and marriage licenses after finding three-term elected office holder Sherry Magretti Hamilton in contempt of court. Hamilton was accused of failing to adequately run the office and was found guilty of violating two court orders that required her to meet specific filing deadlines and required functions. Two judges issued findings that determined the office had fallen behind on its work, was understaffed and without proper leadership. “This has never been done before,” Antoniono said of his conservator role. “In some ways, it will take nowhere near the time I thought it would, or twice as long. I’m going to be there off and on, on a regular basis. When I’m not there, I’ll have someone monitoring the situation. The judge’s order gives me authority over the office, and I think I have enough authority and I’m going to be backed by the judges.” He will be paid $170 an hour in his conservator’s role the judge’s said will continue indefinitely until the office is stabilized. Hamilton will continue to earn her nearly $90,000 a year salary, but will have no official oversight role in the office during Antoniono’s conservatorship. For Antoniono, it’s a return to county government. “He’s very comfortable in the courthouse,” said Greensburg attorney Ken Burkley, who said he spoke with Antoniono days before he was appointed as register of wills conservator. “I told him, anybody who wants to take that job is crazy, but he’s extremely competent and capable.” ‘He’s the perfect guy’ Antoniono began his professional career in the 1970s as the chief deputy to then newly elected Recorder of Deeds Jeanne Griffith. He served in that role as he attended law school and later spent nearly two decades as the office solicitor. Antoniono was raised on a farm in Upper Burrell and, after graduating high school, enlisted in the Army, where in the mid-1960s he served as a driver in a special military liaison unit that spied on East German and Russian troops across the Berlin Wall. “I was caught by Russians when I tried to sneak into a restricted areas. I couldn’t get out of the car and was held until the next day. They pulled my permit to drive into East Germany,” Antoniono said. After a four-year Army career, Antoniono went to college at Penn State University and later obtained a master’s degree in political science from Rutgers University. He returned to Westmoreland County, where in 1972 he headed the local presidential campaign staff for South Dakota Sen. George McGovern in his unsuccessful bid to defeat President Richard Nixon. While working on that campaign, Antoniono forged professional and political alliances that continue decades later. Attorney Bill McCabe has been Antoniono’s law partner since 1986. “I can tell you he is an extremely dedicated lawyer. There’s nothing he wouldn’t do for his clients, and there’s been times when he’s been in the office working at 3 a.m.,” McCabe said. “He just tenacious. He’s a problem-solver. Jim just knows how to figure things out. He’s the perfect guy for (that office), but I think he’s insane for doing it.” ‘I started with nothing’ A lifelong Democrat, Antoniono worked on various campaigns and twice ran for public office, once for a state House seat in the late 1970s and in 2009 for Westmoreland County district attorney. He lost both races. Antoniono continued his political activism and in recent years served as the Democratic Party’s local lawyer in voting challenge cases pushed by Republican candidates, including then-President Donald Trump following the 2020 election. He continues to own a successful real estate business that has bought and sold properties in downtown Pittsburgh, Greensburg and throughout the region. It’s that business that allowed he and his wife, Susan, in 2013 to donate $1 million to his alma mater, Penn State. “Philanthropy is important and I truly believe in giving back. I started with nothing and built up what I have with hard work,” Antoniono said. ‘Not unusual for me’ Hard work for Antoniono extends to the outdoors. In 2013, at 68, he completed a five-month, 2,200 mile hike along the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine, a trek that raised about $10,000 for the Westmoreland County Bar Association. Last summer, for the fifth consecutive year, he became the oldest hiker to complete the 37-mile daylong Rachel Carson Trail Challenge. A torn Achilles will prevent Antoniono from hiking during this summer’s challenge, but he said a return is a possibility for 2025. “It’s amazing for anybody to do it, especially at his age,” said fellow hiker Dirk Matson, who like Antoniono has walked the Appalachian Trail and finished the Rachel Carson challenge. “He’s a machine, a physical anomaly. It’s not an easy thing to do at any age.” Antoniono this spring was elected vice president of the Pennsylvania Bar Association and is in line to head the organization in two years. But for now, his focus will be on the register of wills office. He said he will rely on his prior work for Griffith as well as his long legal career, which at times focused on wills and estates of clients. “I spent 20-plus years working in a row office. That experience makes this very difficult job not unusual for me,” Antoniono said.",

        "content": "Andrew McCutchen has more incentive than most to heavily lean on advanced analytics and all of the information at a player’s fingertips nowadays as the Statcast era reaches a decade of full implementation in MLB. The Pittsburgh Pirates’ designated hitter has navigated through a slow offensive start to the season, slashing .226/.332/.384 with a handful of days left in May. But analytics can be utilized to add more context to a given player’s performance — McCutchen’s in particular — at-bat by at-bat. In that regard, McCutchen has found some consolation despite relatively unappetizing standard splits. However, within the greater realm of analytics, there is an extent to which McCutchen decides to consume. “(Analytics) can keep you positive and can help you, but there’s also just a lot of information out there that ultimately, you shouldn’t look at all of it,” McCutchen said. “You’re just going to take yourself down a rabbit hole. “It’s good, but just like anything that deals with numbers, it’s also bad. You’ve got to try to simplify the game, at the end of the day, as much as you can. Use stuff that you need to use that can help you and just move on past it.” One advanced statistic that adds interesting context to McCutchen’s performance at the plate in 2024 is his barreled balls per plate appearance percentage. Barreled balls take into account exit velocity and launch angle off the bat. Specifically, barreled balls require an exit velocity of at least 98 mph. As exit velocity increases, so does the launch angle range that earns barreled designation. Within the Statcast database of in-play balls dating back to 2015, barreled balls have registered a very high minimum batting average (.500) and slugging percentage (1.500). McCutchen ranks 13th in all of baseball with a 10.3% barreled balls per plate appearance rate. As of Tuesday morning, McCutchen led the Pirates in that regard, with Oneil Cruz (10.2%) close behind. For further comparison, the respective averages of elite sluggers Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani are 16.3% and 13.4%. Similarly, McCutchen’s hard-hit production (balls off his bat with an exit velocity of 95 mph or higher) falls in the top 22% league-wide. On the Pirates, only Cruz (54.2%) accounts for a higher rate of hard-hit balls than McCutchen (46.4%). “For me, you’re doing something right when you let the ball travel and get deep, so you’re getting hits that way,” McCutchen said. “You keep that and maintain that approach and good things happen.” McCutchen’s expected slugging percentage (.501) being significantly higher than the actual (.384) is further illustrative of the kind of contact he’s been making on the year. For a specific example, look no further than McCutchen’s second at-bat in May 23’s series finale vs. the San Francisco Giants. After hitting his seventh homer of the year to lead off the game, McCutchen just missed hitting another in his next plate appearance, instead flying out deep to right-center field. Per Statcast, the ball had an 100.9 mph exit velocity, traveled 392 feet and had an expected batting average of .670. McCutchen putting balls in play like that constitutes a major reason why manager Derek Shelton has stuck with him, even when his batting average and accompanying offensive numbers remained low. “This guy went through a week or 10 days of having the worst luck of any human being on the planet,” Shelton said. “It seemed like everything he squared up was getting caught, and now balls are starting to fall in for him a little bit. The quality of the at-bat has been really good over the past month.” McCutchen’s career transcends the Statcast era. His 2011-15 stretch, featuring five All-Star appearances, the 2013 NL MVP and four Silver Sluggers, took place before many of the aforementioned analytics became commonplace. Comparing the present with the pre-Statcast era, McCutchen can appreciate what analytics offer from a process standpoint. Being able to quantify his approach at the plate, while it hasn’t fully translated into the numbers he’d prefer to be putting up, has been important for him this season. “You get confirmation when you’re going through things,” he said. “It used to be before (2015) you’d be like, ‘Man, I just feel like I’m squaring a lot of balls up, I’m just not really getting the knocks.’ Now, you say that and you have the numbers to prove it. ‘You are squaring the ball up (but) the hits just aren’t falling for you. You’re actually squaring the ball up more than you ever have and you’re also not getting the hits like you normally should.’ “So, you have both of those to prove your statement. ... You get cold, hard facts on the things that you’re feeling.” That said, while exit velocity in particular is increasingly used as a performative barometer in baseball, McCutchen is not a player putting all his energy into chasing the metric. “In the sense of squaring the ball up three, four times and getting hits — that rarely happens,” McCutchen said. “When a guy is 3 for 4, 3 for 5, 4 for 5, 4 for 4 — a lot of those times all those hits aren’t hit on the barrel. “Sometimes you’re getting jammed, you’re hitting one off the end, you’re beating out an infield single and mixing in a hard-hit ball here and there. That’s just the way the game goes.” McCutchen would be the first to admit that his current numbers fall short of expectations, but over the past few weeks, he’s been heating up along with the weather. Heading into Tuesday’s series opener vs. the Detroit Tigers, he owns a .263 May batting average with an on-base percentage of .359 and slugging percentage of .438. McCutchen’s strikeout rate this month is 24%, down from 36% in April. Taking some time to get going offensively is nothing new to McCutchen, who owns a career .239 batting average in April. Over his 16-year MLB career, he’s hit .284 in May while June has routinely been when McCutchen’s been at his best at the plate, with a .315 lifetime average. The strong underlying numbers around McCutchen’s performance to date give him confidence that he’s on the right track. “They’re getting better,” McCutchen said of his at-bats of late. “... I have to just maintain my approach. If I get to two strikes, I’ve got to battle and that’s what I’ll continue to do. But until then, it’s good but it can be better.”",

        "content": "Temporary traffic signals are being installed where Route 380 and Golden Mile Highway meet, but the permanent improvements proposed for the intersection have a Murrysville family upset. Canonsburg-based Olympus Energy is funding traffic improvements as part of its Hermes fracking well pad project, being constructed nearby on the Murrysville/Plum border. Part of those improvements — widening the intersection of Route 380 and Logan Ferry Road to accommodate truck traffic better — are complete, and Olympus officials also proposed installing traffic signals where the roads split. It is an odd configuration where the state route numbers do not align with the local road names. Route 380/Fairview Drive turns sharply west as it becomes Saltsburg Road through Plum, and Route 286 (which is also part of Saltsburg Road, running across the top of Murrysville) banks south and suddenly becomes Golden Mile Highway. Near the intersection, there is a small driveway and house owned by 95-year-old Florella Silvis. Her son Jeff Silvis said he and his mother are being pressured by Olympus officials to sell a portion of the driveway and property for the intersection’s eventual permanent improvements. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}(); “A representative from Olympus told me that ‘Murrys­ville is going to put a new intersection there one way or the other,’ and they want part of our driveway and property to do it,” Silvis told council at its May 21 meeting. “He said multiple times that Murrysville is using Olympus as a cash cow to improve the intersection.” That angered Murrysville council President Dayne Dice. “We as a municipality are not involved in this,” Dice said. “We agreed to take over maintenance of the traffic signal once it’s installed, but for an Olympus representative to say that is pretty asinine. Just to make it clear, if anyone comes to you and says Murrys­ville is putting pressure on you, or them, the answer is no.” Murrysville Chief Administrator Michael Nestico confirmed the traffic light is being undertaken by Olympus, and that he directed Olympus officials to reach out to the Silvis family regarding any matters involving future work. “What was said in those conversations, I was not privy to,” Nestico said. Olympus officials declined comment for this story. The traffic signal is to be operational prior to the Hermes wells going into production, Nestico said. “From a drilling and operations standpoint, I think they’re ready to move forward, and that means getting the light installed,” he said. The signal — which will go into operation on May 31, according to signage posted at the intersection — places much more regulation on the way traffic flows. “With the new temporary signal, drivers headed north and east on Golden Mile Highway won’t be able to make a simple left onto Saltsburg Road,” said PennDOT District 12 Traffic Engineer David Parker. “That entrance onto the slip ramp will be barricaded and they’ll sit at a light to wait and make that left-hand turn.” Golden Mile Highway traffic continuing down the hill on Fairview Drive/Route 380 toward the 380 Auction Warehouse will mostly be able to continue unimpeded. And for traffic turning left from Saltsburg Road onto Fairview, a series of barricades will prevent drivers from crossing into the far-right lane of continuous traffic. The design is called a “continuous T” intersection. Parker said PennDOT recently installed a similar one at the Pennsylvania Turnpike’s Route 31 interchange in Donegal. The only time drivers headed north on Golden Mile Highway will be stopped by the light is when it is triggered by a vehicle waiting to leave the Silvis driveway. Parker said the temporary lights will remain in place until Murrysville requests to remove them or make them permanent, which Olympus officials say they intend to do. Dice made it clear that Murrysville officials are barely involved, apart from being the official body to make the request to PennDOT on behalf of Olympus. “We have a role in the approval process, but for anyone to say we’re putting pressure on them is just not true,” Dice said.",

        "content": "By TERRY TANG and MIKE SCHNEIDER (Associated Press) The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes miss the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. say they are not represented accurately in the official numbers. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them versus how they identify themselves. The groups say money, political power and even health could be at stake. Being lumped into the wrong column can mean a gain or loss of government funds that are distributed based on data. For some, it’s about their identity and feeling seen by their own country. The Office of Management and Budget said the working group that oversaw the revisions held 94 “listening sessions” with many advocacy groups, academics and the general public, and it will continue to reach out to communities. During the Vietnam War and unbeknownst to the American public, the CIA recruited Lao and Hmong people to fight the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia. Tens of thousands of Hmong soldiers died while others fled to the U.S. as a result of what became known as the “secret war.” By the 1970s, many Hmong had resettled in Minnesota, Wisconsin and central California. Today, Hmong in the U.S. number more than 300,000. Some states recognize Hmong and Lao veterans with annual ceremonies, and in April, the Wisconsin governor signed a law mandating that Hmong American history be taught in schools. Given their history fighting in that region for the U.S., many Hmong feel strongly that they should be classified as Southeast Asian. But because China is considered the Hmong ancestral homeland, the U.S. Census Bureau categorized them as East Asian after the 2020 census. “That has been very hurtful to our elders and to our veterans who sacrificed so much to get us here to this country after everything they did to help the U.S. during the Vietnam War,” said May yer Thao, president and CEO of the St. Paul, Minnesota-based Hmong American Partnership. The East Asian label also pains them because the Hmong were oppressed in China as an ethnic minority and sought refuge in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, according to Quyên Dinh, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. Those who object to the classification also have a practical concern: the East Asian grouping could hide socioeconomic disparities between Hmong and other Asian households that need to be addressed. The per capita income of Hmong was almost $26,000, while it was more than $53,000 for Asians overall, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. “We are still one of the most impoverished communities in this nation,” Thao said. The Census Bureau says it’s working with the Hmong community to improve their classification. When the government revised its race and ethnicity standards in March — it’s first major alteration since 1997 — its seven categories included a new one, Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA. The revisions also encouraged detailed data collection about respondents’ backgrounds, such as African American, Jamaican and Haitian under the Black category. Missing from the list of backgrounds under the new MENA category: Black Arabs from such countries as Somalia and Sudan, and Armenians. The groups were left out after a 2015 field test by the Census Bureau found that most Armenians still identified as white and most Somali and Sudanese respondents identified as Black even when MENA was an option. Some advocates said the decision to omit Black Arabs from being included in the MENA category was based on outdated research. For many Armenian Americans, not having their own category amounts to an existential threat as a large part of their diaspora’s culture is now concentrated in the United States. Ethnic Armenians also have communities around Europe and the Middle East, in particular Lebanon. Many are descendants of those who fled the 1915 campaign by Ottoman Turks in which some 1.5 million Armenians died in massacres, deportations and forced marches. The atrocities, which emptied many ethnic areas in eastern Turkey, are widely viewed by historians as genocide . Turkey rejects the description of genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest during World War I. Without Armenian inclusion in the MENA subcategories, many will likely categorize themselves as being from a different country. That could diminish their official numbers and reduce their power when it comes to redrawing political districts in places with large Armenian communities, said Sophia Armen, chair of the Census Taskforce of the Armenian National Committee of America-Western Region. “We will now be undercounted by potentially hundreds of thousands of people,” Armen said. “It spells out a very real destruction of Armenian identity in the next two generations.” During the last redistricting round following the 2020 census, Armenians in greater Los Angeles — which has the largest concentration of Armenians outside Armenia — were almost split up into different city districts, but the redistricting plan was modified after they sounded the alarm. There are an estimated 460,000 Armenian Americans in the U.S. , with half living in California, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. Being identified in the data correctly also is important to local health departments. It can influence anything from vaccination outreach in the proper language to tailoring health campaigns for specific communities. Armenian Americans, for instance, are more likely to suffer from hypertension than the general population, but there’s not a lot of data. A coding error last year in an annual Census Bureau survey offered unprecedented insight into how large numbers of Brazilians in the U.S. identify as Hispanic or Latino. An analysis by Pew Research Center showed that the coding mistake revealed at least 416,000 Brazilians, or more than two-thirds of Brazilians in the U.S., also identified as Hispanic in the 2020 American Community Survey. Usually, if someone marks Hispanic and Brazilian on the survey, they are recoded as “not Hispanic” when the numbers are crunched. Not including Brazilians, or Haitians for that matter, in the definition of Hispanic or Latino, means that large numbers of Afro-Latinos aren’t counted, Michelle Bueno Vásquez, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Northwestern University, wrote the Office of Management and Budget. “The OMB as it stands fails Latinos, especially Afro-Latinos who continually suffer double discrimination and marginalization, on top of statistical invisibility, in the United States,” she said. Researching the impacts of categorizing Brazilians as Hispanic was among the recommendations a Census Bureau advisory committee made last month. “Policy is driven by data, first and foremost,” Armen said of people who feel missed in the classifications. “It just seems like we are purposely being ignored.” ___ Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP .

        "content": "According to the Supreme Court, it’s perfectly fine for state legislatures to draw congressional districts according to political party — they just can’t gerrymander by race. This simple-sounding rule poses a serious practical problem, however, in places where there is a high correlation between being Black and voting Democratic. The conservative majority of the court, in a 6-3 decision issued Thursday, made it much harder for plaintiffs to prove that race, not partisanship, is the reason a given district has been gerrymandered. The case, Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, is an object lesson in the conflict between two competing theories of how we should think about racism in America today. The decisions and dissents are a bit technical. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by all the court’s conservatives. Alito argues that courts should assume that legislatures are acting in “good faith.” In other words, faced with a gerrymander in a place like South Carolina where at least 90% of Black voters vote Democratic, we should not presume race was the motivating factor for the Republican-dominated state legislature. To convince the court otherwise, the plaintiffs should compare the contested map with an “alternative map” of a district gerrymandered purely on partisan grounds but not racial ones. In the absence of such an alternative map, Alito wrote, the court should infer that partisanship, not race, was the underlying motive — making the district constitutional. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan, joined by the court’s two other liberals, excoriated the good-faith assumption and the requirement of the alternative map. Her point was that, according to Supreme Court precedent, the justices are supposed to accept the gerrymandering decisions of district courts unless those lower court decisions are clearly erroneous. The majority, she emphasized, violated this principle by imposing the presumption of good faith and the requirement of an alternative map. So much for the law: What’s going on behind the doctrine? The answer is a profound disagreement about racism between the court’s two factions. Alito and the conservatives think that the Constitution should only protect Black people from the most virulent bigotry – the kind that led South Carolina to embrace slavery until it lost the Civil War and segregation until the Civil Rights movement produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965. More than that, they believe that such explicit racism has now effectively disappeared. The judicial presumption of good faith is implicitly based on the notion that the White South Carolina Republicans who gerrymandered the district just want Republicans to be elected to Congress and wouldn’t care if those Republicans happen to be Black. Put another way, the court’s conservatives assume that the South Carolina legislature is sticking it to Black South Carolinians because they are Democrats, not because they are Black. Kagan and the court’s other liberals see it differently. First, they don’t agree that overt racism is dead. A presumption of good faith is therefore premature, to put it mildly. The law shouldn’t be rigged to make it harder to prove racism than to prove other kinds of legal claims. Second, the court’s liberals implicitly believe that racism today must be understood as more than just personal bigotry. The core idea of structural or systemic racism is that, even if we could all wake up one day miraculously free of any biases, the structures of racial disadvantage created over hundreds of years of slavery and segregation would still be with us. And Black people would still, on average, be more likely to live in locations determined by that history, as is the case in South Carolina. Under this way of thinking, the fact that South Carolina Republicans can gerrymander Black people into a district to limit the influence of Democrats isn’t a neutral act or even a purely partisan one. At a legal level, you could see the Supreme Court’s split in this case as a consequence of its refusal to find partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional. Kagan tried hard to get Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court’s swing vote from about 2006 to his retirement in 2018, to hold partisan gerrymandering to be a constitutional violation. She came close, leading Kennedy to at least entertain the possibility, but in the end, she lost the flight. Now the court is differently configured, and the conservatives are following the logical implications of their acceptance of partisan gerrymandering. At a more fundamental level, the divide on the court reflects a divide in the country about race and racism. In that respect, this case is similar to last year’s major decision on affirmative action in college admissions. We can expect more of the same in the years to come. ____ This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

        "content": "Offering the best possible employee benefits package is crucial for Isle of Man businesses that want to attract employees from the ‘Generation Z’ and ‘Millennial’ age brackets. That’s the message from experts at insurer Zurich who are seeing increasing demand from island employers that want to use employee benefits to help them address skills shortages, support business growth and gain a competitive advantage. Corporate benefits executive at Zurich International Stephanie Hatton leads the company’s Braddan-based team who have decades of experience in this sector. She said: ‘For employers that rely on professionals who are sought after by competitors because of their unique skillsets and experience, offering a high-quality benefits package is often the best way to ensure employees are satisfied in their career. 'Difficult decisions' for Isle of Man hospitality firms avoided thanks to support' 'Reduced activities' at £10m leisure centre during Isle of Man TT amid access row Zurich award celebrates Isle of Man's young innovators with bright ideas James O'Kelly promoted to head of operations at SolutionsHub ‘In an era when low unemployment levels and skills shortages are combining to make it even more difficult to retain the best people, it’s more important than ever to offer benefits packages which make valued employees want to stay.’ There’s a growing weight of evidence that changing attitudes and expectations are transforming the employee benefits landscape. Research published by Deloitte in 2023 , for example, shows clearly how expectations of employees have shifted significantly in recent years. The survey by the advisory, assurance, audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk advisory and tax services specialists covered 44 countries and the general trends it highlights regarding the Generation Z and millennial age brackets broadly matches Zurich’s experience here in the island. Generation Z are those born from the late 1990s to the early 2010s, while millennials are typically defined as the generation of people born from 1981 to 1996.Stephanie added: ‘One key trend we’re seeing here which is reflected in the research is that employee experiences and expectations are very different when compared to previous generations. ‘Health and wellbeing and achieving a good work/life balance are now much higher on employees’ list of priorities. ‘In this context, mental health support has become a major focus because mental health issues are on the rise in the workplace. ‘This means employers must recognise the importance of providing resources and support, and the best way to do that is with services provided as part of a comprehensive employee benefits package.’ Modern employees naturally gravitate towards employers who demonstrate how much they value their contribution to the business. While salary and pensions are obviously key factors in this context, says Stephanie, having a well-thought-out employee benefits package that also provides practical help to support physical and mental wellbeing is equally important. ‘In our experience both locally and globally, we know that the most progressive employers see this as a sound investment in the people who power their businesses, and one which pays dividends in the long run by reducing employee turnover and sickness leave, while also increasing morale and productivity. ‘Using apps to provide 24/7/365 support for a wide range of health and wellbeing issues is very important – but we also find that offering the option to access traditional forms of one-to-one in person counselling in times of crisis is equally important. ‘It’s why we choose to partner with global technology leaders in health and wellbeing care, and we complement that by partnering with established and respected Manx providers such as Isle Listen and Cruse Bereavement Care. ‘Ultimately, recruiting and retaining the best people – and making sure they are happy and productive – underpins every successful business. That’s why employers here in the island are paying even more attention to the decision they make when choosing their employee benefits solutions provider.’",

        "description": "Heading down a road with no destination in mind,this resident has become a Connecticut sports' 'Game Day' icon, a part of the experience at UConn, Yard Goats and Sun games.",
        "content": "This is not a Connecticut “dream-come-true” story. For Conor Geary, it’s more a dream from which he has yet to be roused. Reveries like this start with a “yes.” Here, Geary is asked to put on a hot, sticky, ridiculous mascot suit in college and reluctantly agrees. That leads to another, even sillier one in Hartford. Then one door opens and leads to another, one gig to another. Louder and louder, deeper and deeper one gets in. “I absolutely did not set out to do this,” Geary said. “Everything that has come over the course of the last six years from sports and arena entertainment and game-day announcing was something where each one happened fortuitously from the previous one.” And now Geary rattles ear drums and gets adrenaline flowing nearly every day on the state’s sports calendar, booming under the name “Game Day Conor” at Yard Goats games, UConn men’s and women’s basketball, hockey and football games, NCAA events all over the country, Connecticut Sun games and anywhere else there is a crowd and a need to get the folks “loud and proud.” “The ubiquity of being in front of so many home crowds in Connecticut is good for the fan experience,” Geary said. “It really does come from a place of humility, because I really do have a very limelight seeking, microphone-shouting, look-at-me, center-of-attention job, but I really feel like my obligation is to the fans.” These days, the ubiquitous GDC shows up in more places than Dan Hurley , gives away more prizes than Drew Carey and he’s available for your private events; book him at GameDayConor.com if the price is right. If he’s not the face of Connecticut sports in 2024, Conor Geary undeniably supplies its lungs. “He is definitely a most valuable player,” Yard Goats president Tim Restall said, “in that he can impact everyone in the building. He can relate to the 5-year-old kid sitting in the stands or the CEO sitting courtside. He can connect to all the fans, get them involved and engaged. And he does it like no one else.” Game-day hosting is a relatively new vocation, evolving over the last generation or so as sporting events developed in-game contests and promotions. It’s essential for minor league baseball, where a very young, sleepy crowd needs to be kept engaged and goofy contests are a staple. A UConn basketball crowd needs less prodding, but somebody has to introduce “Dannnnnnn Hurrrrrrrrrr-leeeeeeee” to bring things to a crescendo, or hand out a plane ticket to the Carolinas for a made half-court shot. And who better to chase a 75-foot putt down the court at Mohegan Sun Arena to usher it through a small opening and give the winner a prize and a hug? That would be Game Day Conor. Geary, 36, is from Manchester and East Catholic High. At age 10, he gained the courage to perform before a crowd, ironically enough, by playing The Cowardly Lion in a production of “The Wizard of Oz” at C.A.S.T Children’s Theatre, a program he still strongly recommends.\\ Older and bolder, he played The Wiz in “The Wiz” and, speaking of showman, Buffalo Bill in “Annie Get Your Gun” . His mother, Faith, took him to Gampel Pavilion for the women’s championship celebration in 1995, his father, Denis, to meet the men’s plane after their championship in 1999. Conor lost his father, who had devoted much of his life to helping adults with disabilities, to cancer last December, but not before they got to share UConn’s 2023 championship. “The pillar he was for so many people in the community, I owe so much of who I am to who he was,” Conor Geary said. At Siena College in upstate New York, Conor Geary earned a degree in marketing and management, with a minor in philosophy, and was a leader in the student senate. Siena had a nationally televised basketball game, and the mascot got sick. “I got a call from the vice president of student affairs, or whatever the title was, and they insisted that they didn’t trust anybody to be the mascot on national television except for me,” Geary says, “because I had a lot to lose as the student government president.” His answer was thanks, but no thanks. They persisted, and next thing you know, Conor Geary, senior from Manchester, was Bernie The Saint Bernard. “And I ... had ... a ... blast,” Geary said. A few years later, Geary was working and living in downtown Hartford, 2 1/2 blocks from the empty lot where a new stadium was to be built for minor league team moving from New Britain. He saw on the Facebook that the Yard Goats needed a mascot and he inquired about tryouts There had been little interest, and the team needed someone to do it at the Glastonbury Senior Center that night. By then, he’d learned that saying “yes” opened doors and could lead him in directions he’d never dreamed of, and thus Geary became the first to ever don the Chompers suit. When Dunkin’ Park opened, Geary and his family held a 60th birthday party for his father. “I fell in love with the place, and I sent Tim Restall a text message saying, whenever you have a job that fits what I do for a living, let me know. I’m going to come work for you.” In 2017, Geary became the Yard Goats director of events and services. A year later, the team needed a game-day host. Knowing that Geary had once managed the Brew HaHa comedy club at City Steam , they asked if he knew any comedians who might be interested in the job. “I said, ‘well, most he comedians I know are busy being comedians,'” Geary said. “That sounds like something I might have fun doing.” Geary was one of the 19 who auditioned, and the Yard Goats, reluctant to have him do both jobs, eventually gave him the shot, working with Mellany Castro, now Gov. Ned Lamont’s director of communications, and Frank Berrian. Eventually, Geary worked alone, MC-ing the coffee cup races, the dress-up-like-a-cheeseburger contest, you name it. “Ultimately, I am a tool to execute whatever it is somebody else has decided to do,” Geary says. “I have to memorize a script, yet be ready to make stuff up.” Then the UConn baseball team scheduled a few games at Dunkin’ Park and asked the Yard Goats if they could use some of their in-game devices. Geary said “yes” to coming in on a day off and the shakers and movers of UConn athletics got to know him, hear him and he got in deeper, started dong UConn events in 2018, Hurley’s first season. “And so each one of the next opportunities came with some affiliation with the prior one,” Geary said. In other words, Geary’s success has come, in more ways than one, by word of mouth. He was hired to work the NCAA lacrosse championships at Rentschler Field two years ago, and now that’s part of his event-juggling; he was in Philadelphia this weekend for another final four. He hosted the FCS football championships last year, and the NCAA men’s basketball regionals in Los Angeles this past March. Last season, someone approached Geary at the XL Center and said he had been instructed by Jen Rizzotti, president of the CT Sun, not to leave the building without his contact information. “I went to a UConn game and I just liked his energy,” Rizzotti said. “It was like really consistent. Most importantly, I loved the way he engaged with the fans and especially at a pro game, it’s more of an event than a basketball game. How the fans perceive the game is just as important as the outcome and I felt he could create an atmosphere that could really make it fun for our fans.” Geary began with the Sun, working Caitlin Clark’s sold-out pro debut five days later. The Yard Goats were home the rest of the week. Does he ever get tired? No need to ask. Conor and his wife, Tori, are now parents of a 16-month old daughter, Harper Rose. “At the end of the day, I am a regular dude,” Geary said, as he looks over the script an hour before the Sun were to play Minnesota. “I had to mow the lawn last night... put the baby to bed and do the dishes. It’s a long day for me. But I’ve got to find that gear and a few minutes after I get my first hit, it’s on. It’s on. Lights are out, curtains coming up, I don’t have the luxury of being tired.” Geary doesn’t have a pregame ritual or regular beverage, like tea with honey. It may be hot chocolate one day, hot coffee another, usually in a sweatshirt or hoodie. “Today,” he told The Courant, “I’m warming up my voice by talking to you.” He does pace himself during a game and tries to generate vocal power from his core, the way a stage performer is trained. “Volume and intensity are two different things,” Geary said. “Sometimes I’m yelling, sometimes I’m shouting, but I try to leave that top 20 percent for the really important moments.” When he yells “Make Some Noi-oise” at a UConn game, that’s full throttle. When he reminds UConn fans not to sit until the Huskies score – or, or, or, or,” he calls on some of his stage techniques to handle the breathing. “On a number of occasions I’ve gotten physically dizzy from holding my breath that long,” Geary said. If you’re one of the tens of thousands, or more, in Connecticut who know who “Game Day Conor” is, you know there is never a drop off in either energy or intensity. He’s asked for autographs often now, and he loves letting kids try on his UConn championship ring. When an employee at a local supermarket asked for a seflie, saying “my friends will never believe you’re here,” Geary put down his can of soup and complied. He gets invited to play golf with people he’s never met. “He represents the brand and the team he is working for like no other,” Restall says. And Game Day Conor is now a brand in its own right, an organic phenomenon, native to Connecticut. But in the end, game-day hosting is a part-time, seasonal job and Geary makes his living year-round by doing corporate sales for the Yard Goats and stringing as many events together as he can. Many do it as a stepping stone to sportscasting, or something else, but Conor Geary, who never knew it would lead to all this the first time he said “yes,” doesn’t know where his high-octane personality and set of iron pipes will lead him next. He has allowed himself a wistful daydream about hosting Wheel of Fortune before Ryan Seacrest was named Pat Sajak’s heir apparent , otherwise the trail of open doors is to lead where it may. “My schtick is arena performance, it’s crowd entertainment,” Geary said. “I’m not a play-by-play person, I’m not an analyst, I’m not a talking head, I’m not a deep-dive, the morning after. I’m going to make sure the kids get the T shirts, the sponsor activations are done. Is there an overlap, something that comes from this? Maybe. But I’m not seeking it. I’m very happy with what I’m doing.”",

        "description": "Already talked-out replacement for the outgoing Mohave remains unconfirmed, but will be \"pushed for\" should demand warrant it.",
        "content": "Kia has indicated that it is open to the idea of remaining in the bakkie-based SUV segment despite its only entrant, the Mohave, being set for reported discontinuing within the next two months. No apparent platform sharing Earlier this month, a report from South Korea claimed the brand’s only body-on-frame SUV would end in production in July amidst not only sliding sales, but also to make way for the Tasman bakkie at Hwaseong Plant from next year. At the same time, the end of the South Korean-market only Mohave, currently in its second generation introduced in 2019, would also spell the end of its 3.0-litre turbodiesel V6 engine once rumoured for the now four-cylinder only Tasman . ALSO READ: Almost South Africa certain Kia Tasman shows itself in first teasers Until now believed to have made use of the same platform as the Mohave, which seemingly isn’t the case, the roll-out of the Tasman will outwardly involve a new architecture with no relations, but still capable of supporting a rival to the Toyota Fortuner, Isuzu MU-X, Ford Everest, Mitsubishi Pajero Sport and Mahindra Scorpio-N. Tasman SUV will need support Asked about the possibility of such a model becoming a reality though, Kia Australia’s General Manager of Product Planning, Roland Rivero, admitted while it would “love” a Mohave successor, significant “negotiating” would have to take place to convince head office of approving such a model. “With Mohave already developed, and I know Mohave is a fairly old product now, but at this point in time globally you need a strong global case, not just an Australian business case,” Rivero was quoted by carsguide.com.au as saying. “So, we’d love to spawn a ladder-frame SUV, like an Everest competitor, out of that same (Tasman) platform. And theoretically you could, but it is something that we still have to negotiate hard with headquarters”. Rivero went further by saying that support for a Tasman-based SUV would have to come from other markets as well and not just Australia where most of the bakkie’s development had taken place. Naming South Africa as one such market, Rivero said, “what we need for it to happen is other markets, major markets that source Tasman, to also want to have a ladder frame SUV. “We’re hoping that South Africa or the Middle East would be keen on it, but at the end of the day we need all of the stars to align for something like to happen”. Tasman coming in 2025 Set to be unveiled towards the end of the year in readiness for the commencing of production and sales in 2025, the Tasman is an all but certainty for South Africa as per comments by Kia South Africa CEO Gary Scott last month. “Where we position the Tasman will be very important. We need to show respect to the bakkie market in South Africa in determining where it will fit in,” Scott told The Citizen on the sidelines of the facelift Picanto launch in Cape Town. “We don’t want it to be like other models which has come with big aspirations but were not able to pull it off. Yes, the Tasman name obviously makes it relevant to Australia, but I think it is just as relevant in South Africa”. For the time being, the Tasman SUV remains purely speculative and not confirmed, though don’t be surprised if matters become more serious once Tasman sales kick-off.

        "description": "“We really have less than five years to go with our available funds.”",
        "content": "Article content The image was both striking and stirring: More than 22,600 colourful mini-flags dotted the graveside markers at Pointe-Claire’s National Field of Honour, this country’s largest military cemetery for Canadian and Allied veterans and their immediate families. The cemetery grounds couldn’t have been more pristine. The occasion was a Sunday afternoon ceremony honouring Canada’s war dead shortly before the 80th anniversary of D-Day, commemorating the Allied landings on the beaches of Normandy, which marked the beginning of the end of the Second World War. More than a million Canadians and Newfoundlanders served in the war, which took the lives of over 45,000 Canadians and left more than 55,000 wounded. Under a glorious but baking sun, a host of politicians and an ever-diminishing handful of Second World War vets were present to hear guest of honour Michel Miraillet, France’s ambassador to Canada, and others pay tribute to our soldiers for their service. A military band played the French and Canadian national anthems. There was the solemn laying of wreaths. There was even a vintage artillery vehicle on hand that landed in Normandy during the invasion. And shattering the serenity of the day were blasts from a howitzer, serving as a harsh reminder of the sounds of war. Among vets and their family members attending the ceremony were former Canadian ambassador to Algeria and Greece Bob Peck and former Canadian ambassador to Indonesia and the Philippines Peter MacArthur, whose fathers are buried at the cemetery. Lt.-Col. Robert Peck took part in the flotilla assault force during the Normandy landing at Juno Beach on June 6, 1944. Private Infantryman James Drennan MacArthur took part in the liberation of Italy 80 years ago and the Netherlands a year later. The two friends have been dismayed to learn that funding for the National Field of Honour has been fast dwindling and that its future could be in peril. The cemetery, owned and operated by the non-profit Last Post Fund, has been steadily accruing large year-end deficits. Although founded in 1909 by the Last Post Fund, the National Field of Honour was only officially inaugurated in 1930. In addition to the Canadians buried here, there are a number of French and Polish vets, whose graves were also decorated with mini-flags of their countries on Sunday. According to the Last Post Fund’s Derek Sullivan, the 2023 cemetery deficit was $200,000 and “is ever growing.” The problem is that the Last Post Fund only has about $1 million in its Perpetual Care Fund, which doesn’t bode well. The cemetery’s annual budget is about $500,000, which is hardly lofty. And if not for the contributions of volunteers — like those who placed the flags on the graveside markers — the cemetery would be in more dire straits. Peck and MacArthur have been at the forefront of efforts to help save the National Field of Honour, petitioning Veterans Affairs Canada to assume full responsibility of the cemetery, as it does with military burial grounds in Halifax and Esquimalt, B.C. The Last Post Fund’s administrators have expressed the same desire. “We really have less than five years to go with our available funds,” Sullivan said prior to Sunday’s ceremony. “Four years ago, we made a proposal to the veterans affairs minister to take over ownership and operation of the cemetery. Unfortunately, that was two weeks before the pandemic set in, so there wasn’t much due diligence on the project. But in the last two years, they’ve been more active in putting in money and time on this. Reports have been provided on environmental assessments and operational examinations and the like. “We don’t know yet if the department will take this over, but I have very positive feelings about them doing something, because doing nothing is not an option. Can’t forget that this is the only cemetery in the country dedicated only to veterans.” Lac-Saint-Louis MP Francis Scarpaleggia — whose riding includes the Pointe-Claire cemetery and who attended Sunday’s ceremony — has presented Peck and MacArthur’s petition to the House of Commons and has declared his advocacy for Veterans Affairs to take over the National Field of Honour. Peck and MacArthur have also communicated with Veterans Affairs Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor about the plight of funding for the cemetery. “Peter and I want to see some sustainability here and we want the graves to be maintained,” Peck said Sunday. “At what time should the government act? We have the 80th anniversary of D-Day and the liberation of Holland and Italy coming in a few days. We think the time is now to make a commitment to resolve this problem. I think it would send a very positive message to commemorate the sacrifice of veterans who have laid down their lives for Canada.” MacArthur conceded this is not necessarily a hot-button issue for most Canadians these days before an election. “The government has this wonderful opportunity framed by D-Day and the liberation of Italy to do the right thing before the election. It’s not a lot of money. Something must be worked out. This beautiful site has so much history to it. We just have to raise awareness with the government and all Canadians. There is a national interest at stake. There is a need to make a correction here to something that’s not right.” Scarpaleggia credits Peck and MacArthur’s steadfast efforts in petitioning for the cemetery’s future. “The idea is to have Veterans Affairs buy this and make it a national cemetery as (Peck and MacArthur) have stated. This place is a gem and I’m going to do everything I can to make that happen. “But you know the wheels of government can sometimes turn slowly, and that’s why you have elected representatives to help push those wheels forward.” Added Sullivan: “I believe there is no chance that any government of Canada now or in the future would allow this cemetery to go under.” Music to the ears of Peck and MacArthur, both of whom grew up in Montreal. Peck divides his time between Greece and Ottawa, while MacArthur is in Ottawa. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the two headed to the graves of their fathers with a little Irish whiskey to share. “My father came from a simple farm family in Arundel,” MacArthur noted. “His world changed so dramatically during the war. He was so proud of his service.” Peck’s dad rarely talked about his service. After the war, he returned to his job as a French teacher for what is now the English Montreal School Board, from which he retired three decades later. “I heard he was a great teacher, but also a real disciplinarian,” Peck said. On both points, I can attest. Mr. Peck was my high school French teacher. Click here to sign Peck and MacArthur’s petition . bbrownstein@postmedia.com",

The 26-year-old Dutchman was one of the best midfielders in the Italian topflight this term, playing a crucial role in la Dea’s historic success in the Europa League and their charge to Champions League qualification. Koopmeiners attracted the attention of , Liverpool and various other top clubs due to his strong and consistent performances for Atalanta, scoring 15 goals and providing seven assists in 50 appearances across all competitions. Daniele Longo of and page 12 of today’s Gazzetta dello Sport detail how Juventus director Cristiano Giuntoli has sent in an offer to Atalanta for Koopmeiners, proposing a fixed €40m fee with €5m in add-ons. This is below la Dea’s €60m valuation, which they aren’t willing to budge from, forcing the Old Lady to alter their offer. Giuntoli is thinking about trying to include youngster Dean Huijsen in a deal to help lower the costs.",

        "content": "In a rare reunion, all 15 members of veteran K-pop boy band Super Junior were recently spotted together. The group, which debuted in 2005 under South Korean entertainment agency SM Entertainment, have gone through several member exits in their almost two decades in entertainment. But member and vocalist Ryeowook’s wedding brought all the men back together in the same space – an uncommon sighting as they were in different countries and unpleasant circumstances had surrounded some members’ exits. Ryeowook, 36, tied the knot with disbanded K-pop girl group Tahiti’s member Ari, 29, in a ceremony held in South Korea on May 26. And his 14 former and current bandmates – Leeteuk, Heechul, Yesung, Shindong, Sungmin, Eunhyuk, Siwon, Donghae, Kyuhyun, Hangeng, Kangin, Kibum, Henry and Zhou Mi – showed up. 【集結】SUPER JUNIOR・リョウクの結婚式に現・元メンバーが参加! https://t.co/crimsSvNoO 写真にはSUPER JUNIORが完全体で写っており、ファンを喜ばせた。リョウクは「これからも変わらずSUPER JUNIORのリョウクとして、歌手リョウクとして、頑張る姿をお見せしたい」と伝えた。 pic.twitter.com/7fek0LTvDd Canadian-Chinese member Henry and Chinese member Zhou Mi are part of Super Junior-M, a sub-unit of Super Junior that are focused on the Chinese market. The sub-unit have not been active since 2015 and Henry left in 2018. SM Entertainment’s chief A&R (artists and repertoire) officer Chris Lee posted an Instagram Story on May 26 of all 15 members and Ari posing for a group photo, sparking much nostalgia among long-time K-pop fans. Another photo circulating online showed the 13 members of the main branch of Super Junior in one frame. A post shared by BADA (@bada0228) South Korean singer Bada from 1990s K-pop girl group S.E.S. also posted two videos showing various members of Super Junior enjoying themselves at the wedding, including one where some members got up and performed their biggest hit, Sorry, Sorry (2009). Chinese star Hangeng filed to terminate his contract with SM Entertainment in 2009 and officially departed the group in 2011. Kibum, who had been on hiatus from the group to focus on acting since 2009, left both the group and SM Entertainment in 2015. Kangin withdrew from the group in 2019 following two drink-driving hit-and-run incidents. Sungmin has also been on hiatus from the group since 2015. That leaves only nine members of Super Junior, who are still actively performing as part of the group today. Heechul, while still involved in song recordings and releases, does not take part in concerts due to health issues. Super Junior last performed at the Singapore Indoor Stadium in 2022 and will return to the same venue on July 14 for another concert. A post shared by BADA (@bada0228)",

        "content": "For more than three decades, Disneyland’s nighttime show “Fantasmic!” has lighted up the Anaheim park’s Rivers of America. A story about our dreams and nightmares centered heavily on Disney’s animated works, “Fantasmic!” has long boasted an assortment of projections, pyrotechnics and fireworks. In 2023, however, a key portion of the show caught fire. A climatic battle between Mickey Mouse and Maleficent in her 45-foot, fire-breathing dragon form brought the show to a halt when the latter became engulfed in flames. Viral video propelled the story to national news, and “Fantasmic!” was placed on an indefinite hiatus while Disney’s live entertainment team re-imagined the show. “Fantasmic!” returned Friday, May 24, featuring a few key changes, including the return of an extended segment focused on “Peter Pan.” It also had no dragon. Yet the apex of the “Fantasmic!” still revolves around a battle between Mickey and Maleficent, who in images is seen towering over the star of the show, her figure conjuring an array of lighting, projection and pyrotechnic effects. Maleficent, with scepter in hand, ascends to a height of 35 feet. Firework effects appear to shoot from Mickey’s hands, and Maleficent sets the river ablaze. “The whole theme of the show — good versus evil, and Mickey’s magic and imagination overpowering the evil — it’s important to have that peak in the show,” says Disney Live Entertainment’s Tobi Longo, who has been working on “Fantasmic!” for nearly all of its three-plus decades. It’s Disney’s longest-running so-called nighttime spectacular. “Maleficent is still going to be spectacular,” Longo said before opening night. “She’s on the stage longer than she used to be. We’ve added new pyro effects, with really cool projections and lasers. The river is still going to light on fire. ... As much as we miss the dragon right now, it’s still going to be a spectacular scene.” “Fantasmic!” is a key piece of Disneyland’s live entertainment, which the park this summer has been leaning heavily upon. With key attractions such as the Haunted Mansion down for refurbishment and the opening of log flume ride Tiana’s Bayou Adventure not expected for a few months yet, Disneyland has sought ways to turn the park into more of a theatrical experience. To wit: A new parade featuring Pixar’s recent films has launched in Disney California Adventure as part of Pixar Fest. It joins the the contemporary Magic Happens parade in Disneyland, which currently houses a nighttime fireworks show based on Pixar. Fireworks fans also have additional ways to take in the evening illuminations, as Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has become a prime viewing spot thanks to the addition of music and a light storyline that feeds into the lore of the land. The return of “Fantasmic!,” however, will further the impression that all of Disneyland is a stage, a place where not only guests can play at heightened versions of themselves but the park can also spring to life and envelop us in stories. “Fantasmic!” makes use not just of the Rivers of America and its centerpiece island but also such large-scale attractions as the Mark Twain Riverboat and the Sailing Ship Columbia. Longo, currently the show director for “Fantasmic!,” says the team began workshopping the new scenes in mid-December, meaning she’s been on an overnight work schedule for the last five months. In an industry where live productions can have relatively short — or repeatedly on and off runs — Longo was asked how “Fantasmic!” has endured. “I think it reflects the wonderful combination of theatrical technology and classic Disney,” Longo says. “We’ve used elements that back in 1992 nobody had ever seen — mist screens, projection on water, lasers and lighting a river on fire. All of that was so new. It’s amazing to me that 30 years later, those elements are still as shocking and exciting as they were in 1992. It combines the charm of classic Disney, live performance and spectacular technology. And we have to remember that probably 75% of the guests at Disneyland have never seen a live entertainment show. “I’ve done a lot of shows, performing at Disney as a choreographer and a director. And I’ve done a lot of shows on the outside. I don’t think I’ve done anything that combines all of those elements.” Of course, big universal themes don’t hurt, either, and “Fantasmic!” in about 25 minutes touches on the power of imagination, romantic idealism and inner demons. Characters are presented in different guises throughout — large-scale projections give way to more serene, waltz-like moments on individual boats. And that says nothing of nostalgia. Take, for instance, the afternoon parade “Better Together: A Pixar Pals Celebration.” Colorful floats that nod to recent films like “Luca” and “Turning Red,” the latter complete with a larger-than-life Red Panda Mei, are contrasted with smaller, more playful units that touch on “Toy Story” and “Monsters, Inc.” There’s an underlying theme of friendship, and show director Robin Trowbridge argues that parades — and the theme park approach to live entertainment in general — have a unifying power. “It’s such a great channel to take people in other worlds and just let them live in fantasy for a while,” Trowbridge says. “The parade itself — there is such a level of anticipation. You see a parade for 25 or 30 minutes, and you are being taken in and out of different stories. You get to relive your youth, or you get to share your stories.” “Fantasmic!” serves a similar role, weaving in and out of the history of Walt Disney Animation, especially now that “Peter Pan” has once again returned and has replaced a scene referencing “Pirates of the Caribbean.” With the Lost Boys in tow, Peter and Wendy will take on Captain Hook, climaxing with a swashbuckling battle. And while the dragon may be missed, Longo offers a hint that we haven’t seen the last of Maleficent in her fire-breathing form. “We’re excited for something to come back, and we’re in the works and working on it,” Longo says. “But I think what I’ve done with that scene — that good versus evil and that battle between Maleficent and Mickey — is so spectacular. We all loved the dragon, and we’ll keep working on things, but there’s not much I can say about it.” Theme park theatrical productions, as “Peter Pan” is evidence, are always available for tinkering. ______ ©2024 Los Angeles Times.

        "description": "Beyond Ken Dryden by playwright Oren Safdie focuses on how Hall of Fame goalie and Habs provided stability for young boy in turbulent times.",
        "content": "Article content Oren Safdie has never met Ken Dryden in person, but the former Canadien played a huge role in the playwright’s childhood growing up in Montreal. Now, Safdie is paying tribute to the Hall of Fame goalie with his new play, Beyond Ken Dryden, which will be part of the St-Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival. The one-person play will be performed on June 6, 9, 11, 12, 14 and 16 at Venue 9 (Studio Multimédia) at 4750 Henri Julien Ave. Tickets cost $19. Native New York actor Max Katz , who became a Canadiens fan while attending McGill University, plays Safdie looking back at what Dryden and the Canadiens meant to a young boy growing up in Montreal during the 1970s. Safdie reflects on how Dryden and the Canadiens became like family members to him and provided some stability as his own family was breaking up, including a fire that destroyed their home in Westmount when he was 6. After seven years of separating and then getting back together, Safdie’s parents finally divorced when he was about 14. In the play, Safdie also reflects on the political climate at the time with the separatist Parti-Québécois getting elected for the first time in 1976, which resulted in many of his friends and classmates at school moving out of the province. “I remember there was this new goalie that came in,” Safdie recalled about Dryden’s arrival in Montreal in 1971 before going on to win six Stanley Cups during his eight seasons with the Canadiens. “I was only 6 years old, but I discovered hockey and the Canadiens. In some ways, I feel like some of the players, they became like family. For a child, you’re looking through the television and they’re speaking to you and you sort of feel like you get to know them — and there’s a certain stability that they gave me. The way they used to work as a team, you couldn’t help but really fall in love with these players.” While things seemed to be falling apart around him with his parents getting divorced and Quebec seemingly wanting a divorce from Canada, Safdie says the Canadiens were able to lift both him and the city of Montreal during that period. Dryden wasn’t the typical hockey player from that era, joining the Canadiens following three seasons at Cornell University. After winning two Stanley Cups in his first three seasons, Dryden took a year off from hockey in order to article with a Toronto law firm. “He was really everything the opposite of how hockey was portrayed at the time when (the movie) Slap Shot was more like the image you had of the average hockey player,” Safdie said during a recent phone interview from his home in Venice, Calif. After watching Dryden play his first games with the Canadiens behind a mask, Safdie had visions of the goaltender as a gladiator with scars all over his face who “drank gasoline for breakfast”. Then the first time Safdie saw Dryden being interviewed on TV he saw a man with glasses and big sideburns who looked more like a lawyer or an accountant and was so soft-spoken he had to turn up the volume. “There were a lot of positive values with him,” Safdie said. “There were just so many lessons that I sort of learned from him and I tried to emulate him in certain ways.” Safdie left Montreal at age 18 for school and would earn a masters degree in architecture from Columbia University. His father is architect Moshe Safdie , most famous for designing Montreal’s Habitat 67. At age 11, Oren Safdie started a paper route, delivering 120 copies of The Gazette before 6 a.m. each day to people at Habitat 67, where he was also living. During his final semester at Columbia University, Safdie took a playwriting course and won a competition in the class, which led to a “complete 180 turn” from his interest in architecture to writing. He worked briefly as an architect for a firm in Montreal and for his father and also taught architecture at Iowa State, which is where he started writing seriously. Safdie continued to feel a connection to Dryden as he gave up architecture and became a writer who also teaches playwriting and screen writing. He has taught at the University of Miami, at Douglas College in New Westminster, B.C., at the California School of the Arts and is now teaching at St. Olaf College in Minnesota. “I didn’t take the straight path of becoming a writer,” Safdie said. “I went into architecture school and only came to playwriting at 26. I remember reading (Dryden’s book) The Game (published in 1983). The intellectual level of how he wrote that and he wasn’t necessarily a writer by trade. It gave me a lot of hope in terms of my own writing career that you really just have to write what you know.” That’s what Safdie has done with Beyond Ken Dryden, which is his first one-person play. The 80-minute play starts with actor Katz playing a 31-year-old Safdie watching the final Canadiens game at the Montreal Forum in 1996 and then he starts to look back, talking about his childhood and the relationship that developed between him, Dryden and the Canadiens, along with the lessons he learned from them. Safdie has written about 14 plays and four screenplays. His credits include the film You Can Thank Me Later and the play Private Jokes, Public Spaces. He took a semester off from teaching last fall and spent three months writing Beyond Ken Dryden. “This is new for me ... I’ve never written a one-person show,” he said. “It’s different from writing other plays because it’s just one guy up there for 80 minutes and he has to keep your interest. It’s much more about storytelling than drama with a couple of characters.” Safdie was 13 when his father moved to Boston to teach at Harvard and open an architectural firm. Still upset about his parents splitting up and not warming up to the fact his father had a new girlfriend, Safdie nicknamed the girlfriend Mike Milbury after the “dirtiest player on the Bruins” when he went to visit them for the first time in Boston and attended a game at Boston Garden. Safdie’s mother, Nina Nusynowicz, ended up in a relationship with author Roch Carrier when Safdie was about 19 and they eventually got married. Carrier wrote the famous book The Hockey Sweater, about the tribulations of a young boy growing up in rural Quebec when he mistakenly receives a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater as a gift instead of a Canadiens sweater with Maurice Richard’s No. 9 on the back. Carrier helped inspire Safdie to write Beyond Ken Dryden. When Safdie’s daughter was in elementary school in Los Angeles, Carrier went to the school to read The Hockey Sweater to her class. Safdie was impressed by how enraptured the children — who knew little if anything about hockey — were with the story. “I thought there’s definitely something here about sports and childhood that I wanted to kind of tap into,” Safdie said. “He had his Rocket Richard and, I guess, I had my Ken Dryden.” Safdie sent a copy of the script for the play to Dryden, who is now 76. Safdie said Dryden read it with “a fine-tooth comb” and responded by email, correcting the spelling of some of the more obscure former NHL players mentioned in the play, along with some other fact-checking. “It was really amazing that he went through all that in so much detail,” Safdie said. “He was very gracious and said, ‘I’m very touched.’ ” When asked if he’d like to finally meet Dryden in person, Safdie responded: “It’s not like my big goal. I was very touched that he read the play and I’m not that star-struck like that anymore that I have to meet him. The fact that he read it and responded and we had this communication was really touching to me.” scowan@postmedia.com x.com/StuCowan1",

        "description": "Waitrose has unveiled its brand new cat food - Lasagne Chunks in Jelly - and it has left many people confused",
        "content": "People have been asking whether Waitrose's social media accounts got hacked after the store uploaded a picture of its new, limited edition cat food. The supermarket left many baffled after unveiling its Essential Waitrose Lasagne Chunks in Jelly with Mozzarella, Juicy Tomato and Fresh Basil. The image posted to the retailer's Facebook , X, and Instagram accounts shows the product sitting on a shelf. On the front, there is a photo of a ginger cat alongside a plate of the lasagne. In the caption, Waitrose wrote: \"Help your cat rise AND shine with our new lasagne-flavoured snack. Inspired by our favourite fuzzy orange friend #GarfieldMovie.\" So, for anyone hoping the cat food is real, they'll be disappointed to know it is made-up. The entire post is a joke and a nod to the brand new Garfield movie that has come out. The Garfield Movie is available in cinemas now, it was released last week on May 24. The 2024 film sees the iconic ginger cat - who loves lasagne and is voiced by Chris Pratt - unexpectedly reunite with his long-lost father, the street cat Vic. A Waitrose spokesperson added: \"Garfield's love of lasagne is legendary, so we thought we'd test out the pasta-bilities with an Essential Waitrose lasagne cat food. While we were just pulling everyone's paws on this occasion, we've got plenty of other feline menu options which aren't quite as hiss-terical.\" However, the post did seem to fool many people. Some even asked if the store's accounts had got hacked while others 'couldn't believe how well cats are now being fed'. On Reddit , one user called SmileyEeyore asked: \"Did Garfield hack Waitrose’s Instagram?\" They added: \"If Garfield got to have his say in commercialised cat food, we know he would stop the human gatekeeping of lasagne. \"The only conclusion is therefore that he’s evidently managed to infiltrate Waitrose HQ & is out there doing it for the cats.\" On X, Nushy wrote: \"Is this real? please say yes!\" Jayveeboyce put: \"Waitrose cats eating better than half the country at this point — I am not surprised.\" Deb___x agreed: \"These cats don’t know they are born.\" Squirrel_lover4 jokingly pointed out: \"April fools day was last month.\" Seagull4 replied: \"Is this an April fool? It’s May... almost June.\" Meanwhile, Eat_static seemed impressed, writing: \"Ha ha, brilliant.\" Waitrose has been approached for comment.",

        "description": "There are plenty of reasons to maintain digital archives of aviation museums. These include preservation of first copies among other things.",
        "content": "Digital archives of any refer to collections of digitized materials related to history, which are also related to various aspects of life, such as culture, societal structure, and cherished values, among other things that can be stored and accessed online. An aviation museum anywhere might have a rich treasure trove of historical photographs, letters, journals, flight logs, military records, oral histories, and other artifacts that can be digitized. The importance of such digitization is only growing, and here is a look at why. Firstly, digital archives play a crucial role in preserving and sharing the rich history of aviation. Aviation museums digitize various materials from their collections. These digitized materials are then stored in online repositories, making them accessible to a wider audience. They provide valuable resources for researchers, aviation enthusiasts, and the public to explore and learn about aviation heritage. For instance, The Museum of Flights has a separate section dedicated to its digital collections. : Get the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: With properly organized digital collections of such an archive, people interested in aviation can: Secondly, digital archives are important for efficient storage and space. Often, physical archives with boxes of documents and artifacts require extensive storage space. This is why more aviation magazines and newspapers are opting to archive their written documents. There are thousands of papers being produced about aviation each month. Keeping physical copies of all such papers would be next to impossible. Some of the other benefits of digitizing data include: Digital archives enable people to search for subjects of interest conveniently. Some of the technology that is used in aviation museums include: OCR significantly reduces the time spent manually searching for physical records, as researchers can find information without looking at every word in the manuscript. So the tough job of analyzing large bodies of information can now be done with ease. Digital archives help museums share content through their websites, social media, and programs, fostering a deep connection with the public. Museums can conduct interactive exhibitions and virtual tours where the public can experience real and immersive experiences. These exhibitions can focus on specific themes, events, or individuals. By presenting curated content online, museums can attract a global audience. Digital archives support educational outreach programs. Students, teachers, and learners can utilize these resources to enhance their knowledge in the aviation sector. Interactive lessons and activities are digitally organized so researchers, historians, and scholars can access digital archives remotely, promoting collaboration and interdisciplinary studies. This is done in Wright Brothers National Park, where digital options such as the following are available for students: In summary, digital archives are of immense significance to aviation museums worldwide. They bridge aviation museums and people, allowing for the preservation, accessibility, and dissemination of valuable materials, making museums efficient and convenient. However, there are a few considerations aviation museums must take before digitizing aviation. Some of the considerations might be providing healthy contextual information so that the reader/ visitor might not be led astray or confused. The aviation museum also needs to ensure that the digital archive is friendly to all users, whilst also making sure that the digital archive and the physical object out of which the archive is made are given equal importance. Without digital archives, it would have been challenging to learn the subtle details about and many other museums we now know about. It is high time aviation museums digitized their archives if they have not done so already. Don't you think so?",

Of 287 lawmakers voting, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city, in which he built onto Tehran’s subway and supported the construction of modern high-rises. Also Read Sri Lankan President Wickremesinghe’s party suggests referendum to postpone elections for two years 23 mins ago Belgium commits $1 billion to Ukraine as Zelenskyy continues his European tour 41 mins ago Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support, as a Revolutionary Guard general, for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief. In Tuesday’s vote, challenger Mojtaba Zonnouri, a hard-line Shiite cleric who once led the parliament’s national security commission, won 60 votes. A former foreign minister to hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Manouchehr Mottaki, received five votes. Qalibaf offered no immediate remarks after the vote. The March parliament election saw the country’s lowest turnout since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Of those elected to the 290-seat body, hard-liners hold over 230 seats, according to an Associated Press survey. A trained pilot, Qalibaf served in the paramilitary Guard during the country’s bloody 1980s war with Iraq. After the conflict, he served as the head of the Guard’s construction arm, Khatam al-Anbia, for several years leading efforts to rebuild. Qalibaf then served as the head of the Guard’s air force, when in 1999 he co-signed a letter to reformist President Mohammad Khatami amid student protests in Tehran over the government closing a reformist newspaper and a subsequent security force crackdown. The letter warned Khatami the Guard would take action unilaterally unless he agreed to put down the demonstrations. Violence around the protests saw several killed, hundreds wounded and thousands arrested. Qalibaf then served as the head of Iran’s police, modernising the force and implementing the country’s 110 emergency phone number. However, a leaked recording of a later meeting between Qalibaf and members of the Guard’s volunteer Basij force, included him claiming that he ordered gunfire be used against demonstrators in 2003, as well as praising the violence used in Iran’s 2009 Green Movement protests. Qalibaf ran failed presidential campaigns in 2005, 2013 and 2017, the last of which saw him withdraw in support of the hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi. Raisi later became president and died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and six others. Iran’s parliament plays a secondary role in governing the country, though it can intensify pressure on a presidential administration when deciding on the annual budget and other important bills. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, has the final say in all important state matters. Iran will hold presidential elections June 28 to replace Raisi.

Namun, dia menyebut tidak menutup kemungkinan ada daftar nama lain di luar kader internal yang akan diusung NasDem, seperti Anies Baswedan. \"Kita utamakan kader. Namun saya belum bisa mengungkapkan siapa itu. Karena memang masih sangat dinamis. Tapi saya yakin dan percaya, nanti pasti akan ada yang terbaik dari yang terbaik,\" ucap Prananda kepada awak media di NasDem Tower, Gondangdia, Pusat, Selasa (28/5). Dia menyampaikan beberapa kader internal yang kuat akan diusung untuk maju dalam pencalonan pemilihan kepala daerah di Jakarta ialah Wibi Andrino dan Ahmad Syahroni. “(Anies) mungkin. Ini dinamis. Mungkin juga Pak Roni (Ahmad Syahroni), mungkin juga sepupu saya, Wibi Andrino,\" kata Nanda, sapaan akrab Prananda. Terkait koalisi di Jakarta, Nanda juga menyebut pembicaraan di internal partainya juga masih sangat dinamis. \"Tetapi ya, kepentingan daerah tentu menjadi lebih utama daripada koalisi itu sendiri, menurut saya. Kita memang terbuka untuk siapa pun dan kita berkoalisi dengan siapa pun untuk kebaikan DKI Jakarta,\" pungkasnya. (Z-2)",

        "content": "At Death Valley National Park, summer temperatures can reach as high as 130 to 134 degrees. For some travelers, that would be reason enough not to visit. But for others, it’s the exact motivation for a trek to Death Valley during the summer: The novelty of experiencing temperatures you’d be hard-pressed to find elsewhere around the globe. “Some folks are seeking out what they consider to be a rare experience,” Nichole Andler, a park ranger with the U.S. National Park Service, said during a media briefing. But it should go without saying that when heat is that extreme, it can easily be a life-or-death situation. “This time of year, when you’re preparing for coming to Death Valley, it’s important to know what you’re getting into,” emphasized Andler, who stressed not only having enough water on hand all times, but staying near your vehicle. In fact, in extreme heat conditions, it may even be best to stay in your vehicle amid the comfort of air conditioning and explore the park by car, said Andler. Her comments were part of a larger National Park Service media conference call, during which officials from parks across the country shared tips for safely visiting this summer. If one of the 400-plus national parks is on your radar for the months ahead, here are the tips NPS officials would like you to keep in mind. 1. Select activities that align with your capabilities There’s all manner of activities available across the U.S. National Park system — from hiking and rock climbing to boating and swimming. The national parks also allow for engaging in challenging and extreme sports including canyoneering, hang gliding and whitewater rafting. During the planning phase for your visit and during your time onsite, it’s important select activities that are appropriate for your experience and physical limitations. “Pick activities that meet your skills and fitness level,” said Cynthia Hernandez, a national park spokesperson. “That might mean being honest if you haven’t prepared for that 15-mile hiking trip.” 2. Bring suitable equipment In addition to focusing on activities that are appropriate for your abilities, it’s critical that you arrive at a national park prepared with the right equipment for your visit. Bring the “right shoes for your activity, water, a compass or a map or a life jacket, if you’re going on the water,” continued Hernandez. It’s also worth noting that weather in many of the wild spaces that make up the national park system can change quickly, so it’s important to bring additional clothing. “What can start out as a beautiful and sunny day can pivot quickly into rain and sleet,” said Jen Newton, with Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, of conditions in that park. “Extra layers and a rain jacket can be helpful.” 3. Communication is critical While this tip is especially critical for solo travelers, it really holds true for anyone visiting national parks, including families and groups: Communicate your plans to others. “Make sure to leave a trip plan with a friend back home,” advises Hernandez, who also suggests telling someone who’s not on your trip how long you intend to be gone and when you can be expected to return. This type of communication is especially critical for remote hikes or other far-flung excursions and explorations. 4. Keep away from wildlife The thrill of seeing wildlife while exploring national parks is unforgettable. But that doesn’t mean it’s open season on taking selfies with wildlife, or engaging with the animals in any way. It’s a rule that should be followed for the safety of the animals and visitors alike. “Keep a safe distance from wildlife, don’t startle wildlife,” Hernandez explained. “Do not pick up wildlife and do not feed wildlife.” Understanding bear safety is also critical when visiting some national parks, said Newton. Grand Teton National Park, for instance, is home to both black and Grizzly bears. “Be bear aware,” said Newton. “Be alert and have good situational awareness.” When hiking in places like Grand Teton or other national parks, it’s important to make at least some level of noise in order to alert animals in the area of your presence. “That’s not necessarily singing and clapping, but even just normal conversation can be helpful to let all creatures know you are out and around,” Newton continued. Newton also recommend carrying bear spray when in Grand Teton (a tip that could apply to other national parks as well that are home to bears). Additionally, know how many seconds of bear spray you have and how far it will go. 5. Review park safety tips in advance Every national park in the country has its own website and that website includes safety guidelines that visitors need to follow in order to have a good experience at the park in question, said Hernandez. Be sure to spend some time reading the website for your intended national park and reviewing the safety tips before you arrive on location. “Even if you visited a park before or have been going to this park for awhile, follow all park recommendations and safety guidelines,” stressed Hernandez, who added that it’s also important to “follow guidelines from park rangers on site.” The National Park Service has also created a Trip Planning Guide that includes “key tips, links, and tools to help” visitors “Plan like a Ranger” for a national park adventure. The guide can be downloaded here . Ultimately, Hernandez said, it’s important for visitors to make what she described as “informed decisions” about their behavior and activities when visiting a national park, in order to help ensure a fun and safe visit. ______ ©2024 Northstar Travel Media, LLC.

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Boston Celtics completed one quest Monday night by returning to the NBA Finals. Now, they'll chase an even bigger goal, the one that's eluded this team for more than a decade — capturing the franchise’s 18th championship. Yes, despite playing for six conference titles in eight seasons, this marks only the second time Boston has advanced to The Finals during that span. And since winning their first NBA title in 1957, the Celtics' current 16-year drought is the second-longest in franchise history. It would be the crowning achievement to what has already been a remarkable season. “Boston has a great team. They led the league from wire to wire,” Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said after his team was swept 4-0 in its first conference finals appearance since 2014. “They didn't want this thing to go on any longer. They blocked shots, they got offensive rebounds, they made key shots.” Boston has excelled in seemingly every possible way in this year's playoffs. The Celtics have won seven straight games overall, they improved to 6-0 on the road with yet another comeback victory, 105-102 in Game 4 against Indiana, and they are 3-0 in elimination games. They beat Indiana three times down the stretch, rallying in the last two games with decisive 13-2 and 7-0 closing spurts to end the Pacers' perfect 2024 playoff run at home — and their season. Next up will be the Dallas Mavericks or Minnesota Timberwolves. Dallas leads the Western Conference finals 3-0 and can clinch the series on its home court Tuesday night. And Boston has been finding help in all corners. While Jayson Tatum garnered the usual headlines for two 36-point outings and a near triple-double in Game 4, 37-year-old Al Horford defied the odds by making seven 3-pointers in Game 3, Jrue Holiday overcame an illness to deftly pick Andrew Nembhard's pocket, and Derrick White delivered the go-ahead 3-pointer in Game 4, everyone seemed genuinely happy it was Jaylen Brown who was chosen series MVP. “I didn't expect that at all,\" Brown said before explaining the emotions of being left off the all-NBA teams. “But as time has gone by and I got to this point, I just stopped caring and I don't care who sees what as long as my team knows my value, my city knows my value, my family knows my value. That's all I really care about.” There's little doubt the Celtics understand where they would be — and where they wouldn't be — without Brown. He scored 29 points and grabbed six rebounds to help Boston erase an eight-point deficit in the final six minutes Monday night. And after the defense forced two late turnovers, Brown helped close it out with a brilliant block of Nembhard just before White's big shot. The reaction was telling for Holiday, who won an NBA title with the 2020-21 Milwaukee Bucks. “I think it's even better that he didn't expect it. That really means that didn't matter to him,” Holiday said. “It was about winning and whatever it took, however long it took. That's what was important to him and I think when you have that mentality and that mindset, you see great people rewarded for the things they do.” Holiday understands. When the Bucks traded him to Portland in September to acquire Damian Lillard, he wasn't sure what would happen next. Four days later, the Celtics made another deal with the Trail Blazers to get the two-time All-Star and defensive whiz, hoping he could help them complete their championship quest. So far, the Celtics' investment in Holiday has delivered big dividends. And now everyone's about to find out if the addition of Holiday and the possible return of starting center Kristaps Porzingis from a strained right calf that has kept him out since April 29 just might help Boston earn another crowning achievement. “Obviously, we fell short of our ultimate goal last year, lost in the conference finals,” Tatum said. “So I think we've just applied everything we learned to this season and this postseason and it's been working really well.\" AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Now, they’ll chase an even bigger goal, the one that’s eluded this team for more than a decade — capturing the franchise’s 18th championship. Yes, despite playing for six conference titles in eight seasons, this marks only the second time Boston has advanced to The Finals during that span. And since winning their first NBA title in 1957, the Celtics’ current 16-year drought is the second-longest in franchise history. It would be the crowning achievement to what has already been a remarkable season. “Boston has a great team. They led the league from wire to wire,” Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said after his team was swept 4-0 in its first conference finals appearance since 2014. “They didn’t want this thing to go on any longer. They blocked shots, they got offensive rebounds, they made key shots.” Boston has excelled in seemingly every possible way in this year’s playoffs. The Celtics have won seven straight games overall, they improved to 6-0 on the road with yet another comeback victory, 105-102 in Game 4 against Indiana, and they are 3-0 in elimination games. They beat Indiana three times down the stretch, rallying in the last two games with decisive 13-2 and 7-0 closing spurts to end the Pacers’ perfect 2024 playoff run at home — and their season. Next up will be the Dallas Mavericks or Minnesota Timberwolves. Dallas leads the Western Conference finals 3-0 and can clinch the series on its home court Tuesday night. And Boston has been finding help in all corners. While Jayson Tatum garnered the usual headlines for two 36-point outings and a near triple-double in Game 4, 37-year-old Al Horford defied the odds by making seven 3-pointers in Game 3, Jrue Holiday overcame an illness to deftly pick Andrew Nembhard’s pocket, and Derrick White delivered the go-ahead 3-pointer in Game 4, everyone seemed genuinely happy it was Jaylen Brown who was chosen series MVP. “I didn’t expect that at all,” Brown said before explaining the emotions of being left off the all-NBA teams. “But as time has gone by and I got to this point, I just stopped caring and I don’t care who sees what as long as my team knows my value, my city knows my value, my family knows my value. That’s all I really care about.” There’s little doubt the Celtics understand where they would be — and where they wouldn’t be — without Brown. He scored 29 points and grabbed six rebounds to help Boston erase an eight-point deficit in the final six minutes Monday night. And after the defense forced two late turnovers, Brown helped close it out with a brilliant block of Nembhard just before White’s big shot. The reaction was telling for Holiday, who won an NBA title with the 2020-21 Milwaukee Bucks. “I think it’s even better that he didn’t expect it. That really means that didn’t matter to him,” Holiday said. “It was about winning and whatever it took, however long it took. That’s what was important to him and I think when you have that mentality and that mindset, you see great people rewarded for the things they do.” Holiday understands. When the Bucks traded him to Portland in September to acquire Damian Lillard, he wasn’t sure what would happen next. Four days later, the Celtics made another deal with the Trail Blazers to get the two-time All-Star and defensive whiz, hoping he could help them complete their championship quest. So far, the Celtics’ investment in Holiday has delivered big dividends. And now everyone’s about to find out if the addition of Holiday and the possible return of starting center Kristaps Porzingis from a strained right calf that has kept him out since April 29 just might help Boston earn another crowning achievement. “Obviously, we fell short of our ultimate goal last year, lost in the conference finals,” Tatum said. “So I think we’ve just applied everything we learned to this season and this postseason and it’s been working really well.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Let's get this part out of the way: Rafael Nadal did not announce his retirement after exiting the French Open in the first round . Nothing else, though, is entirely clear about what comes next for the owner of 22 Grand Slam titles. He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time . “I don’t know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what’s going to happen in the next few months.” He probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies , but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to , or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts. He probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either. As for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but — hey, here's a twist — he wouldn't completely commit to that. So in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants. “Obviously,” Zverev observed, “there are uncertainties.” Obviously. “That’s why I am not saying I am retiring today,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. “In terms of what’s driving me ... I’m a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I’m in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.” So, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take? Why not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family — particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet — some memories to hold onto one day? “If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,” Nadal explained. “I don’t know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see — I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let’s make a decision.” Makes perfect sense. Especially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev. The 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years. “I mean, I was not that far,” Nadal said. “That’s my feeling.” Zverev's assessment: “If he stays healthy, he’s going to continue playing better.” Nadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind. “Give me two months ‘til the Olympics, and then let’s see if I am able to keep going or I say, ’OK, guys, it’s more than enough.' Let’s see,” Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. “I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\" Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

Market Detailed Segmentation: By Type: (Fitness & Nutrition, Menstrual Health, Pregnancy Tracking & Postpartum Care, Menopause, Disease Management, and Others) Market Drivers: Increasing Women Health Awareness and Accessibility of Mobile Apps With the growing focus on women's health issues and empowerment, more women are becoming aware of various aspects related to their health and well-being like menstrual cycle tracking, fertility tracking, pregnancy and post-pregnancy care, contraception, heart health etc. Mobile health apps are making it very convenient for women to access information and track various aspects of their health on their smartphones. This has significantly driven the demand for women health apps. Rising Demand for Period and Fertility Tracking Apps One of the major drivers of the women health app market is the high demand for menstrual cycle and fertility tracking apps. These apps allow women to understand their menstrual cycle, ovulation phases, safe periods, and fertility windows to plan or avoid pregnancy. With busy lifestyles, many women prefer using mobile period tracker apps for convenience over traditional calendar-based tracking methods. The increasing popularity of natural family planning methods is also propelling the demand for fertility awareness and family planning apps. Market Restrain: Privacy and Data Security Concerns Though mobile health apps provide convenience, one of the major restrains in their adoption is privacy and data security concerns. Women are hesitant to use certain health apps that require them to input and store personal and sensitive data like their menstrual dates, fertility details, sexual activity, contraception practices, symptoms experienced etc. on their devices or in the cloud. There is a lack of trust as most women health apps do not have robust privacy policies and security measures in place to protect users' personal data. Any data breach can compromise users' medical records and personal information. This acts as a key restraint for many potential users. Buy This Premium Report and Get Upto 25 % OFF: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/buy-now/5656 Market Opportunity: Increasing Penetration of Wearable Health Devices The rising popularity and adoption of smart wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers present a huge growth opportunity for women health apps. These devices allow tracking of biometrics, physiological data as well as providing app-based experiences directly on the wrist. Women health apps can leverage these wearable platforms to monitor various health parameters specific to females like heart rate, stress levels, sleep patterns, periods, fertility in real-time. Integrating diagnosis and advice directly on smart wearables will help to expand the reach of women health apps, especially among active, health-conscious millennial users. This offers a significant opportunity to boost adoption. Market Trends: Personalized and AI-Powered Health Recommendations One of the major emerging trends in the women health app market is the shift towards highly personalized and AI-powered health recommendations. With the help of machine learning algorithms, apps are now able to analyze users' profile, medical history, symptoms experienced and biometrics to provide hyper-customized guidance, feedbacks, and diagnoses. Apps integrated with virtual health assistants are also gaining popularity as they provide on-demand support based on individual conversations.

        "content": "On Tuesday, UBS increased the price target for shares of Neurocrine (NASDAQ: NBIX ) Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX) to $193 from the previous $174, while reiterating a Buy rating on the stock. The firm's positive outlook is based on several factors, including the steady growth of Ingrezza, a base business product, the anticipated successful launch of crinecerfont in 2025, and significant upcoming read-outs from two major schizophrenia pipeline projects expected in the third quarter. Neurocrine Biosciences' Ingrezza, utilized for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, continues to perform well, contributing to the company's robust financial position. Looking ahead, the firm is optimistic about crinecerfont, a treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is slated for launch in 2025 and is expected to be strong from the start. The UBS analyst's confidence is further bolstered by the potential of two schizophrenia treatments in Neurocrine's pipeline. The firm has conducted an in-depth review of NBI-'568 and luvadaxistat, leading to an increased conviction in the higher risk-adjusted net sales for these assets. For NBI-'568, the firm models $1.3 billion in risk-adjusted peak sales, assuming a 10% market share in the schizophrenia market, which is an increase from the previously estimated 5% market share. Additionally, the firm projects nominal peak sales of $3.2 billion for this treatment. Similarly, for luvadaxistat, UBS has adopted a conservative approach, modeling a 15% probability of success, up from the prior 10%, and doubling the market share estimate to 20% from the previous 10%. This adjustment leads to risk-adjusted peak sales of approximately $770 million and nominal peak sales of around $5.1 billion. The updated $193 price target is supported by an unchanged 6.2 times enterprise value to estimated 2029 sales multiple and is reinforced by a discounted cash flow (DCF) framework. This revised target reflects the firm's anticipation of Neurocrine Biosciences' continued growth and successful market penetration with its developing treatments. InvestingPro Insights As Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX) garners attention with UBS's updated price target and optimistic projections, real-time data from InvestingPro provides a broader financial perspective. With a market capitalization of $14.03 billion and a P/E ratio standing at 37.23, the company's valuation reflects expectations for future growth. The recent revenue growth is impressive, showing a 23.99% increase over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, which aligns with UBS's positive outlook. Additionally, the company's robust gross profit margin of 68.54% underscores its financial health and efficiency. InvestingPro Tips indicate that Neurocrine Biosciences is expected to grow its net income this year, which could further strengthen the company's financial position. However, analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, which suggests some caution may be warranted.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Let's get this part out of the way: Rafael Nadal did not announce his retirement after exiting the French Open in the first round . Nothing else, though, is entirely clear about what comes next for the owner of 22 Grand Slam titles. He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time . “I don’t know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what’s going to happen in the next few months.” He probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies , but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to , or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts. He probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either. As for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but — hey, here's a twist — he wouldn't completely commit to that. So in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants. “Obviously,” Zverev observed, “there are uncertainties.” Obviously. “That’s why I am not saying I am retiring today,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. “In terms of what’s driving me ... I’m a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I’m in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.” So, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take? Why not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family — particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet — some memories to hold onto one day? “If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,” Nadal explained. “I don’t know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see — I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let’s make a decision.” Makes perfect sense. Especially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev. The 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years. “I mean, I was not that far,” Nadal said. “That’s my feeling.” Zverev's assessment: “If he stays healthy, he’s going to continue playing better.” Nadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind. “Give me two months ‘til the Olympics, and then let’s see if I am able to keep going or I say, ’OK, guys, it’s more than enough.' Let’s see,” Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. “I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\" Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

The beautiful Savoy Hotel in Limerick city hosted a Mad Hatters Tea Party for their corporate clients and some of Limerick’s best known faces got an invite, too. It was a magnificent event and so many wonderful people were in attendance, including journalist and former Limerick Leader reporter, Meghann Scully, who is always a joy to be around, and fashion designer Marion Murphy-Cooney, who I adore. The glitz and glam of the night was spectacular and upon arrival, we were treated to a lovely prosecco reception and goodie bags. DJ JP Dillon from Live95 was the MC for the evening, and what a wonderful job he did. Games such as pass the parcel, dancing competitions and guess the song, took place and the fun and laughs that were had were off the charts! Prizes included overnight stays in The Savoy and George, dinner in the Terrace, Hamptons, Vincenzo’s and of course, afternoon tea. Afternoon tea and Skellig gin cocktails were flowing throughout the evening and there was also entertainment from world renowned illusionist, LEON the magician, which partnered perfectly with the theme of the night. It was such a memorable event and one which lived up to its name, as the atmosphere was lighthearted and we were all giddy - which may have had something to do with the delicious cocktails on offer! I look forward to spending another fabulous evening in the five-star Savoy Hotel again soon -XxCelia",

        "description": "New Kutztown store reflects the owner’s passion for gaming, collecting.",
        "content": "After years of collecting video games, systems and a large variety of related items, Paul Herr has channeled his passion for everything video-related into a business. Level Up Video Games opened recently at 13 East Main Street in Kutztown, recognizable by its nostalgia-steeped display window that features a vintage gaming system, Mario Brother figurines, a Nintendo poster, MAD magazines, a Polaroid camera, New Coke cans and a 1987 wall calendar. “I worked hard on that window,” said Herr, who is 55. “I wanted to give people a trip down memory lane.” A visit to the shop, which is known simply as Level Up, was a nostalgic experience for Brittany T., a graduate of Kutztown University who currently lives in Virginia. She spotted an early-model Sega console — the same version she and her brother shared as kids. “My mom entered a contest at the Coventry Mall (North Coventry Township, Chester County) and won a one-year subscription to Sega Channel,” recalled Brittany, who asked that her full name not be used due to concerns about it appearing on the Internet. “That was the first subscription that provided monthly access to about 30 games from the cable company.” She and her brother spent hours gaming, eagerly anticipating the release of every new video game. “That Sega started my whole journey,” said Brittany, who is now in her mid-30s. “I probably have more than 1,000 video games and still play all the time.” Brittany is not alone in her love for video games and related items, Herr said. The store has been busy since it opened with people looking to buy, sell, trade or simply reminisce about their gaming experiences. “I was surprised at how many college-aged kids came to the grand opening,” Herr said. “But I guess that everything old is new again.” Herr held the grand opening for Level Up Video Games on Saturday, May 4. Herr’s love of video games and gaming started when he was in high school in the 1980s and would visit his friends’ homes to play. “The Nintendo entertainment system came out and it was a big deal,” he said. “I didn’t have one at home, but some of my friends did and we played as much as we could.” Herr passed his love of gaming on to his four children, who range in age from 26 to 33. “The kids were little when I found a Nintendo 64 with four controllers,” he recalled. “I took it home and my kids fell in love with it. After that we started collecting anything we could find that was related to video games.” Herr planned to pass along the collection to his children and eight grandchildren, but eventually, with the support of his family, decided to open the store. “At the end of the day, it’s my kids and grandkids I’m doing this for,” Herr reflected. “I want them to be able to share my love of all this and experience the fun of it. It makes me happy that my 10-year-old grandson loves Zelda.” A part-time construction worker and owner of a cabinet shop, Herr was able to build and mount all the shelving and cabinets himself. Level Up is designed to showcase as many items as possible, with more collectibles being added all the time. “I took the whole collection and made a little museum in the store,” he said. Customers can browse among items including various models of Game Boys, Amiibo figurines, Pokémon cards, Super Mario mugs, headphones, lunch boxes, Pez dispensers, T-shirts and other video game-related gear. “I love when people come in and see something that gets them excited or nostalgic,” Herr said. “I want the store to be a fun place where people can stay as long as they want and explore and reminisce.” • Located at 13 E. Main St., Kutztown • Open Thursday, Friday and Saturday from noon until 8 p.m. • Connect on Facebook at Level Up Video Games • Call the shop at 484-926-3650",

        "description": "Steward Health Care failure in Massachusetts predicted by Catholic activists, back in 2010",
        "content": "Lawmakers were well warned more than a decade ago in advance of the current crisis surrounding several Bay State hospitals operated by now-bankrupt Steward Health Care, documents reviewed by the Herald show. The impending summer sale at auction of eight Massachusetts hospitals operated by the Dallas-based healthcare company is the inevitable result of selling the facilities formerly owned by non-profit Caritas Christi Health Care to an entity completely unsuited to running a hospital system, according to R.T. Neary, the former chairman of the Coalition to Save Catholic Health Care. Neary sat down with the Herald this month for an extended interview, during which he shared his written records and explained the efforts he and other hospital volunteers and patients made to warn anyone who would listen that selling hospitals to a venture capital firm would inevitably result in their failure. “The roots of Steward were highly tainted. In fact, they proved to be poisonous,” Neary said. Reporting in 2009 showed that Caritas Christi and the six hospitals it operated were doing better than they had the year before. Even during the financial crisis that marked the end of President George W. Bush’s Administration, and after posting a $20 million loss in the previous fiscal year, they would close out fiscal 2009 with $31 million in operating income. Fairly new to his job, then Caritas CEO Dr. Ralph de la Torre described his efforts to rebuild the struggling hospital system as a genuine tear-down operation; a complete restructuring of how the company managed its businesses. By 2010, credit agency Moody’s thought things were going so well at Caritas, that it upgraded their bond rating, not long after Standard and Poor’s had done the same while noting a 3.6% growth in revenues over the previous year. “Things were looking good,” Neary said. “They had one bad year — one — but things were turning around.” Neary, a former Caritas patient, donor, and volunteer, said that de la Torre seemed like the solution the struggling Catholic hospital system needed, right up until he became the problem. “Dr. Ralph de la Torre, masquerading behind medical credentials, proved to be a business venturer — and an unscrupulous one at that,” Neary said. After his hiring in 2008, his quick turnaround of the business side of the hospital systems, Neary said many in the Catholic community were taken by surprise when de la Torre announced venture capital firm Cerberus would buy the allegedly fiscally unsound hospital network and establish Steward Health Care Systems, LLC., with himself as CEO. “Cerberus is pleased to be making a long-term investment that will help ensure the viability and future success of the Caritas Christi health care system,” said W. Brett Ingersoll, co-director of private equity at Cerberus in a 2010 statement attached to the announcement of a $830 million plan to buy the hospital chain. The plan would need the approval of then Attorney General Martha Coakley and the state’s Department of Public Health, as well as the Archbishop of Boston. Cerberus, which had been in the news before the Caritas deal after their unsuccessful attempt to turn around automaker Chrysler , had never operated a hospital before. Coakley announced in June of 2010 the sale would be subject to six public hearings starting that month, but signaled she was open to the deal . “It’s no wonder,” Neary said. “Dr. de la Torre was raising money for her Senate campaign.” The Attorney General, according to public filings and contemporary reporting, had been the guest of honor at a fundraising event held at de la Torre’s Newton home the year before the Caritas sale was announced. The party had netted her campaign against now-former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown more than $34,000, and de la Torre and his wife each made the maximum personal donation of $2,400 to her . Coakley told the Herald in 2010 that she was thinking about the future when weighing the hospital sale. “What does this mean in the short run, and what does it mean five years, 10 years down the road,” she said then. The deal wasn’t worth the paper it was written on, Neary’s organization told her at length. Assertions about the hospital’s financial health, apparently dire, did not match their new credit ratings, he said. In writings to the AG, Neary expressed concern the system was destined to be torn apart and sold, bit by bit, until the hospitals couldn’t function. “Executives of Cerberus, as was done with GM, Chrysler and other of their organizations, will eliminate or severely curtail unprofitable divisions. With many hospital functions being seen in this category, we can be assured there will be changes,” he wrote to Coakley in a July 2010 letter. Neary, along with other faith-based organizations , wrote to Coakley dozens of times that summer, warning that Cerberus would run the hospitals into the ground. They wrote to the state’s Supreme Judicial Court — which eventually approved the sale — to Sen. Brown, then-Gov. Deval Patrick, the director of the FBI, the Archbishop, and the Pope. Their message, time and again, was the same. Approval of the sale, they wrote, would come “with a heavy monetary cost down the road for the citizenry.” The deal was eventually allowed to go through , at a final cost of $895 million. Neary, now 89-years-old and retired from his career as a high school teacher, was not surprised when it was announced earlier this month that Steward would file for bankruptcy and look to sell most of its dozens of hospitals, including the eight it now operates in Massachusetts. That was always their plan, he said. Steward’s downfall, first signaled this January when their landlords let it be known they were $50 million behind on their rent, could have been prevented, according to Neary. At the very least his letters, held now in a black binder and meticulously organized by date, serve as proof that he was right to be concerned, he said. Unfortunately, no one listened. “We warned them,” Neary said. “A venture capital firm should never have been allowed to buy a non-profit hospital system — a system built on the more than 100 years of patient and community donations. Steward’s hospitals will go up for auction at the end of June and bankruptcy proceedings are still ongoing while the company faces dozens of lawsuits from vendors and employees. Coakley did not return a request for comment.",

        "content": "After getting a day off on Memorial Day to wash away the taste of a loss to end the series in San Diego, the Yankees are back in action up the road in Anaheim. The Angels have had just as poor a season as you’d expect knowing they’d lost Shohei Ohtani, and they represent another good opportunity for the Yankees to win a series. It’ll be Nestor Cortes on the bump tonight against Griffin Canning to try and get the Yankees back in the win column. It’s another late start, so we’ll have plenty to keep you occupied on the site throughout the day. In the morning, I’ll preview the three games in Anaheim, while Peter runs through the games the Yankees’ rivals played on Monday. Also, Jeff writes the latest entry in the 1999 Yankees diary, and Esteban’s At-Bat of the Week features Gleyber Torres, turning things around. New York Yankees vs. Los Angeles Angels Time: 9:38 p.m. ET TV/Online: YES Network, Bally Sports West Radio: WFAN 660/101.9 FM Venue: Angel Stadium, Anaheim, CA 1. If the Yankees had to play a do-or-die game tomorrow, which of their healthy starters would you hand the ball to? 2. Anthony Volpe has racked up 2.6 fWAR so far, and projects to finish with 5.3 fWAR. Would you take the over or under on that number?",

        "content": "A ton of steel – roughly 25,000 tons – will be going into the new Buffalo Bills stadium. If this were another era, there’s a good chance most of it could come from steel mills in the Buffalo Niagara region. But those steel mills closed more than 40 years ago. In fact, there is little to no steel manufactured in mills in New York State anymore. Ironworkers assemble the steel frame of the new Bills stadium under construction in Orchard Park. There are at least 40 steel fabricators throughout New York, employing around 2,000 people, working on the project. That’s forcing the contractors building the $1.7 billion stadium to rely on steel made in other parts of the country for the massive stadium construction project. But state officials also note that there is still plenty of steel work being done by New York firms. They say about 60% of all the structural steel that will be used in building the stadium will be worked on in the state. That means a number of New York companies will play a role in the making, finishing and delivering of the steel used in the stadium, state officials said. But if there are few to no mills manufacturing steel left in the state, including in the once proud steelmaking Buffalo Niagara region, what does that 60% number touted by the state really mean? Essentially most of the companies in the state working on the steel beams for the stadium are custom steel fabricators. A fabricator takes the material from a steel mill and readies it for the worksite through the processes of cutting, bending, welding and assembling. They will take on tasks like figuring out where the bolt holes should be and building them into the steel. Fabricators play a critical role in a project of this size, said Brian Raff, vice president of sustainability for the nonprofit trade organization American Institute of Steel Construction, which represents both steel mills and fabricators. “Many times, the steel mills are only credited for this work, and I understand why that is because some people have never heard of structural steel fabricators, but their role is important in this project,” Raff said. “Most don’t understand the nuances of steelmaking.” The state is working with Cives Steel Co., a national firm headquartered in St. Lawrence, north of the Adirondacks, as the prime contractor for the steel fabrication work. Approximately 12,000 tons of steel – nearly half of what’s being used on the project – will be fabricated by Cives Steel. From the time we first heard of preliminary talks about a new Bills stadium, our team has been there to bring you news about the deal. Catch u... The company is among about a dozen fabricator facilities that are lined up for the stadium project. They also include JPW Structural Contracting in Syracuse and A&T Ironworks in New Rochelle. Local subcontractors working on the steel include Seneca Steel Erectors of West Seneca, Steel Tech Fabricators from Rochester, Huntress Painting of Niagara Falls and Interstate Steel Sales of Orchard Park. At least eight local unions representing laborers, carpenters, teamsters, engineers, plumbers, electricians and cement masons will be on the job while steel is being erected, state officials said. Additionally, Upstate Steel has been pursuing work on the stadium project after state economic development officials reversed their decision to exclude the Hamburg steelmaker from New York’s woman-owned business program. Led by Lauren Chmielowiec, the company’s president, Upstate Steel now operates a warehouse in an old Bethlehem Steel building. The steel these fabricators are working on is all being manufactured in the United States for one of the biggest construction projects ever in Western New York. “We wanted to see domestic steel, and we’re obviously looking for as much of the materials and labor to be as local as possible,” said Steven Ranalli, president of Erie County Stadium Corp., the state entity overseeing the project. About a year into the project, work is now being done on the second level of the new Bills stadium, continuing to rise from “the pit,” the deep hole that was dug to form its foundation. The steel is being used to build the skeleton of the open-air, 1.35 million-square-foot stadium that will seat over 60,000 fans and is expected to be completed before the start of the 2026 season. About a year into the project, work is now being done on the second level of the stadium, continuing to rise from “the pit,” the deep hole that was dug to form its foundation. Steel will go up level by level around the bowl, starting in the northwest corner of the stadium and proceeding to the southeast corner. The final level to be built will be level 5, which will consist of the stadium canopy 200 feet in the air. This summer, state officials expect about 1,500 workers a day will be on site as more steel goes up higher and some of the more detailed work gets underway. “These types of projects are a really big boost for the local economy and certainly New York’s economy,” Raff said. “And by employing all these people to support things like this stadium and critical infrastructure, I think steel fabrication contributes quite a bit to the local and state economies.” There are at least 40 steel fabricators throughout New York, employing around 2,000 people, and they work with many suppliers and other trades, creating additional jobs in these related fields, Raff said. That includes around 85 companies involved in painting the structural steel once it is fabricated, as well as others building in the columns or pillars on the beams, he added. By keeping steel fabrication local, there’s also savings on transportation costs and lowering emissions that come along with moving materials. “New York is a really big contributor to the steel construction environment,” Raff said. “We’re excited to see any high-profile project using structural steel so we’re following the stadium on the edge of our seat.” But overall steel production in New York isn’t what it used to be. These days, the state’s steel production is less than 1 million tons annually, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. That pales in comparison with the nation’s leader in steel production, Indiana, which made more than 21 million tons of steel in 2022, and even the second highest steel producer, Ohio, with over 10 million tons of steel made that year. The steel being used at the stadium includes a green sustainability profile that makes this project environmentally friendly, Raff said. The production process, which no longer lives up to the trope of it being dingy and outdated, uses electric arc furnaces, emitting 75% less carbon dioxide than traditional methods at many foreign mills, he added. It contains mostly recycled material that comes from the steel of decommissioned bridges, buildings, appliances and automobiles. It gets melted down over and over and is continually made into new steel without any loss of durability or strength, Raff said. “It’s a really huge sustainability story for steel and a really good choice for this stadium,” Raff said.

        "content": "From the time Brennan Milone started hitting in high school to draft day 2022, the Athletics watched him closely. “As a staff, we liked him a lot in high school,” A’s scouting director Eric Kubota said. “Our area scout, Jemel Spearman , really liked him and made sure a bunch of us saw him that spring. He’s always had a knack for hitting.” When Milone finished at Georgia’s Woodstock High, the Dodgers drafted him in the 28th round. He chose instead to attend South Carolina, then lost his freshman season to Covid. He returned as a sophomore in 2021 to play 38 games, but he hit just .216 with three homers. Milone transferred to the Oregon in 2022 and again started slugging, batting .337 with 12 homers in 60 games. “I kept an eye on him when he was at South Carolina and then was able to see him at Oregon,” Kubota said. “We were fortunate to have a history with him already. We thought he could hit, and his numbers backed it up, so we took a chance. I’m happy that things are going well so far.” 2 Hits, 2 Homers for the RockHounds! Brennan Milone with a solo shot! pic.twitter.com/S3dDRGCzof The A’s drafted Milone as a third baseman in the sixth round in 2022. Last year at two Class A levels, he hit .285/.398/.488 with 17 homers and 72 walks in 114 games. Through 40 games at Double-A Midland this year, the 23-year-old Milone hit .273/.368/.434 with five homers and 20 walks. “His bat has carried him to Double-A,” A’s farm director Ed Sprague said. “He’s really been an on-base guy as well. Power can be the last thing to come, and that will be the separator for him.” The biggest question for Milone will be position. A high school shortstop, he played third base and first base in college. He has played mostly first as a pro. “(Midland manager) Gregorio Petit says he can play third,” Sprague said. “It’s mostly about him gaining the confidence to do it.” A’s ACORNS — Injuries have slowed two of the Athletics’ top shortstop prospects. Double-A Midland’s Jacob Wilson went down with knee tendinitis after a torrid start to the season. Triple-A Las Vegas’ Max Muncy got hit in the hand and needed time off. — Righthander Cole Miller , drafted in the fourth round last year out of high school, continues to recover from Tommy John surgery he had this spring.

        "content": "Cicadas are all the buzz and the emergence of two broods simultaneously is a natural wonder not to be missed. To embrace the cicada craze, people have been finding ways to make the most of this free and nutritious food source. Yes, you read that correctly ... cicadas can be eaten and taste good! They are related to shrimp and lobster so if you enjoy these, you may enjoy their land-dwelling relative. Bogdonas I had the chance to collaborate with my horticulture colleagues on a recipe tasting event in Springfield, Illinois, and the food was a huge hit. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that cooked cicadas taste and smell like asparagus with a hint of sesame. I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity to try something new while supplies last. They provide nutritional value. Cicadas, like other edible insects, are rich in protein, unsaturated fat and contain a variety of vitamins and minerals. Specific nutrient values are dependent on factors such as species, diet, and developmental stage. When is the best time to find cicadas? Just after sunset cicadas can be found crawling up vertical surfaces (trees, fences, etc.). This is also a common time for them to molt their outer shell (teneral stage). Tenerals are white and considered best for eating because their adult shells have not hardened. After that happens, the wings and legs can be removed before cooking if desired. See recipe below for more information. Safety considerations before you chow down: Frozen cicadas can be stored in the freezer for up to a year for best quality. Remember to blanch (see steps on blanching below in step #2) for one minute before using in recipes. They can serve as a replacement for meat or as a healthy protein option added to baked goods. Cicada's can provide an alternative source of protein, such as on pizza. Ingredients: Directions: 1. Wash hands with soap and water. Preheat oven to 425°F. 2. To prepare cicadas: Remove frozen cicadas from freezer and de-wing (If using tenerals, you do not need to de-wing). After de-winging the cicadas, they must be blanched for a minute in boiling water (salting optional). This step will not only defrost the cicada, but it will also remove any unwanted dirt on their exterior, and kill any harmful pathogens found on and within the cicada. 3. Spoon pesto over the naan bread. Spread the mozzarella evenly over the pesto. Artfully arrange the sundried tomatoes and artichoke hearts over the cheese. Add the blanched and towel dried cicadas to the pizzas (8 on each). 4. Top with shredded parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil. Bake for 15 minutes, or until desired doneness. 5. Wait 17 years and repeat steps 1-4.

        "content": "Sri Lanka’s tea producers condemned a government order to increase wages by 70%, saying it would make their tea globally uncompetitive and reduce dollar earnings essential for the island nation to emerge from a financial crisis. The $1.3 billion industry produces popular Ceylon Tea and employs about 615,000 workers. The island annually exports about 95% of the 250 million kilos of tea it produces. The government has ordered worker salaries be increased to 1,700 rupees ($5.66) per day from 1,000 rupees, which the industry says will increase tea production costs by 45%. The fallout from Sri Lanka’s protracted financial crisis, caused by a severe shortfall of foreign exchange in 2022, has also hit the tea industry, quadrupling fertiliser, fuel and power costs, the Planters’ Association of Ceylon (PAoC) said. “This is unsustainable and unfair. This decision was made without proper consultation and will result in the quality of Sri Lanka’s tea declining,” PAoC spokesperson Roshan Rajadurai told reporters. “Sri Lanka’s key rivals, India and Kenya, have lower prices and higher productivity.” The industry must start paying the salary increase from next month, Sri Lanka’s Labour Ministry said on Sunday, warning that plantation companies refusing to comply could be taken over by the government. Implementing the wage hike will cost plantation companies an additional 35 billion rupees, the association said. Plantation companies and worker unions have been negotiating for months to increase salaries, which unions contend is essential as Sri Lanka’s financial crisis plunged around a quarter of the population into poverty in 2023.

        "content": "The Orioles’ recent player development success has been defined by the aptitude of their high draft picks. Outfielder Matthew Etzel might end up blazing the trail for later picks making an impact. The Orioles drafted him in the 10th round last year out of Southern Mississippi. He has done nothing but hit since signing. Through 40 games this season, Etzel hit .298/.389/.461 with four home runs and 23 stolen bases for High-A Aberdeen. “The hit tool itself is really elite,” Aberdeen hitting coach Zach Cole said. “He’s just really good at finding the barrel on any pitch types.” WAVE IT BYE-BYE! Matthew Etzel tacks on an insurance run with a solo homer of his own! IronBirds lead 4-0 in the 8th pic.twitter.com/bg57MosVuO Whether taken early in the draft or on the later side, Etzel has many of the traits the Orioles favor in their hitting prospects: athleticism, bat-to-ball ability and a knack for finding the barrel. Part of his developmental plan to further harness that is relatively common for players who can get to pitches all over the zone, with a focus on not swinging at pitches he can’t drive. “That will come with making better swing decisions in time as well—not to say his are poor,” Cole said. “But at times he can get exploited because he knows he has that good hit tool where he can just pepper one over there. “But as pitching continues to level up, as he grows levels, they’re going to be able to exploit that a little more and he might have to refine that.” High-A has typically been a place where that growth is solidified in the Orioles’ system in recent years. A challenging diet of pregame work focusing on different pitch shapes and movement profiles helps hitters develop plans on how to hit offerings of a quality level they may not see until the high minors. The success stories from that developmental track aren’t lost on anyone, from Gunnar Henderson and Colton Cowser to Coby Mayo . “We use a ton of examples from the past,” Cole said. “You’ve seen guys like Coby Mayo need to make some better decisions at the plate, just continuing to attack that.”",

        "description": "Attempts to tackle Sydney’s housing crisis are being undermined by the failure of developers to start work on projects that have building approval.",
        "content": "Attempts to tackle the nation’s housing crisis are being undermined by the failure to complete dwellings over the past five years. In Sydney, it is being exacerbated further by the failure of developers to even start work on projects that have been granted building approvals. In a curious juxtaposition, construction of thousands of new Sydney homes has stalled despite the city’s deepening rental crisis as soaring building costs, supply problems, tradesmen shortages and interest rates put residential projects on hold. The Herald’ s Matt Wade reports that more than 11,000 homes around Sydney were approved but not yet commenced in December, which was 8 per cent higher than the five-year December average. About 80 per cent of the total were townhouses and apartments, prime rental market properties. According to a new report by KPMG, the number of new dwellings approved across NSW but not commenced jumped from 13,765 in the March quarter of 2023 to 15,593 by the December quarter. Despite population increase fuelling the demands by both buyers and renters, dwelling construction has been hit by a perfect storm of constraints on activity. In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions significantly limited the sector’s ability to respond to increasing demand, which was partly linked to the HomeBuilder program for first home buyers and eligible owner-occupiers. Materials, fixtures and fittings, and skilled labour, especially in finishing trades, were in short supply and shipping delays significantly extended build timelines. Pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and competition for resources from other types of construction have pushed up prices significantly, by nearly 40 per cent since late 2019. Reserve Bank of Australia assistant governor Sarah Hunter, addressing a conference in Hobart earlier this month on housing market cycles in the building sector, said that the building industry had navigated the temporary disruption created by the pandemic but was now facing weaker demand and dwelling approvals were the lowest in decades. In Sydney, the rise in the number of projects approved but still on hold leads to the conclusion that some developers have delayed projects because of the relatively high cost of building when compared with the project’s returns. What’s to be done to liberate these lifelines to the housing crisis? Since coming to power, the Minns government has attempted to address the housing crisis by “rebalancing housing growth” across NSW with a focus on well-located homes close to transport, jobs and existing infrastructure. Eight Sydney transport hubs have been selected for accelerated rezoning aimed at delivering 47,800 new high and mid-rise homes and rezoned locations across NSW, allowing for 138,000 new homes to be created within 400 metres of metro or suburban rail stations and town centres. Minns has also pledged to change the rules to allow flat-building in all residential zonings. While welcome, most of these proposals could take up to 15 years to bear fruit. That is a long way off but the 11,000 plus homes put on hold by developers are a low-hanging and quick fix. Initiatives that streamline approvals and build processes will reduce costs and ultimately lift supply and the Minns government should consider what sort of leverage it can exert on recalcitrant developers to start work on the properties that have received building approvals. A suggestion from the mayor of North Sydney, Zoe Baker, that the Minns government could offer residential builders a financial guarantee to ensure approved projects are completed quickly is worthy of consideration. Such a proposal raises the possibility that developers could be persuaded to build additional social housing as part of the deal and has the advantage of incentive rather than big stick.

Now, the 2021 pick is thriving at Double-A.The post Yankees’ Ben Cowles Alters Routine And Sees Results appeared first on College Baseball, MLB Draft, Prospects - Baseball America.",
        "content": "At least so far, the impact of the Yankees’ 2021 draft class has been felt more in terms of who it has netted them in trades. Perhaps 24-year-old shortstop Ben Cowles will be the one to change that. The Yankees have traded six of their top nine picks from 2021, including first-rounder Trey Sweeney , second-rounder Brendan Beck and emerging ninth-rounder Chandler Champlain . Of those drafted in the first two days, only Brock Selvidge , Tyler Hardman , Will Warren and Cowles remain in the organization. While the righthander Warren got the majority of the attention this spring, it is Cowles, a 10th-rounder from Maryland, who remains on a steady track to the big leagues. The 6-foot, 180-pound Cowles has had a breakout start at Double-A Somerset. Through 43 games, he hit .320/.406/.527 with four home runs. According to Cowles, his brief stint at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre last year, where he was sent for the last week of the season, showed him the adjustments necessary for the higher levels. “Just being able to experience that firsthand, where it was like, ‘Wow, my swing doesn’t play here. I have to change something.’ Going through those struggles helped me out a lot,” Cowles said. “I got the chance to talk to the Triple-A guys, and we went through my routine and things I could get better at. And I took that new routine and took it to the (Arizona) Fall League, and it worked out pretty well.” Primarily a shortstop, Cowles has also played second base and third base this season, just as he did in the AFL last year. That versatility could help make him a priority callup if the Yankees need emergency infield help.",

        "content": "Can you imagine? They want $20 for a 12-year-old kid to get into the zoo. Larry Beahan remembers when the Buffalo Zoo was free. When I was 12, the zoo was free for everyone. We kids lived close enough to walk to Delaware Park and we often visited the zoo, particularly in the summertime. We always checked on Eddy the chimp, the polar bears and the elephant. Watching the seals glide across their pool and leap out of the water onto a cement slab was a cooling, thrilling sight, almost as much of a thrill as watching the lion yawn on those hot summer days. One of my best memories is also one of the stupidest things I did as a kid. A few times, I took a book along to the zoo and when I tired of watching the animals, I climbed up the stone divider between the bear caves and lay down on the ledge above the polar bears to read in that secret, adventurous place. Thinking of it now, that adventure may be a good argument for pricing the zoo out of the range of a Buffalo News delivery boy, as I was then. The rest of the park was also free, including the Historical Society (now History Museum) and the Albright Art Gallery (now AKG). Sometimes we would walk the extra distance across the golf course and the Delaware Avenue bridge with the hope of seeing the apostles come marching out of the old mechanical clock in the Historical Society or view the dioramas of Seneca villages and the gun collection, sufficient to arm a rebellion. The art gallery with its statues and paintings was a wonder through which we wandered with big eyes and little understanding. Mom enrolled my sister, Marge, in watercolor classes there on Saturday mornings. I think that might even have been free. Saturday mornings we would ride the #23 streetcar, for 3 cents apiece, down Fillmore to Northampton. We’d get out there and walk past my Gramma’s house up to the Buffalo Museum of Science. It, too, was free, and we wandered the halls passing the Rosetta Stone, the giant four-story pendulum and the dodo bird, to mention just a few of the marvels. Then we would assemble in the museum auditorium for Mrs. Weyerhaeuser’s free story hour. She would never fail to entertain and probably to educate us, though we had no idea we were being educated. We topped the museum visit with a 5-cent serving of the best mashed potatoes and gravy in the world served in the cafeteria. We’d stop at Gramma’s on the way home for a baloney sandwich and a hug. But back to Delaware Park. There was a grove of chestnut trees to the left of the Jewett Parkway entrance. We collected a grocery bag full of nuts there every year. We made a game of stringing one on a shoelace and hitting it with another on a shoelace ; the winner survived the collision . A little further in that direction was a quarry. It was 15 or 20 feet deep, 100 or 200 yards long, lined with shrubs and small trees along a path. A stone bridge arched over it, for the convenience of golfers. We kids needed no bridge. We climbed the trees or the rocky cliffs themselves to ascend the quarry wall. It was a great disappointment when I returned to Buffalo after eight years away and discovered the quarry was filled in with debris from the Route 198 project. I wanted to bring my kids there for a taste of my youthful adventures. Neither bears nor entrance fees would have hindered us.

        "content": "Greensboro and Guilford County elected officials are considering whether to approve performance-based incentive packages for what is known as “Project Mercury” for an industrial property in east Greensboro. The county Board of Commissioners appears to be the first to consider the economic-development project with a public hearing set for 5:30 p.m. June 6 in the Old County Courthouse at 301 W. Market St. in Greensboro. The unidentified company behind Project Mercury is requesting up to $373,855 in incentives from the county. It also is making incentive requests from Greensboro City Council and the N.C. Commerce Department, the latter involved because the company is considering locations out of North Carolina. In exchange, the company would commit to a $26.94 million capital investment and 80 jobs, both by Dec. 31, 2028, at 3617 McConnell Road. People are also reading... The prospective Class A industrial building is in McConnell Business Park and is being marketed for lease, along with 3655 McConnell Road, by the Triad office of CBRE. The 3617 McConnell building contains 104,629 square feet. The 3655 McConnell property features 120,368 square feet, while there is a proposed third building under consideration at 140,273 square feet. The site became available as an industrial site in June 2022 when a Cincinnati industrial real-estate firm paid $2.33 million to purchase a combined 35.88 acres. The properties were a 29.8-acre tract at 3635 McConnell Road and a 6.02-acre tract at 3617 McConnell Road. The buyer was McConnell Road Industrial I LLC, an affiliate of Al. Neyer of Cincinnati, which entered the North Carolina market in 2019 with an office in Raleigh. Al. Neyer’s listing of the McConnell property touts neighboring Coca-Cola, Vistar and Walmart facilities. “Central North Carolina has been the epicenter of a string of recent job announcements from major manufacturers, such as Toyota, Boom Supersonic, VinFast and Wolfspeed,” according to the listing. “The companies have unveiled plans to construct advanced manufacturing facilities that will employ more than 13,000 people. “The projects are expected to drive significant ancillary activity among suppliers and support industries, fueling future demand for industrial space across central North Carolina, including Greensboro.” Al. Neyer also lists Buckhorn Industrial Park in Mebane and Haw River Industrial Park in Graham among its other eight N.C. developments. rcraver@wsjournal.com 336-727-7376 @rcraverWSJ Get the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly. {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.",

        "description": "Down rounds rose from seven percent in 2022 to 31 percent last year.The post Fading 2023 VC performance underscores Canadian tech market’s “vulnerability,” BDC reports first appeared on BetaKit.",
        "content": "Last year marked a “repeat year of recalibration” for Canada’s venture capital (VC) market as the industry continues to normalize following a , according to a study from the investment arm of the Business Development Bank of Canada ( ). Per BDC Capital’s latest Canadian VC landscape report, which was released today, 2023 also saw softening returns amid a proliferation of down rounds (a round of financing at a lower valuation than a company’s previous round) and markdowns for Canadian technology firms. As by the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (CVCA), BDC noted that $6.9 billion CAD in VC funding was invested across 660 deals during 2023—declines of 34 percent and 12 percent year-over-year, respectively, as overall activity continued to return to pre-2020 levels. “After seeing VC activity come down from record levels in 2021 and witnessing interest rates reach new highs in 2023, the Canadian VC community was understandably feeling bleak last year,” the report states. “The numbers reported here, while not grim, underscore the ecosystem’s vulnerability.” As interest rates rose to the highest levels since 2001, there was pessimism heading into 2023. BDC’s charted declining VC activity, economic growth, and a “gloomy outlook.” But despite some cracks, BDC’s latest study found that this “worst-case scenario” did not come to pass. According to the report, 2023 “showcased both signs of resilience and fragility—some cautious optimism is warranted but must be tempered by persistent fundraising challenges and subdued returns.” The insights are based on analysis of data from CVCA, BDC, and PitchBook. BDC noted that macroeconomic headwinds have led to greater caution among VC fund limited partners (LPs) and general partners (GPs). In particular, “heightened diligence and caution” on the part of LPs has had an impact on Canadian GPs and tech entrepreneurs. LP influence has promoted discipline and improved standards among GPs and raised their expectations for portfolio companies, BDC claims. Amid a challenging fundraising environment, BDC reported that many VC fund GPs have not been able to achieve their first-close or final-close targets or raise funds at all. Across the board, fundraising is taking longer, the report found. The report also found that VC returns declined. In 2023, 10-year internal rates of return (IRR) for Canadian VC funds decreased to 11.7 percent, following a similar downward trajectory as United States (US) VC returns, while continuing to “gradually narrow the gap between the two countries’ long-term performance.” Meanwhile, BDC found that the one-year VC IRR for Canada dropped into negative territory, falling by more than 11 percent, “largely influenced by valuation corrections following the exuberance of 2021.” Contributing factors include an increase in down rounds and proactive adjustments by GPs. One-year IRR for VC globally also fell by a comparable amount in 2023, clocking in at the lowest among all private-capital asset classes. Ten-year VC net returns also dropped slightly but stayed in double digits last year at above 11 percent, while some vintages were also hit harder than others, the report found. For its part, the median distributed to paid-in capital improved across all vintages in 2023 save for 2020–2022, which remains young. The proportion of down rounds last year had an impact on these figures. Down rounds rose from seven percent in 2022 to 31 percent in 2023. BDC also found that in 2023, median cash runways got shorter, bridge financings declined, and venture debt funding lost steam. However, compared with global VC investment, Canadian VC experienced a slower decline in terms of total dollars invested in 2023. Per BDC, late and growth-stage investments were hit hard last year both in Canada and globally. VC put into late-stage Canadian companies was almost cut in half in 2023 relative to 2022, while the late-stage deal count dropped by 19 percent. By dollars invested, early-stage VC saw a smaller decline than later and growth stages. Sector-wise, the BDC reported that the life sciences and energy and clean technology (ECT) sectors demonstrated some strength in 2023. While the information and communication technology (ICT) sector still accounts for “the lion’s share” of VC investment, Canada has notably seen a “slight reallocation and increased investor interest” in life sciences and ECT, which both drew a larger share of total VC dollars invested last year than in 2022. At the same time, BDC identified “considerable gaps” at both the earliest and latest stages in the life sciences and energy and ECT in terms of active private Canadian VC funds backing pre-seed, seed, late VC, and growth equity-stage companies. The initial public market offering (IPO) market remained cool as only one Canadian VC-backed company— —went public via IPO in 2023, noted BDC. Meanwhile, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) reached record-high exit values last year, driven by a few large deals, including , , , and . For the second consecutive year, the report found over half of VC transactions in Canada included foreign participation. This indicates that investors from other countries, including the US, continued to consider Canadian VC an attractive asset class amid current market conditions. BDC estimates that Canadian-headquartered VC investors hold $10.4 billion in dry powder, or committed but unallocated capital. Citing PitchBook, BDC reported that as of last year, US VCs were sitting on a record $421 billion in dry powder. Speaking to the outlook for Canada’s VC market in 2024, BDC believes this data “reveals the possibility for slight optimism,” but acknowledged that challenges remain. “As the industry looks to demonstrate enduring profitability, the bar for new investment will be raised,” stated the report, which added that Canadian tech companies and GPs that are unable to meet these expectations will continue to face difficulties fundraising. If annual VC returns continue to drop for another year, BDC anticipates that average five-year and 10-year returns will likely drop to single digits. If that happens, BDC expects some institutional investors to reallocate more of their VC dollars to other asset classes. The report ultimately expressed hope that the Canadian VC market is returning to “a point of sustainable growth.” If anticipated interest-rate cuts come to fruition this year, BDC noted that M&A activity may increase, and the lower cost of capital may help sustain current VC activity.",

        "content": "A ton of steel – roughly 25,000 tons – will be going into the new Buffalo Bills stadium. If this were another era, there’s a good chance most of it could come from steel mills in the Buffalo Niagara region. But those steel mills closed more than 40 years ago. In fact, there is little to no steel manufactured in mills in New York State anymore. Ironworkers assemble the steel frame of the new Bills stadium under construction in Orchard Park. There are at least 40 steel fabricators throughout New York, employing around 2,000 people, working on the project. That’s forcing the contractors building the $1.7 billion stadium to rely on steel made in other parts of the country for the massive stadium construction project. But state officials also note that there is still plenty of steel work being done by New York firms. They say about 60% of all the structural steel that will be used in building the stadium will be worked on in the state. That means a number of New York companies will play a role in the making, finishing and delivering of the steel used in the stadium, state officials said. But if there are few to no mills manufacturing steel left in the state, including in the once proud steelmaking Buffalo Niagara region, what does that 60% number touted by the state really mean? Essentially most of the companies in the state working on the steel beams for the stadium are custom steel fabricators. A fabricator takes the material from a steel mill and readies it for the worksite through the processes of cutting, bending, welding and assembling. They will take on tasks like figuring out where the bolt holes should be and building them into the steel. Fabricators play a critical role in a project of this size, said Brian Raff, vice president of sustainability for the nonprofit trade organization American Institute of Steel Construction, which represents both steel mills and fabricators. “Many times, the steel mills are only credited for this work, and I understand why that is because some people have never heard of structural steel fabricators, but their role is important in this project,” Raff said. “Most don’t understand the nuances of steelmaking.” The state is working with Cives Steel Co., a national firm headquartered in St. Lawrence, north of the Adirondacks, as the prime contractor for the steel fabrication work. Approximately 12,000 tons of steel – nearly half of what’s being used on the project – will be fabricated by Cives Steel. Your guide to the road to a new Bills stadium The company is among about a dozen fabricator facilities that are lined up for the stadium project. They also include JPW Structural Contracting in Syracuse and A&T Ironworks in New Rochelle. Local subcontractors working on the steel include Seneca Steel Erectors of West Seneca, Steel Tech Fabricators from Rochester, Huntress Painting of Niagara Falls and Interstate Steel Sales of Orchard Park. At least eight local unions representing laborers, carpenters, teamsters, engineers, plumbers, electricians and cement masons will be on the job while steel is being erected, state officials said. Additionally, Upstate Steel has been pursuing work on the stadium project after state economic development officials reversed their decision to exclude the Hamburg steelmaker from New York’s woman-owned business program. Led by Lauren Chmielowiec, the company’s president, Upstate Steel now operates a warehouse in an old Bethlehem Steel building. The steel these fabricators are working on is all being manufactured in the United States for one of the biggest construction projects ever in Western New York. “We wanted to see domestic steel, and we’re obviously looking for as much of the materials and labor to be as local as possible,” said Steven Ranalli, president of Erie County Stadium Corp., the state entity overseeing the project. About a year into the project, work is now being done on the second level of the new Bills stadium, continuing to rise from “the pit,” the deep hole that was dug to form its foundation. The steel is being used to build the skeleton of the open-air, 1.35 million-square-foot stadium that will seat over 60,000 fans and is expected to be completed before the start of the 2026 season. About a year into the project, work is now being done on the second level of the stadium, continuing to rise from “the pit,” the deep hole that was dug to form its foundation. Steel will go up level by level around the bowl, starting in the northwest corner of the stadium and proceeding to the southeast corner. The final level to be built will be level 5, which will consist of the stadium canopy 200 feet in the air. This summer, state officials expect about 1,500 workers a day will be on site as more steel goes up higher and some of the more detailed work gets underway. “These types of projects are a really big boost for the local economy and certainly New York’s economy,” Raff said. “And by employing all these people to support things like this stadium and critical infrastructure, I think steel fabrication contributes quite a bit to the local and state economies.” There are at least 40 steel fabricators throughout New York, employing around 2,000 people, and they work with many suppliers and other trades, creating additional jobs in these related fields, Raff said. That includes around 85 companies involved in painting the structural steel once it is fabricated, as well as others building in the columns or pillars on the beams, he added. By keeping steel fabrication local, there’s also savings on transportation costs and lowering emissions that come along with moving materials. “New York is a really big contributor to the steel construction environment,” Raff said. “We’re excited to see any high-profile project using structural steel so we’re following the stadium on the edge of our seat.” But overall steel production in New York isn’t what it used to be. These days, the state’s steel production is less than 1 million tons annually, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. That pales in comparison with the nation’s leader in steel production, Indiana, which made more than 21 million tons of steel in 2022, and even the second highest steel producer, Ohio, with over 10 million tons of steel made that year. The steel being used at the stadium includes a green sustainability profile that makes this project environmentally friendly, Raff said. The production process, which no longer lives up to the trope of it being dingy and outdated, uses electric arc furnaces, emitting 75% less carbon dioxide than traditional methods at many foreign mills, he added. It contains mostly recycled material that comes from the steel of decommissioned bridges, buildings, appliances and automobiles. It gets melted down over and over and is continually made into new steel without any loss of durability or strength, Raff said. “It’s a really huge sustainability story for steel and a really good choice for this stadium,” Raff said.

        "content": "FARGO — The two most important names in meteorology and weather forecasting are Vilhelm Bjerknes and Edward Lorenz. In the early 1920s, the Norwegian Bjerknes developed the concept of a low pressure system forming as a disturbance along a zone of temperature contrast, with extended boundaries between contrasting air masses emanating from the low. He called them fronts after similar military boundaries in World War I. Edward Lorenz was a American mathematician and meteorologist who developed the method of using computers to solve systems of differential equations to forecast weather. He famously showed the issue with numerical prediction in a 1964 paper which showed that tiny changes to initial conditions in these equations would lead to massive changes over time. That is why even today’s very fast weather computers can reasonably predict weather short term, but are incapable of accurately predicting weather changes several weeks away.",

        "description": "The ads from the Canada Action Coalition breached five clauses of Canada's code for advertising standards. Among other things, the ads were found to be inaccurate and deceptive.",
        "content": "Canada’s advertising regulatory body has unanimously determined a campaign stating B.C. liquefied natural gas “will reduce global emissions” distorted the true meaning of scientific and professional statements, and in the end, amounted to “greenwashing.” The Ad Standards Canada case centred around a series of billboard, newspaper and transit advertisements produced by the Canada Action Coalition, a self-described “grassroots” organization that advocates for the development of natural resources like oil and gas. Glacier Media reviewed the confidential decision and correspondence confirming the non-governmental industry group had come to its decision. Leah Temper, health and economic policy program director at the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), said her organization knows of at least 18 complaints filed with the national body. “We’re seeing this flood of disinformation campaigns coming from the oil and gas industry,” said Temper. “They have millions of dollars to spread disinformation. We have very little means to counteract it, contest it.” Canada Action doesn't fully disclose where it gets its funding, but Temper pointed to public filings that show the group has spent more than $5 million on advertising between 2017 and 2022, while receiving over $7 million in corporate sponsorships. Calvin Sandborn, former legal director at the University of Victoria’s Environmental Law Centre, described the Ads Standards decision as “enormously significant,” and follows a string of rulings in Europe, New Zealand and the United Kingdom that found gas companies made misleading statements about their products. “It’s really significant in the larger context of showing how misleading so much of the promotion of fossil fuels is,” he said. Ads Council ruling cites 'greenwashing' In its transit ad, Canada Action also claimed “The world is asking for Canadian Energy,” the word Canadian represented with a flag. Newspaper ads, meanwhile, came with explanations on “how B.C. LNG projects will reach the goals of sustainability, affordability and reliability.” “Council unanimously determined that the evidence provided by the advertiser was insufficient to support the absolute claim that ‘B.C. LNG will reduce global emissions,’” says the decision. “Rather the evidence submitted to Ad Standards indicated that LNG could reduce emissions if only taking into consideration the off setting of transitioning from coal to gas.” In its determination, the council found the added information in the newspaper ads “did not change the overall misleading impression conveyed by the prominent absolute claim that B.C. LNG is food for the environment” and amounted to “greenwashing” — the practice of using false, misleading or unsubstantiated environmental claims to create an impression that a product or service is ‘greener’ than it really is. The ads from Canada Action were found to be in breach of five clauses of the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards , including making inaccurate, deceptive or otherwise misleading claims; omitting relevant information to deceive or mislead; and failing to back up claims with competent and reliable evidence. One of the clauses the group was found to have breached states: “Advertisements must not distort the true meaning of statements made by professionals or scientific authorities.” Ad Standards Canada was not immediately available for comment. Canada Action’s Cody Battershill said his group’s advertising is “grounded in facts” and that it has appealed the decision. In a written statement, he said Canadian LNG exports “can reduce global emissions by backing out [of] higher-carbon alternatives.” “Switching from coal to natural gas for power and heat generation is a clear win for the global environment, with examples in Canada, the U.S., and elsewhere globally showing just how tangible these emissions reductions are,” his statement said in part. Ads still running despite breaches According to Sandborn and Temper, the watchdog body does not have the regulatory power to punish breaches of advertising standards, but it sends out calls to halt and recall false advertising. But in the months since the Jan. 30 Ads Canada decision, CAPE says Canada Action has continued its LNG advertising campaign across B.C. and Ontario. Some of those ads have appeared on billboards and public transit while others have been featured on the radio and in major newspapers. In late April and early May, Canada Action repeated the same already censured ads — “THE WORLD IS ASKING FOR CANADA’S LNG” and “B.C. LNG WILL REDUCE GLOBAL EMISSIONS” — both in full, front-page ads in the Times Colonist. While forest fires, aggravated by drought and #climatechange , burn in B.C. ... This is the front page of Victoria’s daily newspaper. Pyromania is rampant. ⁦ @ SethDKlein ⁩ #climate pic.twitter.com/RROJxFFR7e — Simon Dalby (@GeopolSimon) April 27, 2024 “Ads Standards would ask them to take down the ads. But the whole process is confidential and not transparent,” said Temper. “We don’t know what was said. All we know is they continue to run these ads.” In March 2023, in a submission to the federal government around its push to modernize the Competition Act, Sandborn and his former team at UVic traced decades of deceptive advertising by oil and gas companies. “A few years ago, industry was playing along, saying we’re going to do this [climate change] stuff. Now, there definitely seems to be an uptick\" in deceptive advertising, he said. Sandborn said companies and advocates for industry write ad campaigns to leave an impression, and to convince people that environmental products are green. “But if things that are not green are misleadingly advertised, there's no way consumers can distinguish between what's actually green and what's not green,” he said. “It absolutely destroys the ability to harness the market to protect the environment.”",

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- Cortechs.ai, a market leader in the quantitative imaging space for over a decade with their flagship product NeuroQuant, is now formally expanding beyond neuroradiology with the widespread commercialization of their prostate MRI solution, OnQ Prostate. OnQ Prostate is FDA-cleared post-processing software that aids radiologists in their interpretation of prostate MRI by supporting improved detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. This is accomplished using an advanced diffusion-weighted imaging method called Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI), exclusively licensed to Cortechs.ai. RSI, initially developed for brain cancer and utilized in NeuroQuant Brain Tumor, increases the conspicuity and specificity of restricted diffusion, a hallmark characteristic of aggressive cancer cells. Studies on RSI in the prostate have shown improved MR-based cancer detection and correlation with underlying histopathology compared to conventional imaging. Up until now, use of OnQ Prostate has been limited to a small number of top-tier academic institutions and imaging centers to validate clinical utility and gather feedback. Now, with the latest version of the software recently released, Cortechs.ai is excited to begin actively selling through its established commercial channel. \"This announcement is an important step in increasing the awareness and accessibility of OnQ Prostate beyond its earliest adopters, so that more physicians and patients can benefit from this technology,\" says , who was recently named the Head of Prostate Business Development at Cortechs.ai. Beyond the radiology value propositions of improved PI-RADS accuracy, inter-reader agreement, and workflow efficiency, OnQ Prostate also makes it easier for non-radiologists to interpret and interact with the images after the exam. For example, urologists may use OnQ Prostate images to assist in patient-selection for biopsy and treatment, planning of those procedures, and simplified communication with their patients. OnQ Prostate has the imminent potential to elevate multiple clinical workflows that use MRI throughout the prostate cancer care pathway from initial screening to after treatment, bridging the gaps between radiologists, referring physicians, and patients. \"We are consistently striving to be at the forefront of innovation and bringing best in class value to our users and patients. Our OnQ Prostate product continues to showcase this focus. We are going beyond the brain and utilizing our RSI technology to those focused on diagnosing and treating patients with prostate cancer,\" said , CEO of Cortechs.ai. \"Patients and users deserve to have a more specific and efficient technology that will allow for diagnosis and subsequent treatments to happen. We couldn't be more excited to launch our technology into the market!\" In addition to advancements in prostate imaging, Cortechs.ai continues to innovate in other areas. The company recently announced the release of NeuroQuant® v5.0, currently FDA 510(k) pending. The latest update to NeuroQuant® expands its capabilities to include the identification and evaluation of cerebral microhemorrhages on susceptibility-sensitive MRI sequences. This update is designed to benefit patients with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI), Cerebral Amyloid Deposition Diseases including Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as those with Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA). Cortechs.ai is a pioneering company in medical imaging software, dedicated to enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient outcomes through innovative technology. With a focus on delivering advanced solutions for neuroimaging and oncology, Cortechs.ai leverages cutting-edge research and development to provide clinicians with the tools they need for better diagnosis and treatment planning.

        "description": "The nursing student says he wasn't even participating in the protest.",
        "content": "A nursing student arrested during a May 4 anti-war protest at the University of Virginia is still being denied access to Grounds, a prohibition that has already cost him a job and could result in him failing his academic program. A total of 27 people were arrested when Virginia State Police broke up an encampment of protesters opposed to Israel's monthslong war with Palestinian terror group Hamas, which has killed tens of thousands of people since Hamas launched a surprise attack on the country on Oct. 7. That total arrest number includes some who say they were never part of the protest but were in the area of the encampment when state police arrived. UVa issued all 27 who were arrested \"no trespass\" orders, or NTOs, preventing them from legally returning to Grounds. Most of those orders have since been lifted or modified. Mustafa Abdelhamid’s has not. Piedmont Virginia Community College nursing student Mustafa Abdelhamid sits in his apartment in Charlottesville on Friday, May 24, 2024. Abdelhamid, who has now filed suit against the university, claims he was not participating in the protest but completing a delivery order at the encampment. And multiple UVa faculty have expressed concern that the 35-year-old nursing student is being unfairly targeted because of his race. Abdelhamid originally hails from a Middle Eastern country, the name of which The Daily Progress is withholding due to concerns its government may seek retribution against his family. After graduating from medical school there, he moved to Charlottesville in 2014 to complete a research fellowship at UVa Health with hopes of eventually completing a medical residency so he can get his full medical doctorate in the U.S. Currently an award-winning student at Piedmont Virginia Community College, he has no criminal record and was granted political asylum by the U.S. government in 2023 after undergoing intensive vetting by federal authorities. But despite repeated pleas from UVa faculty members and the American Association of University Professors, UVa Police Chief Tim Longo has so far declined requests to modify Abdelhamid’s order, citing “continued concern for the overall health, safety, and well-being” of the UVa community. UVa has declined to offer details on how Longo made that determination. Before receiving the NTO, Abdelhamid had been accepted as a summer extern at UVa Medical Center, UVa's flagship hospital in Charlottesville where he was scheduled to do paid work in the intensive care unit. “This is something I’m looking forward to because it’s going to give me a good chance to proceed in the field that I’m interested in,” Abdelhamid told The Daily Progress. But due to the order, and despite efforts from UVa law professor Anne Coughlin, he was forced to miss orientation. Coughlin After learning of Abdelhamid’s circumstances, Coughlin emailed Longo offering to personally escort Abdelhamid to orientation, remaining with him throughout the day and then escorting him off Grounds at the end of the session. “I was trying to educate the administration about who he was and what he had been invited to do on our Grounds,” Coughlin told The Daily Progress. “My big concern was to make sure administration was aware of the timing and that if they didn’t act quickly to modify the NTO they would in effect be destroying his career and they would need to weight that very heavily, losing the community his services as a nurse.” Her repeated requests were denied. On Friday, Abdelhamid received a letter from UVa Health telling him that his externship offer has been rescinded. It had been his last opportunity to participate in the paid program. The externship is only available to nursing students in the summer, and by next summer, he will have already graduated from the PVCC nursing program. His graduation assumes, however, that the NTO will be lifted. When the fall semester begins, Abdelhamid will be required to complete clinical rotations at UVa Health. If his NTO is not modified, he will not be allowed to attend and will necessarily flunk out the program, despite maintaining top grades and winning PVCC’s Distinguished Student Award, the highest student honor presented by the school. Any person issued an NTO can have it modified by submitting a timely appeal to Longo. “I humbly ask to appeal against the trespass warning so I can attend my training, which will help me tremendously as a future nurse serving the community of Charlottesville/Albemarle County,” Abdelhamid wrote in his May 6 appeal letter which he delivered in person, via mail and via email. Abdelhamid, who works as a driver for DoorDash, included two brief sentences about his involvement on May 4. A police officer watches as a protester waves the Palestinian flag on University of Virginia Grounds, Saturday, May 4, 2024. “I was delivering food near the Rotunda. I was unaware of the unlawful assembly order issued in the area,” he wrote. He went on to say he’s required to attend daily nursing training at the medical center, but Longo’s sole focus appears to have been on those two preceding sentences. In denying Abdelhamid’s appeal on May 16, Longo said Abdelhamid was “actively participating” in the protest. He made the claim based on \"law enforcement records\" that he has not shared with Abdelhamid, the public or The Daily Progress. “I am deeply concerned about the wholly inconsistent account that you offered in your appeal that stands in stark contrast to law enforcement records,” Longo wrote. The appeal was denied. “Mustafa was not part of the encampment and didn’t wake up on the morning of May 4 intending to protest,” UVa law professor Kelly Orians told The Daily Progress. “When he found himself in the area and saw friends from PVCC who were out there observing the police response to the encampment, he decided to join them.” Orians Orians is among a number of UVa faculty members helping people who were arrested on May 4 navigate the legal process. Orians said that, unlike Abdelhamid, other individuals who appealed their NTOs did not include any information about their involvement in the protest, and their NTOs were modified anyway. “Candor did not matter in those cases,” Orians said. She also noted that NTOs include a list of boxes that the university police can check off. One of those boxes: the individual demonstrated \"conduct that threatens\" the safety of the UVa community. For Abdelhamid, that box was never checked, indicating university police did not consider him to be a threat. Two other arrestees, Cierra Biel and Evan Urquhart, shared their appeal letters with The Daily Progress. Neither letter included an explanation for why they were at the protest, despite the requirement that they offer a “complete and candid explanation for the conduct that precipitate[d] the Trespass Warning.\" Both Biel and Urquhart said they’d been advised by attorneys to withhold that information. Biel went so far as to write Longo that the university’s response against protesting students was an “overreaction” as well as “unjust and unwarranted.” Both Biel’s and Urquhart’s NTOs were lifted. Longo wrote them that NTOs are meant to “mitigate a threat to health and safety.” He concluded that any risk from Biel or Urquhart had been “sufficiently mitigated.” He did not reach the same conclusion with Abdelhamid. Police drag anti-war protesters out of an encampment at the University of Virginia, Saturday, May 4, 2024. It’s a conclusion with which the U.S. government disagrees. Abdelhamid first arrived in the U.S. on a visa that required he return to his home country every six months. He did so until one trip home in the fall of 2015 when he was detained by his home government's authorities. They found it suspicious that he was traveling to and from the U.S. every six months. They believed he was a spy. And they found out that during the 2011 Arab Spring, Abdelhamid had been a part of the protests, where he had provided medical assistance to injured protesters. During the revolution, his home government is alleged to have committed many human rights abuses and murdered hundreds of demonstrators. “There would be two million people in one square, and police were just shooting at us,” Abdelhamid recalled. He was detained and brutally tortured for more than a week, deprived of sunlight and subjected to torture sessions three to five times per day. It is difficult for Abdelhamid to talk about, and he became choked up when recalling the traumatic period in an interview with The Daily Progress. Piedmont Virginia Community College nursing student Mustafa Abdelhamid wears his hospital ID badges in his Charlottesville apartment, Friday, May 24, 2024. Authorities only released him under the condition that he be strictly supervised and told him that if he ever returned to the U.S. he would be killed. “They made it very clear,” Abdelhamid said. He took the risk anyway, fleeing his home country in 2015. Upon arriving back at UVa, he told a professor what had happened. He did not understand the complex U.S. immigration system but was terrified of returning home. He wanted to know if he could change his visa so that he would not be required to fly back home every six months, which he feared would effectively be a death sentence. In the spring of 2016, Abdelhamid was ordered to go to the UVa Police Department where he was questioned by an agent with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. He was released after the interview. After not receiving a response on how to change his visa status, and fearful about returning home, Abdelhamid overstayed his visa. The day after he passed the six-month mark without returning to his home country, he was in the emergency room with his now ex-wife. She was having a miscarriage. While in the ER, Abdelhamid received a call from the same ICE agent who had questioned him previously. She demanded to meet with him immediately. A UVa police officer met Abdelhamid in the ER, forcing him to leave his wife behind. He was escorted from the building, taken to the ICE officer and detained. Soon after, he was in immigration court for removal proceedings, a hearing where a judge determines whether an individual may remain in the U.S. “I stood in front of the immigration judge and told him my situation and why I cannot go back home,” Abdelhamid said. He also got in touch with a nonprofit group that recommended he apply for political asylum. Abdelhamid was released on bond and was granted asylum in October of 2023, after being thoroughly vetted by U.S. law enforcement. The vetting was especially thorough because he had previously been on the “removal docket”; asylum seekers who have been involved in removal proceedings are subjected to heavier scrutiny than those who have not. “The asylum process is extremely extensive in terms of credibility standards you have to meet to qualify for asylum and the background checks you have to meet with the Department of Homeland Security,” Karla McKanders, director of the Thurgood Marshall Institute at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told The Daily Progress. McKanders Authorities investigate if asylum seekers have any criminal record in the U.S. or abroad; even loose connections with anyone associated with a terrorist organization will result in a denial. And an applicant must also get a green light from an immigration judge. “Even if you meet all the criteria, it’s in the judge’s discretion to deny asylum,” McKanders said. Abdelhamid’s yearslong ordeal with immigration authorities effectively prevented him from doing a medical residency in the U.S.; priority is given to prospective residents who are within three years of graduating medical school, and it had been eight years since Abdelhamid had graduated from his home university. In the fall of 2022, he chose to enroll in the PVCC nursing program. “He wanted to do a medical residency to get his full MD here in the United States. And that was completely derailed by what happened with ICE,” Orians said. “So he found another way to contribute to the health care sector, which is to go into nursing.” Multiple faculty members have made repeated requests to UVa administration and to Longo that Abdelhamid’s NTO be lifted. UVa told The Daily Progress it does not comment on individual NTOs and would not provide details on why Longo has refused to modify Abdelhamid’s. UVa also has not released who has and hasn’t had their NTOs modified after the events of May 4. With his future at stake, people in the UVa community are making regular efforts to have the university reconsider its decision. On May 20, the UVa chapter of the American Association of University Professors penned a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan. It asked that the NTO be dropped, or at least modified so Abdelhamid can pursue his education. “We are deeply concerned that the denial of Mr. Abdelhamid’s NTO appeal grossly infringes on his student rights,” reads the letter, “and unjustly impairs his ability to pursue his education.” Piedmont Virginia Community College nursing student Mustafa Abdelhamid sits in his apartment in Charlottesville on Friday, May 24, 2024. It also floats the same possibility that people familiar with Abdelhamid’s case have considered: that his appeal was denied because he is Arab. “This extremely punitive state of affairs, selectively applied to him, as it appears to us, is prejudicial to his minority status,” reads the letter. Neither Biel nor Urquhart, two arrestees who had their NTOs lifted, understand why Abdelhamid is being treated any differently. Unlike Abdelhamid, Urquhart doesn’t spend much time on Grounds. “It wasn’t super high urgency for me to get back on campus,” Urquhart, who is a local freelance journalist who says he was covering not participating in the protest when he was arrested, told The Daily Progress. Abdelhamid has been “incredibly nice” in all the interactions she’s had with him, said Biel, who is an administrative coordinator in the school's Department of Pharmacology. As a UVa employee, she said she’s done significant research on local history and is skeptical of Longo’s reasoning. University of Virginia Police Chief Tim Longo address the media outside the Charlottesville Police Department on Thursday, Oct. 5, 2023. “I’m suspicious why Longo would deny him and not anyone else,” said Biel. “Longo has a really long history of racist decisions in various positions.” Biel said she was referring, in part, to a 2011 episode when Longo was police chief for the Charlottesville City Police Department. While searching for a serial rapist, Longo authorized a policy where officers could approach Black men on the street and request DNA samples. The “dragnet” deeply strained relationships between Charlottesville’s Black community and its police department. With the university so far showing no appetite to amend Longo’s decision, Abdelhamid is turning to a last resort: filing a lawsuit. “Mustafa does not want to sue UVa. It’s been a decade since he first got here, and all he has wanted to do is contribute to the health and well-being of UVa and the greater Charlottesville community,” Orians said. “UVa has left him in a position where he’s run out of options except to sue to have his rights respected so he can fulfill his dream to be a health care provider in this community.” Jason Armesto (717) 599-8470 jarmesto@dailyprogress.com @rmest0 on X Get our local education coverage delivered directly to your inbox.

        "content": "The Jacksonville City Council adopted its Fiscal Year 2025 budget last Tuesday evening, and here’s everything you need to know. The FY25 budget goes from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. Some of the highlights in this year’s budget include no change in the tax rate, remaining at $.60, a 2.25% water and sewer rate increase and a $4 recycling and residential sanitation rate increase. The total proposed budget is $119,436,756, which breaks down as follows: This proposed budget is roughly $8,000,000 less than last year’s amended budget which totaled $127,345,478. During the Jacksonville City Council’s budget retreat, they came up with several goals or initiatives to be the focus of this year’s budget. These included pay plan integrity, fee schedule review, recreation land development, citizen/cultural engagement efforts, economic impact — housing and development, street improvements, cultural competency and awareness, downtown development and Unified Development Ordinance review. In the City of Jacksonville Proposed Budget Fiscal Year 2024-2025 that can be found in full on the city of Jacksonville’s website, the foundation of the budget is built on maintaining the integrity of the employee compensation and pay plan. Therefore, the proposed budget includes a market and merit pay increase of 5%. The Capital Improvement Plan was another important piece, critical for how the city makes improvements to city systems, budget documents explain. City systems include things like parks, facilities, water, sewer and other capital-defined items. This year’s budget has also been developed with the intention of preparing for major investments in city facilities over the next five years, through 2030 or so. Budget documents say these capital investments will be a focal point during FY25. This year, the city also developed a new strategy for evaluating requests for new employees. According to budget documents, this process was developed through discussions with each department regarding their mission, their ability to effectively accomplish that mission, and their ability to do more within their existing resources. The proposed budget also includes a number of Capital Improvement projects that are currently underway or will begin in the new fiscal year. The FY25 projects actually represent $10,262,500 of Capital Improvements, and include street rehabilitation, water and sewer improvements, recreation development and building improvements. One concept also taking affect in this year’s budget is the aforementioned increase in sanitation fees. According to the budget documents, the fee increases will help the city’s sanitation fund move closer to operating as a true enterprise fund, also further decreasing the demand on the general fund, effectively freeing up that money to provide for other needs and services. As previously stated, Capital Improvement Plan projects are a major part of the FY25 budget. At this time, however, the Capital Improvement Plan does not specifically list the Recreation and Sports Complex as a funded capital project because city council is awaiting an update to the Recreation and Parks Master Plan. Some of the notable projects being funded in FY25 include the Northwoods Community Center expansion, Jacksonville Station Phase 2, an upfit to the Center for Public Safety, improvements to Court Street, an upgrade to the Commons Pump Station, the Commons Challenge Courts & Trail, the Downtown Transit Transfer Station and more. The city also used a Five-Year Consolidated Plan to assess affordable housing and community development needs. The Annual Action Plan is the process by which the consolidated plan is then implemented into the fabric of the community. Requests from the community this year included in the FY25 budget include $200,000 to Carolina Statewide Development LLC for a 72-unit low-income housing project, $180,000 to ECCDI for a 44-unit homeless housing project, $5,000 to Williams Outreach for rapid re-housing services, $15,000 to Onslow Women’s Outreach for a women’s shelter, $20,000 to Onslow Community Outreach for a women’s shelter and $10,000 to Philippians Place for a homeless coaching program. In addition, requests were made for $10,000 to Pretrial Resource Center for Judicial System Support programs, $5,000 to United Way of Onslow for local nonprofit support, $10,000 to Onslow County PEERS for family development programs, $10,000 to the WARM Program for a home repair program and $30,000 to Boys & Girls Club for youth development programs. There is also community support funding outside of the Annual Action Plan. This year, this includes things like the $1.5 million contribution to the YMCA pool project, $333,333 to One Place for their new facility, $100,000 to the Dix Crisis Intervention Center and a total of $50,000 in opioid support funds.

        "content": "It is strange how nobody is talking about the immediate fallout of the Calcutta High Court’s decision to cancel an estimated half a million Other Backward Classes (OBC) certificates — issued mostly to Muslims — by the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee -led Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal since 2012 and the preceding Left Front regime. While Mamata has announced from the rooftop that she will not “accept” the order passed by Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Rajasekhar Mantha and will appeal to the Supreme Court to get the decision revoked, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah lost no time in welcoming the judgment and heaping praise on the justices for striking down Mamata’s policy of “snatching reservation meant for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and OBCs and giving it to Muslims for their votes.” While Bharatiya Janata Party and Trinamool Congress leaders trade charges amid calls to haul them up before the court for contempt, the Calcutta High Court’s order passed last week will lead to a windfall gain for the TMC this week in the last round of polling on 1 June — in as many as nine Lok Sabha seats — an aspect strangely nobody is talking about. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD How Mamata Can Capitalise Electorally Without a doubt, Mamata has got the upper hand electorally by smartly branding it as a “BJP order”, as opposed to a High Court order. Come Friday, thanks to Mamata’s stand, the Muslim community is bound to vote emphatically for TMC candidates and in far greater numbers than they would have if such an order had not been passed bang in the middle of the elections. As it is, North and South Kolkata, Diamond Harbour, Jadavpur, Dum Dum, Barasat, Bashirhat, Joynagar, and Mathurapur constituencies have a high to very high percentage of Muslim voters. Now, even those Muslims who were veering towards the Congress Party, Communist Party of India (Marxist) or Indian Secular Front candidates, will vote en masse for Mamata’s candidates as she has taken up cudgels for the beleaguered community, brightening the TMC’s overall prospects in Bengal – a state the BJP is desperate to win despite Muslims accounting for 27 percent of the population. Importantly, among Trinamool candidates who will romp home by bigger margins in the wake of the contentious High Court order, is Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata’s heir-apparent and second-in-command. He is a contestant in the Diamond Harbour parliamentary seat at Kolkata’s doorstep where Muslims, comprising 38 percent, play a big role in deciding the winner. He has been scathing in his criticism of the verdict that Modi and Shah are praising to the skies in their election speeches for dealing a blow to Mamata’s Muslim “appeasement” policy. 0 The infirmities of the order scrapping the OBC status of 77 caste groups, out of which 75 are Muslims, have been brilliantly spotlighted by legal scholar Faizan Mustafa. Mustafa points out that one of the four grounds cited by the two judges for cancelling the certificates is that the West Bengal government chose the Muslim castes for conferring OBC status through executive orders and not through the legislative process. But the reasoning flies in the face of the Supreme Court laying down in the Indra Sawhney case that reservation can indeed be provided by executive order. Moreover, the Constitution has empowered the President of India to include any caste or tribe within the SC or ST under Articles 341 and 342 in consultation with the Governor, which means that there are other pathways to reservation besides the legislative route. Mustafa also bluntly refutes Calcutta High Court judges’ controversial contention that Muslim castes were included in backward classes on grounds of religion, arguing that they were given reservations not due to their religion but their backwardness. Advocating that Muslims get the same privileges as their non-Muslim counterparts, he rightly asks why the “appeasement” tag is deployed only in cases of reservation for clearly backward Muslim castes or Pasmanda Muslims — and not when Patidar, Gujjar, Jat, Marathas and Economically Weaker Section reservations are announced. This is not the Only Reason Why Calcutta HC Has Hit the Headlines If Mamata has publicly called last week’s order “kalankit”, or tainted, one can’t help but wonder whether she made the remark due to what is happening of late in the Calcutta High Court. Justice Rajasekhar Mantha, who delivered the verdict with Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty, has been in the sights of some members of the Bar Association since last year for giving blanket protection to BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari by issuing written orders to the West Bengal police not to register any FIR against him. More recently, Justice Abhijit Ganguly took premature retirement and is in the electoral fray from the Tamluk seat as a BJP candidate after endlessly gunning for Abhishek and Mamata from the bench. And to make matters worse, days before last week’s order, retiring Judge Chitta Ranjan Das, disclosed at his farewell that, “I was, and I am, a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangha (RSS)”. The trio haven't exactly covered themselves with glory. Given this backdrop, the order scrapping five lakh OBC certificates issued mostly to Muslims was bound to raise a stink.

        "content": "FARGO — The two most important names in meteorology and weather forecasting are Vilhelm Bjerknes and Edward Lorenz. In the early 1920s, the Norwegian Bjerknes developed the concept of a low pressure system forming as a disturbance along a zone of temperature contrast, with extended boundaries between contrasting air masses emanating from the low. He called them fronts after similar military boundaries in World War I. Edward Lorenz was a American mathematician and meteorologist who developed the method of using computers to solve systems of differential equations to forecast weather. He famously showed the issue with numerical prediction in a 1964 paper which showed that tiny changes to initial conditions in these equations would lead to massive changes over time. That is why even today’s very fast weather computers can reasonably predict weather short term, but are incapable of accurately predicting weather changes several weeks away.",

        "description": "Even if he plays nice, the PM knows there is a real risk of the campaign disintegrating",
        "content": "An incumbent Government seeking re-election really only has two pitches to the electorate. Whilst the details and policy focus may vary, these are either: “isn’t everything going wonderfully?” or “let us finish the job”. The problem with any other option is that once you start running against the status quo, voters start asking impossible questions about why you haven’t done something about it already – especially when you have held office for 14 years. Hence Rishi Sunak’s insistence that “the plan is working”. Winning a fifth consecutive term in office would be difficult in normal circumstances. But this election confronts the Prime Minister with an especially impossible balancing act. Sunak was installed in No 10 following the collapse of Liz Truss’ government with the explicit objective of putting as much distance as possible between the Conservatives and the disastrous political fallout from her mini-Budget. Unfortunately for him, not only has his predecessor indicated that she will stand for re-election but is once again busily trying to rehabilitate her record. In her latest interview with the Daily Telegraph Truss has, astonishingly, claimed that she couldn’t be held responsible for the political damage done by people criticising her policies. Labour would love nothing better than to have Truss front and centre for the next five weeks. The more they can persuade voters that she still informs the Tories’ policy thinking, the better. Read Next Westminster has no right to laugh at Liz Truss One might therefore expect Sunak to spare no effort in drawing as bright a line as he possibly can between her approach and his own. The contrast between their two approaches is there to be made. Yet while the Prime Minister is trying to remind voters how much they liked furlough, he has so far held fire on Truss. He has to be extremely careful about maintaining party unity. The current consensus amongst Tory MPs to pull together and take the fight to Labour is fragile. If the leadership started trying to score points off their internal opponents, it might break, and the Conservative campaign could fall completely to pieces. This, unlike the sins of his predecessors, is a problem of the Prime Minister’s own making. His decision to ambush his party with a snap election has torched almost every shred of goodwill he enjoyed in any quarter of it. MPs who have resisted efforts to mount a challenge to his leadership, on the grounds that it would be self-indulgent and self-harming when the Government only had six months’ left to focus on voters’ priorities, have seen Sunak throw that extra time away and plunge them into the fight of their political lives . Politicians, as well as their staff and their families, who thought they had a few months to sort out a life after politics now find themselves with only a few weeks to try and line something up, weeks in which those not standing down will be spending all hours campaigning. Since then, they have watched as the Prime Minister’s team – the only people who knew an election was coming – serve up gaffe after gaffe, and have been wheeled out to support policies such as national service for which no preparation has been made, and which Conservative ministers were dismissing only days ago. Many of those I’ve spoken to think the decision to call a snap election now was an almost completely selfish move on Sunak’s part that exhibited no concern for the broader interests of the Party. That he nonetheless depends on them putting party first, and saving their criticism for Labour, has not gone unnoticed. Even if he plays nice, the Prime Minister must know there is a real risk of the campaign disintegrating. If the polls don’t narrow over the next few weeks, MPs will be increasingly tempted to go off-message in order to save their own seats, and future leadership hopefuls keener to get in early with their explanations for what he got wrong. All Sunak can really do to prevent such a civil war breaking out is avoid starting it himself. That means sticking to his own messaging – and hoping voters don’t take too much notice as Truss sticks to hers.",

        "content": "This summer, a brand new and interactive sculpture trail will be heading to town, hoping to turn heads as well as pages. Newark Town Centre will play host to a book themed art trail from July 11 to coincide with the start of Newark Book Festival, but will be enjoyed all summer long until September 5. ‘Meet Me at the Benches’ is a project organised by Newark Creates and will see 11 book shaped benches dotted around the town, which have been designed by talented artists from across the East Midlands. The trail is similar to other projects which has seen things such as brightly coloured animal sculptures adding a splash of colour in towns across the UK. Once the trail has launched, a map will help visitors to follow the route of all 11 benches as they showcase a range of themes from the rich history and heritage of Newark or the beauty of nature, to cultural stories, literature and nursery rhymes. Each bench be a unique work of art and will also host pop-up events and workshops, where people can take part in drop in story-telling sessions, or find out more about some of the community and cultural organisations in Newark. One bench was created by artist Dahlia Lee who worked with community groups to gather their ideas on what the bench should look like. Dahlia worked with the Newark Book Festival young ambassadors and the Open Doors Creative Influencers and their families through two workshops to come up with her unique bench. Another bench was designed by students taking Art and Design at Newark College. Vicky Kuhn, one of the artists said, “I’m so excited to be a part of a project that celebrates Newark and its people's love of literature. “I hope that the benches bring people from far and wide to take part in the trail and enjoy what the town has to offer.” Rowan Cozens, Newark and Sherwood District Council’s portfolio holder for heritage, culture and the arts, said, “I am delighted that this wonderful trail will be coming to Newark this summer. “Last year’s umbrellas were so well received by all our town centre visitors, and I am sure that the Book Benches, this year will prove equally as popular. “I hope many people are encouraged to visit our town centre to enjoy, not only the trail, but all that Newark has to offer, from our unique and independent retailers and cafes to our iconic castle and its beautiful gardens. “Newark really is a special place, and this trail is the icing on the cake.” Carol Newman, director of culture at Inspire Libraries. said, “I’m delighted that the community of Newark and Sherwood will be able to enjoy the amazing, bespoke Book Bench sculptures from Wild in Art this summer, part of the ongoing, extensive Newark Creates cultural programme.” The Book Benches will be brought to the town centre by Newark’s Cultural Consortium, led by Newark and Sherwood District Council and Inspire Culture, Learning and Libraries. They are funded by the Arts Council England and the UK Shared Prosperity Fund which is providing £2.6 billion of new funding to local authorities to bid for to invest in unique opportunities within their district. The Book Benches are built by Wild In Art, an established body appreciative of the culture of Newark and the surrounding area. Since 2008, Wild in Art have animated cities across the world including Sydney, Cape Town, and São Paulo, and created trails for the London 2012 Olympics, the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and Historic Royal Palaces. Now, they are helping to bring this unique installation to Newark where people can see world-class art in their hometown.",

        "content": "FARGO — The two most important names in meteorology and weather forecasting are Vilhelm Bjerknes and Edward Lorenz. In the early 1920s, the Norwegian Bjerknes developed the concept of a low pressure system forming as a disturbance along a zone of temperature contrast, with extended boundaries between contrasting air masses emanating from the low. He called them fronts after similar military boundaries in World War I. Edward Lorenz was a American mathematician and meteorologist who developed the method of using computers to solve systems of differential equations to forecast weather. He famously showed the issue with numerical prediction in a 1964 paper which showed that tiny changes to initial conditions in these equations would lead to massive changes over time. That is why even today’s very fast weather computers can reasonably predict weather short term, but are incapable of accurately predicting weather changes several weeks away.",

        "content": "With dwindling legislative working weeks before November, Senate Democrats are shifting to more messaging bills as an election-year tactic to bolster vulnerable incumbents. Legislation with little or no Republican buy-in that is all but certain to fail is likely to become increasingly popular with Senate Democrats, which includes a border security proposal that suffered its second loss this week and a contraception bill that will face similar doom next month. Democratic leadership promises there are more such measures on the horizon to hit the floor, a strategy that they market as simply highlighting to voters their policy differences with Republicans. “You’re going to have to wait with bated breath to determine what's next,” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), the third-ranking Democrat, said with a laugh. “There will be other opportunities.” Democrats face eight competitive Senate races, none of which they can afford to lose and hope to still keep the majority. “These are not gimmicks. These are real issues that people in America care very deeply about,” Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), who chairs Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, told the Washington Examiner. “Folks should vote and be on the record.” The campaign-minded approach is turning away even those in the GOP who are most inclined to cut deals on major policy issues, presenting minimal opportunities for the Senate to muster bipartisan achievements before the elections. The chamber's 60-vote threshold means that at least nine Republicans are required to achieve nearly every legislative task. “Seems to me, the Democrats are getting deep into messaging amendments as opposed to serious legislation,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) told the Washington Examiner. The centrist Republican argued that if Democrats were genuine about legislating, they would allow a vote on a bipartisan bill she’s co-authored to restore national abortion rights by codifying Roe v. Wade into law, which also includes contraception protections. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said they will instead vote on legislation to codify federal protections for only contraception after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump teased he may support restrictions and as some states seek to limit access to abortion medication or birth control for some people. Democrats facing competitive reelections welcome the border and contraception votes with open arms. “Could it help that I’m fighting for my constituents to get their rights and freedoms back?” Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), an incumbent facing a serious Republican challenger, told the Washington Examiner. “Absolutely.” Trump later walked back his contraception comments, posting on social media that he’d “never, and will never advocate imposing restrictions on birth control or other contraceptives.” It failed to quell fierce backlash from Democrats, including from the Biden campaign. “Now more than ever, contraception is a critical piece of protecting women’s reproductive freedoms, standing as nothing short of a vital lifeline for millions of American women across the country,” Schumer said. Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), the GOP co-author of the border bill, accused Democrats of “fearmongering” over contraception. “No one's taking away your right to contraception,” he told the Washington Examiner. “That's why this is political posturing during an election year.” The border security bill started as a bipartisan agreement in February but suffered a swift death under the weight of GOP backlash, including from Trump. Democrats’ attempt to revive it last week was met with an even greater loss in a 43-50 vote , as six Democrats and independents bucked the party to vote with almost all Republicans against it. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was the only Republican to support it. Lankford, after voting for it the first time, voted against it the second time. “The American people have already made their mind up about who's responsible for the mess of the border,\" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said. \"No amount of political maneuvering is going to change that perception and that reality.\"",

        "content": "Kimberly Turbin thought she was going to be a happy mom. “But that was snatched from me,” she says, the first time she gave birth. Up until then, “I had a perfect pregnancy. I didn’t have any nausea. Nothing was wrong with me,” she says. Her water broke while she was at her friend’s house, and she went home to shower before going to the hospital. Once there, she let the staff know she’d previously been raped and asked them to be communicative with her throughout her delivery. She remembers them giving her a pill to help calm her down because she was growing anxious. “And I did calm down,” she says. “I thought I was going to push the baby out, and everything was great. Everybody was really nice still.” But shortly after she began pushing, her obstetrician, Alex Abbassi, told her he was going to perform an episiotomy, or cut into the sensitive skin between her vagina and anus — known as the perineum — to widen her vaginal opening. Turbin repeatedly objected to the procedure, which the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends doing . “What? Why? We haven’t even tried!” she can be heard saying in a video of the birth taken by her mother that she later posted online. “Why can’t we just try?” Abbassi said the baby wasn’t coming out and if she continued to try to push, “it’s going to rip the butthole down clean.” When she protested — more than once telling him no and pleading, “Don’t cut me!” — he told her he was the “expert” and that she could “go home and do it” or “go to Kentucky.” He then cut into her perineum a dozen times. Turbin, who went on to , says she’s still grappling with the physical and emotional toll of his actions more than a decade later. “Dr. Abbassi snatched my decisionmaking for my body from me because of what he did,” she says. “And he left me with PTSD for life and nerve damage.” Mothers’ mistreatment at the hands of the very health care workers meant to help them through pregnancy and childbirth is a rampant — and dangerous — problem in maternity care. in the United States report being ignored, threatened, forced to accept treatment they didn’t consent to, physically abused or otherwise mistreated by their providers during pregnancy and delivery, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among Black, Hispanic or multiracial mothers and those who have public insurance or no insurance, the rates are higher still: closer to 1 in 3. Turbin, who is Latina and was insured through California’s Medi-Cal, belonged to both groups. And American health care workers are far from the worst offenders. A 2019 study led by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Myanmar, for instance, found that whose deliveries researchers observed were mistreated during childbirth. These experiences of disrespect and abuse can have a devastating impact, heightening risks for mothers and their children during an already vulnerable period and continuing to affect them long afterward. Mistreatment has been linked to , such as obstructed labor and excessive bleeding, as well as postpartum hemorrhage and abdominal pain. It can also deal a blow to parents’ mental health, as can the complications and it contributes to. Mothers who have been mistreated are at greater risk of developing postpartum depression. Their mistreatment can fuel childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder. And when they turn back to health care professionals for help or try to seek justice through hospitals, medical boards or courts, they can find themselves confronting a lack of care or awareness — if not more disrespect and abuse. Postpartum depression, the most common perinatal mood disorder, affects around the world and 20 percent in developing nations. Mothers who have been mistreated appear to grapple with it at significantly higher rates: about 50 percent higher, according to one study. Information on the relative prevalence of childbirth-related PTSD following disrespect or abuse is harder to come by. But researchers have identified mistreatment as for the condition, and poor experiences with health care workers loom large in descriptions of traumatic deliveries: One widely cited study found that , regardless of whether it resulted in PTSD, said their providers’ actions were what made the experience traumatizing. Childbirth-related PTSD, like other forms of the disorder, usually stems from a person “experiencing an event as a real threat to their life, or potential threat,” says Sharon Dekel, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and the founding director of the Postpartum Traumatic Stress Disorders Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. That feeling could arise from physical complications during labor, she says, or from “something psychologically being violated.” Dekel and her colleagues have found that develop PTSD after a “successful” birth, while as many as 17 percent display clinically significant symptoms. The effects of traumatic births aren’t limited to the mothers at their center, either. People who bear witness can be traumatized as well, Dekel says, and parents with PTSD can experience difficulties caring for their babies, whom they may associate with their trauma. PTSD, postpartum depression and other perinatal mental health conditions have been found to , which in turn can impair childhood development. Research has also indicated that , possibly even leaving a tangible mark on families’ genes. This is something Turbin thinks about: how her mistreatment and its lingering effects may impact her children. “I would cry a lot, or maybe I would scream more than I would like to,” she remembers. “I had to get hypnotized to stop screaming at my kids.” Years after her traumatic delivery, she says everything she feels “is raw,” and at times, she experiences panic or shuts down. Sometimes, when her children are screaming, she just ignores them. Because of Abbassi’s actions, she says, “I never became the mom I wanted to be.” Parents affected by childbirth-related PTSD may feel like they’re reliving the birth through intrusive thoughts or flashbacks, try to avoid reminders of the experience — including pregnancy — and grapple with depression and “negative alterations in mood and cognition,” Dekel says. They may also be gripped by guilt and shame, she says, believing they’ve failed their children or that their bodies have failed them. The same feelings often , along with helplessness, hopelessness, restlessness, sadness, anxiety and emptiness. Some have suicidal thoughts. Some translate those thoughts into suicide attempts. And if they reach out to professionals for help, parents already struggling with their mental health again face the risk of mistreatment — with potentially dire consequences. “We see and hear of many cases of care that we could characterize as mistreatment when individuals are seeking help for mental health during pregnancy, postpartum and post-loss,” says Wendy Davis, the executive director of the nonprofit Postpartum Support International. “That often takes the form of belittling, demeaning, blaming the individual, sometimes really overt name-calling.” Davis, who previously worked as a psychotherapist and specialized in perinatal mental health after recovering from postpartum depression and anxiety herself, says this kind of treatment from health care professionals can have a dangerous effect. “Their existing mental health symptoms have already made them think they can’t do this. ‘I shouldn’t be a mom’ and, at worst ... ‘my baby would be better off without me.’ That thought is already swirling around in somebody who’s dealing with a perinatal mood disorder,” she explains. “So if you go to a professional, and if they give the same message,” she says, “perinatal patients have an extremely high risk of suicide.” Mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of maternal mortality, according to the CDC, accounting for in the United States. Most of these deaths are determined to be preventable. Davis says perinatal mental health care has taken “baby steps” toward improvement in recent years. “At this point, in the 21st century, the resources do exist for social support, peer support. We have more and more informed perinatal mental health providers, and we have more and more informed OB and primary care providers,” she says. Dekel, too, sees progress. She points to the growing body of research on the subject and notes that the National Institutes of Health, which supports her work, has made maternal mental health a high priority. “Which is terrific,” she says, “and I think is raising a lot of awareness among the scientific and also critical communities.” But both caution that there’s still work to be done, specifically stressing the need to better educate and train providers. “The gap that exists that we really need to close,” Davis says, “is the gap between the resources that exist and medical care.” As well as exacerbating both physical and mental health risks, mistreatment can fracture mothers’ trust in health care workers, making them leery of receiving treatment in the future. “When somebody experiences mistreatment of any kind from a medical provider, really specific things happen,” Davis says. “There’s now a decrease in trust. There’s a decrease in confidence on the part of the individual. They second-guess themselves. They might blame themselves for problems that are going on. Mostly, they don’t want to have the same negative experience they had before.” This can cause people to stop going to appointments, she says, or to “put on a mask to try to appear better and healthier and ‘less weak’ to avoid the terms of the experience before” if they do return to a provider. Mothers who suffer mistreatment have been found to be throughout their pregnancies and in the wake of giving birth, a critical period for ensuring the long-term health, and even survival, of both mothers and their children. Medical mistrust can also contribute to women of color in particular , and it can cause people to for health issues extending far beyond maternity and postpartum care. “To this day, I really don’t feel comfortable going to hospitals,” says Sebrena Tate, citing the ways her doctors treated her during labor and postpartum care in the pandemic. “I always have this sense of, whoever walks in, is everyone going to be able to walk out? I’m always questioning medical providers.” After Tate went into early labor roughly six months into pregnancy, the doctors at the hospital she was admitted to “weren’t answering” her “questions and were brushing the situation off,” she says. She remembers being told “these things just happen” and “we just have to wait and see.” One doctor from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) told Tate, who is Black, “Don’t worry about it. Black females are the strongest babies in the NICU,” she recalls. The comment made her think about the surrounding Black women’s pain that have long affected their medical treatment. It made her worry what else her providers might be thinking. Due in part to implicit and structural bias in the medical system, Black mothers in the United States face when it comes to pregnancy and childbirth. They’re as their white counterparts to die due to pregnancy-related causes, according to the CDC. They’re also about to give birth preterm — one of the leading causes of infant mortality. “I just remember being in that hospital room and being like, ‘I don’t feel safe. I feel like none of these people have my best interests at heart right now,’” Tate recalls. “Like either myself or my daughter’s not going to make it out of this hospital.” She decided to leave and went to another hospital the following day. The care she received there was “totally different” and more attentive, she says, but her daughter ultimately passed away. The last time Tate went to a medical provider was her six-week postpartum checkup, during which a midwife — who had not read her chart — asked her, “How’s the baby?” “I just feel like they don’t really care,” Tate says. She did see a therapist in the wake of her experience, who she’d already been connected with when she previously dealt with postpartum depression. But she says she “wasn’t really able to find a lot” when she searched for other support resources. Not wanting other parents to experience the same loneliness she felt, she has worked to become a resource herself by going through bereavement doula training, building her own doula service, and becoming a birth trauma group leader at Postpartum Support International. Turbin, too, has sought to help other parents. In the years since her traumatic delivery, she has plunged into advocacy on medical board reform, maternal mortality and mistreatment. While discussing her own experience, she speaks passionately about the cases of several other women who suffered mistreatment or died in childbirth and about Latinas’ invisibility in conversations surrounding . “My advocacy just keeps on growing, because I have a lot of work to do,” she says. The fight for awareness and accountability Disrespect and abuse in maternity care, also in some cases referred to as obstetric violence, has in recent years been recognized as a human rights violation by international organizations, including and , and explicitly outlawed by several Latin American nations. Most countries still have no laws expressly prohibiting it, however. In fact, the law sometimes serves as an instrument for mistreatment, as in the case of . And efforts to combat providers’ disrespect and abuse or hold them accountable for their actions are an uphill battle. Storm O’Brink seeks to do both as a full-spectrum birth worker and advocate with the University of Iowa’s Rape Victim Advocacy Program. O’Brink, who uses they/them pronouns, provides counseling throughout the perinatal period and accompanies survivors of obstetric violence and sexual violence to medical appointments and procedures, among other services. They describe mistreatment they’ve witnessed firsthand: Patients being coerced or forced into pelvic exams or treatments they didn’t want; providers “completely trampling on” patients’ boundaries. “As a doula and as an advocate, it’s my job to amplify the survivor’s voice when they’re not being heard,” they say. In the case of mistreatment, “I try to intervene. I try to speak up as much as I can. But there’s only so much I can do before the providers will attempt to kick me out of the room.” O’Brink also works to help people who want to “seek some form of justice” for their mistreatment complain to the hospital or state medical board, and occasionally they assist them in finding a lawyer if they think they have grounds to sue. But they say most of these efforts end in disappointment, and it can “open a wound” for people as they navigate months- or even years-long processes that often involve hospitals, providers, courts or other entities “invalidating the experience they had and basically saying it needed to happen this way.” Turbin filed complaints against Abbassi with the hospital and the Medical Board of California, in addition to suing him. Two years after performing her delivery, he , acknowledging “physical and mental deterioration” related to his age. He and Turbin later settled her lawsuit out of court. She hopes she set a precedent with the case, in which a California judge ruled Abbassi’s actions could be tried as potential assault and battery. But at the same time, she says she doesn’t recommend that other people follow in her footsteps. “The psychological and the mental anguish isn’t just from the assault. It’s from everything, along with the assault that happened to me. For me, I wasn’t just assaulted. I was also part of a movement to spread awareness. And yeah, I didn’t have to be — but then I had to be. There was no going back,” Turbin says. “I always said, ‘I’m going to do it.’ And I did,” she says. “But I’m telling you, I paid the price for it. My kids paid the price for it.”",

The No. 1 Auburn men’s golf team advanced out of stroke play at the NCAA national championship tournament on Monday in Carlsbad, Calif., finishing in sixth place in stroke play to take the No. 6 seed into the match-play portion of the tournament. Auburn faces third-seeded Virginia in the national championship quarterfinals Tuesday morning. The teams are scheduled to tee off at 7:40 a.m. locally, which is 9:40 a.m. Central. If the Tigers advance, they’ll play the winner of No. 2 Vanderbilt and No. 7 Ohio State in the semifinal round on Tuesday afternoon. The championship match is scheduled for Wednesday. Tuesday’s quarterfinals and semifinals will be covered on GOLF Channel and on Peacock. Auburn won the SEC Championship earlier this postseason and has been a top-ranked team down the stretch of the season, aided by freshman sensation Jackson Koivun . Koivun finished stroke play at two-under, finishing in a tie for second place on the individual leader only one stroke behind individual national champion Hiroshi Tai of Georgia Tech. As a team, Auburn shot 19-over over four rounds during stroke play, with the four-over fourth round getting the Tigers into the sixth-seeded spot. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

        "description": "Gibson-City-Melvin-Sibley's baseball team made history on Monday afternoon as it advanced to the Class 1A state finals",
        "content": "BLOOMINGTON — Gibson-City-Melvin-Sibley’s baseball team made history on Monday afternoon. The Falcons had never won a super-sectional plaque before defeating Annawan/Wethersfield 3-0 in a Class 1A game at Jack Horenberger Field, clinching the program’s first-ever state tournament appearance with the shutout victory against the Titans. “It’s great, of course,” GCMS senior Ty Cribbett said. “Nobody’s ever been here before for Gibson. It just feels really great.” GCMS relied on the efforts of Elliott, who turned in seven complete innings of five-hit, six-strikeout ball. Elliott’s gem was backed up by a stellar defensive effort from the Falcons (22-7-1), who came through with multiple key plays to help the junior escape trouble. “It’s really been a big thing for us this year,” GCMS coach Dustin White said. “Our defense has been playing really well. ... These guys just continue to work every day in practice, all the time. Can’t be happier with them.” With a sea of red-clad fans looking on down the first-base line on the Illinois Wesleyan University campus, the Falcons carded a pair of runs in the bottom of the first inning to claim control of the game. Elliott doubled to drive in Cribbett before yielding to courtesy runner Alex Overman, who scored on a single from Zach Price. “It boosted my confidence a lot when we got a little bit of a cushion, I would say,” Elliott said. “The pressure kind of fell off, and we went from there.” Another run came across in the bottom of the third inning when Graydon Leonard hit a sacrifice fly to score David Hull, who was the hero a half-inning prior, when he dove to his left at third base to snag a two-out line drive from Zeb Rashid that would have likely scored Dylan Horrie and Maddux Heitzler. Instead, it stranded the bases loaded and kept the Falcons in control. “It’s kind of crazy,” Hull said. “You get put in that situation in your head and then it actually happens. You’ve got to produce and that’s what happened.” The Titans outhit the Falcons by a 5-4 margin but couldn’t break through thanks to a slew of key defensive plays throughout the game. Hull’s clutch catch was joined by a bases-loaded putout from first baseman Zeb Greer to Price at home plate in the third inning, as well. Leonard later initiated a double-play during a similar bases-loaded jam in the sixth inning. “My confidence boosts way up when I know my defense is out there,” Elliott said. “My defense will make any play hit to them. Anything reasonable, they’ve got.” Falcons fans — eager to see the program that had previously only won postseason hardware in 2006 — outnumbered Annawan/Wethersfield supporters on Monday. Their experience from recent state finals runs in other sports — GCMS won back-to-back 2A football state titles in 2017 and 2018 and the Falcons boys’ basketball program placed third at the 2019 2A state tournament — was evident by them putting forth a tailgate in front of the baseball field’s main gate and gathered above the seating. “Once you look up at them and embrace it all,” Price said, “it finally actually settles in.” GCMS’ historic victory on Monday will be followed by more history this weekend. A state semifinal game with Altamont (30-9) awaits at 1 p.m. Friday at Dozer Park in downtown Peoria, and win would put the Falcons into Saturday’s state championship game at 1 p.m. against either Ottawa Marquette or Jacksonville Rout. By the time Saturday evening rolls around, these Falcons will add more hardware to the school’s trophy case with the program’s first ever state trophy. It’s just a matter of where the Falcons will finish now that GCMS is among the final four 1A teams still playing this spring. “I’m really excited,” Cribbett said. “We always have fun at practice, and hopefully we can translate that into Friday and Saturday.”",

        "content": "If you want to glimpse the from below the Arctic Circle, be ready to drive to dark skies the first week of June. Earth's in more than two decades happened between May 10 and May 12, painting the skies with colorful auroras in an ultra-rare occurrence. This was the result of at least five solar storms that hit Earth simultaneously, all originating from a massive sunspot known as active region 3664 (also called AR3664 and AR13664), a dark patch on the sun more than . The barrage of charged particles collided with Earth's magnetosphere, which funneled them along lines toward the poles, generating vibrant auroras along the way. Crucially, the fallout from the solar storms arrived a few nights after May's new moon, when the night sky was free from moonlight — making even faint auroras easier to see. Because the sun rotates on its axis once every 27 days, the sunspot disappeared from view around a week later, but it didn't stop producing solar flares. , it emitted a rated as X12, the strongest since September 2017. It was observed by the 's Solar Orbiter spacecraft. AR3664/AR13664 is now becoming visible again as the sun rotates — and it will be Earth-facing once again during the new moon on June 6. \"It will align nicely,\" , a solar physicist at the National Solar Observatory (NSO) in Boulder, Colorado, told Live Science. \"As soon as the sunspot starts to appear, we will enter the window of opportunity [for viewing auroras].\" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The monster sunspot will reappear in late May/early June, but when the sunspot reaches the center of the sun, from our perspective, the sun-Earth system will be most connected. That's when our planet is most likely to be hit by solar weather, potentially resulting in another display of auroras at low latitudes. \"That's exactly where it produced all of those large flares,\" said French. \"But in theory, if you had a large enough eruption, even if it's to the left of the sun's center, we could still get the edge of that impact.\" — — — June 6's new moon rises exactly 27 days after May 10, so be on alert a few nights before and after that date — just in case there's a repeat of last month's extreme geomagnetic activity. If auroras are visible near you, you'll need to get far from obscuring clouds and city lights to be able to see them. Even after June's new moon, there may still be other chances to catch the aurora near you this year. Sunspots appear in greater frequency — and trigger more powerful solar flares — during the peak of the sun's 11-year activity cycle, known as the solar maximum. Scientists suspect that the current cycle's , hitting us than previously estimated. But we won't be able to determine the maximum's precise timing until after it ends, and solar activity finally quiets down again.",

        "description": "Tallulah Dent, 11, only munched six plain Aunt Bessie's for dinner every day since she was aged four - but now she's ditched the diet after hypnosis",
        "content": "A schoolgirl who was addicted to Yorkshire puddings has finally eaten a proper meal - thanks to hypnosis. Tallulah Dent, 11, munched six plain Aunt Bessie's for dinner every day since she was aged four. The youngster ate at least 24 a week and even devoured a plate of the crispy battered puds on Christmas Day instead of turkey and vegetables. She couldn't stand trying new foods like cheese sandwiches or chicken which made her feel physically sick and gag. Her worried mum Gemma desperately tried to encourager Tallulah to try other foods but she was unable to keep anything else down. She managed to eat a simple ham sandwich for lunch and occasionally a slice of cheese pizza but Tallulah always returned to her favourite puds. Eventually Tallulah bravely asked her mum to seek help after she tried a piece dish of chicken and veg which left her in tears. Gemma contacted cognitive behavioural hypnotherapist David Kilmurry after Tallulah was diagnosed with ARFID - avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder. She underwent 12 intense weeks of hypnotherapy sessions and now Tallulah is trying all kinds of new foods. Thrilled Gemma, 41, said: \"When she came back one day from nursery she just started refusing certain foods. Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' Talullah aged 3 when it all began ( Image: Gemma Dent/SWNS) \"She used to eat chicken dippers and that was fine but then one day she refused to eat them because she said they looked different. I made everything from scratch for my kids. She used to eat absolutely everything. I thought it was a phase and just thought she would outgrow it but she just point blank refused almost all foods except Yorkshire puddings.\" \"She would eat an entire plate of them for dinner. One Christmas she just had a plate of Yorkshire puddings while we all had Christmas dinner with the trimmings. I just felt like I was a bad parent and worried about her health. She physically couldn't put other foods to her lips. You'd see her go red and she'd be shaking, it was horrendous. \"She wanted to try the food but she couldn't physically not put it near her mouth. She used to say, 'what's wrong with me, why can't I eat it?' She just couldn't understand why she couldn't do it. At its worst, she would be having Yorkshire puddings almost every night. The other nights she'd have pancakes or a ham toastie but it was really restrictive. Talullah with hypnotist David Kilmurry ( Image: Gemma Dent/SWNS) \"I'd always have a pack of Aunt Bessie's in the freezer or I'd make my own. It was always a nightmare going out for dinners. I tended to stick to the same places. When we went for a carvery I explained to the staff that she would only eat Yorkshire puddings. We'd pay £1 and she could have as many as she wanted.\" Gemma first noted something was wrong during Covid and began researching her options before she started hypnotherapy. Just months after completing her treatment Tallulah now enjoys healthy salads and roast dinners with all the trimmings. Tallulah said: \"I only really liked beige foods and Yorkshire puddings were my absolute favourite. \"I just couldn't get enough of them. I still like them but I want to try different foods too. Now I like peppers and noodles, curry nuts and dried fruit. I've tried boiled eggs and fried eggs too.\" Gemma added: \"She tried different types of nuts, she tried fruit, bread and cheeses. She tried warmer food and pasta. He took her to subway. I think we've still got a way to go. But she will try anything. The other day she ate a salad for dinner. We're more or less eating the same thing. She will try things which before she physically couldn't do. Some of the food Talullah will now eat following her hypnotherapy sessions ( Image: Gemma Dent/SWNS) \"It's made my life a lot easier. She's really happy to be eating salad all the time. She loves a pot noodle. It gets her down the noodle route. When I do a roast dinner I'll put a little bit of everything on her plate, whereas before it was just roast dinners. Yorkshire puddings are lovely but there's not much good in them. \"For dinner she'll eat salad, crusty bread with roast chicken, tacos, there is a big improvement.\" Hypnotherapist David, who runs clinics in Coventry and in London's Harley Street, said: \"Tallulah has been a dream to work with. She has really taken well to the hypnosis, immediately eating interesting and healthy foods, now no longer showing any signs of ARFID with a free eating, varied and balanced diet, I'm honoured to have worked with her.\"",

        "description": "The last thing the hard-working armed forces need are a bunch of whingeing teenagers moaning about having to get up before midday.",
        "content": "‘Mum! They’re going to make us go into the Army at 18 ,’ my 15-year-old said while she was lying on my bed, browsing ASOS, clearly disgusted at the news. As much as I wanted to tell her that the idea of bringing back National Service is just another desperate gimmick from Rishi Sunak as he tries to court the old-fashioned right-wing brigade, I was tempted to say I’d already put her name on the waiting list. My daughters, who are 12 and 15, are the kind of kids who are so pampered, they refused to leave London for a trip to the countryside. They couldn’t live without their hair straighteners, so no wonder they’re horrified by the idea of a year in the military. I’ll be the first to concede that they could benefit from learning how to work in a team, self-discipline and tidiness, but there are other ways to do that, which don’t involve joining a regiment. National Service was originally a post-war scheme that meant physically fit men between 17 and 21 had to serve in the armed forces for 18 months. The Tories’ announcement that they want to bring it back is supposed to get older voters’ juices flowing just in time for the ‘Genny Lex.’ Anyone with common sense will argue that the military aspect of National Service is a billion-pound waste of money. Former naval chief Adm Alan West has described the plan as ‘bonkers’; Labour leader Keir Starmer branded the idea of a ‘teenage dad’s army’, ‘desperate’.

If Sunak has any hope of getting their votes, he’s just crushed it. (The poor man’s on TikTok too. Next thing we know he’ll be frugging to Bronski Beat.) Besides, the last thing the hard-working Armed Forces need are a bunch of whingeing teenagers cruising in on electric scooters, sniggering at TikTok and moaning about having to get up before midday. Forcing headstrong 18-year-olds to do something they don’t want to is hardly a morale booster. But there is the tiniest glimmer of a good idea in all this. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Giving teenagers the opportunity to volunteer, help their communities and learn more about people outside their own echo chamber. Mixing with older people is so beneficial for both generations, as I saw in the pre-Covid days when my daughters’ school choir went to sing at a care home. And I know I personally benefit from volunteering at a disco for over-65s – I can’t think of anything I do that’s more uplifting. Research by the National Council For Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) reported that 77% of 18-24-year-old volunteers felt less isolated after volunteering. So getting young people who are able to give up one weekend a month to spend time with people who work in the NHS or help older people who are isolated isn’t a massive sacrifice, but it could be a real eye-opener. The best skills we can give our teenagers are a sense of compassion and empathy – and that comes from learning about other people’s lives and being able to help those who need it. While volunteering has obvious benefits, billing it as National Service is alarmist . I’ve seen people argue that National Service will give the younger generation a sense of pride in ‘Great’ Britain. I’m not being funny, but faced with an under-funded NHS and no chance of ever owning their own homes, it’ll take a lot more than that to give young people a feeling of hope or patriotism. And does it even occur to the Conservative Party that not everyone would be able to afford an entire year off after school ends? What about young carers, already shouldering the responsibility of earning and looking after their families, or youngsters living with disabilities and mental health conditions , who face having their benefits cut ? This generation of teenagers have already had it particularly tough, with their education disrupted and their mental health in crisis after the pandemic... so there does need to be caveats in any type of mandated scheme. All political parties would be wise to actually spend some time around young people before plucking these policies out of thin air. Young people aren’t the selfish losers they’re painted as. My daughters and their friends would love the chance to do something useful to help other people. Start them volunteering sooner, while they’re at school, rather than when they’re trying to make a living or start a degree. Taking a couple of hours out of the school week to do voluntary work could be hugely beneficial in terms of teaching kids empathy and new skills. I’ve seen how much volunteering has helped my own mental health – it’s not just a selfless act, but a way to give yourself a boost by doing something good for others.

If National Service was a fully-funded, Government-backed scheme to support young people to volunteer rather than a scary prospect of being sent off to the military, I’d definitely encourage my daughters to take part. But spending £2.5billion on the scheme is not what the UK and our teetering economy needs right now. The money this scheme is slated to cost could be better spent improving NHS services, alleviating child poverty, supporting teenage carers – and providing real training schemes to get young people in the workplace.

        "content": "Listen to Story A person who witnessed the horrific May 19 accident in Pune involving a Porsche car , told India Today TV that the luxury vehicle was overspeeding and the teen driver was drunk at the time of the crash. As a result of the impact, one of the two victims, who died on the spot, was thrown 15 feet in the air, the witnesses recalled. \"The speed limit of the Porsche was so high that we did not actually see the crash, but only heard a very loud sound,\" the witness said. \"The car stopped a little ahead of the crash site because the airbags got deployed. After the minor driver got down from the car, I caught hold of him, took him to the accident site and showed him what he had done,\" he said. The teen driver was drunk and was beaten by the crowd that gathered at the spot, he said, adding \"But it had no effect on him.\" The witness went on to say that the police arrived within minutes and took the teen driver to a station. The 17-year-old boy involved in the Pune crash has been sent to the Children Observation Centre for 14 days. The teenager had consumed alcohol at one bar, and then moved on to another on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, before the deadly car crash. Two IT professionals from Madhya Pradesh - Aneesh Awadhiya and his friend Ashwini Koshta - died after their motorbike was hit by the Porsche. While Ashwini died on the spot, Aneesh was shifted to a city hospital, where he died soon after.",

        "content": "PARIS -- The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, May 27, 2024, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal’s last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,” said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. / AP",

        "description": "Worldcoin has tweeted that more of its ‘orbs’ are coming, days after it was blocked from operating in Hong Kong. It aims to assign ‘World IDs' to global citizens as an ‘international proof of personhood'. With these IDs, people will not need to share their personal details to interact with web and websites.",
        "content": "The Worldcoin project, led by OpenAI's Sam Altman, has announced that it will introduce more Orbs for verifications soon. The announcement comes days after the project was barred from operating in Hong Kong. Despite the threat of being banned in multiple parts of the world, Worldcoin has shown no signs of halting. Developed by the initiative, Orbs are devices that scan people's irises to identify them and issue a proof-of-personhood. This data collection has drawn the ire of critics around the world and Hong Kong is the latest region to bar the project. Worldcoin to Introduce More Orbs On Monday, Worldcoin's official X (formerly Twitter) handle tweeted ‘More orbs are coming', while an unverified Worldcoin account informed users about the next WLD token drop. As per CoinMarketCap , the WLD tokens are currently priced $4.60 (roughly Rs. 380). As per information available on the project's website over 165,000 new accounts have been created with Worldcoin over the last seven days, bringing the total of unique humans to 5.4 million. As of Tuesday, the project claims to have existed for 309 days and has managed to have connected with people from over 160 nations. The website also says that up until now, Worldcoin has manufactured 2,000 orbs. The project, also plans to expand its community in the near future through token airdrops and competitions that people can participate in to win rewards. Worldcoin Blocked From Operating in Second Region Last week, Hong Kong's Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) raised privacy concerns among Worldcoin's biometric data collection. In a statement released by the PCPD, it said that Worldcoin has admittedly scanned the eyes and faces of 8,302 individuals during its operation in Hong Kong. The PCPD said that Worldcoin's biometric scanning is ‘unnecessary and excessive'. Furthermore, the PCPD also claimed that that neither did the project provide a Privacy Notice and a Biometric Data Consent Form in Chinese language, nor did it inform people about the risks involved with the use of this biometric data for training AI protocols and retaining the data for a decade. “The Privacy Commissioner has served an enforcement notice on Worldcoin Foundation, directing it to cease all operations of the Worldcoin project in Hong Kong in scanning and collecting iris and face images of members of the public using iris scanning devices. If members of the public notices that Worldcoin is still operating at any premises with the iris scanning devices in Hong Kong, please report the matter immediately to the PCPD,” the statement noted. In March, Spain banned Worldcoin from collecting personal data and biometrics of Spanish citizens. Based in San Francisco, Worldcoin was officially launched in July 2023. It aims to assign ‘World IDs' to global citizens as an ‘international proof of personhood'. With these IDs, people will not need to share their personal details to interact with websites. Despite several concerns raised by privacy advocates, Worldcoin recently claimed that it has never sold any user data nor does it plan to. The project has been perceived as intrusive and is currently facing legal hurdles in countries like Nairobi and Italy as well.

The 43-year-old will be sentenced on June 19. On Jan 9, 2023, Faizal held a knife to a woman’s neck at Block 108 Yishun Ring Road. He told the court on May 28 he was then under the influence of methamphetamine or Ice, which a Central Narcotics Bureau urine test had confirmed. Videos of the incident, posted on Facebook, showed officers from the Singapore Police Force Emergency Response Team (ERT) at the scene. The ERT is a specialised tactical unit whose officers are equipped with tactical and counter-assault skills to respond to terror attacks and cases that involve firearms and dangerous weapons, such as knives. The officers, who were in bulletproof vests and armed with sub-machine guns, disarmed Faizal and arrested him. The woman suffered abrasions to her face. Faizal was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for medical examination. For abduction, an offender can be jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned or receive any combination of such punishments.",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 28: The Department of Telecom has imposed a penalty on Bharti Airtel for violating subscriber verification norms, the company informed the exchange in a filing on Tuesday. The company stated that it received a notice from the telecom department of Punjab LSA (Licensed Service Areas) on May 27 for violations of subscriber verification norms under the Licensee Agreement, following a sample CAF (Customer Application Form) audit conducted by the department for March 2024. The department has imposed a penalty of Rs 1,79,000 on the telecom operator for these violations. “The maximum financial impact is to the extent of the penalty levied,” said Bharti Airtel. Earlier, on April 19, the Department of Telecom Punjab LSA also imposed a penalty of Rs 1,56,000 for the same violation. Before that, in March, the Department of Telecom (DoT) imposed a penalty of around Rs 4 lakh on Bharti Airtel for violating subscriber verification norms. The penalties were imposed in the Delhi and Bihar circles. According to a regulatory filing with the National Stock Exchange (NSE) by Bharti Airtel, the Department of Telecommunications’ Delhi circle issued a notice imposing a penalty of Rs 2.55 lakh for “alleged violation of subscriber verification norms under the Licence Agreement, pursuant to Sample CAF Audit conducted by DoT for January 2023,” the filing said. The Bihar circle issued a notice imposing a Rs 1.46 lakh fine for “alleged violation of subscriber verification norms,” Bharti Airtel stated in a separate filing. For the Bihar circle, the notice was issued “pursuant to Sample CAF Audit conducted by DoT for January 2024,” the filing said. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in India has set guidelines and processes for verifying the identity of telecom subscribers. In June 2007, the DoT issued guidelines regarding subscriber verification to be followed by Telecom Enforcement Resource and Monitoring (TERM) Cells. These norms are crucial for maintaining accurate customer records and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. As per the guidelines, the telecom operators must implement KYC processes to verify the identity of subscribers during the on- boarding process. The DoT periodically conducts sample Customer Application Form (CAF) audits to assess compliance with subscriber verification norms. (Agencies)",

        "content": "To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Giovanni Pernice has declared ‘we are back’ following claims he is leaving Strictly Come Dancing while facing allegations about his training room techniques. In a new video, fellow Strictly star Anton Du Beke wrapped his arms around the Italian dancer, hugging him with glee as they spoke about their upcoming tour with excitement. Earlier this month, it was reported that the BBC programme was launching an investigation into Giovanni’s behaviour following accusations from three celebrities who he was previously partnered up with on the competition. It was claimed that his former partners Ranvir Singh, Laura Whitmore and Amanda Abbington – the last of whom withdrew from Strictly prematurely in 2023 – met up to ‘compare notes’ about their experiences with him. In a recent statement shared on social media, Giovanni, 33, said that he rejected ‘any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour’ , adding that he was looking forward to ‘clearing his name’ of any wrongdoing.

The performer is now looking forward to a new venture he’s embarking on with Strictly judge Anton, 57, as the pair of them prepare to head on a tour. Production company Strictly Theatre Co shared a video of the duo on Instagram in a dance studio, as they enthusiastically spoke about their first day of rehearsals for the tour, which is titled Together. ‘First day of rehearsals,’ Anton said, as Giovanni repeated his co-star’s statement. The judge continued: ‘Always my favourite day. Second day, less so.’ Chuckling, Giovanni responded jovially: ‘Because we have to remember everything we’ve done on day one, just like this.’ As Anton jokingly groaned about the prospect of having to remember all of their choreography, Giovanni declared: ‘We are back on tour. We are back. It feels nice,’ before giving his friend and colleague a hug. As Anton hugged him back, Giovanni said to the camera that they ‘can’t wait’ to see all of the fans who come to the show. The judge then outlined that the tour will be starting from June 14, and they will be ‘on the road’ until the end of July. He praised the ‘great show’ with its ‘amazing cast’, saying that the dancers and singers who are joining them on the tour are ‘remarkable’. After Giovanni reminded everyone that the show is called Together, Anton made a gesture between them, before drawing his Strictly co-star in closer. They then said in unison: ‘And whatever we do, we do it together.’ Several fans who commented on the video on Instagram expressed how delighted they were to see Anton and Giovanni reunited, with the pair also having worked together on their BBC travel TV series Anton & Giovanni’s Adventures in Sicily and Anton & Giovanni’s Adventures in Spain. ‘Lovely to see you both together. Have fun guys,’ a fan called Helen wrote, while Lisa added: ‘Amazing! Look forward to the show.’ Claire also shared: ‘Big hugs to you both, you are adorable together. Lots of love.’ In the statement that Giovanni posted on social media earlier this month in light of the allegations made against him, he wrote: ‘To my dear fans, You will be as surprised as I am that allegations have been made about my dance teaching methods in the media this week. ‘Of course, I reject any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour, and I look forward to clearing my name. ‘Those who have followed my journey on Strictly Come Dancing over the last decade will know that I am passionate and competitive.

        "content": "Vice President Kashim Shettima has called for a global partnership to address the problem of internal displacement in Nigeria, pledging the federal government’s unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of displaced citizens. He outlined the strategy adopted by the President Bola Tinubu administration in tackling Nigeria’s internal displacement challenge, saying the nation prioritises the welfare of its people, particularly in the current critical times. The vice president made the call yesterday during the launch of the “State Action Plans on Durable Solution to Internal Displacement” at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The action plan is a United Nations secretary general’s solution agenda on internal displacement which aims to help internally displaced persons find a durable solution to their displacement, prevent new displacement crises from emerging and ensure those facing displacement receive effective protection and assistance. Unveiling the programme being implemented in four northern states of Adamawa, Benue, Borno and Yobe, Shettima said, “For a country that has endured the devastations of economic disadvantages across generations, we cannot afford further expansion in the displacement of our people. So, we remain committed to ensuring that each displaced individual returns to a safer environment and is given a lifeline to start afresh.” He recalled his experience dealing with conflict and displacement, just as he emphasised the need for a collaborative, cross-border approach to tackling the multifaceted challenge. “Let us harness the strength of our partnerships, both local and international, to bring about lasting change,” he urged. In a statement by his spokesman, Stanley Nkwocha, the vice President welcomed the support of the United States and other global partners, stressing that the task ahead demands a united front that transcends political divides. “We are here to craft solutions that will outlive us, that will offer future generations a place of hope, a home for all, and a land of opportunity where dreams can be pursued without worry. The journey is not merely about addressing the symptoms of displacement but also about tackling the root causes,” he stated. Outlining the strategy of the Tinubu administration, Shettima pledged investment in sustainable development, education, and economic opportunities as critical components of a comprehensive solution. “By doing so, we not only address the immediate needs of the displaced but also create a foundation for a more stable and prosperous future,” the VP said. He called for collaborative efforts transcending borders to bring about lasting change, stating that “the task ahead is immense, but with determination, unity, and a clear vision, we can make a profound difference”. On its part, the United Nations commended the efforts of the state governments in drafting action plans for durable solutions to internal displacement. Speaking virtually through an online conferencing platform, UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms Amina J. Mohammed, said attaining such solutions “is a priority for Nigeria and for the United Nations Secretary-General,” noting the global number of internally displaced persons has doubled in ten years to nearly 76 million globally. “Over four million Nigerians remain in search of solutions to their forced displacement,” she stated, adding that the state action plans “capture the first essential steps towards solutions.” Earlier in his remarks, the UN Assistant Secretary-General and Special Advisor on Durable Solutions, Mr Robert Piper, commended Nigeria’s commitment and leadership in being the first country among the 15 pilot countries to launch the programme. “Today, despite the warnings and the real challenges, I have the honour to say, on behalf of the Secretary-General, that Nigeria is the first of all our 15 pilot countries to formally launch government plans placing over 4 million IDPs and Returnees on pathways to solutions,” he noted. On his part, Borno State Governor Prof. Babagana Zulum, said the state government is fully committed to the implementation of the Action Plans on Durable Solutions, noting that 15% of the state’s annual budget will be dedicated to projects undertaken under the initiative. Zulum recalled the efforts of the state government in the past few years in returning displaced persons to their communities, assuring stakeholders at the meeting that the government’s commitment to the cause of displaced persons remains unwavering. Also, Governor Hyacinth Alia of Benue State said the launch of the state action plans on durable solutions to internal displacement is a beacon of hope and a catalyst for the transformation of lives and livelihoods in communities affected by conflict. He commended Vice President Shettima’s inspirational leadership as well as the commitment of all the development partners involved in the project which he said aligns with the vision of the Benue State government to build a society where all residents can live in peace and harmony.",

        "content": "Population Health Management Market Industry Share, Business Analysis And Future Growth 05-28-2024 11:58 AM CET | Health & Medicine Press release from: MAXIMIZE MARKET RESEARCH PVT. LTD. Population Health Management Market Population Health Management Market Overview Patient data are gathered from several health information technology sources for a programme known as population health management. Because of this, medical professionals can use the collected data to analyse and produce a single, easily accessible patient record, which benefits patients' clinical and financial outcomes. In population healthcare management programmes, a business intelligence technology is usually used to compile data so that healthcare providers may generate a precise and accurate clinical picture of each individual patient. Population Health Management Market Report Scope and Research Methodology The comprehensive analysis report offers valuable insights into the dynamics, trends, and future prospects of the Population Health Management industry during the forecast period. It covers key market drivers, challenges, and recent developments, along with demand trends, growth stimulators, spending patterns, and modernization trends across different regions. The research is based on extensive research and analysis, incorporating inputs from industry experts, government agencies, and market participants, providing a reliable and accurate assessment of the market dynamics and future trends. For in-depth information on this study, visit the following link: https://www.maximizemarketresearch.com/market-report/population-health-management-market/3838/ Population Health Management Market Dynamics Trend in the Market: Utilising the Value-Based Payment (VBP) Model to Expand the Healthcare Market: In the healthcare industry, move from value-based payment (VBP) to fee-for-service (FFS). This is mainly because organisations that successfully gather and evaluate population health data later on are more capable of organising and delivering care. By doing this, these healthcare companies and organisations are able to grow their income, which propels the market's expansion. Traditional fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement is being replaced with value-based payment (VBP). Using this approach, doctors submit claims to health insurers after accounting for clinical outcomes and the overall quality of treatment provided. Market Drivers increasing focus on personalised medicine: In addition, the increasing focus on customised care will offer beneficial opportunities for population health management to progress (PHM). Using cutting-edge analytics and predictive modelling techniques, healthcare businesses can treat every patient uniquely and achieve optimal results. More and more, analytics are being used to personalise cancer and other disease treatments. Population Health Management Market Segmentation by Component Services Software This market is segmented into software and services according to component. In 2022, the services sector held a dominant market share for population health management. The services segment includes analytics for value-based care and, in certain situations, strategic advice. The services, which include PHM programme maintenance and service updates that typically need to be updated on a regular basis, have been essential to these devices' domination in the market. The software segment's CAGR is anticipated to be lower during the projection period. The procurement of new PHM programmes by healthcare facilities and growing acceptability in emerging economies are anticipated to fuel demand for this segment and drive growth over the forecast period. by Platform Cloud-based On-Premise by End-User Healthcare Providers Healthcare Payers Others Throughout the projected period, the healthcare provider segment will continue to hold a dominant position based on the End-User. Based on end users, the market is segmented into healthcare payers, healthcare providers, and other end users. Healthcare providers are anticipated to be the leading segment in the forecast period due to the growing frequency of neurology, cardiology, and other disorders in developed and emerging countries, which is drawing in a sizeable patient pool suffering from acute and chronic conditions. It is thought that when the number of patients increases, PHM programme uptake will increase more quickly. The second-highest market revenue share of the sector is mostly attributable to changing reimbursement practices and an increase in healthcare payers throughout the projection period.

        "content": "A CONTROLLING girlfriend forced her boyfriend to swallow toothpaste and branded him a \"fat whale\" in a vile campaign of abuse. Sarah Rigby, 41, drove Gareth Jones to the brink of suicide after repeatedly belitting and bullying the NHS project manager. 5 Sarah Rigby controlled her boyfriend in a vile campaign of abuse Credit: Cavendish 5 Gareth Jones was left on the brink of suicide Credit: Cavendish The student nurse called the 40-year-old fat and made him eat salads in a warped bid to make him lose weight. She also forced him to wear a hat after ridiculing his hair and made him swallow toothpaste after wrongfully claiming he had bad breath. Rigby also kept control over Gareth's £4,000-a-month wages, threw him out the house in his underwear and checked his mobile phone. The mum-of-six admitted coercive behaviour but avoided jail and was instead handed a 20 month jail term suspended for two years. Gareth bravely revealed how even during the case, Rigby taunted him by showing up told Chester Crown Court with a £400 Marc Jacobs bag he was ordered to buy during a shopping trip to Harrods . He added: \"After the abuse started, the effect of being constantly belittled and abused made me nervous, feel degraded and worthless. My image of myself became distorted and I had low self esteem - I still feel like this to a degree. ''When she used to say things like I had halitosis and forced me to drink half a bottle of Listerine or eat toothpaste, I started to believe that I had things wrong with me. ''I had regular bruising on my body from when Sarah used to kick, bite, scratch or claw me. I was nervous to consult my GP for fear she would find out and beat me further.

I also feel nervous about telling people what has happened to me due to the stigma behind males not being seen as victims of domestic abuse. ''I think I will always be emotionally scarred by the effects the abuse that I've suffered.” The court heard how the couple got together in 2021 after meeting on Plenty of Fish. Gareth moved in with Rigby shortly after but she soon became controlling and told him he needed to lose weight if they were to remain in a relationship. The mum restricted what he ate, taunted him over his sexual performance and \"frisked\" him before leaving the house. If she was going out, Rigby made Gareth wander the streets until she returned and regularly branded him 'fat”, “lazy”, “sweaty”, “a whale”, “dopey”, “thick”, “smelly” and a “dog”. She also kept control of his finances, made him sleep on the floor as \"punishment\", barred him from using the toilet at home and made up false claims he had assaulted her. On one occasion, Rigby told him: \"If I’m not pregnant this month, I am going to find someone else to have sex with and get pregnant. I need to get pregnant this month. If I don’t, I’ll dump you.'' The evil student nurse also physically abused Gareth and left him with a scar on his nose after hitting him with a glass candle holder.

        "content": "The Puducherry government is planning to procure 75 more electric buses under the PM e-bus scheme. Official sources said the Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL), on behalf of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), had aggregated the demand from cities shortlisted under the scheme in January this year. States including Maharashtra, Haryana, Odisha, Gujarat and Meghalaya and Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir have been selected in the first phase. As many as 3,800 buses will be rolled out in the first phase and Puducherry is eligible for 100 e-buses. Puducherry has been qualified in the list of States and UTs selected in the first phase and the Government has planned to introduce e-buses under the PM e-bus scheme. With the U.T. waiting for the delivery of its first tranche of electric buses being procured under the Smart City scheme, the Transport Department has submitted a demand for 75 electric buses to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). A Detailed Project Report has been submitted to the Union Government. The initiative is aimed at promoting clean and sustainable public transportation through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in urban centres across India. According to an official, “Puducherry plans to run 50 buses on inter-city routes and the remaining on mofussil routes. Of the 75 AC buses, 50 will be 12-metres long and will be deployed on inter-city routes while the rest (9-metres long) will be deployed within urban areas.” The official added, “States or cities will be responsible for running the bus services and making payments to the bus operators. The Central government will support these bus operations by providing subsidies to the extent specified in the scheme.” Under the scheme, the government will provide ₹24 and ₹22 per km per bus deployed on inter-city routes and urban areas respectively to the administration and the remaining amount will be borne by the U.T. For cities in the first segment, depot infrastructure will also be developed or upgraded to support the new e-buses, including the creation of behind-the-meter power infrastructure like substations. For those in the second segment, initiatives will focus on bus priority, infrastructure, multimodal interchange facilities, automated fare collection systems, and charging infrastructure. A Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) will also be put in place by the Centre to protect e-bus suppliers and help in adoption of electric vehicles. PSM will ensure that e-bus suppliers are paid for their vehicles in the event of improper upkeep of vehicles, inefficiencies in fare collection and poor health of State Transport Utilities.

        "description": "España cuenta con un nuevo tratamiento farmacológico para el glaucoma, una enfermedad causada por el aumento de la tensión ocular que tiene consecuencias fatales.",
        "content": "España cuenta con un nuevo tratamiento farmacológico para el glaucoma , una enfermedad causada por el aumento de la tensión ocular que tiene consecuencias fatales. Se trata de la primera innovación en este campo en 25 años que actúa directamente sobre la \"malla trabecular\" (tejido esponjoso ubicado cerca de la córnea a través del cual fluye el humor acuoso fuera del ojo). Esta patología oftalmológica produce una perdida de visión, que es irreversible e irrecuperable. El glaucoma también se le conoce como la \"ceguera silenciosa\" porque no produce síntomas que avisen de la presencia de esta enfermedad. Sin embargo, es \"extraordinariamente\" frecuente. Afecta en torno a un 2,5% de los mayores de los 40 años. El 3% de la población española tiene glaucoma, es decir, un millón de personas. No solo es importante por el número de pacientes, ha subrayado el doctor Francisco Muñoz Negrete , presidente de la Sociedad Española de Glaucoma , durante un encuentro con periodistas especializados en Madrid, sino por sus consecuencias. Glaucoma: una patología que está \"oculta\" Dentro de esta enfermedad, existen cuatro subtipos: glaucoma de ángulo abierto primario (GAAP), glaucoma de ángulo cerrado primario (GACP), glaucoma secundario y glaucoma del desarrollo o congénito. Los pacientes con glaucoma de ángulo abierto primario son asintomáticas hasta que se produce una notable pérdida de visión, mientras que las personas con glaucoma de ángulo cerrado primario pueden sufrir síntomas como dolor intenso y repentino en un ojo, náuseas, vómitos, enrojecimiento del ojo, visión disminuida o nublada. En esta enfermedad, que es la segunda causa de ceguera más común y la principal causa de ceguera irreversible a nivel mundial, es fundamental la detección precoz para frenar su avance . Hasta ahora, el tratamiento del glaucoma se basa en reducir la presión intraocular para ralentizar la ceguera . Pero, las últimas innovaciones han permitido desarrollar una nueva alternativa terapéutica, que además de disminuir la presión intraocular y que actúa sobre el origen de la enfermedad. El doctor Muñoz Negrete ha resaltado que Roclanda , del laboratorio Santen, \"este lanzamiento marca un antes y un después, y representa un hito, ya que por primera vez en 25 años tenemos un tratamiento médico con un mecanismo de acción nuevo, como son los inhibidores de la ROCK, que actúan en esta malla trabecular\". Desde el pasado mes de abril los pacientes con glaucoma tienen acceso a este medicamento. Está cubierto por el Sistema Nacional de Salud. Roclanda es un colirio que se administra una sola vez al día. Como ha recalcado Teresa del Río , directora médica de Santen, \"su uso solo está contraindicado en casos de hipersensibilidad a sus componentes, lo que supone una ventaja frente al resto de combinaciones fijas que se dispone actualmente\" La exposición de los pacientes hasta el 18 de junio de 2023 era de unos 113 932 pacientes y desde entonces se han expuesto más pacientes no se han producido problemas de seguridad importantes durante la fase posterior a su comercialización. El carácter silencioso de esta enfermedad de los ojos hace que las revisiones rutinarias son la mejor forma de coger a tiempo el glaucoma. Y si encima tenemos alguno de los factores de riesgo (edad, raza, miopía, antecedentes familiares...), las revisiones son completamente esenciales. Para el diagnóstico del glaucoma en concreto, el oftalmólogo realizará un estudio en profundidad de la forma y color del nervio óptico , el campo visual completo, el espesor corneal y, sobre todo, conocer y ver la evolución de la presión intraocular. Para ello se utilizan distintos equipos tecnológicos como tonómetros, campímetros, gonioscopios, paquímetros o tomógrafos de coherencia óptica. Y aunque por los nombres de este instrumental parezca otra cosa, estás revisiones no duelen. Delfina Balonga , paciente y vicepresidenta de la Asociación de Glaucoma para Afectados y Familiares (AGAF), tiene esta enfermedad de nacimiento. Pero, el glaucoma no le impidió que aprendiera a leer y a escribir, ni estudiar una carrera y aprobar unas oposiciones. Y todo con una visión del 30% en el ojo derecho (que posteriormente perdió en un accidente) y un 15% del izquierdo.

        "description": "Benoit Blanc is back, and he could be joined by some new stars in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.",
        "content": "More details about Netflix 's third installment to the popular whodunnit Knives Out Mystery are emerging about its cast. As we reported last week , the next chapter of Benoit Blanc's hugely entertaining adventures will once again bring back Daniel Craig, who is clearly having the time of his life, and it'll be called Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery . While Netflix hasn't yet officially confirmed any other members joining the murder mystery ensemble (we've reached out to the streamer for comment and will update this story if we hear back), rumors are beginning to surface that Craig will likely be joined by another stellar cast this time around. We're not talking about Lindsay Lohan and Tom Hardy, but Cailee Spaeny and Josh O’Connor, which a new report from The Hollywood Reporter confirms are now in talks. It's important to stress that so far only one name has been confirmed, and that's Daniel Craig. But clearly someone close to the production is having trouble keeping secrets, so casting details – or at least potential casting details – are emerging despite Netflix's best efforts at news management. If the latest report is correct, it's an interesting one. Cailee Spaeny has been making waves recently, starring as Jessie in Civil War and delivering a superb performance as Priscilla Presley in the Elvis biopic Priscilla . And Josh O'Connor has been impressive as Prince Charles in The Crown , and has been getting good reviews for his role in Challengers too. As for Lohan and Hardy, you might need to curb your excitement a little. What's On Netflix is reporting that while both actors were indeed in talks, those talks \"are now believed to have fallen through\". No matter who's in the final cast, it's a safe bet that the third Knives Out will be another big hit for Netflix. Glass Onion has an impressive 91% on Rotten Tomatoes and the original Knives Out has 97%, with both movies delivering the elusive combination of critical acclaim and seriously big viewing numbers. No doubt Netflix is seriously hoping that director Rian Johnson has some ideas for a fourth installment too. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.",

        "content": "German state-owned legacy plant operator Uniper will install a 50MW/100MWh BESS at a soon-to-be-decommissioned coal facility in partnership with NGEN, an energy storage operator and technology provider based in Slovenia. The companies will build the 2-hour battery energy storage system (BESS) at the Heyden 875MW hard coal power plant site in Petershagen, with a commercial operation date (COD) expected in 2025. The Heyden plant, one of the most powerful in Germany, will be decommissioned by Uniper on 30 September, 2024. Decommissioned power plant sites provide excellent locations for new clean energy projects with substantial existing grid infrastructure and interconnections which can be re-utilised. The new BESS will comprise of 26 energy storage packs, so around 3.85MWh each. In an interview with in September 2023, NGEN CEO Roman Bernard said the company had Tesla’s Megapack’s have an energy storage capacity of 3.9MWh. NGEN is a developer and operator of those projects but also describes itself as a provider of energy solutions, with its own energy management system (EMS) platform, Energy Smart Grid Platform, which can aggregate numerous technologies into virtual power plants (VPPs). As part of the move into Germany the company will open an office in Frankfurt. Uniper was formed through the spin-off of German multinational energy company E.On’s electricity generation businesses from its retail utility operations, after the split became effective at the beginning of 2016. Uniper is aiming to be carbon-neutral by 2040, and for 80% of its generating capacity to be zero-carbon by 2030. This includes growing its renewable and clean energy portfolio but also converting its legacy gas plants to alternative gases like hydrogen and biomethane. Germany’s grid-scale energy storage market has picked up in the last few years with the right market and policy signals incentivising investment in large-scale projects. has recently reported on BESS projects of around 230MWh being launched by developers and .

        "content": "Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Romeo D. Lumagui Jr. reports that a raid in several locations in Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur resulted in the confiscation of 347,869 packs of illicit cigarettes last April 24, 2024. The illicit traders will be facing P219,157,470.00 in tax liability. “Residential houses are now being used as warehouses by traders of illicit cigarettes. If you see any signs of illicit cigarettes or vape products in your neighborhood, report the same to the BIR. Illicit trade destroys legitimate businesses. It destroys the livelihoods of millions of Filipinos. It undermines fair competition. We urge all consumers to stop buying illicit cigarettes and vape,” Commissioner Lumagui stated. The illicit traders involved in the aforementioned raid violated Section 236: Failure to Register its Business as an Excise Taxpayer; Section 255: Failure to File Return (Excise), supply correct and accurate information; Section 258: Unlawful Pursuit of Business; Section 263: Unlawful Possession or Removal of Articles Subject to Excise Tax without Payment of Tax; and Section 265: – Offenses relating to Stamps under the National Internal Revenue Code. Administrative penalties, which include assessments that may be multiplied ten times, may also be included. The raid was made possible due to the assistance of Air Force Intelligence, the Military Intelligence Group, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines 401st Brigade. We will continue to work with various enforcement agencies as part of our campaign against illicit trade. Upon discovery of the cigarettes, the items were immediately identified as illicit because none of the items bore the required BIR stamps. The unexplained possession of illicit cigarettes, the tax on which has not been paid, is already punishable by imprisonment under the National Internal Revenue Code. We will include the owners of these warehouses and residential houses in the cases that we will file. Liability attaches to the possessor of the illicit goods. The BIR has been consistent in addressing illicit cigarettes and vape. It will continue its crusade against these products, in line with the directive from President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. to expand and strengthen efforts to protect the tobacco industry against illicit cigarettes and vape. “Ang pagbebenta ng ilegal na sigarilyo at vape ay isang krimen. Hindi na nga sila nagbabayad ng tamang buwis, pinapatay pa nila ang mga lehitimong negosyo na bumubuhay sa milyun-milyong Pilipino. Wag po tayong bibili ng ilegal na sigarilyo at vape. I-report po natin ang mga nagbebenta nito,” Commissioner Lumagui stated.",

        "content": "Bengaluru: Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) President and Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Tuesday said that around 300 candidates want to contest the Legislative Council elections on the Congress ticket. “It is not possible for us to accommodate all these 300 candidates who come from every segment and region of our state. The party high command will decide on who will fight from which segment,” the Deputy Chief Minister told media persons before leaving for New Delhi to meet the high command. He said that there is demand from all regions to give representation. “Some seats have sitting MLCs and others have worked for the party at various levels,” the Deputy Chief Minister said. Earlier, Karnataka Home Minister G. Parameshwar said that the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister should not make all the decisions regarding the selection of the candidates. “We will of course take feedback into account before taking any decision,” the Deputy Chief Minister said while reacting to the Home Minister’s remarks. Given the number of MLAs, the Congress can elect seven MLCs in the Legislative Council known as the Upper House. The election of 11 MLCs will be held on June 13.",

But that hasn't stopped stopping parents Kate Middleton, 42, and Prince William, 41, from trying to give the young royals as 'normal' an upbringing as possible. 10 Kate Middleton and Prince William are trying to give their kids as 'normal' an upbringing as possible Credit: AFP 10 Kate and William do the school run and opted for a very private school in Berkshire Credit: Getty While that may be tricky considering they're constantly in the public eye, the Prince and Princess of Wales have previously revealed the values and life lessons they've instilled in the children.

During a visit to Nottingham Trent University in 2023, Kate highlighted the importance of putting yourself out of your comfort zone and throwing yourself into new things. \"I remember university for me was one of those great opportunities to try out new hobbies, and that has carried through now,\" she said. \"I loved trying out new things, and challenging myself, whether (in) sports, music, or art.\" “It’s one of the things with my kids too, just trying out new things, and university for me was when I learned to try out because there is so much on offer.\" She continued: “I love being outside and being a part of all the different sports clubs, so doing things like hockey and tennis at university.

The royal chose to read The Owl Who Was Afraid Of The Dark by Jill Tomlinson, which tells the story of baby barn owl Plop, who is helped by others to grow in confidence and overcome his fears. Kate commented: \"Wow, what an encouraging tale. \"We can all feel scared sometimes just like our little owl friend Plop, but as Mrs Barn Own said, 'It’s better to find out about the things that scare us before we make up our mind'. \"And with the help of others, we can often face things that worry us.

During an engagement at Basildon Sporting Centre, Kate met fan Janet Emery and spoke about how essential a warm embrace is within her family. As Janet leaned in to offer the royal a hug, the mum-of-three pointed out: \"Hugs are very important.

As MyLondon reports, the down-to-earth royals have encouraged their children to write thank you notes just like Diana did with a young William and Harry. Royal expert Andrew Morton told how the late royal was eager for Prince Harry and William to be exposed to life outside the Palace and commented: \"She took the young royals with her on her private charity visits from a young age. \"One of the reasons was she didn't want the boys to grow up thinking the whole world was 4x4 Range Rovers, shotguns and nannies.\" Meanwhile, a source claimed that Kate and William have adopted a similar approach with their own children.

It has been an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family, but I've had a fantastic medical team who have taken great care of me, for which I am so grateful. In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment. This of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be OK. As I have said to them; I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits. Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too. As is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you. It means so much to us both. We hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery. At this time, I am also thinking of all those whose lives have been affected by cancer. For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone.",

Lagbaja gave the charge yesterday during his maiden visit to the Engineering Depot in Kaduna, where he was briefed by commander, Major-General Babatunde Alaya on the engineering efforts of the Depot in rebuilding, reboring and refitting damaged and broken combat vehicles in support of formations and units of the Nigerian Army. In a statement by the director of Army public relations, Major-General Onyema Nwachukwu, Lagbaja urged the personnel to sustain the current operational momentum and successes by supporting the troops on the frontlines through swift engineering interventions in rebuilding and repairing Combat equipment. The army chief said the CED remains pivotal in ensuring the sustenance of equipment in the inventory of the Nigerian Army. He commended the Commander, officers, soldiers, and civilian staff of the DEPOT for diligently keying into his Command Philosophy to “transform the Nigerian Army into a well-trained, equipped and highly motivated force towards achieving our constitutional responsibilities within a joint environment”. He lauded the earlier leadership of the NA for resuscitating the comatose former Central Engineering Depot which has now been transformed into a viable and innovative Command Engineering Depot. During the visit, General Lagbaja inspected the various production sections of the depot and interacted with the personnel. He was accompanied by the Commandant Nigerian Defence Academy, Major-General John Ochai, GOC 2 division, Major-General Lander Saraso and principal staff officers from the Nigerian Army.",

        "content": "We’ve all had bad days at work, those times when you just wish you’d just stayed in bed to avoid some awful mistake or embarrassment. Well pity the Mexican government worker who accidentally snapped the arm off a mummy while carrying out renovations at the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). The mummified individual is one of several buried in the 19th Century and now on display at the museum. The INAH has since accused the Mexican city of Guanajuato of mistreating the Central American nation’s famous mummified artefacts, and said it would demand answers from the federal government . The archaeology agency also intends to apply for records of the renovation, the permits, and the government workers involved. ‘These events confirm that the way the museum’s collection was moved is not the correct one and that far from applying proper corrective and conservation strategies, the actions carried out resulted in damages, not only to this body,’ the institute wrote in a statement. ‘It appears that this situation is related to a lack of knowledge about proper protocols and the lack of training of the personnel in charge of carrying out these tasks.’ INAH did not say what or, if any, other bits had fallen off the mummies. The preserved corpses were unintentionally mummified when they were buried in crypts in a dry, mineral-rich soil environment in the mining state of Guanajuato. Some still have hair, leathery skin and their original clothing. The incident is far from the only archaeological accident to happen during mundane museum work.

        "content": "Hyundai Motor India has said that it will offer 684 technologically advanced assistive devices to people with various kinds of disabilities in the next three years. Under its social good initiative, Hyundai Motor India Foundation (HMIF), the car manufacturer distributed 72 of these devices, including specially designed wheelchairs, hearing aids, digital kits for the visually-impaired, bionic limbs and other devices, to differently-abled people in Bengaluru on May 24. Kinds of assistive devices Samarthanam Trust for the Disabled, an NGO, is helping HMIF to identify people across the country who would require such devices. These technologically advanced assistive devices aim to enhance mobility, vision, hearing, and communication capabilities for the recipients, according to the company. Speaking at a conclave, organised in the City by Hyundai Motors India, the company’s Chief Operating Officer, Tarun Garg said, ‘Samarth by Hyundai’, an initiative for specially-abled people reflected the company’s commitment to leveraging technology for the empowerment of individuals with disabilities in India. “At Hyundai Motor India, we don’t just make cars but also believe in empowering society as a whole with the help of technology and innovation. Through ‘Samarth by Hyundai’, we aim to create a more inclusive society and ease the way of living for people with disabilities in the country. Disability is part of diversity and we just have to correct the mindset to make the whole world barrier-free and inclusive,’‘ he said. Arman Ali, Executive Director of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People, an NGO, said making disability inclusive should not remain only as a discussion in isolation, but there should be a holistic approach supported by the right policies, funding, infrastructure, accessibility and affordability. 20 para-athletes adopted Mahantesh G. Kivadasannavar, Founder and Managing Trustee of Samarthanam Trust for the Disabled, said, “Progress for humanity means empowering every individual to reach their full potential.” Other experts who spoke at the conclave said close to 24.8 crore people in India have some kind of disability. However, sadly, only less than 3% of these people have access to any assistive devices. According to the World Health Organisation, 16% of the world’s population lives with some kind of inability. According to Garg, Hyundai is planning to rope in 120 schools in six cities across the country to create awareness about disability among students. The company has also adopted 20 para-athletes for the next three years. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Karnataka / bengaluru",

The funnyman admitted he was extremely concerned about how the forecasted heavy rain would affect his delicate flowers. 6 Comedian Tom Allen was concerned about how the bank holiday rain was going to affect his peonies Credit: TikTok/@tomindeed 6 He turned the camera to show the ominous looking sky Credit: TikTok/@tomindeed 6 He then began to put together the makeshift shelter, using four bamboo sticks Credit: TikTok/@tomindeed 6 He used the cover for his fire pit to place on top of the sticks as a kind of roof Credit: TikTok/@tomindeed So he decided to try and come up with a way of protecting them from the downpour. He documented the process in a video on his TikTok page, as he began: \"So I'm very worried because my peonies have literally just bloomed and the sky has gone like that. \"And I'm very concerned there's going to be heavy rain and and it's going to get rid of all the beautiful petals. \"So I'm going to build a shelter for it, using four bamboo sticks and the cover for the fire pit.\" He then carefully positioned the bamboo sticks around the peonies, before using them to hold up the circular covering from his fire pit. \"Disaster averted!\" he said, adding: \"Although they keep sticking out!\" However, the video concluded by showing the rain bucketing down, while the flowers were nice and protected beneath the makeshift shelter. \"Disaster nearly averted,\" he captioned the video.

May gardening jobs The Sun's Gardening Editor, Veronica Lorraine, has shared the tasks you need to crack on with in May. GARDEN growth can go from nought to ninety in May, depending on the weather. The last UK frosts are generally seen at the beginning of the month, so all of a sudden there’s so much more to do and grow. Plant out dahlia tubers It's a joy to finally plant out your dahlia tubers. Remember how big they can get - and space accordingly - anything up to half a metre apart. It's a good idea to put your support stakes in now instead of trying to work around them. And make sure you include lots of well rotted manure or decent compost to feed it and then mulch to keep it moist and suppress weeds. They generally start blooming in July. Final feed to Spring flowers You can give a cheeky feed to all your remaining tulips and daffodils. Although the majority of bulbs aren’t guaranteed to come back year after year any more, as long as you’ve left them to die back naturally there’s a good chance they’ll have stored enough energy to come back again. Tomato feed is fine. Tie up climbers Your clematis, honeysuckle and rambling roses should be well on their way by now - try to use plastic free string to tie them back into their support, or tuck them round each other to make sure they don’t sprout off in crazy directions. Feed the lawn It’s not too late to give your lawn a good feed. Whether you use granular or liquid, it can give it a good boost to see it through the harsher summer months. While mowing, don’t go too low with your cut length yet and never take more than a third off the grass height. Get creative It’s also time to get creative with hanging baskets and pots. Trailing pelargoniums, which a lot of people call geraniums, and Begonias are a good, low cost way of getting lovely returning blooms throughout the summer in your baskets. And pots can be planted with spring bulbs. Don't forget the greenhouse ! Give your greenhouse a good tidy and clean the glass inside and out. The improved light will help plants grow quicker inside and tidying is good for the soul. You can just use a household white wine vinegar and water solution - or even neat if you’re feeling spendy - which gives a really good shine. \"Too cute! My rock roses were squashed, your foresight is enviable,\" someone else sighed. \"That’s just the sweetest,\" another wrote. \"As Mother Nature mistreats them every year!\" \"Well done Tom, Peonies are so beautiful well worth preserving,\" someone else said. While another agreed: \"It always happens!

        "content": "Fortnite may have been the game that propelled Ninja to fame but it sounds like he’s quickly falling out of love with it this season. Ninja is one of the most well known livestreamers in the world and has been playing Fortnite since it first launched in 2017. It’s still the game he plays the most today, but it seems he’s not happy with the current season. Over the years, Ninja has developed strong opinions about the games that he’s spent countless hours in. Recently, he described players of Call Of Duty as ‘disgusting and mentally abused’ when discussing last year’s controversial Modern Warfare 3. This time Fortnite is in his crosshairs, as Ninja condemns the introduction of vehicles, arguing that the new feature will make the game less confrontational and puts too much importance on which vehicle you have. The most recent season in Fortnite adds new mods to make vehicles more powerful, including a machinegun turret and grenade launcher. It also introduces the resource Nitro, which makes you or your vehicle faster and even lets you destroy builds as you smash into them. Ninja is no fan, as he explains: ‘We’re going to land in the middle of nowhere, we’re going to loot up, we’re going to find a vehicle, we’re going to f****** not attack anyone. ‘And then we’re going to play like the biggest f****** losers in the world, because this season is absolute dog f****** water,’ he says, and adds : ‘If I was a five-year-old that still loved cool cars I would be having the time of my life. [...] I’m a 32-year-old grown man who likes to shoot things in video games, and now I have to drive a vehicle around and pray that I run into people that have a worse vehicle than me.’ At another point in the livestream Ninja gets downed by a vehicle with a machinegun turret, and tells his fans he’s had enough. ‘Yeah, I will not be playing this season,’ he says, insisting that he will be playing Valorant and League Of Legends instead, for the next few months. ‘I’m not joking. I just got killed in three seconds by a vehicle, by a turret, by a guy just literally seat-swapping. I didn’t have a car to run away, so I died. [...] It feels like you’re playing a different game right now,’ he says . Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 trailer confirms roadmap leak – Lethal Company skin revealed 10,000 Street Fighter 6 fans play as Akuma at the same time - mayhem ensues QTCinderella is so good at baking cookies Speedrun is changing the rules Elon Musk asks Twitch streamers to move to Twitter - they say no Vehicles have been a part of Fortnite for years, starting off as drivable shopping trolleys, but becoming more elaborate over time, until now when you can add different weapons to numerous vehicles that spawn around the map. Ninja does have a point, in that it has certainly changed how Fortnite is played, but every season has its gimmicks, needed to keep the game fresh, and vehicles are unlikely to be the focus again for a while after this.

        "content": "Popular fast food chain Burger King is unleashing a new value meal box just in time for its 70th birthday – and it’s got a surprising new item inside. Burger King was first established back in 1954, by James McLamore and David Edgerton, who dreamt of a restaurant serving high-quality food items at an affordable price. Following the successes of other fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s (established in 1940), they introduced the ever-popular Whopper burger in 1957, three years after opening. Now, with over 18,000 locations worldwide, its burgers are some of the most popular in the world. In honor of its 70th birthday, Burger King is releasing a $6 Birthday Meal Box, at the value price of, you guessed it, six dollars. It features a Whopper Jr, small fries, a small drink, The Birthday Pie Slice features a super creamy birthday cake-inspired filling, along with a cookie crumb base, topped with plenty of rainbow sprinkles in keeping with the theme. As well as this, as of May 28, Burger King is rolling out a whole bunch of freebies. These include: This isn’t the only thing that Burger King customers have to get excited about. In a May company call, US and Canada Burger King President Tom Curtis signed off on a new $5 value Though we’re not sure exactly what this $5 value meal box contains yet, we know that customers will have the choice of one of three sandwiches, along with nuggets, fries, and a drink.",

Silva, president of Argentina’s National Securities Commission, said in a blog post that the country is looking to “strengthen our ties with El Salvador and are exploring potential collaboration agreements.” Silva recognized El Salvador’s position as a global leader in the use of Bitcoin and other digital assets. El Slavador, in 2021, became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender, leading to a surge in tourism and going on Bitcoin spending sprees. Now Argentina is looking to explore Bitcoin as legal tender too. Argentina is the 22nd largest country by GDP with a population of over 45 million people.",

        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel have nosedived with the diplomatic recognitions by two EU members , and Madrid insisting on Monday that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to rethink their position. Slovenia’s Prime Minister Robert Golob said Monday his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries, including stops in Oslo and Dublin, to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively. “The recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries,\" Norway's top diplomat said. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel and Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen, Denmark and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report. Follow AP's Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain, Norway and Ireland moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations designed to add international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to last year’s Hamas-led attack. Tel Aviv slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told his nation in a televised address from Madrid that “this is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.\" Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz quickly lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Ireland and Norway soon joined Spain in formalizing a decision they had jointly announced the previous week. The Palestinian flag was raised in Dublin outside Leinster House, the seat of the Irish parliament. “This is an important moment and I think it sends a signal to the world that there are practical actions you can take as a country to help keep the hope and destination of a two-state solution alive at a time when others are trying to sadly bomb it into oblivion,” Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said before his Cabinet meets to formally sign off on the decision. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel have nosedived with the diplomatic recognitions by two EU members , and Madrid insisting on Monday that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Harris, the Irish leader, insisted Tuesday the EU should consider economic sanctions for Israel, saying “Europe could be doing a hell of a lot more.\" Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to rethink their position. Slovenia’s Prime Minister Robert Golob said Monday his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries, including stops in Oslo and Dublin, to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively.\" “The recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries,\" Norway's top diplomat said. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, Jill Lawless in London, Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen, Denmark and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report. Follow AP's Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

        "content": "It’s hard to know exactly how and why Henry Shefflin’s reign as Galway senior hurling manager has unravelled but let’s pull on one thread to start. Looking back now, with three years down, no silverware and a Championship exit from the Leinster round robin casting doubt over whether he’ll be back to take charge of his adopted county again, it’s worth returning to the endgame of last year’s Leinster final. In the words of one of the central characters Pádraig Mannion, what unfolded was a ‘freak’ set of circumstances. With injury time running out, it looked like Galway had done enough to give Shefflin his first meaningful trophy since the shock announcement in the autumn of 2021 that he would be heading out west for his first post in inter-county senior management. Silverware would go some way to justifying a move that didn’t sit comfortably with plenty of the Kilkenny supporters who would have adored him as a player. In a Kilkenny shirt, he could do no wrong, a glittering career franked by his status as the alltime Championship scorer and the only player in the history of the game to win 11 All-Ireland senior medals. During the Brian Cody era, he was the manager’s trusted on-field lieutenant. But here he was, on the verge of overseeing Galway’s first Leinster title since 2018 and denying Derek Lyng his first title in his first year taking up the baton since Cody abruptly departed. And then it all unravelled in a truly astonishing passage of play. When Brian Concannon fired over a point to put Galway two ahead, well over four minutes of the allotted five had elapsed. The last passage of play that unfolded involved a messy combination of missed pick-ups and half-strikes in the corner of the field between the Hogan Stand and Davin Stand before the ball was played across the Galway goal. How one of Galway’s best players on the day Mannion managed to lose his hurl and then opt to boot the sliotar straight up in the air where Cillian Buckley was waiting, we’ll never know. And for the Kilkenny substitute – a wonderful servant who had never scored in all his years of Championship action – to squeeze a shot home through a crowd of bodies, well that topped it all. The irony of Shefflin suffering a heart-stopping late, late match-winner – the kind he built his own career around and the county have all but trademarked – wouldn’t have been lost. In truth, Galway haven’t looked the same since. The subsequent qualifier victory over Tipperary aside, they have played since like a bunch who have had their confidence and belief and momentum badly damaged. When Shefflin suggested after Sunday’s defeat by Dublin that luck was against his side, he wasn’t wrong. At a point in the game where Galway were cruising 0-9 to 1-2 ahead – albeit backed by a strong breeze – the straight red card issued to David Burke was critical to how the match unfolded and how poor Galway were from there to the finish. Anthony Daly called it right on The Sunday Game when he said it was a yellow card offence, nothing more. It wasn’t a shoulder to the head – the replay clearly showed it was a shoulder to the front of Fergal Whiteley with the two players’ helmets making contact. In Gaelic football, a body collide is a black card offence; 10 minutes off the field of play. However ill-advised and unnecessary the challenge was to make for a player of Burke’s experience, the red card shown by referee Colm Lyons was rightly contested by Shefflin afterwards. Add in the shoulder injury suffered by Johnny Glynn and the fates weren’t exactly on Galway’s side. But the case for the prosecution is fairly damning at the same time. There was no denying that Dublin looked the better drilled and better coached side. The lack of discernible style of play to Galway was called out by Joe Canning who described his county’s exit as ‘depressing’. A straight red card issued to Antrim’s Ryan McGarry played into their hands in that round-robin game so there are swings and roundabouts. And another irony of Shefflin’s reign is that so may of the qualities as a player – and those his Ballyhale Shamrocks team exhibited in winning back-to-back club All-Irelands – weren’t part of the make-up of Galway on his watch. That’s consistency, leadership under pressure, plus the nerve and confidence and belief to win tight games. The Leinster final defeat by Kilkenny in a poor quality contest marked by missed Galway chances in 2022 was yet another exhibit. Shefflin’s own managerial legacy too has taken a major dent. When he guided his club to that double, he made management look easy. But the failure of Kilkenny to implement a proper succession plan under Cody is partly to blame for how he has ended up here – not needed in Kilkenny where Lyng has bedded in as senior manager and jumping to another county when he looked right then as the natural successor to Cody. Add in the infamous ‘handshake’ between Shefflin and Cody at the first meeting in Salthill when his former mentor seemed to make it clear how dimly he viewed a modern icon of Kilkenny taking on a Leinster rival. It was unseemly and unbecoming of Cody’s own management career and how he carried himself. Especially at a time when Shefflin was grieving the sudden and tragic death of his brother Paul. The game is bigger than that. For someone so wedded to Kilkenny hurling and to his club Ballyhale Shamrocks, there is still something jarring to the sight of him in the maroon and white of Galway on a sideline, especially going up against some of his close friends and clubmates. He brought in some big name additions to the Tribe set-up this term with former rugby international Johnny O’Connor appointed as a new head of S&C, and Eamon O’Shea added as coach. Yet there has been precious little of that spark, invention, and movement in attack that characterised O’Shea’s time with Tipperary and his All-Ireland winning partnership with Liam Sheedy. Blunt and over-reliant on Conor Whelan and the likes of Cathal Mannion, the passage of play near the end of Sunday’s outing where the Galway players retreat and allow Dublin defender Paddy Smyth carry forward a short puck-out so far upfield before launching over a point hints at a systems failure on the day. The problem for Galway is that Shefflin felt like the best candidate at the time. Is still arguably, the best placed to lead them on – given the way he commands a dressing room and commands such respect. The question for Shefflin is whether his heart is in it for the necessary rebuild, which is likely a two to three-year job looking at the age profile and miles on the clock that might see the likes of Burke or Glynn or other players with a lot of mileage between club and county consider their future. Galway – and Shefflin’s own time as a senior inter-county manager – is at a distinct crossroads. It’s probably in Kilkenny’s best interests to bring him back into the fold with, say, the county’s Under 20s. He took on this job when he was revered in Kilkenny, with a flourishing managerial CV. He stands now with a fractured relationship with Kilkenny’s most decorated manager, with various supporters divided about his own divided loyalty, and the gloss stripped off his impressive achievements with Ballyhale Shamrocks after three testing and unfruitful years with Galway. Even if he remains the best fit for Galway, is Galway the best fit for him?",

        "description": "Keeping your data safe in 2024 is important and Kanary helps make the job as easy as possible",
        "content": "In 2024, Kanary is one of a number of the best data removal services, which play a fundamental role in keeping your personal information out of the wrong hands, such as data brokers that buy and profit from data. For the uninitiated, data removal services come in a few different forms but their task is essentially simple: scan the web for your personal data (think address, email, phone number, and so on) and, either automatically or manually, remove that data from data brokerages, social networks, search engines, and so on. There are a lot of companies that offer such services, and today we're looking at Kanary, one of the most well established and reliable services on the market. We'll get into the nitty gritty below, but Kanary offers a free trial (which then turns into a free tier subscription) and two paid tiers of its data removal services that offer different levels and specifications, including the ability to add custom domains and emails to speed up removals. In 2024, keeping your online data safe should be of paramount importance, and we recommend checking out the best VPNs , the best password managers , and the best antivirus software to help prevent anything untoward happening. We also recommend checking out rival data removal services like DeleteMe , Mozilla Monitor Plus , and Surfshark Incogni to make the best choice for your needs, be that a wider range of data brokers targeted or a corporate plan. As we mentioned above, Kanary offers two paid tiers and, at the moment, a fairly generous 14-day free trial that includes three removals, which will then turn into a free tier subscription if a user decides not to pay. The Premium tier is split into monthly and yearly payment plans, albeit with one difference: the monthly plan does not include free custom domain and email to speed up removals. Kanary charges $16.99 per month or $179.88 per year, which translates to $14.99 per month, but that will, of course, be billed yearly. Each tier lets users add family members, for $7.49 per month on the yearly plan and $8.49 on the monthly plan. Finally, Kanary offers an Enterprise plan, which costs $179.88 per year per user and adds a ton of different features that we'll get into below. These prices are fairly towards the high end of the range for data removal services, although the addition of a limited free tier and, on top of that, a 14-day free trial are nice perks that can at least offer a feel of the services, and remove at least some data from brokers and other online services. Kanary has a really helpful explanation of how its service works on its website, and we'll break down the main themes here, on top of some other notable features. Upon becoming a Kanary member, the service begins scanning the web to identify where your data is located and who has been storing it. That process can take anywhere from two to 14 days, and includes removing users from Google Search, and asks for your preference on data on Facebook and other websites. Between days four and 14, Kanary is still scanning the web and removing any data automatically that falls within its scope. On day 15 (or maybe sooner), Kanary will generate a dashboard to show removals, pending removals, and its overall progress. By day 30, Kanary says there should be around a 60% removal success and the software will continue to rescan and check for your data out there. Users can initiate a new scan sooner than 30 days, but Kanary recommends waiting for the dust to settle first. Between day 31 and 45, Kanary estimates there will be an 80% removal success rate, as the service focuses on the \"toughest removals\" and its support team investigates websites that are not responding to removal requests. By day 90, you will likely be looking at a 95% to 100% removal success rate as Kanary's software and its staff work their magic. Beyond the 90 days, Kanary will continue to scan every month and resurface old exposures to fix them promptly, and users can track pretty much everything on the main dashboard. It's pretty much simple, and we found Kanary to work as advertised. The company publishes a helpful website on its Privacy & Security philosophy that offers a lot of details for those interested. Kanary also offers a tier for businesses, which provides a pretty similar set of features to the personal plans but with some additions geared towards enterprise. The high-end service comes with 256-bit encryption and multi-factor authentication, the ability to set up accounts within five minutes, and dedicated support, to make sure that your needs are met quickly and easily. Kanary works by searching and removing content related to employees at a business, like it does with personal data. You can find out more about its enterprise tier on its website . Like its peers, Kanary offers a good range of support documentation, including a helpful blog with tips on everything from Google data removal to deleting popular social media services like Instagram and LinkedIn. There's also an FAQ with a lot of basic questions about how the service works, and the company publishes a long list of all of the websites Kanary removes from. On top of that, Kanary offers email support, as you would expect. There are a number of high quality data removal services available right now from a range of companies, some independent and some part of larger organisations. DeleteMe , for example, is a veteran of the data removal game having been launched in 2011, and includes a lot of great features, including support for up to 750 data brokers (albeit with some available on on expensive plans). The company charges $129 per year for its basic plan. Mozilla Monitor Plus , too, is a great option that is developed by the same people as Firefox , meaning you can rely on its quality and robustness. Monitor Plus costs $8.99 per month. Honourable mentions should also go to Surfshark Incogni , PrivacyBee, IDX, and Hello Privacy, all of which offer data removal services to a high standard and are worth checking out to match your specific needs. In our testing, Kanary worked well and deserves to be up there alongside the best data removal services around in 2024. With the crisis of data brokers and the abundance of personal data we (accidentally) leave across the web, there has never been a better time to get a handle on your online footprint. It's worth checking out Kanary's competitors like DeleteMe and Mozilla Monitor Plus , especially if you have a specific use case in mind, or to just make sure you're getting the best value. Covering hundreds of data brokers, plus Google, Facebook, and other social networks, Kanary is a solid option, and the $16.99 per month tier, while not cheap, offers a wide range of features.",

The founder of Prince Adeyinka Ali Foundation (PAAF),who expressed this opinion argued that even though the government committed some errors at inception, the indices are still there to show improvement on local content . He called on government at all levels to make education affordable for all irrespective of race, religion and influence. “It’s not easy to have met the economy the way it was and when this government came in and expect that we will start living in heaven for the period of one year. “Even though they have their mistakes, they made some fallacies without making necessary preparations. We are now competing with the world, there is local content, the indices are still there but we are not there yet but I give them the pass mark “ According to him, PAAF is one of the few organizations that are catering for the needs of the children in order to fulfill their full potentials. “We recognize that children make the world complete, sweeten the world and that is why we have to celebrate them so that they can know that they are appreciated. “PAAF is one of the NGOs that is doing this in Ekiti because we cater for the kids. The government can partner with us and other NGOs so that we can bring smiles to the children. “I want Ekiti of my dreams to bring up children that can compete with any other child in the world. “I want to encourage Ekiti children not to be left out and we expect the state government to join us in this. “One of the focus of Ekiti is Education, that’s why are calling on Ekiti state to partner with us so that we can celebrate the children”.

        "content": "Toilets may serve basic human needs but one woman has managed to forge a community over a shared need to find toilets with bidets in Singapore. In 2022, the 24-year-old who wants to be known as R, was spurred to create the @toiletswithbidetsg Instagram page after coming across a tweet calling for an app that shows which toilets in Singapore have a water spray. She decided to choose Instagram as a platform so that she could post photos of the toilets as well. Impressively, she has since collated over 200 locations where users can find toilets with bidet and even created a map for easy reference, which has had over 1.3 million views. A post shared by toilets with bidets 🇸🇬🚽💦 (@toiletswithbidetsg) The account has been a lifesaver for those who are out and about and need to take care of urgent business with access to a water spray. Some users have even labelled her a \"hero\" and thanked her for saving their lives. When asked why she thinks her page resonates with so many, R told TNP that bidets are \"superior\" because they keep one’s behind clean and hygienic. “Tissues don’t do the job and leave me feeling unsatisfactory,” she said. In her opinion, the best toilet she has visited is at Jewel Changi Airport where there are built-in bidets and the toilet seats are even heated. A post shared by toilets with bidets 🇸🇬🚽💦 (@toiletswithbidetsg) “They’re just like the toilets in Japan and are always kept clean,” she added. R never imagined that her page would grow to where it is now, with more than 17,000 followers. “I thought it was a niche thing to appreciate bidets in Singapore but surprisingly, many people were rallying behind my idea,” she said. “I never expected it to hit a five-digit number and I initially thought this Instagram page wouldn’t last more than a year.” R, who works full-time as an administrator, goes through every contribution herself. She is also the only one posting photos, reels and editing the map. She shared that she followed a YouTube tutorial to create her map and spends at least an hour a week updating it and compiling and editing photos. “It is a little time-consuming but I enjoy seeing my map grow with more locations,” she said. “I started with fewer than 60 locations but it has grown to more than 200 in three years, I think that’s an amazing accomplishment!” However, she acknowledges the page would not be a success without her followers and contributors. “The support from the local community has been huge,” she said. “I get at least one submission a day from someone sending me their bidet find and there are also many who update me when they find a bidet that was on my page but has since been taken down.” She added that bidets are sometimes removed by building management to prevent theft or because users use the sprays incorrectly, causing the toilets to be wet and dirty. “We all need to do our part to keep the toilets clean.” The page is also a hit with tourists from neighbouring countries like Malaysia and Indonesia indicating how important such amenities are. On March 20, an Indonesian travel page posted an Instagram Reel about @toiletswithbidetsg and has garnered 1.5 million views. A post shared by Evan’s Travel Guide (@evantravelguide.id) “The best is when tourists send me their bidet finds like in their hotel rooms or cafes they visit,” she said. “I think it’s very cute!” R is currently working on publishing a website directory for public toilets and hotel rooms that are equipped with bidets in Singapore. She hopes it will make navigating easier and also help tourists plan their trips to Singapore easy as well. She hopes people will continue to submit their bidet finds and also share what they would like to see on the website.",

        "description": "Of the 21 femicide victims recorded by the Met Police in 2022, nine were black as were eight of the 13 victims in 2023.",
        "content": "Black women in London are said to be facing a “crisis”, with higher rates of femicide in the capital than other ethnic groups, figures suggest. Femicide broadly refers to the killing of a woman or girl because of her gender, highlighting the issue of violence targeted specifically at females. Keisha Christodoulou, a 32-year-old “funny and kind-hearted” mother of three autistic children, was fatally stabbed 17 times in her living room in 2022 while her one-year-old son was in the house. The ex-partner of Ms Christodoulou and father of her children, Leon Murray, was charged with her murder and pleaded guilty to manslaughter on May 8. However, the Crown Prosecution Service is still pursuing the count of murder at Wood Green Crown Court. Her younger sister Chanel Vasiliou, 31, from London, told the PA news agency that there needs to be “tougher laws against men committing violence or murder against women”. Southall Black Sisters, an organisation dedicated to assisting society’s most marginalised victims of abuse, said that while the findings are “really shocking,” it sadly does not come as a surprise that there’s a disproportionate impact on black women. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from the Metropolitan Police in a Freedom of Information request. They show that: – Of the 21 femicide victims recorded by the Metropolitan Police in 2022, nine (43%) were black while eight of the 13 victims in 2023 (62%) were black. – These figures suggest black women are being disproportionately targeted when compared with the ethnic breakdown of the female population of London, where just 14% are black, according to the 2021 census. – By contrast, four of the 21 victims in 2022 were white, along with one of the 13 victims in 2013, while white women make up over half (53%) of London’s female population. – The pattern was different in 2021, however, with 25 femicide victims recorded by the Met, of whom 20 (80%) were white and three (12%) were black. Ms Vasiliou told the PA news agency that femicide and violence against women are not receiving “the level of attention and care” they urgently need, and emphasised the necessity for more “culturally specific services” for black women. She said: “There needs to be more culturally specific services for black women where they feel safe to turn to. It also shows the lack of care and protection for marginalised communities. More advocacy and services specifically for black women, by black women is a must. “I feel there need to be tougher laws against men committing violence or murder against women. Our women need to be protected, and right now, they are not.” “There’s also not enough media coverage around women killed in their homes by their partners. It’s not made into a big issue like gang violence and knife crime on the streets, which you see every single day. But you see next to nothing about innocent women being murdered in their homes, often in front of their children.” Met Police data also shows that sharp instruments were the most common method for killing the victims, being used in 13 of the 25 femicides recorded in 2021, 16 of the 21 in 2022 and seven of the 13 in 2023. Ms Vasiliou added that there needs to be more awareness in schools and colleges to teach children about the signs of an abusive partner. After Ms Christodoulou’s death, Ms Vasiliou founded Keisha’s Place, an organisation dedicated to raising awareness about domestic abuse and its dangers, in honour of her sister. “It’s something I’ve always wanted to do, having been in a DV (domestic violent) relationship myself many years ago and multiple friends previously suffering in DV relationships. So, when this happened to Keisha, I knew right away that this was my calling,” she said. “I am dedicated to helping women flee domestic abuse safely and rebuild their lives away from violence. My journey in this has only just begun and I have so much more to do.” Ms Vasiliou said Ms Christodoulou’s death “tore” their family apart and altered their lives forever, and that her mother is currently taking care of her three children. She said: “Our friends and family still to this day cannot believe that this has happened to Keisha, our hearts break over and over for her and what she endured. “We are all still suffering from the effects of her death and we forever will. Her children lost both their mother and father.” The Femicide Census, a database providing detailed information on women killed in the UK and their perpetrators, criticised the Met Police and the Mayor of London, saying they “simply don’t care enough” about femicide. Clarrie O’Callaghan, 49, from the Femicide Census, told PA that there has been a “woeful disregard” for the experiences of black and minoritised women in London. She added that despite multiple freedom of information requests, the Met Police for nearly a decade has never provided them with data similar to that provided to the PA until this year. She said: “The fact that they (Met Police) have steadfastly resisted giving us the data... it’s a good indicator to say, where are their priorities, where do they want to focus attention.” Selma Taha, 52, from Southall Black Sisters, told PA: “Racism and sexism are deeply entrenched in the UK’s system. At the intersection of race and sex, black women are disproportionately impacted and failed as a result. Black femicide is a form of violence against women and girls (VAWG) that reflects these prejudices, both in the act of violence and in the systemic response to it. “Why is the value of black women’s lives so obsolete, they’re facing a crisis... we need politicians and the police to step up.” Commander Kevin Southworth, who leads Public Protection for the Met, told PA: “We take violence against women and girls in all its forms extremely seriously and are dedicated to being open and transparent with our data. “We provided data for all women who had been killed between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021 to the Femicide Consensus – the data that was not released was due to families who did not wish for the victims’ data and details to be shared in any form. “We are committed to protecting those who are at risk, regardless of their ethnicity or faith, and understand that communities are affected in different ways. We work with victim-survivors, charities and partners to listen to, transform and improve our response to all victims.” A spokesperson for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: “The Mayor is committed to ensuring that ending the epidemic of violence against women and girls is treated with the utmost urgency both by our police, and society as a whole. “Sadiq has invested a record £163m as part of his public health approach to tackle violence against women and girls, which includes targeted funding to support community organisations working with women and girls from black, Asian and minority-ethnic communities and other minoritised groups, including the LGBTQ+ community. “But there is more to do, which is why the Mayor has prioritised a new comprehensive 10-point plan to tackle offending and fund new free independent legal advice for survivors of rape and serious sexual offences so that they can receive the vital support they need and deserve. “And is supporting the ‘New Met for London’ plan, to overhaul the way the force deals with offences involving women and girls. This includes providing better training for officers, more resources for specialist investigative teams and focused action on the worst offenders so we can build a safer London for all.”",

        "content": "Israel's foreign minister accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” on Tuesday, after the country moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Ireland and Norway were set to follow suit the same day in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza , but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people , according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say. — Iran’s acting president addresses its new parliament . A watchdog says Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war . Here's the latest: NORWAY FORMALLY RECOGNIZES A PALESTINIAN STATE COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. SPAIN WILL BEGIN RECOGNIZING A PALESTINIAN STATE MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. IRANIAN PARLIAMENT REELECTS HARD-LINER QALIBAF AS ITS SPEAKER DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief.",

        "content": "The Pope is alleged to have used a homosexual slur during a private meeting with bishops over the admittance of gay men into theological colleges. Pope Francis, 87, allegedly made the remark during a meeting with Italian bishops in Rome on May 20. The slur was uttered as they discussed whether they should be admitted into Catholic seminaries where priests are trained. During the private meeting, one bishop asked for guidance when the pontiff allegedly repeated his objection to admitting gay men, adding while it was important to admit everyone he believed a homosexual might lead a double life. The Pope is then alleged to have said there was too much \"frociaggine\" in seminaries. The word is an Italian slur that roughly translates to \"f****ness.\" The Mirror has contacted the Vatican's press office for comment. Pope Francis allegedly uttered the slur during a meeting with bishops ( Image: Evandro Inetti/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock) The allegation was first published on the gossip website Dagospia before being reported on by other Italian outlets. La Repubblica and others then quoted an unnamed bishop who said the Pope meant the slur as a \"joke\" and that meeting attendees were surprised he used it. The outlet also reported there had been a meeting between the Pope and bishops in November where they discussed whether gay men should be admitted to seminaries. Pope Francis previously made inclusive comments about gay people ( Image: Maria Grazia Picciarella/REX/Shutterstock) Since being elected as Pope in 2013, Francis has made public statements that have been perceived as more inclusive toward the LGBTQ community. In July that year, Pope Francis said if homosexuals \"accept the Lord and have goodwill, who am I to judge them?\" He also approved a ruling in December that allowed priests to bless unmarried and gay couples. It marked a major departure from the Catholic Church's stance toward the community. Last year Pope Francis said homosexuality is not a crime, while sexual acts outside marriage were considered to be a sin. He also urged Catholics to show \"tenderness\" toward the the LGBTQ community.",

        "content": "Listen to Story Shahjahanpur BJP MLA Chetram questioned the poor quality of roads being built by the government after a video of him using a pen to scrape a part of an underconstruction road went viral. The BJP MLA found shortcomings in the quality of material being used for construction when he went on a surprise inspection in the Powayan police station area. Road widening work is being carried out on a 17 km stretch connecting Powayan tehsil with Lakhimpur district at a cost of Rs 32 crore. During his visit to the site, Chetram found that mud was being used instead of gravel. He was then seen using a pen to scrape parts of the road that was constructed. The BJP MLA lamblasted the junior engineer and the contractor and threatened to send them to prison if they played with the quality of the road. He also accused the departmental officer of embezzling commission while underscoring that the Yogi Adityanath government had zero tolerance in terms of quality of road construction. The BJP MLA further said that he would take up the matter with higher-ups in the government. The incident has caused a stir in the PWD department. Shahjahanpur is the home district of PWD minister Jitin Prasada. A local, Amrit Pal Singh, said the road would again get uprooted within months. \"These people will build the road and go away. However, it will slowly uproot again,\" he said. Another local, Lakhbinder Singh, part of the road caved in recently, flagging the poor construction being carried out.",

After 27 years, Kajol and Prabhudeva are reuniting for Telugu director Charan Tej Uppalapati's action thriller, which is titled, 'Maharagni - Queen of Queens'. Interestingly, the first schedule of 'Maharagni' was recently completed and now the makers have unveiled the official teaser of the film. Taking to Instagram, Ajay Devgn treated fans with a teaser of his wife's upcoming movie 'Maharagni'. The video opens with Prabhudeva stepping out of a charter plane, immediately takes down a group of goons. The action then shifts to Samyuktha Menon, who amidst a high-stakes chase, shares her quest for revenge. The video shows Naseeruddin Shah lying in a hospital bed sharing his heartfelt last wish and Kajol emerging in her 'Maharagni' avatar, exuding power and strength in her never-seen-before role. A post shared by The Free Press Journal (@freepressjournal) Sharing the video, he wrote, \"Aali re aali, #Maharagni aali! kajol.\" As soon as the first glimpse was shared, fans chimed in the comment section. One of the users wrote, \"Singham ki lady Singham.\" Directed and written by Charan Tej Uppalapati and produced by Harman Baweja and Venkata Anish Dorigillu under the labels of Baweja Studios and E7 Entertainments, 'Maharagni - Queen of Queens' is a pan-India film set to be released in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. Apart from Kajol and Prabhudeva, the cast also includes Naseeruddin Shah, Samyuktha Menon, Jisshu Sengupta, and Aditya Seal, among others. Talking about the project, director Charan Tej Uppalapati stated, \"Directing Maharagni - Queen of Queens has been a labour of love. Collaborating with actors like Kajol, Prabhudeva, Naseer sir, Samyukta Menon and Jishusen Gupta has elevated the project to new heights. Their unmatched charisma and acting abilities breathe life into the characters, and I can't wait for the audience to witness this on screen.\" Sharing his thoughts, producer Harman Baweja said, \"Maharagni is a special project for Baweja Studios, driven by a compelling story. We are excited to collaborate with Eternal 7 and have an extraordinary cast featuring Kajol, Prabhudeva, Naseeruddin Shah and Samyukta Menon. Kajol's talent and authenticity make her perfect for this role. At Baweja Studios, we believe in telling powerful stories, and I am thrilled to bring this project to life with such a stellar team.\" Adding to that, producer Venkata Anish Dorigillu said, \"As soon as I came across this story, I knew it carried a powerful message that needed to reach the masses. With Charan Tej Uppalapati's keen eye for direction and the remarkable talent of our stellar cast, we are confident that we will deliver a unique vision that will make this story shine.\" Kajol and Prabhudeva earlier worked in Rajiv Menon's 1997 Tamil film 'Minsara Kanavu'.

        "description": "Ineos is \"confident\" of finding a solution to allow its clubs Manchester United and French club Nice to compete in next season's Europa League.",
        "content": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos organisation has significant stakes in Manchester United and Nice Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos company owns a 27.7% stake in United and are in control of the club's football operations, while they completed a takeover of French club Nice in 2019. Uefa rules restrict the influence any organisation can have over more than one club in the same competition. An independent panel will rule on the matter before next season's competition starts in the middle of July with the qualifying rounds. Uefa's regulations meant Belgian club Union Saint-Gilloise had to alter its ownership structure last season to allow it to compete in the Europa League alongside Brighton, whose owner Tony Bloom had been a pivotal figure for both clubs. Aston Villa and Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes faced the same scenario in the Europa Conference League. It is also a situation Manchester City and Spanish side Girona will have to address this summer given they are both part of the City Football Group and have qualified for next season's Champions League. If a solution is not found United would have to drop into the Conference League as they finished lower in the Premier League last season than fifth-placed Nice did in Ligue 1. However Ineos is confident that scenario will be avoided. \"We are aware of the position of both clubs and are in direct dialogue with Uefa,\" it said. \"We are confident we have a route forward for next season in Europe.\" Ineos also owns Swiss Super League club FC Lausanne-Sport, but they have not qualified for European competition.",

Catatan ini penting untuk menjadi panduan bagi pelaksanaan RUU ini ke depannya,” imbuh Tobas. Sebelumnya, fraksi PDI Perjuangan DPR RI menyebut telah berkomunikasi dengan fraksi lainnya untuk menolak Revisi Undang-Undang (RUU) Mahkamah Konstitusi (MK) guna mencegah pasal-pasal yang diselundupkan. Anggota Fraksi DPR RI Djarot Saiful Hidayat mengatakan bahwa pasal-pasal yang akan ditolak itu adalah yang melemahkan MK. Adapun RUU tersebut kini tengah dibahas di lembaga wakil rakyat itu. \"Penjaga konstitusi betul-betul harus independen, harus kredibel, harus mandiri,\" kata Djarot di Kompleks Parlemen, Jakarta.

        "content": "A huge project to create one of the biggest reedbeds in the UK at a quarry site is more than half complete. The RSPB said work to expand its Ouse Fen nature reserve, north of Cambridge, started in 2001. New wetland is being carefully created by the phased restoration of Needingworth Quarry, where sand and gravel are extracted for use by the construction industry. The quarry operator, initially Heidelberg Materials (formerly Hanson UK) and now Brice Aggregates, is gradually handing the restored wetland over to the RSPB. In the last 20 years the site has become a habitat for bitterns, marsh harriers and bearded tits as well as otters, water voles and 22 different species of dragonfly. Volunteers have been helping to plant reeds, and those in nearby villages have created walking routes. When the project is completed, Ouse Fen along with its neighbouring RSPB nature reserves – Fen Drayton Lakes and the Ouse Washes – will form a near continuous 3,000 hectare wetland habitat – around half the size of nearby Ely. Chris Hudson, senior site manager at RSPB Ouse Fen said: “We have achieved such a lot here, and we are over the moon at how this long-term project has nurtured endangered wildlife populations, but there is still much more work to do. Oliver Brice, managing director of Brice Aggregates, said: “The quarrying operations at Needingworth provide vital raw materials to the construction industry across the East of England and East Midlands whilst supporting jobs and economic activity locally. “What differentiates this site however is the focus on restoration from the outset and the proactive collaboration between industry and the RSPB. “The ongoing creation of Ouse Fen is a long established and exemplary quarry restoration scheme providing a new large scale and nationally significant wetland habitat. “We are pleased to be taking over the project from the capable stewardship of Heidelberg Materials and look forward to working with the RSPB to continue delivering benefits for vulnerable wildlife species and local communities alike. “It is a harmonious scheme delivering for its many stakeholders.”",

        "content": "A stockpile in Massachusetts of widely-used abortion pills has sat dormant over the year-plus since Gov. Maura Healey directed her administration to spend nearly $700,000 on 15,000 doses in the face of a legal challenge to the medication, according to health officials. Healey moved last April to buy a year’s worth of mifepristone in the event of a shortage after a Texas judge suspended federal approval of the drug. Access to the pill has remained available after the case shifted into the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, where justices put the Texas ruling on hold until a final decision is handed down. A spokesperson for Healey, Karissa Hand, said the governor “took action” last year to make sure mifepristone remains available in Massachusetts as access to medication abortion was threatened. “We have preserved these doses as the case remains pending before the Supreme Court and mifepristone remains legal and accessible. We will evaluate next steps based on the court’s ruling, but no matter what, mifepristone and access to reproductive health care will remain protected in Massachusetts,” Hand said in a statement. A spokesperson for the Department of Public Health said the administration plans to “take steps to distribute the stockpile” based on the final ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court and officials have no plans to order more doses. A decision is expected in June. Healey turned to the University of Massachusetts Amherst to purchase the pills — which have a five-year shelf life — because the institution had the necessary certifications in place to order mifepristone and already provides the drug through its health services. University leaders said at the time that ensuring access “to safe, effective, reproductive healthcare for the residents of Massachusetts is fully aligned with UMass Amherst’s longstanding mission to serve the commonwealth.” UMass Amherst spokesperson Ed Blaguszewski said the entire shipment of mifepristone was handed off to the Department of Public Health within a few days of its arrival. “None of it is being stored at UMass. There have been no further requests by the state for additional purchases,” Blaguszewski said in a statement. Supreme Court justices in March heard about 90 minutes of oral arguments in a case that looks to overturn the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decades-old approval of mifepristone. A ruling for opponents of the drug could stop the delivery of the medication by mail and at major pharmacies. Justices appeared skeptical of the case, which was initially brought only five months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and some seemed to think the lower courts had overreached. “I’m worried that there is a significant mismatch in this case between the claimed injury and the remedy that’s being sought and that that might or should matter for standing purposes,” Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said in March. Taylor St. Germain, a spokesperson for Reproductivity Equity Now, said the organization is “proud” of Healey’s “bold and proactive steps” to stockpile mifepristone ahead of the Supreme Court’s ruling. “In a post-Roe world, protected states like ours need to go on offense to protect and expand access to essential reproductive health care, and Massachusetts stands ready to get this medication into the hands of providers and patients when a decision comes down this June,” she said.

        "content": "As if Conor Quinn in Commonwealth title action wasn’t enough, Queensberry have just confirmed a card that includes a mouthwatering all Irish clash between Pierce O’Leary and Darragh Foley , as well as title fights for James McGivern and Colm Murpjhy . Frank Warren and co will return to Belfast for the first time since they promoted Irish great Carl Frampton on June 28. They bring the TNT Cameras and what promises to be a brilliant fight card to the SSE Arena. Belfast’s new big ‘wee man’, the fast-rising Quinn is in Commonwealth title action on the top of the bill. ‘The Magnificent’ will look to continue stepping up the ladder against undefeated Leeds native Conner Kelsall in another massively intriguing clash on the bill. An all Dublin clash co-mains as no-nonsense big punching O’Leary takes on the massively entertaining teak tough Foley in a Sheriff Street versus Blanch bout that’s all but guaranteed to deliver. Irish champion super featherweight champion Murphy faces former Scottish title holder Jack Turner on the card, while the Jason Quigley managed McGivern defends his BUI Celtic title against Rashid Omar in the cards fourth title fight. Cork prospect Steve Cairns will also populate the card, making his Irish debut as will Warren’s Mayo fighter Eoghan Lavin and a number of Quennsberry’s British stable. Kristina O’Hara McCafferty , who has a big fight on June 7, and Willo Hayden , both of whom are signed to Warren have yet to be confirmed on the bill.",

        "content": "As the Bola Tinubu administration marks one year in office, good governance, advocacy organisation, Youth Advocates For Peace Justice And Empowerment Network (YAPJEN), has called on the President to redouble his effort to save Nigerians from hardship occasioned by the removal of fuel subsidies. Tinubu will on the 29 th of May, 2024, clock a year in office, a period that has been criticized for inflicting hardship on the lives of the people of the country. From the removal of the fuel subsidy to the hike in electricity charges, the citizens are crying out for succor. In a press release on Tuesday, the Director of Communication of YAPJEN, Comrade Benedict Chidobem Esq, felicitated the President on his one year in office but lamented that Nigerians are currently subjected to economic hardship and hyperinflation, high cost of food and other commodities, an exorbitant increase of petroleum pump price and other commodities, devaluation of the naira, insecurity, epileptic power supply, poverty, and unemployment. In his words, “The government must prioritize the wellbeing and the interest of Nigerians in their policies “The government needs to urgently diversify the economy of the nation by investing more in agriculture, securing farmers from bandits attack, solving farmers-herders crisis, providing tractors and fertilizer to boost food production, engage the teeming mass of unemployed youths into agriculture. “Furthermore, with the unbundling of the power sector, the government needs to create an enabling environment that will encourage private sectors to invest in power generation and distribution in such a way that they will be able to recoup their investments without bottlenecks and still provide steady power supply to Nigerians.” On the high cost of petrol, the group urged the government to intensify efforts to get Warri, Port Harcourt and Kaduna refineries back to life and get the railway working across the country to aid the transportation of petroleum products, while NNPC should ensure the availability of the products to private marketers in the downstream to ensure availability of the products. He called on Nigerian governments at all levels to shift from consumption to production and reduce overdependence on the dollar to ease the pressure on the naira. He said further; “The government needs to restructure and rejig the security architecture of the country, provide enabling legislation for state policing while emphasis must be placed on intelligence gathering and sharing for the security of Nigerians.” Comrade Chidobem also advised the government to provide an enabling environment for private sectors to thrive, and for an increased inflow of investors into the economy, to create jobs for the masses. According to him, efforts should also be made to establish skills acquisition training in the various higher institutions of learning. “This will ensure that graduates who come out of the tertiary institutions are well-equipped for the labour market. This is because at present, people graduate from higher institutions without any single life-sustaining skill.

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will lead a rejuvenated Belgium side including a once-retired Alex Witsel at the European Championship next month. De Bruyne and Witsel were on the 25-man list unveiled by coach Domenico Tedesco on Tuesday. Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, preparing for the Champions League final, was not. Defender Maxim De Cuyper, who won the Belgian league with Club Brugge last weekend, was the only newcomer. De Bruyne and Witsel are remaining members of the so-called golden generation of Belgian players. While De Bruyne's presence was expected, Witsel's was a surprise after Tedesco dropped him from his first squad last year. Witsel soon after announced his retirement from international soccer and did not play in qualifying. But Tedesco said Witsel's recent excellent showings with Atletico Madrid convinced him the 35-year-old midfielder was the right choice. Tedesco also traveled to Spain to meet Witsel and discuss a comeback. There was no hard feelings, the coach said, and Witsel immediately agreed to return. “First of all, it's about the quality,” Tedesco said. “There is no doubt he is a high-quality player. We need him, he is an experienced player, he can help the young players. Either if he is playing or not, we have a good feeling with him.” Witsel can play in midfield or defense, a versatility that increased his value. “He has started to play as a central defender, it changed a lot,” Tedesco said. “As a (number) six, probably he would not be in the squad today. I have to be very transparent.” Tedesco said Courtois was not ready for Euro 2024, which starts on June 14 in Germany, after recently returning from injury. The men have been at odds since a dispute last year, and Courtois announced in December he would miss the Euros. “Of course he knows his body the best,” Tedesco said about Courtois. Tedesco succeeded Roberto Martinez as Belgium manager in February 2023. He has yet to lose a game in charge of the Red Devils. Belgium will face Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine in Group E. Belgium’s best result at the continental tournament was runner-up in 1980. Tedesco can still amend his squad before a June 7 deadline when teams must give UEFA a list with a minimum of 23 players and a maximum of 26. He said two extra \"young\" players will join the squad as training partners during the Euro preparations. Tedesco said he had been following the left-footed De Cuyper closely since he took over as coach but the defender had so far been overlooked because of strong competition. “The situation changed a little bit and we are open,” Tedesco said. “We have to choose the best players.” Up front, strikers Romelu Lukaku and Lois Openda were chosen at the expense of Michy Batshuayi. Tedesco said it did not make sense to have Batshuayi in the squad knowing that Charles de Ketelaere, Dodi Lukebakio and Leandro Trossard can also cover his position. “We did not see the necessity to take a third striker,” Tedesco said. Belgium: Goalkeepers: Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest), Koen Casteels (Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton). Defenders: Wout Faes (Leicester), Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Arthur Theate (Rennes), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge) Midfielders: Aster Vranckx (Wolfsburg), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Orel Mangala (Lyon), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Amadou Onana (Everton) Forwards: Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Lois Openda (Leipzig), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal), Johan Bakayoko (PSV Eindhoven), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Yannick Carrasco (Al-Shabab) AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

Reputation is a critical asset for companies, with global executives attributing , according to KRC Research. Real-time sanctions screening plays a crucial role in protecting this valuable asset by addressing risks as transactions occur, thus eliminating the need for periodic or manual reviews. This continuous monitoring helps firms avoid both legal penalties and significant reputational damage. For example, a major FI briefly lost 5.6 percent in the value of its shares after allowing a £250 cash withdrawal by a sanctioned individual, even though the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) chose not to impose a fine. Real-time sanctions screening can offer unparalleled agility and scalability, allowing firms to adapt swiftly to evolving sanctions landscapes. In an era where global sanctions regimes are becoming increasingly intricate and subject to frequent changes, businesses must stay ahead of the curve to ensure compliance.

Real-time screening platforms offer the scalability necessary to handle increasing transaction volumes while maintaining the same level of effectiveness in identifying potential sanctions violations.

Real-time screening brings a proactive dimension to the due diligence process, empowering organizations to . This can help quickly identify any associations with sanctioned entities, meaning potential risks are spotted as soon as they emerge, enabling timely intervention and mitigation. Solutions that are API-led offer further efficiency gains, as firms can integrate the software seamlessly into their compliance workflows. Such solutions can also be tailored to align with a firm’s risk appetite and compliance requirements. They can adapt to varying transaction volumes, different customer segments, and evolving regulatory landscapes. This adaptability ensures that organizations can efficiently and effectively target potential violations to suit their unique needs. For example, embedded finance platform . This allows the two platforms to connect via an API to communicate with one another. In this case, the APIs automatically interface with ComplyAdvantage on the backend, delivering information from ComplyAdvantage to Alviere’s teams and analysts via their in-house portal. This allows them to make crucial decisions without manually contacting ComplyAdvantage’s back office. The impact of robust sanctions compliance extends beyond regulatory requirements, directly influencing geopolitics and international relations. By swiftly identifying and blocking transactions involving sanctioned individuals and entities, real-time screening systems contribute to cutting off the flow of funds to those engaged in illicit activities or human rights abuses. This not only bolsters global efforts to combat financial crime but also promotes accountability and justice on a global scale. By preventing the movement of funds by sanctioned entities, real-time screening helps curb bad actors’ ability to finance destabilizing activities or circumvent sanctions imposed by the international community. This contributes to a more stable and secure global financial system, fostering trust and cooperation among nations. Ultimately, the implementation of effective sanctions screening measures aligns with broader humanitarian and ethical principles, as it deprives oppressive regimes and illicit actors of the resources they need to perpetuate injustice and harm. Advanced real-time sanction screening solutions In the face of constantly changing sanctions lists and increased regulatory expectations, organizations must adopt a to sanctions compliance.

        "content": "RAWALPINDI – Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Founder Imran Khan’s trouble increased as a new complaint has been moved against him over charges of speaking against the state institutions and creating ‘hateful narrative’, the sources familiar with the development said on Tuesday. The sources said that the complaint was moved by a Rawalpindi resident. “An FIR will be registered against Imran Khan over charges of speaking against the state institutions and spreading false propaganda,” said the sources. A local TV reported that a journalist is said to be the complainant. Last week, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari addressed a press conference and said that the provincial cabinet approved legal proceedings against Imran Khan over what she said “a hateful narrative” against the state institutions. “The Punjab Home department will take steps in this regard,” said Azma Bokhari while addressing a press conference about the 8th cabinet meeting with Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in chair at the DGPR on Friday. Azma Bokhari said, “The PTI founder is spreading a hateful narrative against the state institutions and is trying to become Sheikh Mujeeb,”. The minister said that all those people who were coming out of the jail after meeting the PTI founder were also equally involved in spreading the hateful narrative, and the cabinet also decided to take action against them. “An inquiry report was conducted by the Home department and was presented today before the cabinet. Eleven times, a pattern is adopted to spread that narrative. A serious nature of statements are made and spread,” said the minister. “Creating anarchy and spreading hate against the institutions is the agenda of this party,” said the minister, emphasizing upon the security of the country. “What did Imran Khan do when he was in power? Why do they mention 1971 again and again? He is quite fond of becoming Sheikh Mujeeb. Nowadays, he mentions the names and mentions the London Plan,” said Azma Bokhari. “The cabinet has allowed us to file a complaint in this regard. But this is final that Pakistan and its security is the most important for the nation. If any of us does not remain alive it does not mean that there will be any impact on Pakistan,” she added.",

        "content": "Brand Africa has revealed that despite 64 percent of Africans expressing confidence in the continent, they are more loyal to brands outside of the continent. The organization, committed to monitoring brand performance, stated this in its latest report on Africa 100: Africa’s Best Brands research and rankings. The report also revealed that African nations account for 64 percent of the top 50 most admired countries, with South Africa, Nigeria, the United States, China, and Kenya as the top 5 countries perceived to contribute to a better Africa. The report added: “All members of the newly expanded 9-member BRICS block, except Iran, made the list, that’s dominated by Southern and West Africa which account for 44 percent of the Top 50 nations Africans admire globally.” According to the findings, South African telecommunications group, MTN, Nigerian conglomerate, Dangote, Zambian consumer group, Trade Kings, Nigerian telecommunications group, Glo, South African media group, DStv and Ethiopian Airlines retain their respective positions as the Top 5 most admired African brands. It added that 14% African share in the ranking came from six countries – South Africa and Nigeria scored five points each, Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania one point each. The report showed Europe retained its 37 percent share of the Top 100, while North America declined 12.5 percent to 28 percent as Asia grew its share by 23.5 percent to capture 21 percent of the African market. According to the ranking, Nike, Adidas, Samsung, Coca Cola and Apple retained their positions, for the 5th consecutive year, as the top five most admired brands in Africa. The report noted: “In an interesting insight, affirming how entrenched non-African brands are in Africa, many such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Samsung, Lacoste, Total (Energies) and Guinness are mistakenly recalled among the most admired ‘African’ brands when the question is asked, ‘What African brands do you admire?’” Among organisations, UNICEF (originally called the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund) and UN, are the most admired NGOs, Coca-Cola is the most admired non-African organization, and MTN is the number one African brand. “While the share of African brands remains a disappointing 14 percent, with Africans overwhelmingly believing that mostly Africa will contribute to a better Africa, as nations continue to create an enabling environment for African entrepreneurs and the AfCFTA opportunity is realized, it’s just a matter of time, but ultimately the share of African brands will increase,” says Thebe Ikalafeng, founder and chairman of Brand Africa. Recognising that brands are a vector of a nation or organisation’s identity, reputation competitiveness, every year, since 2011, Brand Africa, through its independent research partners, Kantar, Geopoll across sub-Sahara Africa, Integrate in North Africa, and Analysis in the East African Islands, conducts research in over 30 markets which account for as much as 85 percent of the continent’s GDP and population. The results are published as the lead cover story in the June edition of African Business, the continent’s foremost business magazine since 1966. Over the next few weeks, Brand Africa will release country-specific results in key countries across the continent.",

Wong reaffirmed calls for an expeditious humanitarian ceasefire, stressing the significance of safeguarding people and permitting aid to enter Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that the assault was not meant to damage people while calling the incident a \"tragic mistake\" and promising a thorough inquiry. Netanyahu stressed that there was no intention for civilian fatalities from the operation. \"In Rafah, we already evacuated about one million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong.\" During his address, MPs from the opposition started yelling. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, flames tore through the displaced people's tents in Tel al-Sultan on Sunday evening, killing 45 people -- 23 of them women and children. \"Events of the last 24 hours underscore that we must see a humanitarian ceasefire now so that civilians can be protected,\" Wong told Sky News. The Australian government continues to demand that Israel and Hamas take action to save innocent lives and oppose Israel's current incursion in southern Gaza. In light of the mounting violence, Senator Wong has urged for an emergency humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza to permit the delivery of supplies and safeguard people. Wong underlined the value of international collaboration and backed peace-brokering initiatives by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States. \"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and Israel must allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice,\" she said. Wong reaffirmed Australia's opposition to the ground incursion in southern Gaza and denounced Hamas for exploiting Palestinian civilians as \"human shields,\" adding \"The federal government has consistently opposed the ground offensive,\" raising worries about the security of the nearly 2.3 million people who were taking refuge in Rafah in Gaza. \"Every innocent life matters, whether it is Israeli or Palestinian,\" she added, calling for immediate action to prevent further civilian casualties. © Copyright 2023 IBTimes AU.

At the end of last year, Canada’s federal government introduced a draft framework to cap pollution from the oil and gas sector to reduce emissions. if(window.innerWidthADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\" });';document.write(write_html);} The plan proposes to cap 2030 emissions at 35% to 38% below 2019 levels while providing compliance flexibilities to emit up to a level about 20 to 23% below 2019 levels. The industry and the oil-producing province of Alberta slammed the emissions cap proposal, saying it would effectively cap oil and gas production. This week’s report showed that in the stress case scenario with production under a 40% emissions cap from 2030, the sector would lose US$55 billion (C$75 billion) in upstream investment spend in 2024 to 2035, compared to the Reference Case, in which conventional oil and natural gas production continues under current policy conditions. The much lower upstream investment would result in US$181 billion (C$247 billion) lower GDP contribution between 2024 and 2035 compared to the Reference Case, according to the report. “Instead of supporting emissions reduction in upstream operations, a new cap and trade system adds costs and uncertainty, which stifles investment and will force producers to curtail production to reach compliance,” CAPP President & CEO Lisa Baiton said. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} “The loss of Canadian oil and natural gas exports will be made up by other nations, who may not share Canada’s high environmental and emissions standards.” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith also commented on the CAPP-commissioned report by S&P Global. “It’s time to scrap the cap. Ottawa's reckless scheme threatens not only Alberta jobs but Canada’s economic future. Billions in investment will vanish, retirement savings will be threatened, and families will feel the pinch,” Smith said in a joint statement with Minister of Environment and Protected Areas, Rebecca Schulz, and Minister of Energy and Minerals, Brian Jean.

        "description": "George Russell was quizzed about the status of his relationship with Lewis Hamilton after Mercedes were accused of favouring him over his soon-to-be departing team-mate",
        "content": "George Russell has hit back at suggestions of a fall out with Lewis Hamilton . The Mercedes pair are in their final season as team-mates, with Hamilton set to make the switch to Ferrari ahead of next year . He suggested at the Monaco Grand Prix that the team might be giving preferential treatment to Russell due to his impending departure. They handed their latest front wing upgrade exclusively to him, and there's been speculation of growing tension in the team. But any notion of a rift was dismissed by Russell in Monaco, where he outperformed Hamilton in qualifying for the seventh time in eight races this year. When probed on whether his bond with Hamilton had soured, Russell was quick to shut down such talk with a succinct seven-word retort, as reported by GPblog : \"No, not at all. The relationship's good,\" he responded. Charles Leclerc made X-rated admission moments after emotional Monaco GP win Lewis Hamilton sparks concern with \"not excited about racing\" admission Hamilton, meanwhile, seemed less than thrilled with how things are panning out following a lacklustre seventh-place finish in qualifying and the race, trailing two spots behind Russell in each. While Mercedes have maintained that they're remaining impartial, Hamilton hinted at a sense of inequality, reports the Express . He said: \"I anticipated it would be difficult to out-qualify George because he has the upgraded component, but it's just great to see that we are bringing upgrades. But once we got to qualifying... I don't understand. \"I already know automatically that I'm going to lose two-tenths going into qualifying, and that's definitely frustrating and it's something that I don't really have an answer for at the moment. I'm not driving any different, the laps were really great, just lacking something. Lewis Hamilton fears Mercedes are favouring Russell over him ( Image: Getty Images) \"I don't anticipate being ahead of George in qualifying particularly this year, but we've just got to keep pushing, and the races are strong.\" When asked to expand on his why he thinks that, Hamilton vaguely responded: \"We'll see.\" Mercedes boss Toto Wolff once again insisted that both Hamilton and Russell are receiving equal treatment, suggesting the former might be overthinking the situation. The team principal questioned: \"Aren't all drivers a bit sceptical at times? \"As a team we have always demonstrated - even in the most tense competitions between team-mates - that we are always trying to balance what is right and be transparent and fair. \"I can understand as a driver you want the best out of yourself and the team, and sometimes when it is going against you you can question that. But as a team we are 100 per cent on a mission of giving both drivers the best possible cars and strategies. \"We are trying to do the best out of the relationship (with Hamilton), trying to maximise the results for what is our final season together. And that situation between drivers and teams can be tense at times because everybody wants to do the best.\" This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

        "description": "Since Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks probed around the edges of Rafah and entered some of its eastern districts but had not yet entered the city in full force.",
        "content": "CAIRO, Egypt – Israeli tanks reached the centre of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, May 28, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza city that has sparked global condemnation. The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area without commenting on reported advancements into the city center. Overnight, its forces pounded the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing its offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly. Since that strike, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighborhoods and took positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area. Witnesses in Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armored vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate response. Since Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah and entered some of its eastern districts but had not yet entered the city in full force. Reacting to Sunday night’s attack in a camp where families displaced from assaults elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel’s assault. Residents said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday’s deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. “Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,” one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. – Rappler.com",

        "content": "Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadid were recently spotted dancing during Stevie Nicks’ performance at BottleRock music festival over the weekend. The Maestro actor and the 29-year-old supermodel, who were captured swaying to Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams in Napa Valley, were placed in the VIP section as seen in the fan video on X. The loved-up couple appear to have a penchant for concert dates, as they were spotted dancing at Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour shows in Paris only weeks ago. Most recently, Zayn Malik’s former girlfriend was caught enjoying a Philly cheese-steak, which was prepared by her beau, who was at the event with Angelo’s Pizzeria owner Danny DiGiampietro. Previously, the duo made headlines when Cooper expressed interest in having children, sparking pregnancy rumours over the internet. As it was reported by Life & Style earlier, the actor has been “vocal about the fact that he wants another child and was hoping that it would happen before he turns 50.\" The source added that since Cooper has always seen Gigi as 'baby mama material,’ he’s adamant to embrace fatherhood at his earliest. It added: \"His big birthday is in January, so no one’s expecting him to have a baby in his arms by that point, but he’s very clear that his intentions with Gigi are very serious.\"",

        "content": "Durham, N.C., May 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pairwise , a company pioneering genetics-based innovation in food and agriculture, launched the first CRISPR food in North America last year – its leafy greens blend, edited with CRISPR for improved flavor. Starting this month, as the next phase of commercialization, Pairwise has entered into an exclusive product licensing agreement with Bayer to further develop and sell the products at scale. With higher nutrition compared to lettuce, the leafy greens are a mixture of multi-use mustard green varieties that Pairwise edited using the company’s proprietary FulcrumTM Platform . By dialing down the wasabi-like flavor of the raw leaves, Pairwise created a new product for consumers who prefer a less-pungent taste but still want the nutrition of fresh mustard greens. This licensing deal is part of Bayer’s new open innovation approach , launched to leverage opportunities for genome edited fruits and vegetables. The agreement allows Bayer to further develop and commercialize 10 varieties of Pairwise-edited greens, and to develop and breed for new varieties with the technology. “We’re extremely proud to have introduced the first CRISPR food in North America last year, demonstrating our ability to deliver a unique product that people want to buy,” said Tom Adams, Pairwise Co-Founder and CEO. “Bayer is a strong partner for this licensing agreement with considerable market reach that we feel can extend the impact and success of our first consumer product widely into the marketplace.” “This agreement and its focus on gene edited produce made a substantial contribution to our open innovation approach,” said JD Rossouw, Head of Vegetables Research & Development at Bayer’s Crop Science division. “We are excited by the potential for these products developed by Pairwise as we bring them forward to create a new category of nutritious and great-tasting leafy greens.” Major innovations in produce, including baby carrots and easy-peel mandarins, have delivered significant consumer benefits such as improving the enjoyment, convenience, and snackability of healthy foods. In addition to successfully introducing the nutritious mustard greens with improved flavor, Pairwise is using CRISPR to accelerate more of these game-changing products across food and agriculture. # # # About Pairwise: Pairwise is pioneering the application of CRISPR technology in food and agriculture. The company brings together leaders in agriculture, technology, and consumer foods to harness the transformative potential of new genomics technologies to create innovative new products. Pairwise is working to develop new varieties of crops, and to partner with organizations that seek to deliver innovation across the plant-based economy. Backed by industry leading investors Deerfield, Aliment Capital, Leaps by Bayer, and Temasek, Pairwise raised $90 million in a successful series B funding round in February 2021, bringing total fundraising to $115 million. The company was founded by Chief Executive Officer Tom Adams and Chief Business Officer Haven Baker, with scientific co-founders J. Keith Joung, Lead Translator at Arena BioWorks; David Liu, Director of the Merkin Institute of Transformative Technologies in Healthcare, and Vice-Chair of the Faculty at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT; and Feng Zhang, McGovern Investigator and a professor at MIT.

        "description": "The former US president has a cameo in the Home Alone sequel.",
        "content": "Home Alone actor Daniel Stern has said he and members of the crew racked up a $7,000 (€6,436) bar bill for Donald Trump after filming a cameo with the former US president. Stern is best known for his role as hapless criminal Marv in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. Advertisement The second film was shot at the Plaza Hotel in New York, which was owned by Trump at the time, and the mogul has a brief cameo in one scene. Discussing his night with The Apprentice star, he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I had met him that day on the shoot and that night, me and the stunt guys and some crew guys were at the hotel bar and Mr Trump walked through. It might be May but we're living our Christmas dreams 🎄 One-half of Home Alone's 'Wet Bandits', Daniel Stern AKA 'Marv' talks about starring in the iconic movie. pic.twitter.com/Tk3MxJZmdb Advertisement Advertisement — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) May 28, 2024 “He pointed and was very appreciative and said ‘drinks are on me’ and so we bought drinks for the entire bar, for the entire night. We hit him pretty good on the bill. Advertisement “Liam, my stunt guy, we figured it was about 7,000 bucks which is a drop in the bucket to the man and he felt good about it, we felt good about it so that was a win win.” Stern has since appeared in shows such as Manhattan and For All Mankind but is still best known for his role as one half of the Wet Bandits, alongside Joe Pesci, in the classic Christmas comedies. Despite the fact the films are festive staples, Stern, who has written an autobiography called Home And Alone, said he has only ever seen the film once. He said: “It was funny because when I wrote the book, and I was writing about the tarantula scene, I wrote out how I remembered it, what happened and what was funny and then my daughter read the book for me and said ‘that’s not what happens in the movie’ and I went ‘oh’ and I had to go back and watch the scene again to see how it actually went. Advertisement Advertisement “Since the movie came out, I go through my life with people saying ‘we love you, we watch you, you’re a big part of my holiday’ and it’s so overwhelming sometimes. I don’t know why it’s happened but it’s a blessing of a lifetime.” Recalling working with star Macaulay Culkin, who played central character Kevin McCallister, Stern said he was more like an adult than a child. He said: “He was a professional actor. That’s what you give up a lot of times when you’re working as a kid and living in New York. “I love him, I loved him then – he was the same age as one of my kids and I was very protective of him. We all went to the park to play... but he was under the microscope. A kid actor is a dangerous situation.” Advertisement",

Ronaldo has now taken his tally to 64 goals in 69 games for Al-Nassr, and he will be looking to add to that tally in the King Cup final against unbeaten Saudi Pro League champions Al-Hilal.

        "content": "Poundland has launched a brand new meal deal offer across all of its 850 stores and it will only set you back £3. The high street bargain retailer's offer will include a main, drink and a side and there are over 400 items to choose from in the range. Mains will include sandwiches, wraps, salads, sushi and rolls and sides include pastries, chocolate, crisps, fruit and meat trays. There will also be around 200 drinks to choose from. Poundland says the main food options come from high quality companies that already supply other multiple retailers such as M&S . The ranges have been developed in partnership with Greencore and On A Roll, a sandwich supplier from the North East of England. The launch sees Poundland offer the \"cheapest\" meal deal on the market right now. Tesco's popular meal deal used to set you back just £3 too - but it now costs £3.90 or £3.40 for those with a Clubcard. Poundland says this is what \"sets it apart\" from other lunchtime deals. Head of chilled and frozen Kyle Storey said: \"Our mission here at Poundland has always been to provide our customers with the best possible value, without compromising on taste or quality. With our new meal deal, we're not only offering an unbeatable price, but also ensuring that everyone can access a delicious and satisfying meal without the need for a plastic loyalty card.\" Triple lock plus explained: What is it and how would it impact my pension?

        "content": "Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse is set to release its next RPG in just over one month. The studio reveals in a press release that releases on July 4 on PlayStation, PC, and mobile. Better yet, we're getting cross-progression and cross-play from the word go, so you can play with friends or take your progress on the go if your iOS or Android device is up to the task. The release date puts me in mild peril as Final Fantasy 14's Dawntrail expansion launches just two days before, though the early July launch does ensure HoYoverse's new launch , which is likely wise. HoYoverse also reveals that Zenless Zone Zero has racked up 35 global pre-registrations, which is five million short of the ultimate 40 million goal. It's decent when you consider that the studio's flagship title, . Mind you, it's also worth noting that Genshin hype has likely contributed massively here. As for what this one's about, the urban fantasy-themed action RPG takes us to a post-apocalyptic world where supernatural disasters called 'Hollows' have left modern society looking worse for wear. Despite the odds, the city New Eridu has risen to take up the mantle of the last remnant of contemporary civilization. Your role in this is of a 'Proxy' who guides others through those Hollows. Who knows, as you face enemies and complete commissions, you may unravel what's really going on. You're still getting the sort of action RPG gameplay you'll recognize from other HoYoverse games, though what's unique here are the roguelike elements folded in. Entering each dungeon – a Hollow – comes with a board showing various routes to your goal. Those routes take you across tiles that will either fling you into a skirmish, offer loot, or form part of a puzzle you must solve to continue. but here's hoping the full release changes our mind. If we can get away from or Final Fantasy 14's Dawntrail expansion, that is.",

        "content": "The main topic of discussion remains the future of Kevin De Bruyne, and according to CaughtOffside sources with knowledge of the club’s plans, a first attempt by the Cityzens to get the Belgian to renew has left a lot to still be discussed. Both club and player will meet again in the coming weeks as they will need to delve deeper into the various aspects of any deal. Man City want Lucas Paqueta to replace Bernardo Silva The insistent interest from the Saudi Pro League remains active as some Saudi clubs consider De Bruyne among the main targets for the summer. They will try and tempt him again and, given that he hasn’t rebuffed the interest out of hand, his future is, therefore, is still to be defined. Another situation that needs to be resolved quickly is related to Bernardo Silva. The Portuguese is believed to be hoping that Barcelona come in for him, whilst Paris Saint-Germain are apparently increasing the pressure on him to sign for them. Given his expected exit, West Ham’s Lucas Paqueta remains a concrete objective for the Premier League champions, even if the betting issue has frozen everything for now. In addition to the Brazilian, Xavi Simons is on City’s list – as well as many other teams in Europe – as is Bruno Guimaraes who, unless there are sensational twists, should leave Newcastle in the summer. On the incoming front, Pep Guardiola remains very interested in Joao Neves, the young Benfica talent, who has now become a key player for the Portuguese club. The stumbling block to that deal at present is that the club don’t want to negotiate his release clause which has been set at €120m.",

        "content": "Dozens of protesters staged a peaceful demonstration at the Nasarawa State Government House in Lafia, urging the leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to return the party’s chairmanship to the North Central, which the zone lost after Senator Abdullahi Adamu’s resignation. The protest took place during a meeting of the APC stakeholders in North Central in Lafia, the state capital at the weekend. The meeting was attended by the secretary to the government of the federation, George Akume, who represented President Tinubu, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the APC national chairman, governors, and lawmakers from the zone. The protesters, some of whom were members of the coalition of APC North Central stakeholders, marched to the venue of the meeting chanting “Ganduje must go”. Since the former Kano State governor assumed the party’s leadership post, there has been ongoing contention, especially from the North Central APC members advocating for the completion of Adamu’s tenure by a representative from their zone. Sani Ibrahim Jigas, a member of the coalition, who addressed newsmen on behalf of the protesters, said: “We want the APC to work according to the party’s constitution by returning the chairmanship to the North Central. Let’s finish our tenure. We will not allow someone from another zone to collect what is being given to us.” He said the North Central merited the party’s chairmanship having produced five APC governors out of the six states and worked for the success of President Tinubu during the 2023 election.",

Photo: Unsplash The ban on single-use bags is part of Dubai ‘s efforts to eliminate disposable items and promote a more sustainable, greener environment. According to Dubai Municipality, bags that are thinner than 57 micrometers, whether composed of paper, plastic, or recyclable materials will be banned. Specific exemptions will allow bags thicker than 58 micrometers and bags for wrapping poultry and bread to continue to be used. This ban on single-use materials is an essential part of Dubai’s wider environmental plan and follows after efficient initiatives implemented in other UAE regions. For example, the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi reports that since the ban on single-use plastic bags was enacted in June 2022, the usage of single-use plastic has fallen by 95% in the first year of the ban. Dubai has outlined a plan for additional prohibitions in the upcoming years. On January 1, 2025, the ban will extend to single-use plastic items like stirrers, tablecloths, cups, styrofoam food containers, straws, and cotton swabs. The ban will also be applied to plastic cups, dinnerware, plates, and food containers by January 1, 2026. Penalties for non-compliance with the ban will be enforced, with fines beginning at AED 200. Repeated violations within a year will increase to a maximum of AED 2,000 hs. Customers are advised to notify the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism of any non-compliant retailers. View this post on Instagram A post shared by بلدية دبي (@dubaimunicipality) The Dubai Municipality has released an awareness guide in both Arabic and English which will assist with the ban on single-use bags. According to the recommendations, recyclable bags are not permitted as they need to be recycled at specific facilities and, if disposed of in a landfill, can decompose into dangerous microplastics. The significance of this guide was made clear by Mohammed Alrayees, the head of Dubai Municipality’s Waste Strategy and Projects Department. Dubai’s efforts represent a big step toward lowering plastic waste and encouraging its citizens to embrace more environmentally friendly habits. Residents are encouraged to review the Dubai Municipality’s online guide for additional in-depth information which offers answers to frequently asked questions for sustainable substitutes for single-use plastics.

Its eastern flank, bordered by Russia 's Kaliningrad and Belarus, will be shored up with minefields, anti-tank ditches and bunkers. A staunch supporter of Ukraine , the European country is looking to keep both Russia and its nefarious ally Belarus firmly at bay with a state-of-the-art defence line. Polish PM Donald Tusk announced the new program to make Nato 's eastern border “impassable to a potential enemy” earlier this month. On Monday defence minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz unveiled the specifics of the East Shield, dubbed the \"Tusk Line\" by Polish media. The line of defence will include steel barriers, reinforced steel hedgehogs, pallisades, trenches, tank traps and planned minefields. Other Nato states including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are collaborating on the ambitious project - set to be finished by 2028. Countries in Europe have long been sharing concerns about a potential world conflict with Russia - as he pushes forward with his illegal war in Ukraine . Poland shares a 130-mile border with Russian territory Kaliningrad and an 170-mile one with Belarus. It's government said the country is being targeted by Russian aggression via those frontiers. The hits come in the form of Russian cyberattacks, attempted arson and forced migration across the borders. Tusk said Alexander Lukashenk, Belarus' dictator president, is pushing a \"hybrid war of migration\" on Poland. He said: “Those are not refugees, those are less and less migrants, families, poor people needing help. “In 80 per cent of the cases, these are organised groups of men, aged 18 to 30, very aggressive.” Army officials say the technique is designed to destabilise Europe as a whole - somewhat shielded from Russia for now behind Poland. The Tusk Line is the largest effort to strengthen Poland's eastern border since 1945. Defence chief Kamysz said yesterday: \"The ‘East Shield’ deterrence and defence plan is the largest operation to strengthen the eastern border of Poland, the eastern flank of Nato, since 1945. “It will be a combination of terrain conditions with fortifications and modern technology .” He said the goal of the shield is to: “protect the territory of Poland, hamper the mobility of our adversary’s troops while making such mobility easier for our own troops and to protect civilians.\" It will include “all kinds of fortifications, barriers, monitoring of the air space on every level and upgrading the existing systems\". Ukraine built its own line of defence with 42,000 concrete \"dragon's teeth\" along barbed wire-lined trenches . The 600-mile wall is made from anti-tank obstacles, underground bunkers and fortified trenches. Only days ago, one of Putin's cronies appeared on State TV to deliver a disturbing warning to other Nato states . Major Nikolay Plotnikov said the warmonger president needs to correct a \"historical mistake\" to bring Russia back to Soviet glory. The tank commander said Moscow should grab Narva in Estonia, Daugavpils in Latvia and Klaipeda in Lithuania. He believes Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin , former Russian dictators, caused an \"injustice\" by letting the territories go. Now the Putin crony thinks Moscow should take back the Baltic strongholds. He also took the opportunity to threaten the same countries, telling them to stop showing support for Ukraine during Vlad's illegal war. The Baltic republics have been boosting their land defences against Russia throughout more than two years of war. Only days ago The Sun spoke to several former army generals who warned that Putin is looking to expand is sea borders in a move against Nato countries . Putin’s defence ministry announced a shock bid to change Russian maritime borders with Finland and Lithuania last Wednesday. Russia is reportedly planning to take over Gotland - east of Sweden - which General Richard Shirreff says would give Putin dangerous levels of control in the Baltics.",

        "description": "David Fowler was a GP at Cove Bay and Kincorth Medical Centre for 35 years and team doctor for Cove Rangers FC.",
        "content": "Hugely respected Cove Rangers FC doctor David Fowler has died following a 10-year battle with blood cancer. The former Cove Bay and Kincorth Medical Practice GP and team doctor for the Altens-based club passed away at the age of 65 on Saturday. His passing came just days after he took to the stage for In a moving tribute from his former colleagues at the medical practice, they said it was fitting that his “last hoorah” was as part of a team, helping others. “He nearly didn’t make it as his health further failed but with trademark determination to do his bit he joined his 23 new friends on the catwalk earlier this month,” they said. “Everyone of them received huge support on an emotional couple of evenings but the arena simply erupted as David rose from his chair and with support made it up the catwalk to strut his stuff. “It was somewhat fitting that his last hoorah was as part of a team helping others and giving every bit of strength left towards it.” ‘Care, compassion and warmth’ Dr Fowler, who was known as Dave, was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2013, which later became terminal in 2019. about his illness earlier this year, he said: “I think it made me a better doctor; maybe even a better person.” Originally from Drumoak, he joined Cove Bay Medical Practice in 1985. His colleagues said his popularity grew rapidly among patients because of his “care, compassion and warmth”. He retired from the practice in 2020 after 35 years to spend more time with his wife Hazel and son Calum. However he continued with his passion, becoming a team doctor for local club Cove Rangers FC, a role he held previously between 1991 and 1995. said he was the “kindest of men” as they revealed he had sadly passed away. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that we inform of the passing of our dearly loved colleague after a long illness borne with immense courage and dignity,” t . “Nothing was ever too much for him and he always found time for others in their time of need. “His popularity grew and with it demands on his time, but he never complained, and his patients were happy to wait – he was worth it. “Caring, listening and supporting were his vocation. To patients, staff and colleagues further flung he was simply the best.” Colleagues were “honoured” to have worked with him They added that few people would have been aware of his own health struggles over the last 20 years as he “cast these aside to concentrate on the plight of others”. “We often heard from patients that they had spotted him helping out in various parts of the health service – he was just that sort of man,” they said. “We are truly humbled and honoured to have worked with you. We are proud to have been colleagues and friends. You were not just a wonderful doctor but a wonderful person. You will never be forgotten. “Should we all capture just a fraction of what made you such then we will be greatly the better for it. For all you did for us we are now due this for you.” Cove Rangers FC tribute to team doctor Scottish League One club Cove Rangers FC has also paid tribute, remembering their “valuable” team doctor. “A hugely popular member of staff, David has been club doctor since Cove’s early days in the Highland League, and back then he travelled to all away matches as well as attending home games,” they said. “David cut back on his involvement due to family commitments for a time, but following his retiral as a GP, he threw himself back into the role, travelling the length and breadth of the country to be there for the players, covering the matches as well as nightly training sessions. “He did so, providing valuable support and expertise, until close to the end of last season. “The ‘Doc’ will be sadly missed by all of us at the Balmoral Stadium.” Former patients pay tribute to Dr Fowler Countless former patients and co-workers have also shared tributes online. Christine Mann wrote: “One of the nicest GPs I’ve had the pleasure of working with, supportive and generous with his time and laughs. Heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.” Alan Reid added: “Dave was my doctor who always made time for his patients. When you had an appointment with Dave, you knew that he would be running late because he cared.” Suzy Sherrit said: “I’m truly sad to read this news. Dr Fowler helped me and my family through some of the hardest times of my life. Nothing was too small, and he always took the time you needed. “I’m forever grateful to him for that.”",

        "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Three players quit Argentina’s women’s squad on Monday in a dispute over not being paid and conditions at a camp ahead of two friendlies. Goalkeeper Laurina Oliveiros, defender Julieta Cruz and midfielder Lorena Benitez, all regular starters, walked out. “We reached a point in which we are tired of the injustices, of not being valued, not being heard and, even worse, being humiliated,” Cruz posted on Instagram. “We need improvements for Argentina’s women’s soccer national team, and I am not only talking about finances. I speak about training, having lunch, breakfast.” Cruz and Benitez said during national squad training sessions they received a ham and cheese sandwich and a banana, which they consider inadequate for high-performance athletes. They said the Argentine Football Association told them they won’t be paid for the friendlies against Costa Rica on Friday and Monday because the games are at home in Buenos Aires. Benitez added their family members were being charged 5,000 pesos ($5) for match tickets. “And there there are millions of things we have gone through,” the midfielder added. Oliveros wrote on Instagram, “With a broken heart and thousands of dreams disappearing little by little. May the next generations enjoy and be happy running after the football, as we were sometime ago.” AFA did not comment on the players’ decision. Estefania Banini, considered the country’s best female player ever, supported her three former teammates. Last year, she also decided to stop playing for the national team. “A matter of time. Thanks for being willing to speak about it,” the Atletico Madrid midfielder said on her social media channels. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

Canada, Oman and Namibia secured a win in their respective first warm-up matches in the T20 World Cup. Canada kicked it off with an all-round performance against Nepal in Dallas. Nicholas Kirtan and Ravinderpal Singh with crucial contributions helped Canada get to a strong score of 183 runs and then defended it brilliantly by skittling out their opponent for just 120. Dilon Heyliger was the star of the show with the ball for Canada as he registered figures of 4/20. Kushal Malla's 37 was the highest score by a Nepal batter as the Rohit Paudel-led side suffered a middle-order collapse to go from 59/2 to 120 all out. In the first game at the Brian Lara Academy in Tarouba, Oman huffed and puffed their way to a 3-wicket win against Papua New Guinea. After a good show with the ball to restrict PNG to just 137, Oman kept losing wickets at regular intervals before Mohammad Nadeem's unbeaten 11-ball 22 took his side home. Zeeshan Maqsood's 45 off 42 helped Oman stem the flow of wickets from one end before Nadeem's cameo finished it off for them. In the day's final game, Namibia proved too strong for Uganda at the same venue in Tarouba. Namibia first restricted Uganda to a chasable score of 134/8. Even though Namibia too lost a couple of batters for low scores, including skipper Gerhard Erasmus, but a rapid 34-ball fifty from Nikolaas Davin was enough for the African nation to get rid of any nerves in the chase. Eventually, Namibia chased down the target in 18.5 overs and will be in action once against a depleted Australian team in the second warm-up game. In the other two games on Wednesday, May 28, Sri Lanka play the Netherlands in Florida while the USA play Bangladesh in Dallas.",

Example – @RayuduAmbati and I were messing around after the IPL final and all of a sudden that banter has turned into an avalanche of abuse towards Ambati. PLEASE stop it?” it further added. The incident took place after the IPL final when Ambati Rayudu changed from orange clothes to a blue outfit following Hyderabad’s loss against Kolkata. “I’ve at least held firm. I wore it and I owned it,” said Pietersen pointing out towards his purple dress. “You are a joker, always a joker,” Pietersen further went on to say live on Star Sports. Come on guys!

Example – @RayuduAmbati and I were messing around after the IPL final and all of sudden that banter has turned into an avalanche of abuse towards Ambati. PLEASE stop it? 🙏🏽 — Kevin Pietersen🦏 (@KP24) May 28, 2024 This led to many trolls being directed towards the 38-year-old as Rayudu has been publicly critical of Virat Kohli’s contributions stating that scoring a lot of runs every season does not guarantee an IPL trophy and that RCB needed to show more faith in the youngsters rather than relying on Kohli alone.

These include Supervised Learning, Deep Neural Networks, Dimensionality Reduction, Unsupervised Learning, Sequential models, Reinforcement learning, Generative AI and LLMs, and Causal Inference with a focus on fostering a strong foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Machine Learning Summer School is open to all engineering students enrolled in Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degrees from any recognized institute in India and are expected to graduate in 2025 or 2026. Eligible students will be required to take an assessment, and the top 3000 students will then be enrolled in ML Summer School. Rajeev Rastogi, Vice President, International Machine Learning, Amazon, says, “Machine learning has become pivotal in solving customer problems driving a surge in demand for ML. However, the demand for ML workforce is surpassing the available talent pool. With Amazon ML Summer School, our aim is to bridge this gap by making students industry-ready for science careers, focusing on cultivating ML expertise and applied science skills. Besides delivering top-tier training across a wide range of machine learning topics, this year, we’re also emphasizing an application-driven approach crucial to equipping talent with hands-on experience to tackle real-world challenges.’’ Amazon’s ML Summer School takes a different approach from traditional programs by offering a unique learning experience combining theoretical concepts with practical applications. It aligns with current industry trends and university courses, catering to students with diverse ML backgrounds. By the end of the program, students will have gained proficiency in key ML technologies. Speaking on the experience, Prabash Male, a participant from the MLSS 2022 batch and currently working as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, said, “Amazon ML – Summer School had a significant impact on my career path in machine learning research. Sessions that were conducted as part of the summer school gave me unique insights into how most of the algorithms and concepts that I learned in college were being applied to solve large-scale problems across Amazon. This program helped me secure an internship with the Automatic Speech Recognition team in the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) org. I gained hands-on experience training large-scale speech models, which directly contributed to other ongoing projects within Amazon. Overall, the summer school program provided me with an exceptional learning experience.” Since its pilot in 2021, the Amazon ML Summer School has rapidly evolved, demonstrating exceptional growth. The inaugural edition saw applications from over 3900 students, with more than 300 students earning the opportunity to join the program. Building on this success, in 2023, the program was expanded to include engineering students enrolled in any recognized institute in India and attracted over 61000 applicants, with 20000 women registering for the course. if (!window.AdButler){(function(){var s = document.createElement(\"script\"); s.async = true; s.type = \"text/javascript\";s.src = 'https://servedbyadbutler.com/app.js';var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n);}());} var AdButler = AdButler || {}; AdButler.ads = AdButler.ads || [];var abkw = window.abkw || '';var plc516228 = window.plc516228 || 0;document.write('');AdButler.ads.push({handler: function(opt){ AdButler.register(182450, 516228, [728,90], 'placement_516228_'+opt.place, opt); }, opt: { place: plc516228++, keywords: abkw, domain: 'servedbyadbutler.com', click:'CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER' }});",

        "content": "POKÉMON switched up the formula of its mainline games, and there are always monthly updates with extra gaming content. This includes seven-star raids, a type of difficult battle which can earn players super powerful Pokémon. In these difficult raids, you can team up with up to four other players – or go solo – to defeat the raid Pokémon and catch it. This June, you will have the chance to catch Swampert the Unrivalled, a powerful version of the fan-favourite Generation 3 starter Pokémon. It will come with the Poison Tera type, and the ability Damp, which prevents Explosion-type moves. Like other seven-star raids, The Mighty Swampert will come at level 100, so you will need to match its level if you want a chance to catch it. Swampert is also likely to have strong Water-, Ground-, and Poison-type moves, so you’ll need to prepare a tough Pokémon to take it down. You will have two weekends where you can encounter Swampert the Unrivalled, with one raid appearing on each day of the weekend. This will give you six chances to catch your own, though you will only be able to catch one Swampert total. The first weekend that the Swampert is available starts on Friday, May 31, 2024, and ends on Sunday, June 2, 2024. You will have a second chance to battle and catch Swampert from Friday, June 7, 2024, until Sunday, June 9, 2024. After these dates, The Mighty Swampert will likely not return to the game, so it’s worth catching one while you can.

        "content": "A railway station is designated as Junction where railway lines to multiple destinations split off. Railway Junction needs at least three train lines going out of the station and trains that come into the station must have at least two outgoing train lines. New Delhi: New Delhi Railway Station is in the news because of the massive redevelopment program of the station which is expected to be started later this year. To ensure smooth movement of trains, Indian Railways will divert trains to nearby locations including Delhi Junction (DLI), popularly called as ‘Old Delhi Railway Station’, Anand Vihar Railway Station, Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station, Delhi Cantt Railway Station, and Sarai Rohilla. A railway station is designated a junction when three or more train routes converge or diverge for different destinations. New Delhi Railway Station (NDLS) has only one route passing through it – Tilak Bridge-Shivaji Bridge-New Delhi-Sadar Bazar-Old Delhi Jn so it is not defined as Junction. The Indian Railways’ Mathura Junction station has seven routes, the most of any station. Some of the examples are: Mathura Junction has the maximum routes among all the railway stations across India. While Mathura has 7 routes, Salem Junction has six routes Vijayawada Junction, five and Bareilly Junction has five routes. New Delhi Railway Station redevelopment New Delhi Railway Station is all set to get redeveloped on a large scale and will be equipped with modern amenities once built. To ensure smooth operation of trains, the Indian Railways will divert, regulate the trains as needed to accommodate the ongoing work. The Ministry of Railways on Monday (May 27) released a statement stating that all necessary notifications regarding train diversions and regulations will be issued ahead of time to keep travelers informed. The ministry issued the statement following media reports about a temporary closure of NDLS for redevelopment work. The Railway Ministry’s Amrit Bharat Station Scheme is aimed at modernising several railway stations across India, with New Delhi Railway Station one of them. Several premium trains, including NDLS-Howrah Rajdhani Express and other Rajdhani trains connecting the capitals of states, New Delhi-Ayodhya Vande Bharat Express, Shatabdi Express, Duronto Express operate from New Delhi Railway Station.",

This includes seven-star raids, a type of difficult battle which can earn players super powerful Pokémon . In these difficult raids, you can team up with up to four other players – or go solo – to defeat the raid Pokémon and catch it. This June, you will have the chance to catch Swampert the Unrivalled, a powerful version of the fan-favourite Generation 3 starter Pokémon. It will come with the Poison Tera type, and the ability Damp, which prevents Explosion-type moves. Like other seven-star raids, The Mighty Swampert will come at level 100, so you will need to match its level if you want a chance to catch it. Swampert is also likely to have strong Water-, Ground-, and Poison-type moves, so you’ll need to prepare a tough Pokémon to take it down. You will have two weekends where you can encounter Swampert the Unrivalled, with one raid appearing on each day of the weekend. This will give you six chances to catch your own, though you will only be able to catch one Swampert total. The first weekend that the Swampert is available starts on Friday, May 31, 2024, and ends on Sunday, June 2, 2024. You will have a second chance to battle and catch Swampert from Friday, June 7, 2024, until Sunday, June 9, 2024. After these dates, The Mighty Swampert will likely not return to the game, so it’s worth catching one while you can.

        "content": "An 18-year-old American boy, Jalen McLean, is now a millionaire after winning the $ 1million lottery. McLean won the jackpot after his sibling, Dasha Silas, bought the Jumbo Bucks ticket on his behalf on May 21. 'He had a huge smile on his face. Like so big it looked like the movie character Venom, ' Silas told NC Education Lottery officials. According to FOX 8, Silas purchased the ticket from Valero in Fayetteville later that night and watched her brother scratch it off. McLean, the youngest of five siblings, gave his ticket to North Carolina Education Lottery officials and collected some of his winnings on May 22. Although McLean requested that his sister buy him a scratch card, she was the one who decided to purchase the Jumbo Bucks ticket from the Valero on South McPherson Church Road. The Jumbo Bucks tickets were first released on June 6, 2023, and its top prize is $1 million. According to the NC Education Lottery website, the rules of the game are to match the scratched-off numbers with the winning numbers. Ticket purchasers who get a 10X symbol win 10 times the prize shown for it. McLean told NC Education Lottery officials that he feels like 'the luckiest guy in the universe.' 'How many 18-year-olds win something like this?, ' he added. The new millionaire had the choice to walk away with $600,000 or receive his prize as an annuity of $50,000 for 20 years. The NC Education Lottery news release confirmed that McLean had decided to choose the yearly annuity. It means the 18-year-old will receive $50,000 every year until his entire $1 million cash prize is paid. Based on the annuity terms, McLean will likely receive a yearly $50,000 check until he turns 38. He still managed to leave the NC Education Lottery headquarters on May 22 with the first payment, which after required state and federal tax withholdings, came out to $35,753. McLean has yet to reveal everything he plans to do with the entire $1 million, but so far, he will be using some of the cash prize to buy an Audi.",

        "content": "Social activist, Aisha Yesufu has sparked a wave of controversy by suggesting that former President Muhammadu Buhari should be prosecuted alongside his former Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, in light of recent allegations surrounding aviation contracts during their administration. The call for joint accountability comes as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) intensifies its legal actions against Sirika, who has been charged along with family members and business associates for corrupt practices. Naija News had earlier reported that EFCC arraigned Sirika , his daughter Fatima, his son-in-law Jalal Sule Hamma, and Al Buraq Global Investment Limited, accusing them of conferring undue advantages on Sirika’s brother and his company, Enginos Nigeria Limited. The allegations include payments for aviation contracts that remain unfulfilled, with no evidence of work conducted to date. Adding to the controversy, the current Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, denounced the Nigeria Air project—an initiative from the Buhari administration—as a fraudulent scheme. According to Keyamo, the project, which was intended to establish a national carrier and boost national pride, was marred by secrecy and mismanagement. In a statement on her X handle, Yesufu criticized the focus on Sirika alone, arguing that to ignore Buhari’s involvement would constitute selective prosecution. “Prosecuting Hadi Sirika without prosecuting Muhammadu Buhari is selective prosecution,” Yesufu stated, calling for equal scrutiny of all parties involved in the alleged corruption.",

        "content": "The Anambra State Children’s Parliament has called on Governor Chukwuma Soludo to consider the establishment of separate correctional centres for children in conflict with the law across the state. The Speaker of the Parliament, Miss Victory Ekwunife, made the call on Monday during the 2024 Children’s Day Celebration in the state held at the Alex Ekwueme Square, Awka. The year’s celebration has as its theme, ‘Enhancing the total well-being of the Nigerian Child through quality education and skill development’ Speaking at the event, Miss Ekwunife cited Section 178 of the Child Rights, which makes it the responsibility of the state to provide correctional centres where children in conflict with the law will stay and go through rehabilitation before being integrated back into society. According to her, the current practice in the state, where children are sent to adult centres is wrong, as the children eventually come out of the centres as hardened criminals. While also calling for the establishment of shelter homes for children in abusive homes in line with Article 24 of the Child Rights Law, Ekwunife, said it helps the children stay away from such toxic home environments. “Last month, there was a case of a man who was raping her three daughters. “After the whole thing was settled, the girls were still taken back to the same house to still face the same man, because there was no shelter home in the state. “So, we appeal that this shelter be provided so that we would stop endangering the lives of the girl child. “Also, there is the need for the establishment of the Violence Against Persons Prohibition, VAPP Commission to be handling issues of violence against persons. “We appreciate all the governor is doing for the children of the state, but we are asking for more. “We are seeing the free education he has granted for basic education level and we appeal that it be extended to the senior secondary students, while enforcement of the policy should be made more efficient,” she appealed. In his speech, Governor Soludo said his government has taken numerous initiatives, aimed at providing the state a brighter future, through its investments in the development of the Anambra child. According to him, some of these initiatives include the free education policy, the State Health Insurance, the ASHIA initiative, and the massive transformation of health facilities in the state among others. Stressing that his government has underscored the place of children in the growth and development of the state, the governor maintained that he would continue to make their needs a priority for his administration. “I want to call on Anambra children to be proactive and hold their heads high in whatever they do because Anambra is an ‘A’ state. “There is also the need for parents to guide their children in the way of positivity as well as avoid influences that can lead them to crime and other vices. That’s a sure way to guarantee a better future for us all,” the governor maintained. Earlier in her remarks, the State Commissioner for Women and Social Welfare, Mrs Ify Obinabo said the establishment of a designated court for Children, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, has greatly reduced the incidences of gender-based violence across the state. The celebration featured a march past by schools in the state, as well as calisthenics and cultural performances, to the delight of the children, who turned out en masse for the August event.

        "content": "Kameleon007/iStock via Getty Images Three key indicators that measure investor expectations for the SPX are suggesting a major top is coming. As you'll see, all three points to an \"extreme\" degree of bullish sentiment in the universe of traders who trade the SPX. They are all indicating the same thing - the soon ending of this bull market and/or the beginning of a major correction. We believe it is highly probable the SPX will have a zero return over the next nine months, and a negative return over the next eighteen. What's More Important When Determining Outlook - Economic Forecasts or Investor Activity? It's not economic data itself, but how investors react to it, that drives stock prices. Up to 50% or more of an asset's price, either up or down, can be driven by the emotions of fear and greed alone. So, we don't forecast the economic picture; instead, we measure investor activity and what investors think the market will do. History has taught us that prices will move opposite what investors expect when \"too many\" investors have that expectation. I want to emphasize this last point: The theory applies only when those expectations have reached an extreme. Notice that the theory does not consider the economic situation. It simply states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a major market top or bottom is the existence of an extreme level of bullish or bearish sentiment. You only have to look to 2022 to see a recent truth of this statement. The key is knowing when there are \"too many.\" Professional SPX Money Managers Aren't Shorting This Market We pointed out in Commitments Of Traders Data Points To Higher Prices , published at the bottom of the bear market in 2022, that heavy short selling by professional money managers in SPX futures was pointing to a higher stock market. Simply put, there were just far \"too many\" bears. The same statistics today show that we have the opposite situation; there are now simply \"too many\" bulls and far \"too few\" bears. The number of E-mini contracts professional money managers are short (The Sentiment King) This chart graphs the number of contracts professional money managers are short the SPX. The numbers are reported by the CFTC every Friday, which we average over three weeks to gain a longer-term perspective. Study the chart. It's obvious that high short positions by money managers occur at market lows, and low short positions occur at market peaks. At just 184,258 contracts, money managers currently have the lowest short position since before the start of the great crash in 2008-09. This is extremely bearish. You Want SPX Dealers To Be Long the SPX As we also explained in the November article, it's very bullish whenever dealers in the SPX are heavily long the market. That's because their investment position is, more often than not, right! At that time, dealers were 75% long, which was the highest \"long\" percent in fifteen years and approaching the levels at the bottom of the 2008-09 crash. This too was another bullish signal two years ago. But today we have the opposite situation. Dealer's long positions are just 17.5% of their total. This is highlighted in yellow in the chart below. The percent dealers in E-mini futures are long (The Sentiment King) We've indicated with arrows previous periods when dealer long positions got below 20%. Like the short positions of the money managers, these extreme positions usually occur at the beginning, and ending, of major bull and bear markets. It's Not Good When Option Traders Buy \"Too Many\" SPX Calls In 1971 Martin Zweig created the \"puts to calls\" ratio to indicate what option traders expected the market to do. Since \"calls\" are bets the market will rise, and \"puts\" bets the market will decline, by comparing activity in both, one could get insights into the market expectations of option traders. His original ratio divided the number of \"put\" and \"call' contracts. However, we've found it more insightful to divide the amount of money going into \"puts\" and \"calls.\" This data is not readily available from the CBOE, but it is well worth the effort to purchase. The chart below divides the amount of \"money\" going into SPX \"puts\" by the amount going into SPX \"calls\" from 2012 to present. The ratios are averaged over 20 days to gain a longer-term perspective. Ratio of monet flowing into SPX puts versus calls averaged over twenty days (The Sentiment King) The black line represents when there's are more puts or calls. Low ratios occur near market peaks, and high ratios occur at market lows. The excess put buying in late 2022 through 2023 was indicative of the negative outlook option traders had for the market. They were wrong, and their current activity shows their bullish change of view. The trouble is the ratio has now swung to the opposite extreme, as we've indicated with a transparent green oval. This indicates that we are at levels of SPX \"call\" buying compared to \"put\" buying associated with past market tops. Asset Allocation As we said, we believe it is highly probable the SPX will have a zero return over the next nine months, and a negative return over the next eighteen. Our usual allocation of stocks and bonds/cash is 80-20. However, because of these indicators, our current allocation is 50% stocks, 7% gold, 20% Cash and 23% long-term Treasuries. We think rates will come down because of an economic slowdown, which will not be good for stocks but will be good for bonds. This asset allocation should be a good hedge against this event. It also reduces the need for the correct timing of such a transition, which is always very difficult. Once investors get extremely bearish again, and we reach extreme levels in our sentiment indicators, will we reallocate back to our normal 80-20? The Topping Process \"Market turns are as obscure while they're occurring as they are obvious after they've occurred.\" This piece of wisdom from William X Scheinman encapsulates an important truth about bull market tops. Bull market tops are very hard to call, let alone define, and are usually very confusing when you're going through them. Bull and bear markets have different characteristics. They are not opposites or mirror images of one another. You can see this difference by taking away the price scale of a stock chart and flipping it upside down. An experienced trader can easily tell the chart is upside-down by the chart patterns. The patterns aren't vertically symmetric. Bear markets usually end suddenly with different market sectors all bottoming at or round the same time. The bear market of 2022 was rather easy to call because of this. Our history of articles written in the latter half of 2022 proves this. But we're experienced enough not to expect the same clarity with the end of a bull market. That's because bull markets usually have multiple tops. There's a topping process that spreads out over time, with various sectors peaking at different times, forming a fan formation. While this process can be relatively short, the topping process can also take up to a year or more. The double or triple top chart patterns, or the formation of head and shoulder patterns, are indicative of this process. While an index might have an exact peak, there are often really two or three tops where different sectors peak. Still Looking for an August Peak in the SPX While we believe the market has begun the actual topping process (which could take months), we still think the actual peak in the SPX index will be in August. We explained why in this article . From this point forward, there should be numerous sell-offs and then rallies that fail. This should cause whipsaws and uncertainties, which, we believe, are best anticipated by the investment allocation we're recommending. We'll return to this forecast in the coming months to see if we are right, and whether this scenario is progressing within the bounds that we've specified.

Should behave well with the women, children and differently-abled people. When a man and a woman travel together, it is not necessary for the conductor to ask about their relationship. Don't ask such questions. Do not come drunk for duty. After 8 pm, the bus should stop at the place where women ask you. If any superior officer takes action against you for that, I will take action against him. Should carry all showing hands. Hearing a lot of bad things about the behaviour of employees of SWIFT. People should be treated with respect.\" The minister informed that steps are being taken to disburse salary to the employees on the first day of every month.

Free Sample Report + All Related Graphs & Charts @: https://www.advancemarketanalytics.com/sample-report/164778-global-frozen-carrot-market?utm_source=OpenPR&utm_medium=Suraj Frozen Carrot Market Definition: A frozen carrot is a vegetable that has been subjected to low temperatures, typically below the freezing point of water, to preserve its freshness and nutritional content. Carrots are commonly frozen to extend their shelf life and maintain their quality for longer periods. The process involves cleaning, peeling, and cutting the carrots into desired shapes before freezing them. Freezing helps to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and enzymatic activity that can cause spoilage, thereby keeping the carrots crisp, flavorful, and nutrient-rich. Frozen carrots can be stored in the freezer for several months and are often used in cooking, baking, or as a convenient ingredient in smoothies and soups. While the texture of frozen carrots may differ slightly from fresh ones after thawing, they remain a convenient and versatile option for incorporating this nutritious vegetable into various dishes throughout the year.

        "content": "Former Aston Villa striker Wesley has revealed he cried for 20 days and turned to drinking after suffering a serious knee injury in the 2-1 win over Burnley on New Year's Day in 2020. The Brazilian - who scored his fifth Premier League goal at Turf Moor - was stretchered off with 20 minutes to go after a scissor-like challenge by Burnley's Ben Mee which resulted in the abrupt end of Wesley's first season at Villa Park. It was a long road back for the striker, who returned to the matchday squad 480 days later in the 2020/21 season. Wesley spent time on loan at Club Brugge, Internacional and Levante before leaving Villa in the summer of 2023. He joined Stoke City for the season just gone, but struggled for form and is now searching for a new club. READ | What Sawiris and Edens texted Smith as ex-Villa boss sends Emery message READ | John Townley's notebook: Emery's change of title, Carlos transfer & Torres blow Having made a steady start to his Premier League career at Villa after recording five goal involvements in his first 12 games, Wesley was called-up to represent Brazil for the first time. It made the injury he'd suffer just six weeks after making his Selecao debut all the more devastating. \"It was very difficult for me because I was selected for the national team in November and then on January 1st I was injured,\" Wesley told human too . \"I scored against Burnley as well. \"The defender went in, I’ve got a scar on my leg. He went in and I got hurt. But I didn’t think it would be serious. The next day, the doctor said I needed an operation. I did the tests, everything had to be operated on. \"Mentally I was very shaken. My wife was with me. I was really shaken up. I went into drinking depression. I drank practically every day. I cried every day, practically for 20 days.\" Asked what helped him through the toughest part, Wesley said: \"I think it was my wife and god. At the time I wasn’t Christian, today I am Christian. \"My wife helped me a lot, she always talked to me, that I was going to turn it around because in this period it’s good to have someone with you. \"Players live under a lot of pressure. Not just playing football, but off the pitch as well. I’m practically the provider for my family and have to help everyone. \"Sometimes people who are going to the stadium, they see us playing happy, scoring goals, other things. But they don’t know what is behind us.\" \"That [Brazil call-up] was the happiest moment of my career,\" Wesley continued. \"I played eight minutes against Argentina and it was a great experience. \"The national team is something that every young child who plays football thinks about, having the privilege of playing for the national team. I worked hard to get into the national team and when the day came I was very happy.\"",

        "content": "LOUISIANA State gymnast Olivia Dunne has turned heads on her latest sun-drenched summer vacation. The 21-year-old model rocked a green swimsuit and wicker hat for a horseriding expedition in Los Cabos, Mexico. Dunne recently completed her senior year at LSU, ending her collegiate career with a national title. The Sports Illustrated model has since starred in another edition of the iconic swimwear magazine. And she showed off her stunning figure in a vacation shoot from the sun-drenched beaches of Mexico's Pacific coast. Livvy rode the horse along golden sands under bright blue skies, sharing a short clip with her adoring fanbase. \"The horse’s name was Friday,\" she captioned the sultry set. Her army of 5.2 million Instagram fans were quick to comment on the \"stunning\" photoshoot. \"You're perfect!\" gasped one fan in response. \"Mexico looks good on ya,\" said another. \"A GOAT ON A HORSE,\" laughed a third. \"That smile is everything,\" wrote a fourth. Dunne ended her college career as a national champion following LSU's historic NCAA Championship win in March. She is currently dating MLB rookie sensation Paul Skenes and took a timeout from SI duties to watch him pitch for the Pittsburgh Pirates. \"I had some nerves creep in at first,\" Dunne told Sportsnet Pittsburgh prior to his debut on May 11. \"But I've kind of channeled it into excitement rather than nerves, and I just have the most confidence in him ever. \"I just trust in him, and what he's put in, and I'm just so excited. Olivia Dunne and Paul Skenes managed to keep their relationship a secret before finally going public last summer. The pair met at LSU, but it's not clear when they started dating. Rumors of a romance began when Dunne watched LSU win the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska last summer. And Dunne then posted selfies from Fort Myers in Florida, where Skenes was playing. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates and began his pro career by playing in minor leagues in the Sunshine State. The final clue came when Dunne posed in a Pirates cap before the pair finally went public. \"It's amazing, the support here is awesome. Pittsburgh has been so welcoming.\" Across three starts, Skenes already has 21 strikeouts in 16 innings pitched. He has only allowed four earned runs, giving him an ERA of 2.25. The couple met at LSU, although exactly when they began dating is unclear. Skenes confirmed their relationship in an interview in June 2023, as per the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette .",

The team [...]",
        "content": "Ta Ann’s 1QFY24 top line was flattish on similarly flattish average CPO selling price realised of around RM3,900 per MT as FFB production dropped and timber turnover declined. KUCHING (May 28): Ta Ann Holdings Bhd (Ta Ann) saw its 1QFY24 core net profit for its first quarter of financial year 2024 (1QFY24) coming in at RM35 million (excluding RM8.4 million fair value gain and RM0.2 million net disposal loss and impairment) which makes up 17 per cent of full-year consensus estimate. The team with Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd (Kenanga Research) considered the results within its forecast given the seasonally low 1Q, harvesting only 19 and 23 per cent of its annual fresh fruit bunch (FFB) and timber production, respectively. Year on year (y-o-y), its 1QFY24 top line was flattish on similarly flattish average CPO selling price realised of around RM3,900 per MT as FFB production dropped and timber turnover declined. However, its core net profit slipped nine per cent as improved plantations profits (on lower cost) were more than offset by weaker timber earnings. “Quarter on quarter (q-o-q), its 1QFY24 core net profit dipped 19 per cent as FFB and log harvest fell 35 and 17 per cent, respectively, offsetting the stronger CPO prices,” it said in its analysis. “Its timber earnings were weaker on softer demand while FFB production declined from a high base in 4Q, which is typically the second best quarter in terms of plantation harvest.” MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd (MIDF Research) reiterated Ta Ann’s timber segment sales being lower at RM59.8 million due to the weaker average selling prices (ASP) of plywood and log subsegment that eased by 18 and 20 per cent y-o-y respectively. The PBT-line softened significantly by 73.2 per cent y-o-y to RM4.5 million, with margins dropping to 7.6 per cent. “Notably, the logs and plywood ASP were weaker following its normal trend where it influenced the depreciation of Japanese yen on top of softer demand from the Japanese housing market during the period under review,” it said in a separate note. “Similarly, the oil palm sales were relatively flat at RM292.5 million. This was in tandem with consolidation of FFB and CPO sales volume which were down by 33.5 and 33 per cent q-o-q respectively, in pollination months.” Kenanga Research expects flattish CPO prices in CY24 as global edible oil inventory is expected to decline though staying manageable. Worldwide, edible oil supply is expected to struggle in keeping pace with trendline yearly growth of three to four per cent in edible oil demand in 2024 and possibly up to mid-2025. “As such, we are keeping our forecast average CPO prices of RM3,800 per MT for FY24-FY25 intact. However, the cost of producing CPO is expected to moderate. Fertiliser prices are now 30 per cent lower y-o-y while energy cost is 10 per cent weaker. “After declining since mid-CY22, palm kernel (PK) prices have started rising in April 2024 and as CPO mills sell PK as a byproduct, better PK prices translate to lower CPO cost. “Soft timber demand still likely. Home building and construction activities are expected to stay subdued in view of economic headwinds and higher borrowing costs. “Prices of hardwood logs have continued to slide but hardwood sawn timber prices are gradually inching up. However, overall hardwood timber demand is expected to remain muted for FY24-25 hence timber earnings are likely to remain soft.”",

        "content": "(This is CNBC Pro's live coverage of Tuesday's analyst calls and Wall Street chatter. Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) A major cruise line operator and a bank in the Midwest were among the stocks being talked about by analysts on Tuesday. Mizuho raised its rating on Norwegian Cruise Line to buy from neutral. Meanwhile, JPMorgan upgraded Huntington Bancshares to overweight from neutral, with a price target that implies upside of 31%. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 6:30 a.m.: Wells Fargo downgrades Zscaler Wells Fargo believes that mounting pressures and executive turnover could finally take their toll on Zscaler . The bank downgraded the cybersecurity stock to an equal weight rating from overweight. Analyst Andrew Nowinski cited mounting competitive pressures as a reason for the change. \"We believe competition is increasing, which could pressure billings growth over the next 12+ months,\" he wrote. On top of that, a slew of sales executive departures could disrupt sales and renewal cycles in the near term. \"While all employees are replaceable, the company is heading into a period of tough comparisons, which leaves little room for disruption from the departures, particularly as the company heads into the seasonally important fiscal yearend F4Q24 (Jul),\" Nowinski added. These two headwinds combined together could create near-term pressures for the stock by limiting Zscaler's billings growth, the analyst wrote. This would put the company below its peer group, which is consistently growing revenue, profitability and free cash flow. Shares of Zscaler have plunged nearly 23% this year. Nowinski's price target of $182, down from $275, implies the stock could rise 6% from here. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:28 a.m.: Citi upgrades DuPont DuPont looks poised to rise on the back of its big announcement to separate its businesses, according to Citi. Analyst Patrick Cunningham upgraded the chemicals stock to a buy from its previous neutral rating. He accompanied the move by lifting its price target to $95 from $85. Shares of DuPont have risen 5% this year. Cunningham's forecast implies that there could be nearly 15% further upside for the stock. Last week, the company announced plans to separate its business by spinning off its water and electronics verticals. Cunningham noted that the stock has already risen post the announcement, and that the business separation could provide even more catalysts for further upside this year. \"The separated Electronics business will be well positioned to benefit from long-term growth in semiconductors & electronics – all with the emerging driver of AI,\" he wrote. On the other hand, the analyst believes that DuPont's water business is poised for gains on the back of secular growth. \"Water has a strong portfolio of filtration components and membranes with ~70% of the business having a recurring revenue profile,\" he said. \"The business has key customer relationships across a variety of end-markets and positioned to focus on new technologies (hydrogen, DLE).\" — Lisa Kailai Han 5:50 a.m.: JMP upgrades Duolingo to outperform Duolingo's growth potential could give it a leg up against its peers, according to JMP. Analyst Andrew Boone upgraded shares of the e-learning platform to market outperform from market perform. The analyst also set a $260 price target, which corresponds to a 46% upside from here. Boone cited the rollout of Duolingo Max, a new subscription tier, as a major catalyst for the company, alongside the optimization of its existing services. \"After rolling out Max to 5%-10% of DAU in April, Duolingo plans to expand Max to more users in the coming months,\" he wrote. \"Additionally, Duolingo now has a dedicated team focused on improving Family Plan, which can be a meaningful driver of retention.\" The analyst added that Duolingo plans to release a \"conversational experience\" as another reason for users to upgrade to the Max tier. Boone added that the company could find itself a beneficiary of artificial intelligence in the e-learning space. \"With Duolingo's differentiated language teaching also fun and engaging (making people 'eat their broccoli' of taking their daily language lessons and likely the hardest thing for competitors to replicate), we think Duolingo likely benefits from AI enabling conversational experiences as it creates upsell opportunities and improves teaching efficacy,\" he wrote. Shares of Duolingo have slipped 21% this year. DUOL YTD mountain DUOL year to date — Lisa Kailai Han 5:40 a.m.: Mizuho upgrades Norwegian Cruise Line, cites inflection point for performance It's time for investors to take a chance on Norwegian Cruise Line , according to Mizuho. The bank upgraded shares of the cruise operator to buy from neutral and lifted its price target to $24 from $21. This updated forecast implies that shares of Norwegian could rise 50% from their closing price. With the stock down 20% this year, analyst Ben Chaiken thinks sentiment is finally shifting as valuations become more attractive. \"After ~2 years of significant relative underperformance (~ -160% vs RCL since Jan '23) NCLH is streamlining its business (e.g., cost cuts), which should drive upside to near-term/medium-term estimates,\" he wrote. The analyst also cited Norwegian's cost reductions as another catalyst for the change. The company has pledged to target $300 million in expense cuts by 2026, with $100 million reached this year. Norwegian has also made efforts to provide higher yields for its investors, Chaiken noted. \"In the context of a very favorable industry backdrop (i.e., limited industry supply, and healthy demand), we see upside to yields from NCLH optimizing its fleet itineraries (i.e., simplifying), with a longer-term yield tailwind from further build-out of its private island portfolio,\" he wrote. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:40 a.m.: JPMorgan upgrades Huntington Bancshares This year's strong gains in Huntington Bancshares are only the beginning, according to JPMorgan. Analyst Steven Alexopoulos upgraded the Columbus, Ohio-based bank to overweight from neutral. His price target of $18, up from $16, implies upside of 31% from Friday's close. Alexopoulos noted he became more upbeat on the stock after meeting with its CEO and chief financial officer. \"What we learned from our meetings ... is that (1) the onshoring benefits to the company's primary markets appears to not only be much more of a needle-mover than we expected, but the timing of these benefits is also coming sooner than expected and (2) with the company having followed a plan since the 2022 investor day to add new verticals as well as expand into new markets, the potential incremental organic growth from these initiatives is much more than we had anticipated,\" the analyst wrote. Huntington shares have climbed 8% year to date. They are also up 26% over the past six months. The stock rose more than 1% in the premarket following the upgrade.

        "description": "Globally, CML affects a significant number of people, with estimates ranging between 1.2 to 1.5 million individualsThe post Blood cancer cases may be rising among young adults in India, say experts appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) — a rare, yet treatable type of blood cancer — is significantly rising among young adults, aged 30 to 40 years, in India, warned doctors on Tuesday. CML affects the bone marrow and is characterised by the uncontrolled growth of white blood cells (WBC), specifically granulocytes, in the bone marrow. Globally, CML affects a significant number of people, with estimates ranging between 1.2 to 1.5 million individuals. Despite its prevalence, CML remains relatively rare compared to other forms of leukaemia, comprising nearly 15 per cent of all leukaemia cases. A recent study published in the journal Lancet showed that the condition is found in much younger persons, with the majority of patients being diagnosed between the age of 30 to 40 years, in India. In comparison, the average age of diagnosis in Western countries is 64 years. “In my practice, I see about 5-10 new patients being diagnosed with CML every month, with an additional 10-15 patients coming in for follow-up,” K.S. Nataraj, Senior Haematologist and Haemato-Oncologist, HCG Comprehensive Cancer Care Hospital, Bengaluru, told IANS. “This high number is largely because more people are nowadays diagnosed on time, as they regularly go for general check-ups and doctors advise testing, for example, when suspiciously high WBC counts are detected,” he added. CML is largely curable if diagnosed and treated in the early stages. The common symptoms of CML include night sweats, weight loss, fever, bone pain, and an enlarged spleen. “CML is indeed a treatable form of blood cancer. However, achieving treatment success requires a delicate balance. Consistent medication intake and regular checkups are important in this journey. With vigilant monitoring and personalised treatment strategies CML can be managed,” Tulika Seth, Professor Haematology, AIIMS, New Delhi, told IANS. “Living with CML is a journey that comes with unique challenges at each stage. Prioritising frequent monitoring, compliance with treatment aiming for optimal treatment goals, and embracing advancements in therapy is key,” she added.",

        "content": "Apple will reveal its latest AI features at WWDC 2024 on June 10. These updates might not be as eye-catching as those from Google, Microsoft, or OpenAI. According to Power On newsletter for Bloomberg, Apple will introduce ‘practical’ AI applications such as transcribing voice memos and auto-generating emojis. Apple is rumoured to announce a partnership with OpenAI, integrating ChatGPT more deeply into its systems. There are also ongoing negotiations with Google for similar integration with its Gemini AI, and talks with Anthropic are in progress. WWDC 2024 kicks off in exactly 2 weeks 🍎 iOS 18 and more are expected to be announced. — AppleTrack (@appltrack) A major new feature expected is the ‘smart recap,’ which will summarize missed texts, notifications, and various media like web pages, news articles, and documents. This aims to help manage iOS notifications better. Additionally, the Voice Memo app will likely get AI-generated transcription capabilities, extending existing features like voicemail transcripts and system-wide captions. These are the proposed new emoji that could eventually be added with iOS 18: - face with bags under eyes - fingerprint - leafless tree - root vegetable - harp - shovel - splatter — Apple Hub (@theapplehub) Apple plans to improve on-device Spotlight search, Safari Internet searches, and writing suggestions for emails and texts with AI. AI might also be used to retouch photos and generate emojis based on text, despite past issues other companies have faced with similar features. Siri is expected to get enhancements, including a more natural voice and better functionality on the Apple Watch. Apple aims to perform many AI tasks locally, but more complex operations will be handled on M2 Ultra-based servers. iOS 18 will feature a revamped Home Screen with the ability to recolor app icons and put them anywhere on the grid Users will also be able to create custom emoji using generative AI Source: — Apple Hub (@theapplehub) Beyond AI, Apple may introduce an iOS 18 feature allowing users to change app icon colours more easily, moving away from the current iOS Shortcuts app workaround. Another anticipated change is the ability to freely arrange app icons on the home screen, instead of the traditional top-to-bottom, left-to-right layout that has been in place since 2007.",

        "content": "Doly, the 3D video rendering app for iPhone that can easily create 3D product videos, was launched on Monday. Developed by the French startup AniML, the app offers on-cloud rendering of any product — from a water bottle to a fancy shoe — just by scanning it using the smartphone's camera. The free-to-download app allows anyone to generate high-quality 3D videos for products, removing the background and adding its own dynamic background to showcase them. In April, Tencent unveiled its InstantMesh AI model that could render 3D videos from 2D images. While apps and websites that can render a 3D image from 2D images already exist, generating 3D videos remains tricky. This is because canvassing objects with spatial points and then consistently showcasing them in a video is very difficult. One popular technique that has emerged in recent times is called Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). It uses artificial neural networks to “imagine” the sides of the object that could not be seen properly to create consistent results. However, according to a report by TechCrunch, AniML uses another 3D rendering technology dubbed Gaussian splatting, which is also a similar technique. Gadgets 360 tested out the app and we found the process to be somewhat lengthy, given it would take multiple attempts to scan the product correctly. Then, it takes about an hour to render the video. The rendered videos are vertically aligned. In our testing, the outcome was not too great. The object had visible polygons and the promised high-quality rendering was nowhere to be seen. However, it could be a lighting issue as we scanned the product indoors with artificial lighting. We have attached a screenshot of the result below. Product video rendering screenshot on Doly Based on its App Store page listing, Doly is targeted towards e-commerce store owners, small businesses, marketplaces, marketing professionals, and product designers. However, there is a price to download the videos. The first video download is complimentary, but any after that requires a Doly Plus subscription. It charges Rs. 2,999 a month or Rs. 24,900 a year which gives subscribers 40 product videos a month as well as exclusive video templates. Gadgets 360 tested out the iPhone app and found it quite user-friendly. The app guides you throughout the entire process of creating a 3D product video. The process is fairly easy.

        "description": "DICT says regulation is better over a complete ban.The post Bill that could ban TikTok and foreign adversary apps in PH filed appeared first on Technobaboy.",
        "content": "A bill that could ban applications controlled by foreign governments deemed adversaries has been filed in the Philippine House of Representatives. House Bill 10489, authored by Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr., proposes to prohibit the distribution, maintenance, and updates of such apps within the Philippines. The legislation empowers the President to designate a foreign country as an adversary based on threats to national security and territorial integrity. This designation would trigger a ban on apps controlled by companies in those countries. One major target of the bill appears to be , the popular social media app owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance. Abante expressed concerns that TikTok collects sensitive user data, potentially allowing the Chinese government to influence public opinion. The bill extends the ban to internet hosting services that support these foreign adversary-controlled applications as well. Abante cited China’s growing involvement in critical Philippine infrastructure, including a 40% stake in both the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) and Dito Telecommunity, as justification for the bill. Violators face significant penalties, with those distributing or maintaining the banned apps facing imprisonment of 6 to 12 years and hefty fines. Internet hosting services that support the apps could be penalized with imprisonment of 3 to 6 years and substantial fines. The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) weighed in on the proposed measure, saying it prefers regulation over a complete ban. DICT Undersecretary Jeffrey Ian Dy, during a public briefing, advocated for monitoring and regulating all social media platforms, including online shopping and messaging apps. In April, a forcing ByteDance to sell TikTok to an approved US firm or face a ban in the country. Unsurprisingly, TikTok pushed back and challenged the law in court. Source: ,",

        "content": "Lagos-based blogger, Stanley Okoruwa, has apologised to Nigerian businessman, Emeka Okonkwo, also known as E-Money , over the unfounded allegation of having a romantic affair with Jennifer Awele, the wife of the late Nollywood actor, Junior Pope. Naija News reported that Stanley, alongside s ome social media users and Instagram blogs , had alleged that E-money was partly responsible for the death of Junior Pope and having a relationship with his wife. In a statement via his Instagram page, E-money debunked the allegation, stating that it shows a complete lack of respect for the memory of the deceased and is deeply hurtful to the grieving family. E-money expressed commitment to identifying the individuals and ensuring they are held accountable for the allegations. Following this, the blogger was arrested by the Lagos State Police Command after E-Money filed a petition regarding the offensive video. In a turn of events, Okoruwa retracted his statements and expressed regret for his actions, admitting that his allegations were merely an attempt to gain popularity and more followers on his Facebook page. He said, “I made the video to grow my page, I did not have any bad intentions towards E-Money. “I did not know the video would go viral. I accept it is wrong for me to make such a video and I did not know it will escalate. “Everything in the video is not true, I just tried to make the video to get popular and get the opportunity to meet E-Money. “I’m very sorry, E-Money. I did not mean to tarnish his image. Everything in the video is false. I’m using this medium to seek E-Money’s forgiveness and I will not repeat the mistake again.” The spokesperson of the Lagos State Police Command, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, said the blogger will be prosecuted for allegedly defaming E-Money in his online video. He said E-Money followed due process by reporting to the police. He said, “He is going to be prosecuted because the things he engaged in were criminal in nature. He has allegedly defamed E-money and he is going to be prosecuted.”",

        "content": "Normal life was brought to its knees by a spell of heavy, incessant rain akin to a cloudburst accompanied by strong winds that lasted a couple of hours in Kochi in Ernakulam district of Kerala on May 28 morning. The episode left roads and houses in many pockets inundated, damaged three houses partially and left motorists stranded across Kochi city as traffic was brought to a grinding halt. Subsequently, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) scaled up the alert for Ernakulam district from ‘yellow’ to ‘red’ warning of extremely heavy rainfall in some areas. Influence of Cyclone Remal The automated weather station on the campus of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) at Kalamassery measured the rainfall at 98.4 mm during an hour from 9 a.m. on May 28. “Rainfall of 100 mm during an hour is qualified as cloudburst. The heavy spell of rain will continue on and off for the next couple of days under the influence of Cyclone Remal. The westerly wind has also strengthened, dragging increased vapour from the Arabian Sea towards the land,” said S. Abhilash, director, Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research, Cusat. Kalamassery municipality area received 150 mm rainfall during a three-hour period, while Palluruthy received 98 mm, Choondi 54 mm and Mattancherry 34.5 mm rainfall during the period. IT hub hit hard The IT hub at Infopark Kochi at Thrikkakara was one of the worst affected as the campus and roads leading to the park were fully flooded. Employees headed to the park in two-wheelers and four-wheelers had a tough time navigating almost knee-high waters. Waterlogging at M.G.

Vibhu Traffic from Kakkanad to Palarivattom along the Civil Line Road and the national highway stretch between Palarivattom and Vytilla and Palarivattom and Edappally proved a nightmare for motorists as they got stranded in these stretches for hours. The service roads of the highway were also choc-a-bloc even as the dug-up state of the highway at Edappally as part of ongoing national highway widening works did not help either. Traffic along the flooded Sahodaran Ayyappan Road was also affected. “It took us over two-and-a-hours for to reach Edappally from Kakkanad. What are they doing about these pathetic drains?” fumed a car passenger. Dinesh Neelakantan, who heads operations at a film school at Edappally, said he got stranded on the Palarivattom flyover for 40 minutes and later returned home as he was unable to reach office. A couple stranded along the highway on their way to Aster Medcity from Thripunithura was left after missing an appointment with the doctor. Padmaja S. Menon, councillor for the Ernakulam South division that has faced recurrent inundation, including at M.G. Road and the South railway station, said was planning to approach the Kerala High Court for the “mental anguish” being caused to the residents and shopkeepers. Teen drowns Eldhose, 18, of Kombanad village in Ernakulam rural was reported drowned after getting caught in the strong current in Paniyeli Thodu on May 27 evening. He had gone there for bathing with his friends. Though he was rescued and rushed to a hospital in Kothamangalam, he died around 7 p.m. The house of noted critic M. Leelavathy at Kalamassery was flooded in the rainfall, destroying a part of her valuable book collection. She has since moved in with her son. House of noted critic M. Leelavathy at Kalamassery in Kochi that was flooded following heavy rains on May 28.| Photo Credit:Special Arrangement Severe flooding was reported in majority of the areas in Kochi Corporation, with Kanayannur taluk being the worst affected, and Kalamassery municipality. A tree fell on a KSRTC bus that stopped at a bus stand at Thoppumpady. However, none was injured. Country vessel capsizes A small country vessel carrying five elderly fishermen capsized in the sea near Saudi in Rameshwaram village in West Kochi. The fishermen swam to safety. Though not seriously injured, they were admitted to Karuvelipady hospital. The front portion of a house, including a well, caved in at Kusumagiri in Kakkanad village. While none was injured, the occupants of the house were set to be relocated. Houses in Rameshwaram colony in the low-lying area of Nazreth division were inundated. Shaila Thadhevoose, councillor for the Chullickal division in West Kochi, said that 100-odd houses were inundated. “Not cleaning the kayal mouth facilitating smooth flow of water through Rameshwaram canal and Pandarachira thodu resulted in the flooding,” she said. A camp has been opened in Kakkanad for 20 members from nine families facing soil erosion at Keerelimala. Fire and Rescue Services personnel across Ernakulam district were kept busy with distress calls, chiefly about uprooted trees, kept pouring in at fire stations.

        "description": "The drinks aren't quite what they seem...",
        "content": "It’s no secret that Brits simply love to order some form of booze when heading off on their holibobs — doesn’t matter what time of the day it is, a cheeky beer, or glass of prosecco is being purchased. And those travelling with Ryanair can now take their in-flight beverage to the next level, by ordering a cocktail to enjoy during the journey. The budget airline recently launched a brand new ‘ready to drink’ cocktail menu on its flights, which features seven different drinks , with prices starting from £8 (€9.50). Some of the options on the menu include a Dublin Lemonade (Jameson Irish Whiskey, Sprite Zero and sparkling water), a Fruit Snack, (Bombay Sapphire Gin, Sprite Zero and Capri-sun), Rose Spritz (rose wine and Sprite Zero) and a Flying Iced Tea (Bombay Sapphire Gin, Absolut Vodka and Coca-Cola). Jade Kirwan, Ryanair’s head of communications, claimed these ‘delicious’ drinks were the perfect way to ‘kickstart your summer holiday’, adding: ‘Our new cocktail range offers a selection of seven ready to drink cocktails from Flying Iced Tea to French 75 to Rose Spritz and more.’ However, it seems the cocktails may not be quite as ‘ready to drink’ as the airline suggested. People have been left ‘howling’ over one man’s experience ordering the Dublin Lemonade. Marty Guilfoyle has gone viral after sharing what he was given by Ryanair staff during a recent flight after buying the cocktail. In a post on Instagram, he shared a look at what the drink was meant to look like, with an image showing a yellow drink in a glass, garnished with a slice of orange on top. But instead of being handed a pre-made cocktail like this, he was given all of the individual ingredients to make the drink for himself. He captioned the video, writing: ‘Come with me to make a cocktail on board a Ryanair flight. It’s the first time I’ve heard of a Dublin lemonade and tbh, it’s delish.’ In the clip, he added: ‘I thought it might be a pre-made can, I definitely didn’t think I’d have to make it myself.’ Thousands of people liked the video, with many sharing their thoughts in the comments and it’s fair to say people thought it was pretty hilarious. ‘Cocktail MAKING experience is what is was supposed to say hahahahahahaha,’ wrote @foxylaura10, while @djtrolley said: ‘Unreal they’ve no shame at all.’ @beccagillen thought it was ‘iconic’, saying: ‘No this is so iconic and of course we couldn’t expect anything less.’ And @bradheidii replied: ‘JESUS CHRIST I’M HOWLINGG.’ @mister_reginald pointed out: ‘Now serving cocktails onboard and it’s literally just whatever they already had on the plane for the last 20 years slapped together...’ I'm a drinks editor and this one tip will make red wine in summer taste so much better No, you haven't imagined it – your pint is definitely getting smaller ‘Alcohol nearly ruined me until my business partner Steven Bartlett said I needed help’ Expert chefs reveal their controversial methods to make the perfect bacon sarnie Others went as far as to call the DIY drinks ‘a sin’ and ‘brutal’, but some could see the positives to being served a drink this way, as they thought having to make the drink would help ‘pass time’ during the flight. Marty wasn’t the only one to experience this after ordering a cocktail, as @cassandra_mcg also shared a similar tale, posting: ‘I thought I was going to get a pre-mixed one and I was handed a bottle of gin, can of Sprite, and a Capri Sun.’ And @hanni_fa_ said: ‘Yes their Long Island [Flying Iced Tea] is a mini vodka and a mini gin and mini bacardi and a mini can of coke ... it was so wrong.’ Daily horoscope today: May 28, 2024 astrological predictions for your star sign Metro.co.uk has contacted Ryanair for comment.

        "description": "British tourists were left stunned as armed officers - donning full body armour - stormed Marbella's Ocean Club in Puerto Banus in a broad-daylight raid",
        "content": "This is the dramatic moment nearly 20 heavily-armed police storm a famous Costa del Sol beach club and ordered tourists out of the pool. British holidaymakers watched on speechless in their swim shorts and bikinis as armed officers wearing body armour crashed the Ocean Club in the Marbella resort of Puerto Banus in a broad-daylight raid under a glorious blue sky. Tourists packing out the ‘beautiful people’ venue, which over the weekend held one of its two annual champagne parties which are always popular with Bank Holiday visitors from the UK, were urged to keep calm. Police issued loudspeaker messages in Spanish and English saying: “This is just a routine check. The minute we finish you can continue enjoying your afternoon. Don’t worry, there’s nothing serious going on.” But the images of the operation, which lasted nearly two hours and also involved a police helicopter which hovered overhead after officers moved in, showed why some revellers were left uneasy about their holidays being interrupted in such a radical way. One clubber is understood to have been arrested, although police have not yet commented officially on the reason for the detention. Were you there? Contact us at webnews@mirror.co.uk Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' One clubber has been arrested, according to reports ( Image: SOLARPIX.COM) Spanish cops swoop in on suspects at the Ocean Club in Marbella ( Image: SOLARPIX.COM) The spectacular club raid followed a string of shootings in the area, sparking the launch of the so-called Marbella Plan last month to keep British and Irish tourists safe. Police warned locals and visitors at the time they could expect to see more random stops and police checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They said nothing about surprise raids on busy tourist-popular venues, although earlier this month heavily-armed officers crashed a gym at a sports club in the residential area of Nueva Andalucia near Puerto Banus and made three arrests. Gym users were asked for their ID before being allowed to continue with their routines. The series of shootings so far this year in the Marbella area have included a March 11 attack on British-run eatery La Sala near Puerto Banus that led to the arrests in April of a British man and Irish national described by police as having links to organised crime. Kerry Katona claimed recently she had U-turned on a decision to move to the famous Costa del Sol resort with her family including fiancé Ryan Mahoney because she no longer feels safe about the prospect following the violent incidents there. Fernando Bentabol, the prosecutor in charge of combatting narco crime in the province of Malaga which Marbella is part of, shone the spotlight on its dark underbelly in a recent newspaper interview by likening it to Medellin. Asked by a local Spanish journalist if the Costa del Sol was turning into Colombia ’s second-largest city, the most violent in the world in the 1990s before a clean-up and the former home of notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar he said: “Yes and no. It can’t be compared to Medellin because countries such as Colombia are the ones that produce drugs, and most of the actions there are related to plantations, as happens in Morocco for example with cannabis. We are in the area where the drugs are introduced and distributed to Europe. But in terms of the level of the organisations involved and their economic capacity, yes it can of course be compared.” Locals have branded parts of Marbella like Puerto Banus the ‘Wild West’. One suggested recently tourists should start thinking about putting on a bullet-proof vest with their swim shorts and sandals. Another wrote on social media, expressing her fears an innocent person could be killed: “A stray bullet could end up entering a house.” In the early hours of Saturday morning, a 33-year-old man was shot on a residential estate a short drive from Puerto Banus, just across the Marbella municipal border in the neighbouring municipality of Estepona. No arrests have yet been made. Around ten shell casings thought to have been fired from an AK-47 were reportedly found on the ground at the scene. British man Marcus Stewart mowed down several pedestrians in May 2017 after speeding away from the Ocean Club in an Audi following a fight between two groups of men from the UK. He was arrested by an armed cop on the beach after a police chase following a spectacular head-on crash on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile with a car carrying an 18-day-old baby. He was later jailed for more than five years. No charges were brought against a second Brit held in the drama, a passenger in the car. The Ocean Club describes itself on its website as the “original classic beach club in Marbella and a reference for style, modern luxury and an atmosphere that has made it famous as one of Europe’s chic favourites for relaxing, partying and enjoying the best that summer has to offer.” It adds: “Daytimes are easygoing, with a quality restaurant, while our themed parties are famous for being as glamorous as they are exciting and lively. Live music, dancers, entertainers and beautiful people make it an experience to remember.” It held its opening party this year on May 3 and its second champagne party on Sunday, a day after the weekend police raid. High-season bed packages around its saltwater pool cost up to EUROS 1,150 (POUNDS 980). The most expensive packages include three bottles of Veuve Clicquot. Revellers who book the most expensive VIP beds are warned online there is an additional EUROS 1120 (POUNDS 955) minimum spend on Saturdays.",

        "content": "Reggae singer Romain Virgo has announced a string of headlining shows across the Northeast U.S. in support of his latest album, The Gentle Man. The first concert is slated for June 6 at Toad’s Place in New Haven, Connecticut, followed by back-to-back shows at the Crown Hill Theater in Brooklyn on June 7 and 8. He will end the run on June 9 at The Ave Live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “It’s always a joy to share my music with a live audience, especially when they’re hearing certain songs for the first time. So I’m looking forward to creating more memorable experiences with this Gentle Man U.S. tour — something special for my fans, whether it’s their first or tenth Romain Virgo show,” said Romain Virgo. “The support I felt at my recent Record Store Day meet and greet in Queens, NY was overwhelming, and we’re definitely going to translate that energy back into these shows.” The can’t-miss performances will feature a seven-piece live band, including rising singers Janeel Mills and Tori Lattore. The hosts for the shows will be DJ Buck and Bojangles in New Haven, Platinum Kids at night one in Brooklyn, Rorystonelove at night two in Brooklyn, and DJ Young Genna and Solomonic Sound System in Philadelphia. The U.S. leg of The Gentle Man Tour follows a sold-out, three-show run in Jamaica where Romain Virgo was joined by surprise guests Protoje, Agent Sasco, Jesse Royal, and Christopher Martin. Later in the summer, the Jamaican artist and his band will bring The Gentle Man Tour to Europe, where they will appear at several festivals including Summerjam in Germany and South Facing Festival in England. His fourth studio album, The Gentle Man, arrived on March 1 via VP Records. It was announced with the Masicka-assisted single “Been There Before,” and includes the songs “Good Woman,” “Driver,” and “Switch You On.”",

        "description": "The company behind the proposals is also looking to develop a new Island port.",
        "content": "Plans for a new, all-electric Isle of Wight ferry service connecting Ryde and Portsmouth have been unveiled. Wight Gateway Limited (WGL), the company behind the proposals, is also looking to develop a new Island port on land owned by the firm, in Ryde. The news follows an announcement for a new service between Yarmouth and Lymington, as previously reported . There have also been similar plans announced by Anderson Boat Cruises, which runs the Coral Star. Read more: Isle of Wight ferry service could rival Wightlink and Red Funnel Isle of Wight ferry to compete with Wightlink between Yarmouth and Lymington In a statement to the County Press, Isle of Wight Council leader Cllr Phil Jordan said WGL's Ryde to Portsmouth route would have all-electric ferries, built locally on the Island, and powered by a dedicated Island solar farm. The ships will be designed to carry passengers, cars, and small vans but there will be no provisions for lorries or large coaches on this specific route, Cllr Jordan said. He said the company has agreed the terms on a ferry berth to be provided by Portsmouth International port (PIP), which is owned by Portsmouth City Council. Speaking about the announcement today, Cllr Phil Jordan said: “I am incredibly supportive of this fantastic new initiative which is bringing forward vital connectivity options for Islanders and visitors alike. \"This is a much-needed project that will help us as an Island community to reinvigorate businesses, tourism, connectivity, NHS and much more. Travel options to the mainland are a vital service that Islanders want, need, and deserve. \"A recently commissioned independent passenger survey on cross Solent ferry usage confirmed that there would be strong customer support for the introduction of the proposed new ferry services. \"I therefore welcome and support this additional cross Solent travel opportunity”. According to Companies House, WGL has three directors: John Clewley, John Fisher and Jeremy Wakefield. Cllr Jordan said the \"innovative ownership model\" of the Ryde port aims to involve local investors. WGL will be working with the council, the Island local MPs and central government to obtain National Significant Infrastructure Project designation and to secure a fast-track planning permission for the new Ryde terminal, he said.

        "content": "Israel's foreign minister accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” on Tuesday, after the country moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Ireland and Norway were set to follow suit the same day in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza , but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people , according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say. — Iran’s acting president addresses its new parliament . A watchdog says Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war . Here's the latest: COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city.

He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief.",

        "content": "The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza , but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people , according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say. — Iran’s acting president addresses its new parliament . A watchdog says Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war . Here's the latest: COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city.

(AP Photo/Leo Correa) Israel’s foreign minister accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” on Tuesday. Spain, Norway and Ireland moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations designed to add international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to last year’s Hamas-led attack. The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza , but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli strikes on Rafah overnight killed at least 16 Palestinians, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people , according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Israeli strikes kill 16 in Rafah , medics say, as residents report heavy fighting. — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah over the weekend was the result of a “tragic mishap.” — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say. Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war . Here’s the latest: ISRAELI STRIKES ON RAFAH KILL AT LEAST 16 PALESTINIANS, FIRST RESPONDERS SAY CAIRO — Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 Palestinians overnight, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city. An Israeli incursion launched earlier this month has caused nearly 1 million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas , and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas. The latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was a “tragic mishap” on Sunday and the military said it was investigating. The latest strikes killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent. NORWAY FORMALLY RECOGNIZES A PALESTINIAN STATE COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. SPAIN WILL BEGIN RECOGNIZING A PALESTINIAN STATE MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations.

IRANIAN PARLIAMENT REELECTS HARD-LINER QALIBAF AS ITS SPEAKER DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief.",

        "content": "Israel’s foreign minister accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” on Tuesday, after the country moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Ireland and Norway were set to follow suit the same day in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza , but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people , according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a “tragic mishap.” — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say. — Iran’s acting president addresses its new parliament . A watchdog says Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war . Here’s the latest: NORWAY FORMALLY RECOGNIZES A PALESTINIAN STATE COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. SPAIN WILL BEGIN RECOGNIZING A PALESTINIAN STATE MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. IRANIAN PARLIAMENT REELECTS HARD-LINER QALIBAF AS ITS SPEAKER DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief.",

        "content": "The S&P 500 could dip below the 5000 threshold if macroeconomic pressures, most notably high inflation, continue to persist, RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a Monday note. In their report, the investment bank stresses that the market’s current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio could decrease under prolonged inflationary pressures and a lack of anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. RBC's base model, which leverages consensus forecasts on economic variables, suggests that the S&P 500 should trade at around 21.5x earnings by the end of 2024, potentially placing the index at 5100 to 5300 if their earnings per share (EPS) forecast of $237 for 2024 is accurate. However, in a stress test scenario considering no Fed rate cuts, higher-than-expected inflation, and 10-year Treasury yields not rising above 5%, the P/E ratio could drop to 20.8x, pushing the S&P 500 down to a range of 4900-5100. In another stress test, where inflation exceeds 3% and the 10-year yield rises to 5.5%, the trailing P/E retreats to 19.1x “and points to about 4,500 for fair value for the S&P 500 on our EPS forecast and the 4,600-4,700 range using consensus EPS,” RBC strategists said in a note. Meanwhile, RBC also reflected on the latest performance of small caps versus large caps. Small caps, as measured by the Russell 2000 , have been retesting their relative lows compared to the S&P 500, the investment bank notes. Despite a brief rally driven by Fed rate cut optimism in early May, small caps have struggled, with only 62% of Russell 2000 companies beating consensus estimates in the recent reporting season, compared to 77% for the S&P 500.",

        "content": "tupungato/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Investment thesis Intel Corporation, ( NASDAQ: INTC ), founded in 1968, has been the most important company in the semiconductor industry, in the US and globally, for decades. However, over the past few years, Intel has lost its leadership position and is significantly lagging behind its competition in terms of technology. Production delays disrupted Intel's product roadmap, while rivals gained an advantage by bringing cutting-edge technology to market. Intel's integrated model, the company's competitive advantage for decades, became its vulnerability as the company drastically lacked the resources to maintain the pace of developing new technology. However, we now see several potential drivers for Intel to improve its position, which will drive the company's financial results over the next 2-3 years. The expected positive trends in PC shipments and global capital expenditures in the data center segment will drive up the company's revenue because ~80% of Intel's sales come from the PC and server segments. If Intel's 18A chip (scheduled to go into production in the second half of 2024) gains market appreciation and if the company can ramp up mass production before the release of the 2 nm chip by TSMC (mid-2025), then Intel could boost its share of the chip manufacturing market. If Intel acquires a reputation as a reliable supplier in the future, the company has a high chance of sustained growth in revenue from external customers in the Intel Foundry segment and an upward revaluation of the stock by the market. We have not previously covered Intel Corporation, so in this review, we will take a closer look at the company's business structure. The status of the stock is BUY. The price target is $49. Intel's losing strategy Over the past few years, Intel has lost its leadership position and is significantly lagging behind its competition in terms of technology, including the current leader of the semiconductor industry, TSMC. To understand exactly how this happened, let's look at several types of business models and the history of how different types of semiconductor companies interact with each other: 1. IDMs (integrated device manufacturers) are vertically integrated manufacturers. One prominent example is Intel. IDMs are engaged in both designing and manufacturing chips. The key advantage of this model is the high degree of control over the entire chip manufacturing process from idea to finished product and over its sale. However, IDMs require high capital expenditures and have a harder time adapting to market downturns. 2. Fabless companies don't have fabrication plants. One prominent example is NVIDIA. Fabless companies are focused on designing chips and outsource manufacturing to foundry companies. The advantage of fabless companies is that they don't need to make capital expenditures to build production facilities, make regular outlays to maintain and upgrade them, and have the option to choose between factories to assemble their products. Due to the absence of high costs associated with factories, fabless companies can funnel more funds into R&D processes. The key disadvantage of such companies is their dependence on chip manufacturers and less control over their production compared with IDMs. 3. Foundries are contract manufacturers. One prominent example is TSMC. Such companies are exclusively engaged in the production of chips to customer design. The success of foundry businesses depends significantly on the success of their customers. Optimization of the production process and the possibility of high-capacity utilization allow foundry companies to increase their profitability. At the beginning of the semiconductor era in the 1970s, all leading manufacturers tested and produced their chips themselves. Later, in the 1980s, smaller manufacturers that did not have the necessary resources to produce chips on their own appeared on the market - and to their aid came IDMs with idle capacity. However, it quickly became clear that this type of cooperation benefitted IDM more than it did small manufacturers because the manufacturing company could put its own interests above the interests of other companies. This changed in 1987 when TSMC opened the first factory to produce exclusively for fabless customers. The model of interaction between fabless companies and fabs allowed the former to outsource production and focus exclusively on chip development without worrying whether the partner company's factory will meet its production plan, and allowed the latter to gain access to advanced manufacturing technologies and increase foundry capacity utilization. At first, TSMC was technologically lagging behind IDMs, but within 10 years it managed to catch up with them by offering more favorable cooperation terms to chip developers, which set off a transition of customers from IDMs to TSMC. Since then, for more than 25 years, the remaining IDMs were, sooner or later, forced to abandon some or all of their own production plants due to higher production costs compared with foundry companies, and a significant lag in technology. During this time, TSMC, the world's largest foundry company, set improvements in manufacturing efficiency as its sole priority and made significant progress: TSMC now has >60% share of the global semiconductor foundry market. Meanwhile, Intel continued to be an IDM, forcing it to divide its resources between chip design and manufacturing, which ultimately led to problems in both areas. Intel's technology fell behind As we mentioned earlier, at a certain point in time, IDMs started to lag behind foundry companies technologically. Intel was not an exception: at this time the best TSMC chips use the 3 nanometer process, while Intel is still mass-producing only 7 nm chips. Previously, Intel engineers and managers were proud of the pace of their manufacturing, which evolved in line with Moore's Law (as a reminder, Gordon Moore, one of Intel founders, made the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years), meaning that about every two years Intel released a chip on a new technological process. However, in 2015, it became clear that Intel's 10nm process was being delayed and that the company would continue to ship its advanced 14nm processors for longer than the usual two years. It wasn't until 2018 that Intel moved to 10nm chip production in small volumes. Production delays disrupted Intel's product roadmap, and rivals, such as AMD, gained an edge by bringing to market technology that was more advanced. When Intel was moving to the next process, 7nm, it faced even worse delays. In addition to falling behind its own plans, Intel was not transparent enough about these failures. It wasn't until 2020, after five long years of talking about \"temporary\" delays, that Intel acknowledged the problem by publishing a note in its 2Q 2020 financial results report, much to the chagrin of investors. Why Intel fell behind Problems integrating extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology into the manufacturing process were one reason for the failure to move to smaller nodes. Some other companies, such as TSMC, adopted the EUV technology earlier, allowing them to achieve smaller technological nodes (7nm and 5nm) sooner than Intel. This technological lag put Intel at a disadvantage, affecting its ability to compete effectively in terms of chip performance and productivity. Another reason why the engineering process at Intel was slower than at TSMC was a directly opposite corporate culture : Intel's rather self-contained approach prevented an inflow of ideas and views from external sources, while TSMC's more open and collaborative culture, on the contrary, allowed it to establish partnerships with research institutes and startups, which facilitated an exchange of ideas and ultimately stimulated innovation. To summarize this brief overview of how the company evolved and developed, it is worth noting that Intel has been one of the most important companies in the US and global semiconductor industry for decades. Thanks to the foresight of founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, the company's focus on R&D investment right from its inception has allowed it to lead the semiconductor industry for many years by innovating, setting one industry standard after another, and discovering ways to reduce the cost of semiconductor production. Over time, Intel's integrated model, which was the company's competitive advantage for decades, became its vulnerability as the company drastically lacked the resources to maintain its leadership position and began to get lost amid the successful collaboration of fabless and foundry companies. However, we now see several potential drivers for Intel to improve its position, which will drive its financial performance over the next 2-3 years. Further down in the report, we will look at the company's revenue segmentation and lay out our forecasts for key segments. Intel's revenue structure Effective from 1Q 2024, the company modified its segment reporting, with revenue now coming from the following business units: 1. Intel Products Client Computing Group (CCG) Data Center and AI (DCAI) Network and Edge (NEX) 2. Intel Foundry Intel Foundry Services (IFS) 3. All other Altera Mobileye Other Let's take a closer look at what, we believe, are the company's key segments, namely Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center and AI (DCAI) and Intel Foundry. Intel's revenue structure: CCG Client Computing Group (CCG) - this segment generates about half of the company's revenue. It supplies central processing units for desktop PCs and notebooks, so CCG's revenue dynamics significantly depends on global supplies. According to aggregate forecasts by Canalys and IDC , a long-awaited recovery in global PC shipments is expected in 2024 and 2025, to be followed by a decline in 2026 and near-zero growth in 2027. Invest Heroes We see the adoption of AI-capable PCs (higher performance PCs that are capable of processing and performing AI tasks and machine learning tasks) as a revenue driver for the CCG segment. AI PCs are slightly more expensive than conventional models (within 5%-10%), as they incorporate more expensive components. According to Canalys , the proportion of AI PC shipments in total PC shipments will almost double in 2024 from the 2023 level, reaching 19%. The year 2025 will see the largest increase in AI PC shipments, with their proportion jumping to 37% of total shipments. Canalys Based on the above projections, we expect CCG segment revenue to be $32.4 bln (+11% y/y) in 2024 and $39.3 bln (+21% y/y) in 2025. Invest Heroes Intel's revenue structure: DCAI Data Center and AI (DCAI) - The key products in this segment are CPUs, GPUs and Gaudi AI accelerators. This segment has accounted for just under 30% of the company's total revenue in recent years. Therefore, if combined with the CCG segment, ~80% of Intel's sales come from the PC and server segments. Consequently, the company's revenue reacts most strongly to trends in PC shipments and capital expenditures on data centers. Previously, the DCAI segment included the operations of Altera , a company acquired by Intel in 2015 that manufactures FPGAs, but as of 1Q 2024, Altera has been made in a separate segment. The earnings report with the new segment reporting provided historical data for Altera's annual revenue from 2021-2023 and quarterly revenue for 1Q 2024, but we don't believe the data is sufficient to make a reasonable forecast for Altera (by which we mean a quarterly forecast due to the lack of information on the presence of seasonality in this segment), so we will continue to include Altera's revenue in our revenue forecasting model for the DCAI segment as it was previously presented in Intel's reported results. As for Gaudi, the release of updated versions of this chip could serve as a key driver of the segment's revenue growth. Intel started developing AI chips for servers after acquiring Habana Labs in 2018, whose technology provided the basis of the Gaudi chip. The chip is manufactured based on a 5nm process at TSMC's foundry. Gaudi 3 is a far cry from NVIDIA's latest designs in terms of performance, but it is a cost-effective alternative to expensive GPUs, especially at a time when NVIDIA's chips are simply not enough for everyone. According to Intel management, Gaudi 3, unveiled in early April 2024, outperforms NVIDIA's H100 by 50% in AI tasks, is 40% more energy efficient, and will be much cheaper than the H100. Until independent test results are released, these figures should be treated with caution, as they are based on Intel's own internal benchmarks. In late March 2024, Intel joined a consortium of technology companies that was formed to challenge NVIDIA CUDA's dominance of AI software. The creation of alternative software that enables work of AI accelerators regardless of their manufacturer will provide opportunities to increase sales of such chips as Gaudi 3. Intel expects it to generate $500 mln in revenue in 2024. Based on the estimates for global capital expenditures on data centers and the potential for the growth in sales of Intel DCAI products, we expect revenue in the DCAI segment to total $14.8 bln (+17% y/y) in 2024, and $15.8 bln (+6% y/y) in 2025. Intel's revenue structure: Intel Foundry Intel Foundry - the segment that includes chip manufacturing for Intel's own needs as well as for external customers. Intel entered the market of contract manufacturing of semiconductors in 2021 as Intel Foundry Service (IFS) to capitalize on the growing demand for foundry capacity. To provide transparency in the segment's operations, the company in its reporting separates revenue generated from external customers and revenue from inter-segment sales within Intel. As of the end of 2023, revenue from external customers totaled $953 mln (+96% y/y), or 5% of total IFS revenue of $18.9 bln (-31% y/y). Even though IFS revenue from external customers is relatively small, Intel has ambitious plans to expand the plants by investing its own funds and with the help of government subsidies (Under the CHIPS Act the US government has given Intel $8.5 bln in grants and the option to draw $11 bln in federal loans). Bloomberg Intel currently has 15 wafer fabs, which are mostly used to produce its own chips, but the corporation intends to bolster its foundry capacity manyfold in the next few years, which will empower it to take more orders from external customers, and raise the prospect of contract manufacturing for such companies as NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and others in the future. US fabless companies would benefit from having a domestic chipmaker such as Intel in order to reduce dependence on Taiwan-based TSMC, as the partnership with that company may sooner or later fall prey to geopolitical risks. In order to close the technology gap with the competition and draw external customers to IFS, the company has set itself a goal of \"five nodes in four years\" in an updated roadmap. At this point, Intel is known to have completed the development of the Intel 18A (1.8nm) and Intel 20A (2nm). Production of the 20A is set to start in 1H 2024, 18A in 2H 2024. In February 2024, the company announced the Intel 14A (1.4nm), which will go into production in 2026, and the Intel 10A (1nm), with its production to start near the end of 2027. Intel To put this in perspective, Intel's main competitor in the foundry business, TSMC, plans to start its 2nm chips production in mid-2025, and start production of 1.4nm chips in 2027. Therefore, provided that: the Intel 18A chip (to go into production in 2H 2024) gains recognition on the market, the company manages to ramp up production before the release of TSMC's 2nm chip (mid-2025), ...Intel will be able to boost its share of the chipmaking market. If it then succeeds in establishing a reputation as a reliable supplier, the company has a high chance of sustained growth in revenue from external customers in this segment and an upward revision of its share prices by the market. Even though not too many companies have officially announced cooperation with Intel Foundry (one of the few is Microsoft ), Intel's management asserts it already concluded contracts valued at $15 bln with external companies. In the base-case scenario, if production of the Intel 18A becomes a success, we expect Intel Foundry's revenue from external customers will total $1 bln (+8% y/y) in 2024, and surge to $1.8 bln (+74% y/y) in 2025. With respect to the company's other segments, we don't see them as holding much promise and expect them to deliver moderate growth. Invest Heroes Financial results Therefore, we expect the company's revenue to total $56 bln (+3% y/y) in 2024, and jump to $65.3 bln (+17% y/y) in 2025, which will be largely driven by rising revenue in the Intel Products segment, as PC shipments will bounce back in 2024 and 2025, and also by rising revenue in the DCAI segment. Invest Heroes The company's adjusted EBITDA is set to total $13.8 bln (+7% y/y) in 2024, and rocket to $20.3 bln (+47% y/y). We expect operating margin to average (1)% (+0 pp y/y) in 2024, and 8% (+9 pp y/y) in 2025. Starting from 2022, the company's R&D expenses has risen sharply. Their ratio to revenue was 28% (+9 pp y/y) in 2022, and 30% (+2 pp y/y) in 2023. In 1Q 2024 the metric reached 34%. We expect R&D expenses to normalize steadily. We estimate their ratio to revenue to total 30% (+0 pp y/y) in 2024, and 24% (-6 pp y/y) in 2025, which explains the projection for a strong growth of operating margin in 2025. Invest Heroes Intel's shareholders Most of the company's shares are owned by institutional investors, so we rule out the risk of a corporate conflict. The proportion of individuals/insiders makes up less than 0.1%. Seeking Alpha The table below shows the largest institutional investors and their ownership of the company's shares. Nasdaq Valuation We are evaluating the company by its projected results in 2027 using the EV/EBITDA multiples method. The price of $49 was achieved by computing 2027 financial results and discounting them at the rate of 13% per annum. Invest Heroes Conclusion At current prices, Intel Corporation stock holds appeal for long-term investors as the expected positive trends in PC shipments (from 2024-2025) and in global capital expenditures in the data center segment will drive up the company's revenue because ~80% of Intel's sales come from the PC and server segments. In addition, if the contract manufacturing of Intel 18A chip becomes a success and a reputation of a reliable supplier is established in the future, the company has a high chance of sustained growth in revenue from external customers in the Intel Foundry segment and an upward revaluation of the stock by the market. We believe the company is trading well below fair value. The rating is BUY.

        "content": "UBS provided an analysis of the Swedish krona's performance, indicating a weakened stance against the euro since May, with the EUR/SEK pair returning to levels seen a year prior, despite the Riksbank's efforts to bolster the currency last September. The bank forecasts that the EUR/SEK may climb in the near term due to uncertainties surrounding the easing cycle but anticipates a medium-term decline as risk appetite grows and high-beta currencies become more attractive. In terms of investment prospects, UBS expects that disinflation and rate cuts should lend some support to the Swedish krona, although volatility in Nordic currencies is generally higher than in other regions. This presents an opportunity for EUR investors to sell EUR/SEK upside risks from 11.80 for a yield pickup. UBS cautions that the EUR/SEK could test levels close to 12.0 in the near term if the Riksbank appears more dovish compared to its peers. Conversely, if the Fed signals more imminent rate cuts, the SEK could appreciate rapidly, potentially bringing the EUR/SEK down to 11.0. The bank also highlights that a sudden shift towards risk-off sentiment due to a deterioration in the global growth outlook could push EURSEK closer to 12.0, while strong global growth could drive it to 11.0. The upcoming easing cycles from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are expected to enhance risk appetite, potentially benefiting the krona. UBS suggests that as the appeal of carry in safer, more liquid assets diminishes, the krona is likely to gain strength against the euro. The anticipation of the ECB's rate cuts starting in June, coupled with the expectation of the Fed's initial rate reduction, has kept risk markets on alert. Improvements in global growth and positive developments in the Eurozone are predicted to create a conducive environment for the Swedish currency. Sweden, which has been experiencing a recession for the past 18 months, is showing signs of economic recovery, but these have not yet manifested in hard data. The Riksbank, having already initiated its easing cycle on May 8, is expected to make two additional rate cuts in 2024, offering some relief to the highly levered Swedish economy. However, UBS notes that the timing of these rate cuts is uncertain, with factors such as the US elections, subdued global growth, and geopolitical tensions posing potential risks that could adversely affect the krona and challenge the forecast of a lower EUR/SEK .

        "description": "Pensioners across the UK could get cash boost under new plan",
        "content": "Pensioners have been promised a £275 tax boost in the coming years by the Prime Minister in a pre-election pledge. Rishi Sunak said his Government would increase the income tax personal allowance for pensioners if the Conservatives remain in power. Labour dismissed the idea as a “desperate move” from a party which was “torching” what was left of its claims to economic credibility. The tax cuts would be worth around £95 in 2025-26, rising to £275 in 2029-30. The Prime Minister unveiled his landmark pensions policy as he sought to get his campaign back on track after a shaky start. Mr Sunak’s new tax policy would see the age-related allowance rise in line with the increase to the state pension under a “triple lock plus” guarantee. That would mean that both the state pension and the allowance – the amount that can be earned before being liable to income tax – rising by whatever is highest out of inflation, average wages or 2.5%.

This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said about half the cost of the plan was from not imposing three more years of frozen personal allowances on pensioners. \"So the £100 ‘saving’ next year is mostly just avoiding a £100 tax increase, rather than an actual giveaway,” he said. Shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said: ”Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” Mr Sunak is hoping the tax announcement will help switch focus from a difficult start to the election campaign. On Monday, outgoing Telford Tory MP Lucy Allan was first suspended then resigned after backing the Reform UK candidate to succeed her. Mr Sunak also suffered criticism over his national service plan, with Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker saying it was “sprung” on candidates, including those with relevant ministerial responsibilities. And Tory peer and former minister Lord Goldsmith said Mr Sunak “has damaged the Party almost beyond repair and all but guaranteed the majority of his MPs will lose their job next month”.",

        "description": "Sydney property prices are at record highs and rental vacancies at historic lows, but new homes are struggling to get off the ground.",
        "content": "The construction of thousands of new Sydney homes has stalled amid the city’s deepening rental crunch as soaring building costs and decade-high interest rates disrupt the delivery of residential projects. Despite strong population growth and persistent claims the state is in the grip of a housing supply crisis, the number of new dwellings approved but not commenced in NSW climbed from 13,765 in the March quarter of 2023 to 15,593 by the December quarter, a report by KPMG shows. More than 11,170 dwellings in Sydney were “approved but not yet commenced” at the end of December, which was 8 per cent higher than the five-year December average. About 80 per cent of the shelved projects were townhouses and apartments. There is normally a lag between when housing is approved and construction begins. However, the report reveals an “abnormal number of dwellings sitting in this category” as the rising costs of building materials, labour shortages and higher interest rates hindered commencements, especially of higher-density projects. Figures released by the Reserve Bank this month showed new dwelling prices have risen by nearly 40 per cent since late 2019. KPMG urban economist Terry Rawnsley said many “zombie projects” appear to have been shelved for an extended period in Sydney. “Some developers are looking at the sums and going ‘Well, actually, I can’t make this stack up in the current market conditions’, so that approval may never come to fruition,” he said. Development approvals in NSW are typically valid for five years until they lapse. Planning Minister Paul Scully said the NSW government is “increasing the capacity of the planning system” to support more approvals and addressing barriers external to the planning system that are slowing residential construction. “We are looking at the financial system, upskilling and training the workforce, examining modular methods of construction and investing in public sector developers like Landcom so that they can support the construction of more homes,” he said. North Sydney Mayor Zöe Baker. Credit: Janie Barrett North Sydney Mayor Zöe Baker called on the NSW government to offer residential builders a financial guarantee to ensure approved projects can be completed promptly. A condition of this support could be the construction of additional social housing in projects that receive the government guarantee, she said. Conditions for residential construction in Sydney have been “particularly challenging” since the middle of last year, Rawnsley said. During that period, the number of homes approved but not commenced hardly shifted, even though new approvals have declined. “With the pool of newly approved dwellings falling, one might expect the pool of not yet commenced dwellings to be falling too, but it remained steady,” Rawnsley said. Domain figures show asking rents in capital cities jumped 10.5 per cent in the year to March, amid super-low vacancy rates. The median asking rent for a unit in Sydney reached $700. Housing Industry Association chief economist Tim Reardon warned rent hikes of that magnitude are set to continue given the inadequate pipeline of new housing. “Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are in danger of double-digit rental price growth over the next three years unless they can find a way of significantly increasing the volume of apartments,” he said. The challenges in the residential construction sector are not confined to big cities – in regional NSW the number of dwellings approved but not commenced has been trending higher for the past five years and reached 4423 in December. Despite the glut of stalled housing approvals, Rawnsley said there are signs the backlog may soon begin to ease. “With housing prices now rising, strong population growth, and construction costs starting to stabilise, developers could be gaining more confidence to start housing projects,” he said.

        "content": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Tuesday morning that his government will approve a measure to formally recognize Palestinian statehood later in the day. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal — to contribute to achieving peace between Israelis and Palestine,” he said in a speech in Madrid. Sanchez noted that Spain will recognize the Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, only recognizing changes that have been agreed upon by both parties. “Although it’s not up to Spain to define the borders of other nations, our position is aligned with the resolutions of the UN Security Council, ... and with the position traditionally held by the European Union,” he said. Sanchez explained that the Palestinian state should be “viable” with the West Bank and Gaza connected with a corridor and East Jerusalem as its capital. Spain will also recognize a unified Palestinian state governed by the Palestinian Authority, which Sanchez called \"our partner for peace.\" The move to recognize Palestine is not against Israel, but “shows our direct rejection of Hamas — which is against the two-state solution,” he stressed. On Tuesday, Norway and Ireland are also set to formally recognize the Palestinian statehood as well. “Today’s decision is based on international law and respect for the rules-based order — principles that guide us no matter what the context,” said Sanchez. The Spanish leader added that from tomorrow, his focus will be on pushing for a viable two-state solution to bring lasting peace to the region. To achieve a lasting two-state solution, Sanchez said the top priority is \"putting an end to the crisis in Gaza,\" which includes achieving a permanent cease-fire, unhindered access to humanitarian aid to Gaza, and the release of all Israeli hostages. Spain will also channel its energy into supporting the reforms of the Palestinian Authority. \"It will need all our support,\" said Sanchez. Finally, he said Spain will \"continue to foster cooperation with partners committed to peace and prosperity in the region\" to convene an international peace conference that will \"implement\" the two-state solution. \"With today's decision, we assume our responsibility in the search for peace, security, and prosperity of all people,\" he added.",

        "description": "\"I know I could have worded this better, or just not tweeted at all,\" part of Jason Kelce's post on social media reads.",
        "content": "Jason Kelce has doubled down on comments he made after a social media user labeled him \"hypocritical\" for his opinion on Harrison Butker's controversial commencement speech. On May 11, Butker delivered a speech at Benedictine College that was full of socially conservative rhetoric. The Kansas City Chiefs kicker said a woman's most important title is \"homemaker,\" and referred to Pride Month as an example of \"deadly sins.\" The remarks were met with a strong backlash and the made a statement declaring Butker's \"views are not those of the NFL as an organization.\" While Jason Kelce defended some of Butker's comments during the May 24 episode of the podcast, he insisted some parts of his speech \"are not things that I align myself with.\" Days after the episode aired, the retired NFL star then came to wife Kylie Kelce's defense after an X user (formerly ) called her a \"homemaker whose home is a mess.\" Jason Kelce then posted a follow-up message to X to explain his point further. \"I was trying to point out to the original poster that they can't be compared, and her point was wrong. It's that simple. I said they shouldn't be compared,\" the father of three , after an X user accused him of \"telling oppressed people not to be offended.\" \"'That being said', is me saying oh, and your entire point you're trying to make is wrong too, because I wouldn't be offended if someone didn't like football. I know I could have worded this better, or just not tweeted at all, but I thought the start of the tweet, and context of the original poster made the intent clear.\" emailed Jason Kelce via the email address for comment on Tuesday. The X user who posted about Kylie Kelce said: \"But you can't support butker. And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. Sorry but it is dirty and messy on television. Seems you're a bit hypocritical. Y'all are going to be left with nothing but swifties. You just ruined your gig. It's a shame.\" I was trying to point out to the original poster that they can't be compared, and her point was wrong. It's that simple. I said they shouldn't be compared. \"That being said\", is me saying oh, and your entire point you're trying to make is wrong too, because I wouldn't be... In his first statement online, Jason Kelce wrote: \"I don't think of Kylie as a homemaker, I think of her as my wife. I think of her as a mother. She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily. \"The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first. We both raise our kids, we both work, We both keep our home. It is both our faults it is messy, but such is life with 3 young children, busy schedules, and neither of us being neat freaks. She also makes a mean sandwhich [sic].\" He also explained that he doesn't \"downplay\" the role of a homemaker, adding: \"If being a homemaker, works for some, and that's what they want, then hell yea, that's awesome, more power to you ... but that is not our family dynamic.\" During the May 24 episode of the podcast, both Jason Kelce and his brother, Chiefs tight end , . Jason Kelce explained that Kylie Kelce was \"a little bit frustrated with some of the comments,\" and that \"if my daughters listen to anybody tell them what to do, that they should be homemakers, then I've failed as a dad.\" Travis Kelce—who has been Butker's teammate since 2017—said he does not agree with \"the majority\" of what the kicker said. \"When it comes down to [Butker's] views and what he said at [Benedictine's] commencement speech, those are his. I can't say I agree with the majority of it or just about any of it outside of just him loving his family and his kids. And I don't think that I should judge him by his views, especially his religious views, of how to go about life, that's just not who I am,\" he explained. surrounding his recent speech for the first time on Friday evening at a Courage Under Fire gala in Nashville, Tennessee. \"If it wasn't clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now,\" he said. \"Over the past few days, my beliefs, or what people think I believe, have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe.\" Butker said that he has become \"more polarizing.\" \"It's a decision I've consciously made, and one I do not regret at all,\" he said.

        "description": "Palestinians struggle in tents as Israel attacks Rafah: ‘We have nothing'",
        "content": "Listen to Story ïû¿The tent camps stretch for more than 16 kilometers (10 miles) along Gaza’s coast, filling the beach and sprawling into empty lots, fields and town streets. Families dig trenches to use as toilets. Fathers search for food and water, while children scavenge in garbage and wrecked buildings for scraps of wood or cardboard for their mothers to burn for cooking. Over the past three weeks, Israel’s offensive in Rafah has sent nearly a million Palestinians fleeing the southern Gaza city and scattering across a wide area. Most have already been displaced multiple times during Israel’s nearly 8-month-old war in Gaza, which is aimed at destroying Hamas but has devastated the territory and caused what the United Nations says is a near-famine. The situation has been worsened by a dramatic plunge in the amount of food, fuel and other supplies reaching the U.N. and other aid groups to distribute to the population. Palestinians have largely been on their own to resettle their families and find the basics for survival. “The situation is tragic. You have 20 people in the tent, with no clean water, no electricity. We have nothing,” said Mohammad Abu Radwan, a schoolteacher in a tent with his wife, six children, and other extended family.“I can’t explain what it feels like living through constant displacement, losing your loved ones,” he said. “All of this destroys us mentally.”Abu Radwan fled Rafah soon after the Israeli assault on the city began on May 6 as bombardment neared the house where he was sheltering. He and three other families paid $1,000 for donkey carts to take them to the outskirts of Khan Younis, about 6 kilometers (3.6 miles) away, where it took a day living outside before they could assemble the materials for a makeshift tent. Next to the tent, they dug a toilet trench, hanging blankets and old clothes around it for privacy. Families usually have to buy the wood and tarps for their tents, which can run up to $500, not counting ropes, nails and the cost of transporting the material, the humanitarian group Mercy Corps said.Israeli authorities controlling all entry points into Gaza have been letting greater numbers of private commercial trucks into the territory, the U.N. and aid worker say. More fruits and vegetables are found in markets now, and prices on some have fallen, Palestinians say. Still, most homeless Palestinians can’t afford them. Many in Gaza have not received salaries for months and their savings are depleting. Even those who have money in the bank often can’t withdraw it because there is so little physical cash in the territory. Many turn to black market exchanges that charge up to 20% to give cash for transfers from bank accounts. Meanwhile, humanitarian convoys with supplies for the U.N. and other aid groups to distribute for free have fallen to nearly their lowest levels in the war, the U.N. says.Previously, the U.N. was receiving several hundred trucks a day. That rate has dropped to an average of 53 trucks a day since May 6, according to the latest figures from the U.N. humanitarian office OCHA on Friday. Some 600 trucks a day are needed to stave off starvation, according to USAID. In the past three weeks, most of the incoming aid has entered through two crossings from Israel in northern Gaza and via a US-built floating pier taking deliveries by sea. The two main crossings in the south, Rafah from Egypt and Kerem Shalom from Israel, are either not operating or are largely inaccessible for the U.N. because of fighting nearby. Israel says it has been letting hundreds of trucks through Kerem Shalom, but the U.N. has only been able to collect about 170 of them on the Gaza side over the past three weeks because it can't reach the crossing. Entry of fuel has fallen to about a third of what it was before the Rafah offensive, according to OCHA. That reduced amount has to be stretched between keeping hospitals, bakeries, water pumps and aid trucks working. The American humanitarian group Anera “is having difficulty distributing what we are able to bring in to the people who need it because there’s so little fuel for trucks,” its spokesperson Steve Fake said.Most of those fleeing Rafah have poured into a humanitarian zone declared by Israel that is centered on Muwasi, a largely barren strip of coastal land. The zone was expanded north and west to reach the edges of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah, both of which have also filled with people. “As we can see, there is nothing ‘humanitarian’ about these areas,” said Suze van Meegen, head of operations in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which has staff operating in Muwasi.Much of the humanitarian zone has no charity kitchens or food market, no hospitals operating, only a few field hospitals and even smaller medical tents that can’t handle emergencies, only pass out painkillers and antibiotics if they have them, according to testimony from Mercy Corps. “It’s just a matter of time before people begin to suffer greatly from food insecurity,” the group said. The Muwasi area is mostly coastal dunes with no water resources or sewage systems. With human waste deposited near the tents and garbage piling up, many people suffer from gastrointestinal diseases such as hepatitis and diarrhea, as well as skin allergies and lice, Mercy Corps said. One aid worker who fled Rafah said he was lucky and could afford to rent a house in Deir al-Balah. “You can’t walk” in the town from all the tents that have arisen, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because his agency had not authorized him to speak.Many people he sees in the street are yellow with jaundice or hepatitis, and “the stench is disgusting” from the sewage and piles of garbage. Israel says its offensive in Rafah is vital to its war aim of destroying Hamas in Gaza after the group’s Oct. 7 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others from southern Israel. Israel’s campaign in Gaza triggered by the attack has killed some 36,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Aid groups have warned for months that an attack on Rafah will worsen Gaza’s humanitarian disaster. So far, Israel’s operations have been short of its planned all-out invasion, though fighting has expanded over the past three weeks from the eastern parts of Rafah to central districts of the city. A strike Sunday hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people, according to health officials. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mistake” had occurred. From the exodus the assault has caused, satellite photos taken last week show dense new tent camps running the length of the coast from just north of Rafah to outside Deir al-Balah. The ramshackle tents and shelters are densely packed in mazes of corrugated metal and plastic sheets, blankets and bedsheets draped over wooden sticks for privacy.Tamer Saeed Abu’l Kheir said he goes out at 6 a.m. every day to find water, usually returning around noon to the tent outside Khan Younis where he and nearly two dozen relatives live. His three children, aged 4 to 10, are always sick, but he said he has to send them out to collect wood for the cooking fire, though he worries they’ll come across unexploded bombs in the wrecked houses. His aging father has trouble moving so has to use the bathroom in a bucket, and Abu’l Kheir has to regularly pay to transport him to the nearest hospital for kidney dialysis.“Wood costs money, water costs money, everything costs money,” said his wife, Leena Abu’l Kheir. She broke down in sobs. “I’m afraid I’ll wake up one day and I’ve lost my children, my mother, my husband, my family.”",

        "content": "PICKING out a wedding guest outfit is no easy task. There's lots of rules on what to wear and what you can't, including wearing white or red to someone else's wedding . But one woman has been savaged for the outfit she picked for a fancy wedding in the wine region Bordeaux , France . Taking to Reddit showing off her outfit she revealed there was no compulsory theme but the bride was hoping for people to wear florals and pastel colours. She said: \"No compulsory theme, but the optional theme is florals/pastel colours. The bride is making her own dress , which will be white with colourful floral embroidery. \"I altered this skirt last year (was originally a full midi skirt) and really want to wear it. I will be removing the shoulder straps from the final outfit, this was just for comfort whilst I tried it on. \"The shoes have this gorgeous blush pink floral lace all over them and are comfortable for me (but I will be taking flats in my bag!)\" The outfit consisted of a black lace off-the shoulder top which she paired with a black midi-skirt which had a large pink and white rose pattern all over. She asked members of the Reddit group, Wedding A ttire Approval : \"Is this outfit wedding appropriate? \"My partner is happy with it and thinks his family will be fine. Is there any way I can improve it?\" And people were quick to share their brutally honest opinions. Many said the outfit was too dated and looked cheap for a wedding. One person wrote: \"Everything about this outfit is very painfully 2010, from the skirt, to the top to the platform peep toe pumps. I’d scrap the whole look (including the second and third top option) and go with something more up to date.\" Another commented: \"Okay so I promise I’m not trying to be mean and if you were my friend irl I would tell you this. This outfit is what the kids today would call cheugy. \"If it was 2012, I would say this is the cutest skirt ever, but nowadays it looks a little dated.\" \"I don't think black to a wedding is 'done' in France.

Wedding Guest Outfit Etiquette If you're struggling to decided on a dress to see you through wedding season, here's a few rules on what not to wear so you don't get in trouble. Folklore says that wearing red at a wedding means you slept with the groom. Casual attire like jeans and flip flops should always be avoided. Any colour that could be picked up as white or cream - even if it's not. Most would agree that your cleavage needs to be covered. Wearing white is a massive no-no if you're not the bride. Meanwhile a fourth said: \"I would want some one to tell me the truth if I was asking. This outfit is incredibly tacky.\" \"This is so tacky. I’m sorry,” claimed a fifth.

        "description": "Aimed at apartment complexes, the HVAC systems will be connected with Samsung's other devices through SmartThings.",
        "content": "Image: Samsung Samsung said on Tuesday that it will form a joint venture with Lennox to expand heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system sales in North America. The Roanoke, Texas-based Samsung Lennox HVAC North America will be formed in the second half of the year and sell ductless AC and heat pump products in the US and Canada. The South Korean tech giant will own 50.1% of the venture and Lennox 49.9%. Under the pair's agreement, Lennox will sell \"Lennox powered by Samsung\" branded products at its stores and distributors. The venture will also distribute Samsung's ductless AC and heat pump products. The South Korean tech giant noted that while in North America demand for unitary systems was still high as many lived in single houses where installation of ducts was convenient, there was rising demand for systems that combine ductless and unitary due to the expanded supply of apartment complexes and medium-sized buildings in the US and Canada. The HVAC systems will also be connected with other Samsung devices through SmartThings, while also offering power consumption tracking through SmartThings Energy, Samsung said. The company said it will also expand its partnership with North American home builder companies to offer new solutions, besides HVAC systems, home appliances, and TV. The ultimate goal is to offer consumers what it calls an AI life solution in the home by leveraging its \"leadership\" in AI, software, smartphones, and chips, the South Korean tech giant added. In recent years, Samsung has been highlighting the combined experience its various consumer devices offer together, especially at home. It wants its various devices as well as household systems from AC to Wi-Fi to work together to offer a \"Smart Home\" for consumers. Samsung is the world's largest manufacturer of smartphones and TVs and a major supplier of home appliances. Last month, the company announced a partnership with Clayton Home Building Group, where it would offer its home appliances in a package to new homes of the construction company. In the same month, it also announced a partnership with US real estate company Flow to install the latter's 422-unit complex in Miami fitted with its home appliances and IoT sensors, connected through SmartThings, to offer a Smart Home experience for residents.",

        "description": "Gareth Southgate will oversee his fourth major tournament at the helm of the Three Lions and faces increasing pressure to finally deliver on the international stage",
        "content": "Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate has revealed the must-do pre-match ritual for his players ahead of the summer's European Championships: haircuts. Pre-match rituals can be as benignly straightforward as beans on toast and as compulsive as a specific pair of hole-cut socks, and the England national team are certainly not immune from the urge to find comfort in a routine. Southgate's England are preparing for the summer's Euros and their mission to secure a first piece of silverware since 1966. And the likelihood is that there will be plenty of hair grooming before England's first group stage game against Bosnia and Herzegovina on 3 June. Transfer news LIVE: Man Utd star's exit, Chelsea close on Maresca, Arsenal blow Jude Bellingham breaks silence on playing with Kylian Mbappe at Real Madrid “The lads are quite obsessive about getting their hair cut the night before a game,” Southgate told GQ, though the 53-year-old refrains from naming any specifics. Even so, it's not difficult to glean who might be the players paying hyper-attention to the locks before kick-off. Manchester City duo Phil Foden and Jack Grealish and Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham are known to share a barber who accompanies them on their travels. They are hardly alone in their zest. Brazilian icon Neymar flew his personal barber 6,500km to Qatar during the World Cup for a pre-match trim. Former Manchester United and Wrexham goalkeeper Ben Foster revealed England midfielder James Maddison , named in Southgate's 33-man provisional squad, did the same. Whatever the potential outward projection of lavishness, grooming is where Southgate believes his managerial purview ends. “If I’m going to start interfering in that sort of thing, then we’re in trouble,\" he said. On his own haircut status, he added: “I’ll have one more cut before we go, I think, because my hair gets a little bit curly, which I don’t like. Plus my wife says I haven’t got the features to have it really short.” Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden are two of England's brightest talents and share a barber when travelling ( Image: Eddie Keogh/The FA via Getty Images) England arrive in Germany as heavy favourites to reach the final, and Southgate is facing fierce pressure to live up to the expectations. Since taking the helm in November 2016, England have reached the World Cup semi-finals in 2018 and quarter-finals in 2022, while reaching the final in Euro 2020 but losing to Italy in a penalty shoot-out at Wembley Stadium. Avenging the Euro 2020 heartbreak will be crucial if Southgate is to continue in the role past the summer amid criticism of squad selection and negative playing style. Despite the increasing pressure, Southgate has insisted his focus rests on the summer's tournament and not what lay beyond. “When I was 23 as a player, I would’ve been anxious about that,\" he said. \"When I was 37 as a young manager, I’d have been anxious about that. But I’m 53 now and am totally relaxed about it, because life will go on whatever happens. \"I also don't think it would be right to make a decision before a tournament. I remember Fabio [Capello] signing a new contract before [World Cup 2010] and everybody said, 'What the bloody hell are they doing? He should be proving himself in the tournament.' If I was two years into the job, then perhaps I would feel differently. But we’re eight years in, and for me, all of my focus is on one thing: how do I get this team to win?\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "description": "Former president's legal costs are mounting, and his sources for funding them appear to be drying up.",
        "content": "Former President sold one of his private jets earlier this month and his sources for funding them appear to be drying up. His company sold a 1997 Cessna jet for an undisclosed sum to Mehrdad Moayedi, an Iranian-American tycoon who is a mega donor, , citing public records. The jet is worth around $10 million, the outlet reported. Aside from the Cessna, Trump also owns his prized Boeing 757 private jet, dubbed Trump Force One and a fleet of Sikorsky S76 Helicopters. The reported sale comes as Trump, who is the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2024 election, is currently relating to hush money payments. He has pleaded not guilty. The former president has been charged in four criminal cases in total, making history as the first American president to be so indicted. His significant legal fees have largely been bankrolled by his supporters as he has primarily used donations made to his political action committees to pay his lawyers. In total, Trump has spent nearly $100 million in legal fees, almost all paid for by donations, since he first left office in 2021 and began attempting to fend off various investigations. These legal fees have been piling up faster since he was indicted. Trump's Save America PAC has paid around $50 million in legal bills to various law firms representing him since his first indictment in March 2023, reported, citing Federal Election Commission filings. His fundraising for his legal expenses falls within a gray area of campaign finance law due to loopholes and lax enforcement by the FEC. But now, these funds could soon dry up. The accounts that Trump has been using to pay his lawyers had access to just $6.8 million at the end of March, according to campaign finance filings, reported. This means that the former president will have to pay his own legal bills or find other ways to cover them. Trump has a net worth of around $7 billion, according to . Along with his lawyers' fees, a New York judge also handed Trump a $454 million civil fraud judgment in February. He after an appeals court granted his request to lower the bond, with his lawyers arguing that it was a \"practical impossibility\" to fulfill the original penalty. reached out to a Trump campaign spokesperson for comment outside of regular working hours. The hush money case is the first one of Trump's four cases to go to trial, and is now entering its final stretch with closing arguments beginning on Tuesday. The other cases relate to alleged election interference in Georgia, a federal case relating to Trump's alleged attempts to subvert the results of the 2020 election, and the alleged mishandling of classified documents. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing, claiming he is the victim of a political witch hunt. As Trump tries to stay on top of his legal fees, he has also been working to close the financial gap between his campaign and President 's, as Biden's campaign committee has been significantly out-raising his.

        "description": "The show which runs at The Alex until May 29 is the latest comedy triumph from the Mischief theatre company",
        "content": "What do you get if you cross Derren Brown, Paul McKenna and Uri Geller? Who cares? It's mind over matter - and when Mind Mangler: Member of the Tragic Circle is in town, those lot really don't matter. Don't cross the Mind Mangler himself, though, for what starts as a flamboyant, supernatural stage performer out to wow the crowd, ends with an increasingly exasperated illusionist hilariously losing his head. Mind Mangler stars Henry Lewis as larger-than-life mind magic man Keith and Jonathan Sayer as his cheeky friend Clive, in the guise of several audience members. For the unitiated, the writer-actor duo are co-founders of Mischief, the theatre company behind slapstick stage classics The Play That Goes Wrong and Magic Goes Wrong and the BBC television series The Goes Wrong Show. Henry Lewis and Jonathan Sayer pretned to use an Ouija board in the Mind Mangler. (Image: Pamela Raith Photography) Mind Mangler is their latest comedy creation and after 10 years of Mischief, it's no surprise that Lewis, Sayer and Co have honed this inspired nonsense to a fine art. I went to see Magic Goes Wrong with my family in the West End a couple of years ago and the brilliantly calamitous cast conjured up a stunning show including some hilarious first glimpses of the Mind Mangler in action. Arriving at Birmingham's Alexandra Theatre last night, I did wonder whether there would be enough mirth-inducing material from the Mind Mangler to carry a whole performance. I needn't have worried as Lewis had the audience completely captivated and laughing along from start to finish - with a little help from his friend, Sayer. The plot centres around the Mind Mangler, a big, booming showman with grand plans to crack Las Vegas using his magical mind-reading methods. His act ranges from card tricks, spoon-bending and Rubik's cubes to death-defying stunts and, true to the Mischief brand, things go wrong, very wrong indeed. Henry Lewis, in the Mind Mangler, as a stunt involving an icecream freezer goes wrong. (Image: Pamela Raith Photography) In-jokes such as the annoying autocue, silly sound man and hypnotic utterances are repeated at deliciously amusing moments and not even a mishap with an icecream freezer can help Keith keep his cool as the curtain closes on the frantic-paced fun of act one. It's a bit much to claim he has a God complex, but a little skit called Quick Fire Jesus, where miracles are distilled into 30 second magic tricks, brings giggles of biblical proportions. The show is all about audience participation, real and staged, and each and every member of the crowd will have left the theatre feeling they played their part, not least the young lady, whose remarkable 'hat' secret was wonderfully coaxed out by the Mind Mangler. You really did have to be there! Much to my teenage son's delight, I didn't escape the main man's atention as he wandered into the stalls to place a thought-capturing contraption on mine and others' heads as our embarrassing 'inner monologues' were transmitted over the speakers. Henry Lewis, with the thought-capturing contraption in the Mind Mangler. (Image: Pamela Raith Photography) When it comes to crowd participation though, Sayer steals the show. Planted at various locations in the auditorium, the likeable rogue oozes fun as he is invited onto the stage to help (more like hinder) the Mind Mangler with various illusions. It emerges during the course of the performance that Clive is actually Keith's best and only friend, desperately trying to prop up his pal's flimsy ambitions only to make a mess of everything. Despite all the flops, failures and fiascos, there's some brilliant stunts throughout the show, culminating in an epic guillotine scene, but the true magic is how the two protagonists survive the setbacks to emerge with their friendship intact. Ultimately the Mind Mangler won hearts and minds as the delightful double act of Lewis and Sayer departed to a much-deserved standing ovation from the crowd, including myself, my son and all of those around us, at The Alex. It runs at The Alex until Wednesday, May 29. Ticket information is here.",

        "content": "refreshes its 10-week high at 0.6165 in Tuesday’s European session. The Kiwi asset strengthens on multiple tailwinds such as soft US Dollar and China’s announcement of fresh stimulus measures to boost demand for its beleaguered housing sector. (DXY), which tracks the US Dollar’s value against six major currencies, has extended its downside to 104.50. The US Dollar fails to capitalize on diminished expectations over the (Fed) starting to reduce interest rates from the September meeting. The decline in market speculation for Fed rate cuts in September is the outcome of a strong (US) and policymakers’ hawkish stance on the interest rate outlook. Meanwhile, the New Zealand Dollar strengthened after China’s Shanghai announced several measures to revive the housing sector from the crisis. The administration acknowledges cutting down payment requirements, lowering minimum mortgage rates, and restrictions on home purchases will be eased. Being a proxy to China’s economy, the appeal for the New Zealand Dollar improves. On the domestic front, investors await the NZ Budget Release that will indicate the scale of spendings, borrowing and revenue collection by the government. NZD/USD is approaching the horizontal resistance plotted from February 22 high around 0.6220. The Kiwi asset strengthened after a bullish crossover of the 20 and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) around 0.6020, which suggested that a bullish trend has been triggered. The 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) shifts comfortably into the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, indicating that the momentum has leaned toward the upside. An upside move above the round-level resistance of 0.6200 will drive the asset January 15 high near 0.6250, followed by January 12 high near 0.6280. On the contrary, fresh downside would appear if the asset breaks below April 4 high around 0.6050 This would drag the asset towards the psychological support of 0.6000 and April 25 high at 0.5969.

        "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Three players quit Argentina's women's squad on Monday in a dispute over not being paid and conditions at a camp ahead of two friendlies. Goalkeeper Laurina Oliveiros, defender Julieta Cruz and midfielder Lorena Benítez, all regular starters, walked out. “We reached a point in which we are tired of the injustices, of not being valued, not being heard and, even worse, being humiliated,” Cruz posted on Instagram . “We need improvements for Argentina’s women’s soccer national team, and I am not only talking about finances. I speak about training, having lunch, breakfast.” Cruz and Benítez said during national squad training sessions they received a ham and cheese sandwich and a banana, which they consider inadequate for high-performance athletes. They said the Argentine Football Association told them they won't be paid for the friendlies against Costa Rica on Friday and Monday because the games are at home in Buenos Aires. Benitez added their family members were being charged 5,000 pesos ($5) for match tickets. “And there there are millions of things we have gone through,\" the midfielder added. Oliveros wrote on Instagram , “With a broken heart and thousands of dreams disappearing little by little. May the next generations enjoy and be happy running after the football, as we were sometime ago.\" AFA did not comment on the players' decision. Estefanía Banini, considered the country's best female player ever, supported her three former teammates. Last year, she also decided to stop playing for the national team. “A matter of time. Thanks for being willing to speak about it,” the Atletico Madrid midfielder said on her social media channels. AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "content": "One thing that must ALWAYS be true: Man Utd are a banter club. So the media pretends they have been pied by Kieran McKenna and hijacked by Chelsea... How will Manchester United ever recover from this ‘humiliation’? Mediawatch understands that there is traction to be found in painting Manchester United as a banter club but they really need no help with this quest; they are plenty daft enough on their own without pretending they have been pied by the Ipswich Town manager: Kieran McKenna ‘set to sign new Ipswich deal as Man Utd suffer humiliating blow in bid to replace Ten Hag’ Note the quote marks. Has anybody called this ‘humiliating’ apart from whichever click-greedy sub wrote that headline? Have they f***. KIERAN MCKENNA could sensationally be set to stay at Ipswich as he edges closer to a new deal, reports suggest. Not that sensational. But let’s get to the part where Manchester United have been ‘humiliated’ by this... Man Utd’s new co-owners are said to have held talks with McKenna as part of a four-man shortlist in the event they part ways with Ten Hag. But now according to The Athletic, McKenna will end speculation on his future by committing to a new long-term contract at Ipswich. So one member of a four-man shortlist for a job that is not actually vacant has decided to stay in his current role. Pesky fact: He was never offered the Manchester United job so could never turn down the Manchester United job. And yet still we are told this is a ‘humiliating blow’. Well it’s certainly embarrassing for somebody... MORE ON THE MAN UTD MANAGER SITUATION FROM F365: 👉 Ten Hag’s Arne Slot potshot can lead to Man Utd-Liverpool feud if Ratcliffe gets the memo 👉 Five reasons to sack Ten Hag and his ‘caveman’ football for Man Utd 👉 Who will be the next Manchester United manager? What’s even worse than humiliation? Talking of Manchester United being a banter club... Man Utd could be RELEGATED from Europa League after FA Cup triumph That will be the Mirror , reporting the news that INEOS’ ownership of Nice could cause problems in Europe next season. Or... Should INEOS fail to resolve the issue, one of their clubs could be relegated to the UEFA Conference League. Usually Nice would maintain their Europa League position due to their higher league finish of fifth, compared to United’s eighth-placed finish. However, it remains to be seen which club, if any, would face the drop down to Europe’s third competition. Which sounds very much like Manchester United will be RELEGATED, doesn’t it? Behave. It’s Casemiro: Do NOT click ‘Manchester United star told Erik ten Hag he did NOT want to play in FA Cup final’ – Mirror . (Because he was injured). And now a HIJACK! And Manchester United are such a banter club that they risk being HIJACKED. Things just go from bad to worse, don’t they? Chelsea look to HIJACK Man Utd and Newcastle’s first transfer target as they ‘offer contract’ to Premier League star The clue is there in The Sun ‘s headline that this is Grade A bollocks because you can’t HIJACK (or even hijack) a transfer target for two clubs. No deal has been done so no deal can be hijacked. Even Dick Turpin couldn’t hijack two carriages holding the same people at the same time. What has actually happened here is that Sky Sports have claimed that Chelsea have ‘offered a contract to Fulham defender Tosin’. What has also happened here is that The Sun have remembered that Tosin has previously been linked with Newcastle United but, always more importantly, Manchester United... The Express – as they are wont to do – go even further... Man Utd risk first INEOS transfer row as Chelsea ‘take advantage’ of Erik ten Hag saga Does ‘take advantage’ appear in the story? Nope. Does it appear in the Sky Sports claim that Chelsea have made an offer for Tosin? Nope. Would it surprise you if we said that Sky Sports don’t even mention Manchester United as rivals for Tosin? Probably not. And yet here we are... Manchester United risk an early rift among the club’s new-look sporting hierarchy if Chelsea successfully hijack a reported summer target. They ‘risk an early rift’ if they don’t sign free transfer Tosin from Fulham? Even though there is literally no indication that Manchester United were ever anything more than ‘interested’. But how silly of Mediawatch to be rational about this complete non-story when this could actually signal a massive, massive issue... Adarabioyo presents a perfect opportunity to strike a bargain to start an important transfer window positively, and Wilcox could be the one pushing for his Old Trafford arrival. But suppose United miss out while they’re focusing on Ten Hag’s future. In that case, it might not go down well within the club and among fans, who hope INEOS can stabilise the Glazer family’s chaotic environment. Yes, we imagine Man Utd fans will be absolutely fuming if they don’t manage to sign Tosin. Remember when Ed Woodward had his house attacked? It will be nothing compared to the rage when the fans realise that a former Fulham defender might join Chelsea on a free transfer instead... Pseuds corner ‘Enzo Maresca, Chelsea and the chess thesis that explains his football vision’ – The Athletic . Don’t make us want him to fail. On the other end of the spectrum... Enzo Maresca’s big dog credentials in absolute tatters as Jeff Stelling has to apologise there for TalkSport calling him Spanish all morning. Not just a slip of the tongue either, they had a jingle with Spanish music playing about him too. He’s done. — Shutts (@Shuttsapalooza) May 28, 2024",

        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan’s opposition-controlled legislature passed changes on Tuesday that are seen as favoring China and diminishing the power of the island’s president. The changes pushed by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies give the body greater power to control budgets, including defense spending that the party has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. The Nationalists took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan’s de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Thousands of people gathered outside Taiwan’s legislature on Tuesday to oppose changes being pushed through by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies that would give the body greater power. The Nationalists, also known as the KMT, took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan’s de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. The proposed legislative changes would give them more power to control budgets, including defense spending that the KMT has blocked in what many see as a concession to China.

        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan’s opposition-controlled legislature passed changes on Tuesday that are seen as favoring China and diminishing the power of the island’s president. The changes pushed by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies give the body greater power to control budgets, including defense spending that the party has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. The Nationalists took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan’s de facto independence from China.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Thousands of people gathered outside Taiwan’s legislature on Tuesday to oppose changes being pushed through by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies that would give the body greater power. The Nationalists, also known as the KMT, took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan’s de facto independence from China.

        "content": "Every year, the poster for the sets the tone for the 12-day showcase that is about to follow. In 2023, it featured , signalling a return to unapologetic glamour and escapism. This year’s poster, however, was strikingly different: it displayed a still from Akira Kurosawa’s touching 1991 drama , which shows a family sitting on a bench and staring up at the moon – except, in the poster, the moon is instead a luminous . Considering the film itself is a reflection on the ripple effects of war – in this case, World War II as it impacts a Japanese family – it was clearly an acknowledgement of the devastating crises currently gripping the world, and felt appropriately subdued and thoughtful. Many believed that the festival would feel similarly restrained and politically engaged – and it did, in parts, though it also had its fair share of glitz and glamour. Below, all the moments you missed from the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival. loomed large (at least for a time) Ahead of the showcase, that was due to be published which would outline new accusations of abuse against a string of prominent industry figures who would be in attendance. At the , Cannes’s artistic director, Thierry Frémaux, refused to comment on the matter, stressing that the festival’s focus should be the films itself. However, that didn’t stop journalists from quizzing the likes of and , the star of the festival’s opening film , on the topic at Cannes’s earliest press conferences – though, it quickly emerged that no such report would be coming after all. Still, women directors did what they could to ensure the subject wasn’t entirely forgotten: over the next few days, Judith Godrèche’s powerful short debuted on the Croisette (and the filmmaker posed on the red carpet with her hands over her mouth to symbolise the silencing of women), alongside Rungano Nyoni’s , Noémie Merlant’s and Sandhya Suri’s , all of which approach the issue from a number of different, equally fascinating angles. There were nods to the war in In his pre-festival press conference, Thierry Frémaux also spoke of his hopes for , and organisers did their best to deliver exactly that: , and while, initially, the festival was reportedly amenable to a plan for Arab filmmakers to wear pins in support of Palestinians, it later changed course. That’s not to say that no one made their voices heard: some attendees did indeed wear ceasefire pins; before the festival kicked off, star and jury member Omar Sy ; and on 21 May, at the festival’s Algerian pavilion, in memory of those killed in Gaza. Meanwhile, , and Cate Blanchett’s floor-length, Haider Ackermann-designed Jean Paul Gaultier gown for the premiere of , with some viewers speculating that it was intended to resemble the Palestinian flag when held up against the red carpet. (The actor has long been pushing for a ceasefire, but did not comment further on her look. It’s worth adding that while the back of her dress looked paler on camera, in reality, it was a blush pink.) Elsewhere, , a survivor of the October 7 Hamas attacks wore a bright yellow dress featuring the faces of hostages held in Gaza and a sash which read: “Bring them home”. Trump battled Ali Abbasi’s , the Sebastian Stan-led account of the embattled entrepreneur and future president’s rise in ’70s and ’80s New York, predictably drew its subject’s ire, given it features him undergoing liposuction and a scalp reduction, experiencing erectile dysfunction, and in one horrifying scene, raping his wife, Ivana (Maria Bakalova). (That sequence is a . “As a woman I felt violated,” she subsequently said. “I referred to this as a rape, but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.” Trump always denied the allegation.) Following the film’s premiere, Trump’s campaign communications director, Steven Cheung, saying that they would be addressing “the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers”, adding, “this garbage is pure fiction which sensationalises lies that have been long debunked. This is election interference by Hollywood elites, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked. This ‘film’ is pure malicious defamation, should not see the light of day, and doesn’t even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store. It belongs in a dumpster fire.” At his press conference, Abbasi : “Donald’s team should watch the movie before they start suing us. Everyone’s always talking about him suing a lot of people. They don’t talk about his success rate, though.” Trump’s lawyers then sent a cease-and-desist letter to producers, attempting to block the film’s US sale and release, to which they said, “The film is a fair and balanced portrait of the former president. We want everyone to see it and then decide.” The film’s future currently hangs in the balance. was the talk of the town Francis Ford Coppola’s long-gestating, futuristic epic dominated headlines for all the wrong reasons, even before the director and his cast arrived on the Croisette. Just days before the film’s premiere, published a report about the blockbuster’s reportedly chaotic shoot which alleged that the director “pulled women to sit on his lap” on set and “tried to kiss some of the topless and scantily clad female extras” in a nightclub scene. (Executive co-producer Darren Demetre responded: “There were two days when we shot a celebratory Studio 54-esque club scene where Francis walked around the set to establish the spirit of the scene by giving kind hugs and kisses on the cheek to the cast and background players. It was his way to help inspire and establish the club atmosphere, which was so important to the film. I was never aware of any complaints of harassment or ill behaviour during the course of the project.”) When the film did finally make its debut, following a red carpet which saw and rubbing shoulders with Adam Driver, Aubrey Plaza and , the responses ranged from applause to shouted boos and more than one viewer approaching the press afterwards to declare that it was the worst film they’d ever seen – understandable, considering it featured Plaza playing a deranged villain named Wow Platinum, Voight brandishing a massive boner, and a truly bizarre piece of live theatre. Will the film ever find US distribution? Who’s to say? But I, for one, will always remember it for providing my most bonkers Cannes moment to date. Women directors triumphed Just a year after became only the third woman in 76 years to take home the Palme d’Or, for , the thriller which went on to earn her a Best Original Screenplay Oscar, it was disappointing to see that only four women-directed films were set to play in competition this year – Agathe Riedinger’s , Andrea Arnold’s , Coralie Fargeat’s and Payal Kapadia’s – compared to seven last year. Even then, these films had an outsized impact, yielding – along with Rungano Nyoni’s aforementioned , which played in the Un Certain Regard section – some of the festival’s strongest reactions and most rapturous reviews. Fargeat left the festival with the Best Screenplay award, and Kapadia, who had already made history as the first Indian filmmaker to compete for the top prize in 30 years, came within spitting distance of the Palme d’Or, taking home the second place Grand Prix. Look out for the latter in the 2025 Oscars Best International Feature race, where she could very well follow in the footsteps of last year’s Grand Prix recipient and eventual Academy Award winner, Jonathan Glazer’s . Red carpet legends dominated From when collecting her honorary Palme d’Or to ’s return to the spotlight, , , , Michelle Yeoh radiant in Bottega Veneta, , and ’s eternal magnetism, the Cannes red carpet, unquestionably, belonged to women in their 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s – Hollywood’s ageist beauty standards be damned. Bella had a blast , , , , , – yes, , et al looked great, but the supermodel proved, once again, that no young starlet can do Cannes quite like she can. Celebrity progeny (and pooches) were the best plus ones ’s 17-year-old daughter, alongside her grandfather, Francis Ford Coppola, at the premiere of , and . Demi Moore’s , also made for a stylish plus one – – though there was some canine competition in the form of the nation’s favourite dog, , who made a triumphant red-carpet return. Kelly Rowland stood her ground The musician and actor went viral when she was seemingly rushed up the red carpet by a security guard at the premiere of . In videos of the incident, she can be seen smiling and responding politely to requests to move up the stairs, before she’s surrounded by guards and confronts one of them directly. “I have a boundary, and I stand by those boundaries, and that is it,” she later told . “And there were other women that attended that carpet who did not quite look like me, and they didn’t get scolded or pushed off or told to get off. I stood my ground, and she felt like she had to stand hers, but I stood my ground.” Colleagues of the usher insisted she was “only doing her job” and needed to get guests inside the venue so that the event could begin on time, but she was soon caught up in a number of other kerfuffles involving Dominican actor , K-Pop star , and . On a red carpet known for its , it was a reminder of how guests are sometimes treated if they’re not, say, or . The festival ended on an emotional note In the run-up to Cannes, many attendees were concerned about the fate of Mohammad Rasoulof. Just days before his latest release, – the emotionally-charged tale of a judge in the revolutionary court in Tehran who turns against his own family – was due to premiere in competition towards the very end of the festival, the Iranian filmmaker was by the government. Miraculously, it didn’t prevent the director from debuting the film – he , arrived on the Croisette, and received a at his premiere, easily the festival’s longest and most enthusiastic. At his press conference the following day, he : “My only message to Iranian cinema is don’t be afraid of intimidation and censorship in Iran. [The regime is] afraid. They want us to feel afraid; they want to discourage us. But don’t let yourself be intimidated. You have to believe in your liberty. We have to fight for a dignified life.” It was a testament to the true power of cinema. The winners included plenty of surprises Given the euphoric response to , not to mention its political weight and significance, it was the presumed frontrunner for the Palme d’Or heading into the closing ceremony – but, ultimately, it was Sean Baker’s bubbly comedy , which had been surging in the race a few days earlier, that scooped the honour, while Rasoulof received a special prize instead. Meanwhile, Payal Kapadia took the Grand Prix for ; Miguel Gomes the Best Director prize for ; Jesse Plemons Best Actor for ; and z both the Jury Prize and Best Actress jointly for its stars Karla Sofía Gascón, Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz. It was a fitting end to a festival which has been quite the wild and unpredictable ride.",

        "description": "With students occupying tables for hours without making purchases, patrons wonder if convenience stores are turning into unofficial study halls.",
        "content": "Subscribe to our FREE Newsletter , or Telegram and WhatsApp channels for the latest stories and updates. In the pursuit of academic success, young minds in Malaysia have found a haven in the cosy confines of Family Mart’s FamiCafe outlets. With their air conditioning and free Wi-Fi, these convenience stores offer a respite from the sweltering heat. They have become a popular destination for students seeking a comfortable and cost-effective study environment. However, what was meant to be a convenient study spot has now become a contention between students and other patrons. As the assignment deadlines draw closer for students, students occupy tables for hours, armed with nothing but their laptops and determined to succeed. While this arrangement may seem ideal for cash-strapped students, it has left regular customers feeling frustrated and neglected. Many have complained that the students’ prolonged presence without making any purchases has made it difficult for them to find a place to sit and enjoy their meals or snacks. Disgruntled customers have taken to social media to express their frustration, with one particular incident at FamiCafe garnering attention. A customer, eager to enjoy a meal at the outlet, was dismayed to find students occupying tables for extended periods without purchasing food or drinks. Tak stress ke belajar kat tempat2 macam ni? Dulu masa time study, pernah la sekali dua try study kat Mcd dgn Kepsi, tapi buka buku 5 mins je, lepas makan terus balik. Tak selesa nyah, dengan bisingnya lagi. https://t.co/CKlVZ58rR3 When approached by the customer, one student allegedly replied, “Lama lagi bang. Saya tengah siapkan assignment.” (It’ll be a while more, brother. I’m working on my assignment.) This response only fueled the fire, as the customer felt that the students were inconsiderate and selfish. The situation escalated when even staff members’ attempts to encourage the students to make a purchase fell on deaf ears. Exasperated, the customer took to the “Saya Anak Perlis” Facebook group to share their experience, lamenting that the students’ actions had ruined their plans to enjoy a meal at the outlet. Some netizens sympathized with the customer’s plight, arguing that while they understand the student’s need for a conducive study environment, it should not come at the expense of other paying customers. Others suggested that students utilize the numerous libraries and dedicated study spaces rather than monopolizing tables at convenience stores. Interestingly, this phenomenon is not new, as students have long been known to frequent establishments like McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Zus Coffee for their study sessions. However, in recent times, many students have allegedly avoided these outlets due to various boycott movements, leading them to seek alternative spaces like FamiCafe. Ngeliat Foto ini ada sedikit cerita. Gw dan temen gw ke McD Sec26. Ceritanya ketika gw mau order mcd, ada 1 keluarga anak kecil 4-7 tahun 2 orang dan 12 tahun 1 orang. Dia bermain sambil cekikikan Deket meja orang ini (pelajar). A Thread pic.twitter.com/YtR3rPqeR9 As the debate rages on, it remains to be seen how FamiCafe and other convenience store chains will address this growing concern. Will they implement policies that fairly balance students’ needs and regular customers’ satisfaction? Only time will tell. In the meantime, students are urged to be more considerate of others when using public spaces for their study sessions. By making a small purchase or limiting their time during peak hours, they can help maintain a harmonious environment for all patrons of these convenience stores.

        "content": "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. appointed retired Marikina Regional Trial Court (RTC) judge Felix Reyes as the new Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) Board of Directors chief, Malacañang said on Tuesday. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin swore in Reyes as PCSO Board of Directors chair on Tuesday, as the 63-year-old retired RTC judge succeeded former congressman Junie Cua, who had been with the government agency since 2022. Reyes formerly served as president of the Philippine Judges Association and acting presiding judge of multiple RTC branches in Taguig City, Lipa City, and Calamba City. The 63-year-old new PCSO Board of Directors chief got his law degree at the University of the East in 1986 after completing his undergraduate studies at the Far Eastern University in 1981. PCSO, a government-owned and controlled corporation of the Philippines under the Office of the President, holds and conducts charity sweepstakes, races, and lotteries and engages in health and welfare-related investments, projects, and activities to provide permanent and continuing sources of funds for its programs. Malacañang announced the new head without giving a reason. This comes after PCSO faced scrutiny earlier this year. PCSO drew flak after it showed an edited photo of a lotto winner. It led to rumors that the lottery draws were fake or staged, even though PCSO General Manager Mel Robles said it was to protect the winner's name.",

        "content": "One of the best players in Three Lions history, Rooney has amassed 120 caps and scored 53 goals for his country. For many years, fans, analysts and former players have debated which Premier League legend is the best. The former striker played with some renowned players as part of England’s ‘golden generation’. He played with Gerrard and Lampard for England while with Scholes, he also played at Manchester United. Rooney has settled the debate in the most sensible manner and given a logical answer, which many people would agree with. The new Plymouth Argyle manager dissected each man’s resume before making his selection during his appearance on the most recent edition of . Rooney declared. Rooney praised all the three midfielders for their talent and quality and it was clear who he favoured among the three. While he has respect for his former club teammate Scholes, he did not hesitate in showering praise on Gerrard. Wayne Rooney picks Gerrard as an all-rounder Not many can argue with Rooney as he has played with all three of them and knows their game better than most others. The fact that he says that Gerrard could do what Scholes did at Man United but Scholes wouldn’t do what Gerrard did for Liverpool settles the debate. Man United fans might not like Rooney’s comments but since getting into punditry, the former striker has been honest and open about his opinions without thinking what the fans would feel.",

        "description": "The UK is set for plenty more wet weather over the summer with reports that we can expect 50 days of rain to fall which would make it the soggiest for more than a century",
        "content": "Brits are set for one of the country's wettest summers with at least 50 days of rain to fall in just three months. It has already been a soggy spring with week after week of heavy rain and now it appears as though we have months more of it. The Met Office has reportedly told the Government that the UK is set for 50% more rain than the average for the time of year. The disappointing forecast means that the many summer events like Wimbledon, the British Grand Prix or the Trooping the Colour could be a washout. BBC forecaster Louise Lear said for this week: “We are closing out the final few days of May on an unsettled note, almost dotting the ‘is’ and crossing the ‘ts’ to what has been a pretty wet spring but as June approaches we will start to see some drier weather by the weekend and fingers crossed it will warm up just a touch. Before then we have some rain to look out for.” Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' It could be the wettest summer for more than 100 years ( Image: James Linsell Clark / SWNS) But it looks as though we could have the wettest summer since 1912 when there were 55 days of rainfall after last year appeared bad enough when we had 40 days of showers, reported The Sun. For it to count as a rainy day there needs to be 2.5mm or more of rain within the 24 hours. The long weather forecast from the Met Office, which runs from June 11 to 25, states that there is no strong signal for either dry or wet weather but temperatures could be higher than normal. It reads: \"Current indications are that the chances of high pressure or low pressure dominating are fairly balanced for this period. \"There is no strong signal for either dry or wet conditions being the more prominent feature of the weather. On balance, it is probable that a continuation of variable, slow moving weather patterns are likely through much of June, similar to that which has been experienced through May. However with potentially slow moving weather systems there is still a chance that longer-lived drier, or even wetter, spells are entirely possible too. Temperatures are most likely to be around or above normal.\" Meanwhile back to today and wet conditions are forecast to dominate, according to forecasters, as weather maps show a large front of heavy rain stretching the length of the mainland UK. A weather map for today ( Image: Met Office) Some of the worst of today's deluge could be seen in the northwest of England, according to data from Ventusky, including up to 2mm of rain to fall per hour across Merseyside. Cumbria, the Isle of Man, Humberside and Lincolnshire, South West Scotland and North Wales will also be in for a rainy day, while daytime temperatures are to sit at around 13-15C across the UK. More unsettled weather is also expected on Wednesday, according to the weather maps. BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker said the weather outlook will remain \"hit and miss\" throughout the week, with no sign of prolonged warmer conditions for the time being. He said: \"Temperatures will be normal, nothing spectacular but at least by the end of the week it does look as though these low pressures should finally pull away as we see high pressure building but the winds will still come in from the north so the certainly isn’t any major warm up in the forecast.”",

The changes pushed by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies give the body greater power to control budgets, including defense spending that the party has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. The Nationalists took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan’s de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Thousands of people gathered outside Taiwan’s legislature on Tuesday to oppose changes being pushed through by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies that would give the body greater power. The Nationalists, also known as the KMT, took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan’s de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. The proposed legislative changes would give them more power to control budgets, including defense spending that the KMT has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. Taiwan’s legislative chamber was festooned with banners promoting both sides in the dispute, while arguments on the floor broke out into shouting and pushing matches.",

        "content": "The game is a repeat of last year's final - which Saints won - and will kick off at 11.45am. It is part of rugby league's triple header at the national stadium and takes place before the Men's Betred Challenge Cup Final between Wigan Warriors and Warrington Wolves. The AB Sundecks 1895 Cup Final between Sheffield Eagles v Wakefield Trinity kicks off at 5.45pm. The ticket winners will, of course, be able to watch all three matches. Saints Women earned their place in the final with an emphatic semi final victory over York Valkyrie, avenging the earlier defeat on the first day of Super League. Games between Saints and Leeds are always keenly contested affairs - just like the league game between the sides last Friday at the TWS where Saints' defensive resolve delivered the spoils with a 12-6 victory. It was a tough encounter - and it has certainly set things up nicely for the Wembley showpiece. The St Helens Star have three pairs of tickets to give away in this competition - but the prizes are 'print at home' tickets so the winners MUST be able to print them off themselves. To be in with a chance of winning one of the pairs of tickets simply answer this question. Who scored all Saints' points in the 12-6 win over Leeds Rhinos at the weekend? Email your answer to mike.critchley@nqnw.co.uk by 6pm Thursday, 30 May. Please leave your name, address, contact email and number on the email that you send in. Winners will be notified on Friday morning. Winners will be drawn from all the correct answers. Please do not enter multiple times. Winners will be sent a ticket link to print off at home - physical paper tickets for the this comp will not be sent out to winners by the Star or the RFL. The prize is for tickets only, winners will have to make their own transport arrangements.",

        "content": "A moment from 's wedding day has gone viral on social media as she and celebrated their earlier this month. The couple, who met in the summer of 2016, announced their , and the two were married at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018. The royal wedding—a highly anticipated event in the U.K., U.S. and Commonwealth—drew a reported global audience of almost 2 billion. Now, many are revisiting a moment from the royal nuptials after user @europeanroyals_ uploaded of Meghan and Harry walking down the aisle after exchanging vows. The video has received more than 100,000 views, with many commenters praising the couple. One user wrote: \"She floated down that aisle. Love her.\" \"Beautiful couple,\" another added, while another commenter wrote, \"Perfect wedding.\" The wedding did not pass without setbacks. For instance, Thomas Markle, Meghan's father—who made headlines by cooperating in a paparazzi photo shoot before the big day—was absent after suffering health issues that prevented him from traveling to Britain to walk his daughter down the aisle. During the ceremony, Meghan walked half the length of the chapel aisle solo before being met by her future father-in-law, —then the Prince of Wales—who to the altar, where Harry waited. The bride's appearance on the day was widely praised. She wore an designed for her at Givenchy, a haute couture house in Paris, by the British designer Clare Waight Keller. Meghan paired the dress with a cathedral-length veil embroidered with the floral emblems of the Commonwealth nations and the California poppy, a reference to her home state. As the bride and groom left the service, Symphony No. 1 in B-flat by William Boyce, an 18th-century composer, played. For years, Boyce was an organist at St. George's Chapel and composed the music for the coronation of Prince Harry's ancestors, King George III and Queen Charlotte, in 1761. Since their marriage, both Harry and Meghan have discussed their wedding day in interviews. In 2021, the couple came under fire after telling they \"got married\" three days before their wedding day in a backyard ceremony with only the archbishop of Canterbury present. \"You know, three days before our wedding we got married,\" Meghan said. \"No one knows that. But we called the archbishop, and we just said, 'Look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world, but we want our union between us.' So the vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the archbishop of Canterbury.\" The archbishop that though he met with the couple before their wedding day, their legal marriage took place at St. George's Chapel on May 19, 2018. \"I had a number of private and pastoral meetings with the duke and duchess before the wedding. The legal wedding was on the Saturday [May 19],\" he told . He continued: \"I signed the wedding certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offence if I signed it knowing it was false. So you can make what you like about it. But the legal wedding was on the Saturday. But I won't say what happened at any other meetings.\" Newsweek Newsweek Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "Drew Barrymore wants to bring back the magic of The Wizard of Oz back on the silver screens. While speaking with US Weekly , the 49-year-old actress said that she has been wanting to make a prequel film on the franchise for more than 20 years now. “'Surrender Dorothy' is the script I’ve been trying to get made for, I kid you not, 28 years. When we first started Flower Films, it was one of the first scripts I fell in love with and we developed it. So it feels very personal to me,” she said. Drew, who launched her Flower Films production company in 1995, further noted that the script is “lying in a vault somewhere.” “As a director, I would give anything to do [make] that. And then as an actor, it was sort of not really available to me for many years. And I did try, but [it] wasn’t feeling right for me,” she continued. Drew also admitted that now that her kids are getting older, she wants to get more acting projects. “I think the girls are like, ‘Yeah, mom, we’re doing great. If you want to go do that, go back and do things.’ Getting that permission from them was really huge and sort of opened up my mind, so we’ll see,” the mother-of-two continued.",

        "content": "TOURISM Solomons is celebrating its best first quarter international visitor intake since 2019. Figures released by the Solomon Islands National Statistics Office (SINSO) for Q1 show the destination attracted a total of 4903 visitors, an increase of 24 percent over the 3940 achieved for the same period in 2023. Australian arrivals continued to dominate the statistics, climbing 4 per cent from 1426 to reach 1484. New Zealand numbers too increased, up 39 percent from 236 to 329 while numbers from Fiji rose 11 percent from 399 to 458. The strongest result came from Papua New Guinea where visitor numbers increased from 261 to 478 for the quarter, an increase of more than 84 percent. The only dip across all visitor sources came from the US where visitor arrivals dropped -5 percent from 351 to 330. While the 2024 Q1 numbers fall short of the 6042 achieved in Q1 of the record-breaking 2019, Tourism Solomons CEO (acting) Dagnal Dereveke said concerted marketing efforts in tandem with partner Solomon Airlines were obviously paying dividends. “Our 2024 marketing strategy continues to be fixed on rebuilding and growing the numbers in our key source markets,” Mr Dereveke said.",

        "content": "A Harvard student slammed her university for subjective action towards 13 students being denied their graduation due to their pro-Palestine stand. “As I stand here today, I must take a moment to recognize my peers—the 13 undergraduates in the class of 2024 who will not graduate today,” Shruthi Kumar, an Indian American from Nebraska said. Thirteen students have been barred by Harvard’s governing against their graduation even as the university’s faculty of arts and sciences voted for them to have their degrees conferred. “The students have spoken. The faculty have spoken,” Kumar said amongst a standing ovation. Shruthi asked: “Harvard, do you hear us?” “We are in a moment of intense division and disagreement in our community over the events in Gaza. I see pain, anxiety and unrest across campus. But, it’s now in a moment like this that the power of not knowing becomes critical,” said the Harvard student. Her stance comes at a time when Israel began bombing refugee camps in Rafah as well, after months of bombing Gaza since October last year (ever since Hamas launched an attack October 7), which many have termed as genocide. The killings in Palestine have also led to several protests across American universities, with students camping out in the open and demanding the US government to stop supporting Israel. “Maybe, we don’t know what it’s like to be ethnically targeted. Maybe, we don’t know what it’s like to come face to face with violence and death. But, we don’t have to know. Solidarity is not dependent on what we know. Because, not knowing is an ethical stance,” she added. After her speech, over 1000 Harvard students walked out in solidarity with the 13 students.",

        "description": "Papua New Guinea orders evacuations after landslide, thousands feared buried",
        "content": "Listen to Story Thousands of residents were ordered to evacuate from the path of a still-active landslide in Papua New Guinea by the government on Tuesday, after parts of a mountain collapsed, burying an initial estimate of more than 2,000 people. Relief teams in the Pacific nation have been trickling into the difficult-to-access northern Enga region since Friday though officials said the odds of finding survivors were slim. Residents said they have been using shovels and bare hands to search for survivors. \"The landslide area is very unstable. When we're up there, we're regularly hearing big explosions where the mountain is, there is still rocks and debris coming down,\" Enga province disaster committee chairperson Sandis Tsaka told Reuters. \"The landslide is still active, as people are digging through the rocks, more is still coming down.\" A state of emergency has been declared across the disaster zone and a neighbouring area, with a combined population of between 4,500 to 8,000, although not all have been ordered to evacuate yet, Tsaka said. Military personnel have set up checkpoints and are helping move residents to evacuation centres he said. Heavy equipment and aid has been slow to arrive because of the remote location, treacherous terrain and tribal unrest in the area forcing the military to escort the convoys of relief teams. Landslides Buried Thousands More than 2,000 people were buried in the landslide which occurred early Friday, according to the government. That is sharply higher than the initial estimates by the UN, which has put the possible deaths at more than 670. Former head of the local government Jiman Yandam estimated the dead at 162. Only five bodies have been recovered so far. The variance in the total number of possible deaths reflects the difficulty in getting an accurate population estimate. The mountainous nation's last credible census was in 2000 and a 2022 voter roll doesn't include those under 18. Tsaka declined to specify the total death toll saying he was not sure how many residents were in the area when the landslide occurred. \"From preliminary estimates, we expect it to be a significant number, in the hundreds and it could go beyond but at this point we'd like to be careful with the number,\" he said.",

        "description": "Enzo Maresca has had a superb season as Leicester boss and that has seen him linked with the Chelsea job",
        "content": "surprise announcement last week that would be leaving the club despite a strong finish to the season sent shockwaves through circles at the Stamford Bridge outfit - and it appears that the Blues have sourced their replacement, with David Ornstein of The Athletic suggesting that the Blues have been granted permission by to speak to Enzo Maresca to take over from the Argentine after he led the Foxes to promotion to the . Many wanted Pochettino to be sacked midway through last season with the Blues in 10th place at Christmas in the top-flight, though Todd Boehly kept faith in the former Tottenham manager. A strong 2024 saw the Blues lose just three games in the Premier League, with two of those being away to title challengers and - and a five-game winning streak to close the season out ensured European football at Stamford Bridge for next season. However, Pochettino was stunningly shown the exit last week to send the rumour mill into full swing; and it appears Chelsea have lined up their replacement with Maresca being granted permission to chat to the Blues. The report states that Leicester to become their next boss as the Blues gear up for another whirlwind summer under Todd Boehly. Chelsea made their official approach to the Foxes on Monday, with Stamford Bridge chiefs reportedly identifying Maresca as one of the 'leading candidates' to take on the role and succeed Pochettino at the helm following his 98-point season with Leicester in the Championship. The Italian will have discussions with Chelsea over a potential move, which is 'likely' to end up with a contract being agreed for a minimum of five years, given Maresca's age and perceived suitability to the way that Boehly wants his teams to play football. Enzo Maresca's Championship statistics - Leicester City squad ranking Wins 31 1st Losses 11 =3rd Goals scored 89 2nd Goals conceded 41 1st xG 91.39 1st Leicester will pick up a decent-sized compensation fee for Maresca, with the move expected to be completed this week - and whilst Ornstein hasn't named a fee, various reports have suggested that the for the young Italian coach. Kieran McKenna was considered as an option to come to the west London outfit though he remains , whilst Thomas Frank was also in the frame after being tipped to leave Brentford after five and a half years - though he will remain in west London at the Gtech Community Stadium for the time being, despite with Erik ten Hag’s future still up in the air. Maresca's stint at Leicester has been impressive, though there were a couple of question marks over their form at times last season. Leicester won 13 of their first 14 games in the Championship to signal what should have been an easy run to the automatic promotion spots, and having won , promotion seemed all but a formality heading into the second half of the campaign. But some poor form throughout February and March saw them win just one game in six, before two more losses to relegation chasers Millwall and Plymouth in early April opened the door up for Leeds and Ipswich to try to take full advantage with four games to go - which left them behind Ipswich and ahead of Leeds by just one point. Leicester finished on 98 points, two shy of being just the seventh side to achieve 100+ points in second-tier history. Of course, they ended up winning the league with a game to spare, but Chelsea fans will be wary that Maresca almost failed to achieve promotion after being 14 points clear at the end of October. One of Pep Guardiola's 'disciples', 44-year-old Maresca has Premier League experience having been Pep Guardiola's assistant manager in the 2022-23 season and having mastered his craft in the second tier, will get the chance to impress at Stamford Bridge should the move go through.",

        "description": "NNA - Belgium on Tuesday, May 28, committed to delivering 30 F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine by 2028, to help Kyiv battle Russia#39;s invasion, at the start of a visit by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. The pledge was made as part of a bilateral security and long-term support accord signed by Zelensky and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, the latest in a string of similar Ukrainian accords with Western allies.The bilateral security agreement, Zelensky said, quot;includes at least euro;977 million in Belgian military aid to Ukraine this year,quot; in addition to a commitment of support over the next 10 years. quot;For the first time, such an agreement specifies the exact number of F-16 fighter jets ndash; 30 ndash; that will be delivered to Ukraine until 2028,quot; Zelensky wrote on X.Zelensky said the first aircraft would be quot;arriving already this yearquot; ndash; though Belgium#39;s Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib was more cautious, saying earlier that quot;we hope deliveries will start at the end of this year.quot;Spain, a day earlier, pledged euro;1 billion in military aid as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Zelensky signed their own security deal in Madrid.Belgium had previously pledged to supply F-16 aircraft to Kyiv as part of a broader initiative by European allies.

        "content": "NNA - Belgium on Tuesday, May 28, committed to delivering 30 F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine by 2028, to help Kyiv battle Russia's invasion, at the start of a visit by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. The pledge was made as part of a bilateral security and long-term support accord signed by Zelensky and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, the latest in a string of similar Ukrainian accords with Western allies. The bilateral security agreement, Zelensky said, \"includes at least €977 million in Belgian military aid to Ukraine this year,\" in addition to a commitment of support over the next 10 years. \"For the first time, such an agreement specifies the exact number of F-16 fighter jets – 30 – that will be delivered to Ukraine until 2028,\" Zelensky wrote on X. Zelensky said the first aircraft would be \"arriving already this year\" – though Belgium's Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib was more cautious, saying earlier that \"we hope deliveries will start at the end of this year.\" Spain, a day earlier, pledged €1 billion in military aid as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Zelensky signed their own security deal in Madrid. Belgium had previously pledged to supply F-16 aircraft to Kyiv as part of a broader initiative by European allies.

        "description": "Mexico's government says a museum mishandled a 19th century mummified body, resulting in one of its arms coming off.",
        "content": "Mexico City — Mexico's federal archaeology agency on Monday accused the conservative-governed city of Guanajuato of mistreating one of the country's famous mummified 19th century bodies. The National Institute of Anthropology and History, INAH, said that during recent renovations at the museum where the mummified bodies are on permanent display, the arm of one of the mummies, well, came off. One might think the complaint is all about the dignified treatment of corpses buried around the early 1800s and dug up starting in the 1860s because their families could no longer pay burial fees. But in fact, the mummies have been in a somewhat grisly display in glass cases in a museum in Guanajuato, the capital of the state of the same name, and toted around to tourism fairs for decades. Some were exhibited in the United States in 2009. Mummies are displayed in the Mummy Museum in Guanajuato, Mexico, in November 2008. Daniel Jayo / AP What appears to be at the root of the latest dispute is a turf battle between the INAH, which believes it has jurisdiction over the mummies because it says they are \"national patrimony,\" and Guanajuato, which considers them a tourist attraction. The state and city are governed by the conservative National Action Party, which the Morena party - which holds power at the federal level - considers its arch enemy. On Monday, the institute said it would demand an accounting of what permits and procedures were followed during the museum renovations. \"These events confirm that the way the museum's collection was moved is not the correct one, and that far from applying proper corrective and conservation strategies, the actions carried out resulted in damages, not only to this body,\" the institute wrote in a statement. It didn't say what, if any, other bits of mummies had fallen off. \"It appears that this situation is related to a lack of knowledge about proper protocols and the lack of training of the personnel in charge of carrying out these tasks,\" it continued. The Guanajuato city government didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. How the bodies met their fate The preserved corpses were unintentionally mummified when they were buried in crypts in a dry, mineral-rich soil environment in the mining state of Guanajuato. Some still have hair, leathery skin and their original clothing. The institute appeared to be miffed because personnel in Guanajuato, not the institute's own staff, are in charge of the approximately 100 mummies. In part because they were mostly dug up before the institute was founded in 1939, they remain under local control, something that has rankled federal officials in the past. In 2023, experts from the institute complained that a traveling display of mummies could pose a health risk to the public, because one of the mummies appeared to have fungal growths. It's not the first time that the extremity of a long-dead person becomes a national political issue. In 1989, the Mexican government weathered a wave of criticism after it removed the arm of revolutionary Gen. Álvaro Obregón - severed in battle in 1915 - after being displayed in a jar of formaldehyde in a marble monument for a half-century. Visitors said it had become \"unsightly,\" so the arm was incinerated and buried. In 1838, Antonio López de Santa Anna, who served as president of Mexico 11 times, lost his leg in battle — and had it buried with honors. By 1844, an angry crowd that accused him of treason dragged the leg through the streets of Mexico City and apparently destroyed it.

        "content": "Corbin Bleu still knows how to jump in. Seventeen years ago, the High School Musical alum made his independent mark in the Disney Channel Original Movie universe with his jump-rope-based movie, Jump In , alongside Keke Palmer. However, the actor and singer, now 35, proved he’s still got the moves by sharing a video of him double-dutching – a jump rope skill played with two skipping ropes moving in opposite directions. Taking to his Instagram on Sunday, May 26, Bleu stirred up nostalgia with the clip set to the movie’s hit track, Push It to the Limit, with the text, “POV: It’s been 17 years since you Jumped In.” He further revealed in the caption, “Double Dutch in between shows outside of our theatre!” referring to the ongoing performances of hos Off-Broadway revival of Little Shops of Horrors . “Can’t believe it’s been almost 20 years since I’ve done this,” he expressed. In the hit 2007 DCOM film, Bleu played teenage boxer Izzy Daniels, who discovers his love for jump-rope after filling in a spot on his friend Mary Thomas’s (played by Palmer) team. In a 2022 interview with Business Insider , Jump In’s director Paul Hoen called Bleu and Palmer two “of the most talented physical actors.” “What’s just so amazing with that group of actors is that they could do all the jump roping. It’s amazingly hard, and all the tricks, they were completely into those and learning how to do them,” Hoen said.",
