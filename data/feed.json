It’s NAIDOC Week – the annual event which grew from the first observances of the National Day of Mourning event to a week-long recognition of the history, culture, and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.Across the country, schools run themed assemblies, while education content providers fall over themselves to push NAIDOC-branded classroom resources. Public transport operators, local councils, community groups, and corporate organisations all join in, blanketing the week with promotional collateral – each seemingly competing to outdo the others in symbolic virtue.Annual slogans are framed around sovereignty and land rights and political reform and activism. This year’s slogan to assist in the social engineering crusade is:‘The Next Generation: Strength, Vision & Legacy.’There are wristbands, posters that promote treaty and sovereignty, and worksheet activities that walk children through concepts such as ‘invasion’ and ‘decolonisation’, promoting a grievance-based narrative that casts Aboriginal Australians as perpetual victims and others as oppressors – fostering division and resentment, not understanding.And this saturation is not limited to NAIDOC Week alone. In addition to NAIDOC week, there is National Reconciliation Week and Sorry Day, as well as a range of other individual days scheduled in the calendar.In educational settings, promotion of these named days comes in addition to a cross-curriculum priority in the National...",

The July 4 “organized attack,” according to a DOJ news release, unfolded just after 10:30 p.m. at the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, a town of about 6,200 residents some 28 miles south of Ft. Worth. Authorities said the defendants, all dressed in black military-style clothing, were equipped with body armor, two-way radios and firearms, including AR-style rifles recovered at the scene. About ten minutes after assembling outside the facility, two of the individuals reportedly peeled away from the main group and tagged several vehicles and a guard structure with graffiti, spray painting the word “traitor” and the phrase “ICE Pig” federal and individuals’ property. This allegedly occurred as other members of the group shot fireworks at the facility itself.

        "content": "Former Democrat Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama tried their best to get Americans interested in electric vehicles by offering generous tax credits and cash to get old clunkers off the road and replace them with more energy-efficient transportation.While the $7,500 tax credit enacted under Biden is set to expire in September, the program has been relatively successful.Related: Tesla's biggest rival slashes prices but faces major pushbackU.S. automakers sold 300,000 new electric vehicles in the first quarter, an 11.4% year-over-year increase, according to data from Kelley Blue Book.But while overall EV sales are increasing, Tesla's market share is decreasing due to increased competition. Tesla sales in the U.S. peaked in spring 2023 when it sold 173,000 EVs, according to Cox Automotive data. The company sold just 128,000 in Q1 2025, a 26% decline from its peak, taking its overall U.S. market share down from 5% to 3%.(Sales differ from deliveries. Deliveries involve the physical transaction of a vehicle to its owner, while sales involve the financial transaction. Tesla delivered 336,681 vehicles in Q1 2025, a 13% year-over-year decline.)But as rough as Tesla's last few months have been in the U.S., it is facing a similar road ahead in China due to many of the same obstacles.

Fue el primer extrabases de Harper desde que regresó de la lista de lesionados el 30 de junio. Fue su primer bambinazo desde el 3 de junio.Luego Harper dio un doblete hacia la banda contraria y anotó en el sexto episodio para ampliar la ventaja a 3-0. Dio dos dobles hacia la banda contraria en un ataque de siete carreras en el octavo capítulo. Fue la primera vez desde el 10 de septiembre que Harper daba tres extrabases en un compromiso.Harper dio varios swings buenos el lunes. Ha estado contento con sus turnos últimamente, incluso si no han resultado en imparables. Pero la jornada del miércoles afirmó que todo parece marchar por el camino correcto, lo que obviamente es importante porque al conjunto de Filadelfia le hacía falta el impacto del bate de Harper y lo necesitan para seguir avanzando en la segunda mitad.La ofensiva de los Filis es...",

        "content": "KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — Over the last decade, an array of Texas state and local agencies missed opportunities to fund a flood warning system intended to avert a disaster like the one that killed dozens of young campers and scores of others in Kerr County on the Fourth of July. The agencies repeatedly failed to secure roughly $1 million for a project to better protect the county’s 50,000 residents and thousands of youth campers and tourists who spend time along the Guadalupe River in an area known as “flash-flood alley.” The plan, which would have installed flood monitoring equipment near Camp Mystic, cost about as much as the county spends on courthouse security every two years, or 1.5% of its annual budget.

Down 3-2 after five innings, the Rays scored four times in the sixth and Caminero led off the seventh with his 22nd homer — a blast over the Detroit bullpen in left. The Rays broke it open against reliever Chase Lee in the sixth. With two out and a runner on second, Lee replaced Brant Hurter (4-1) and allowed four straight run-scoring hits, including doubles by Ha-Seong Kim and Danny Jansen. The Tigers loaded the bases in the seventh, but Garrett Cleavinger struck out Riley Greene to end the inning. Zack Littell (8-7) allowed three runs in 5 2/3 innings for the Rays. The biggest cheer came after the top of the first inning when the Tigers announced that Zach McKinstry had been selected an All-Star reserve, giving Detroit five representatives. The Tigers last had six in 2013. Detroit's Gleyber Torres doubled in the fourth to extend his on-base streak to 22 games — the longest active streak in the majors. It matched his career high, done twice for the New York Yankees, most recently last August. Tampa Bay travels to Boston to start a four-game series. RHP Taj Bradley (5-6. 4.79) was scheduled to start Thursday against Boston's RHP Walker Buehler. The Tigers are off Thursday before starting a home series with Seattle on Friday.

(AP) — The news on Athletics shortstop Jacob Wilson's injured left hand was much better than feared, however his status for Tuesday's All-Star Game is uncertain. “That's the question I can't answer right now,” manager Mark Kotsay said before Wednesday's game against the Atlanta Braves. “Its day to day. We hope to get him back before that. Today's a day where there's soreness. The positive is that he can put a bat in his hand.” Wilson, the first fan-elected rookie starting All-Star shortstop, was hit on the hand in the first inning of Tuesday night's 10-1 victory over the Braves . X-rays were negative for a broken bone, so the A's were relieved that Wilson shouldn't be out of the lineup long. He is batting .335 with nine home runs and 42 RBIs. “I think we escaped with Jacob yesterday,” Kotsay said. \"Any time someone takes one in the hand, it could've been worse.\" Wilson, selected sixth in the 2023 amateur draft, was the leading candidate for AL Rookie of the Year, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, before the injury. Now he's second, one spot ahead of teammate Nick Kurtz. “It's a big sigh of relief for sure,” Wilson said after the game. “The anxiety of waiting the 15, 20 minutes after it happened. Nothing was broken. It could've been a lot worse, so everything's good.\" Also, A's utility player Miguel Andujar was removed from the 10-day injured list, and outfielder Colby Thomas was sent to Triple-A Las Vegas. Andujar was hitting .296 with three homers and...",

Filmmaker James Gunn hopes the beloved superhero will bring hope to a cynical world. “Superman,” which flies into theaters nationwide Thursday, is a bit of a change in tone for the writer and director who brought a mischievous playfulness and snark to the chaotic worlds of “Suicide Squad” and the “Guardians of the Galaxy.\" The film is threaded with optimism and what it means to be inherently good as audiences watch the metahuman save the day. Gunn doesn’t just focus on Superman’s humanity but highlights the importance of truth and the power of journalism to fight against injustice. Burna Boy's 'No Sign of Weakness' fulfills his rock star dreams NEW YORK (AP) — Afrobeats megastar Burna Boy is releasing his new album, “No Sign of Weakness,” on Friday. The Grammy-winning artist is bringing his own rock star dreams to life with features from Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, country hitmaker Shaboozey and hip-hop heavyweight Travis Scott on the 16-track album.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu was cut Wednesday by the New York Yankees with almost $22 million remaining on his contract, one day after the two-time batting champion got demoted to the bench. “It's been a tough couple days. Some hard conversations,\" manager Aaron Boone said before New York's game against the Seattle Mariners. \"But in the end, feel like this is the right thing to do at this time.\" LeMahieu, who turns 37 on Sunday, was designated for assignment and fellow infielder Jorbit Vivas was recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. New York has seven days to trade or release LeMahieu, or send him outright to the minors — an assignment he would have the right to refuse in favor of free agency. It's very unlikely another team would claim LeMahieu off waivers because he's still owed $21,612,903 from the $90 million, six-year deal he signed with the Yankees prior to the 2021 season. New York must pay him $6,612,903 for the rest of this season and $15 million in 2026. “Tough decisions,\" general manager Brian Cashman said. \"It ultimately comes down to how this roster sits and what’s best. You want to provide your manager with enough chess moves.” LeMahieu, a three-time All-Star, was batting .266 with two homers, 12 RBIs and a .674 OPS. He made his season debut May 13 after recovering from a left calf strain and had a .310 average in his last 31 games since June 1. A versatile defender in the past, LeMahieu has made all 35 of his starts at second base this year — even...",

Then he made certain he left a lasting impression in the ninth inning by ranging into the outfield grass to pounce on a hard hit ground ball by Johnny Ascanio and throwing on the run in time to retire the Dayton Dragon as the Sky Carp took the second game of the six-game homestand 5-1. “That play is just instinct,” said Miller, who had six assists in the game. “You see the ball and go get it and just fire a throw.” In the first inning, Miller stepped to the plate after Colby Shade had led off with a single and stole second and third before Garret Forrester and Eric Rataczak walked with two outs. Dayton replaced starter Luke Hayden (1-5) after just 29 pitches, bringing on reliever Graham Osman. “I was just looking to hit the ball hard somewhere and hopefully find a gap,” Miller said about his three-run double to center. “I was hoping for a fastball and that’s what I got.” That key hit gave Beloit starter and winner Will Schomberg (2-4) a nice 3-0 cushion. He was sharp from the opening pitch, taking a no-hitter into the fifth inning and then retiring the first two Dragons. Ascanio did coax a walk and Ariel Almonte collected Dayton’s first hit to send Ascanio to third. Diego Omana walked to load the bases and Schomberg lost his shutout when he drilled Victor Acosta with a pitch to force in a...",

But Rojas says it's necessary because the fear of being apprehended and possibly deported has swept communities, including Catholic churches. “There is a real fear gripping many in our parish communities that if they venture out into any kind of public setting they will be arrested by immigration officers,\" Rojas said in a statement Wednesday. “Sadly, that includes attending Mass. The recent apprehension of individuals at two of our Catholic parishes has only intensified that fear.

The multistep processes that have inspired people to spend endless amounts of time sudsing up can harm your skin — and the environment . Dermatologists say it's all mostly unnecessary. “Your skin is a barrier,” said Dr. Nicole Negbenebor, a dermatologic surgeon at University of Iowa Health Care. “It’s one of the biggest barriers you have. It’s you in your natural elements. So you want to treat it right, and then sometimes there can be too much of a good thing.” Here's what to know about how to take a basic shower and indicators that you've gone too far with your routine. The basics of showering A shower is a relatively simple routine that usually doesn't require 10 steps or a plethora of products. A daily shower with lukewarm water and a fragrance-free hypoallergenic cleanser — followed by hydrating lotion or oil afterward — will do the trick. Don't plan to stay in the shower too long or turn the water temperature too high — it can strip your skin of the natural oils it needs to maintain its barrier, leaving it vulnerable to dryness and irritation. When it comes to soaps, use one meant for sensitive skin. Antibacterial soaps are popular, but experts said they dry out your skin...",

Similar guidance memos are issued around this time every year. But the state is facing “a different scenario than we have seen in the past several years,” division Administrator Lori Wolff wrote in the latest memo, which Idaho Education News obtained through a public records request.

That means the state will have less revenue than projected in fiscal year 2027 and in future years, Wolff wrote in the memo. Wolff told agency directors that budgets relying on state general fund dollars will be limited to “maintenance” spending.

I’d write ‘rock star,’” said the Afrobeats giant. “One of my teachers asked me, ‘What do rock stars do?’ I didn’t really know what to say.” These days, the Grammy winner’s music talks for him.

Among them, counselors and 27 girls at a summer camp who went missing early Friday when the Guadalupe River burst its banks. Five campers and one counselor from Camp Mystic were still missing as of Wednesday, along with another child not associated with the camp, Leitha said. Two dozen other people have been confirmed dead elsewhere in the state, according to an AFP tally of official reports. More than 2,000 rescue personnel, police and experts have descended on the flood zone in what Leitha described as an \"all hands on deck\" operation. Ben Baker, with the Texas Game Wardens, said search and rescue efforts involving helicopters, drones and dogs were difficult because of the water, mud and debris. \"When we're trying to make these recoveries, these large piles can be very obstructive, and to get in deep into these...",

The agencies repeatedly failed to secure roughly $1 million for a project to better protect the county’s 50,000 residents and thousands of youth campers and tourists who spend time along the Guadalupe River in an area known as “flash-flood alley.” The plan, which would have installed flood monitoring equipment near Camp Mystic, cost about as much as the county spends on courthouse security every two years, or 1.5% of its annual budget. Meanwhile, other communities had moved ahead with sirens and warning systems of their own. In nearby Comfort, a long, flat-three minute warning sound signifying flood danger helped evacuate the town of 2,000 people as practiced. A deadly 2015 Memorial Day flood in Kerr County rekindled debate over whether to install a flood monitoring system and sirens to alert the public to evacuate when the river rose to dangerous levels. Some officials, cognizant of a 1987 flood that killed eight people on a church camp bus, thought it was finally time. But the idea soon ran into opposition. Some residents and elected officials opposed the installation of sirens, citing the cost and noise that they feared would result from repeated alarms. County commissioners sought compromise.

The surprise meeting with leaders of Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau follows the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development . The Trump administration has switched from “a charity-based foreign aid model” to partnerships showing that other nations have “the ability and willingness to help themselves.” A study published in the Lancet medical journal projects Trump’s shift will lead to more than 14 million additional deaths globally by 2030, including 4.5 million children. West Africa possesses untapped resources. They’re also among countries that might fall under an expansion of Trump’s travel ban. The Latest: Trump sets 50% tariff on goods from Brazil over treatment of Bolsonaro Trump called the South American country an “international disgrace” for the treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump singled out Brazil Wednesday in a letter shared on his Truth Social platform, accusing Brazil of waging a “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro, whom Trump described him as a “Highly Respected Leader.” The former president is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. The fiery language in Trump’s letter stood out from the standard form letters sent to other trading partners on Wednesday.

        "content": "PHOENIX — An officer who shot and killed an alleged kidnapping suspect in Peoria did not activate his body camera before the shooting, according to new information released by the Glendale Police Department. A Peoria police officer shot and killed Matthew Cardon on June 5 after he allegedly tried to kidnap a woman and her child who were walking in a neighborhood. Video from a neighbor's surveillance camera showed Cardon following the woman, who was pushing a stroller, before she screamed after walking out of the camera's view. Cardon could then be seen running in the opposite direction. Police arrived within minutes and pursued Cardon into a nearby cul-de-sac. Surveillance and cellphone footage captured the tense moments that followed, including officers issuing commands for Cardon to stop, followed by multiple gunshots. Cardon did not survive his injuries. RELATED: Police said a man tried to kidnap a woman and her baby before they shot and killed him. His brother says he was unarmed and 'didn't deserve to die.' On Wednesday, the Glendale Police Department, which is investigating the shooting as part of the West Valley Investigative Response Team, said it has completed its investigation and it has been turned over to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office for review. The case will not include body camera footage from the officer. \"During our investigation, we learned that due to the chaotic and rapidly evolving nature of the scene, the officer did not have the opportunity to...",

Speaking during the inauguration ceremony held in Abuja on Wednesday, Keyamo stressed that the board’s role is not merely administrative but transformational, tasked with delivering tangible progress in line with President Bola Tinubu’s economic agenda.In his address, the Minister outlined the core expectations of the Federal Government, urging the board members to prioritise safety and security, champion sustainable development, enhance passengers’ travel experience, and build strong, cooperative relationships both within FAAN and across the broader aviation ecosystem. He reminded the new board that their stewardship would directly impact not only the aviation sector but also the national image and economy. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1718806029429-0'); }); “As you embark on this new chapter, remember that the eyes of the nation are upon you,” Keyamo declared. “The success of FAAN is not measured merely by financial growth but by the impact it has on the lives of ordinary Nigerians.

The hiker is the same height and about the same weight as Decker, according to a news release from the U.S. Marshals Service District of Idaho. He also has dark features, a beard, and tattoos on his arm and calf, like Decker. The man was cooperative with investigators and said he was hiking int he Bear Creek area last weekend, the release said. “United States Marshal Brent Bunn is grateful for the public’s assistance with this fugitive investigation,” the release stated. In May, Decker’s three daughters, ages 5, 8 and 9, did not return from a visitation trip with him; they were found dead near a Washington campground. In a news release Sunday, officials warned the public in Idaho not to approach or interact with Decker if they thought they spotted him, and asked for public help, particularly from people who had been recreating in the Sawtooths over the previous 24 hours.

Noem made the comments at a FEMA review meeting, seeking to contrast the performance of the agency under their predecessor with its performance in the devastating Texas Hill Country flooding, which has left more people dead than are killed on average in the United States from an entire year of hurricanes. “After the wildfires in Maui, residents voiced concerns that every FEMA employee that they spoke with had different answers,” said Noem. “None of them had conversations that resulted in getting assistance that was helpful or any clarity in their situations. The situation in Lahaina was so bad that one in six survivors were forced to trade sexual favors, other favors for just basic supplies.” When Politico reached out for citations, DHS \" sent a May press release containing a link to the report. The study, conducted by Tagnawa, which describes itself as a 'Filipino feminist disaster response organization' based in Hawaii, surveyed 70 female Filipino fire survivors and found that 16 percent of those surveyed — roughly one in six — engaged in 'survival sex in exchange for basic necessities post-disaster,'\" said the report. \"The study found that women had 'survival sex'...",

Menanggapi kontroversi tersebut, Dhani menegaskan bahwa unggahannya bukan bentuk dendam pribadi, melainkan pembuktian kepada publik. “Kita lihat nanti aja. Kita lihat apakah Maia akan membantah atau tidak,\" ujar Ahmad Dhani di kawasan Menteng Jakarta Pusat, Rabu (9/7/2025). \"Kalau tidak bantah, berarti bukan fitnah,” lanjut Dhani. Ia menegaskan bahwa video itu dibuat sebagai respons terhadap berbagai narasi yang selama ini berkembang di masyarakat, bukan sebagai serangan langsung. “Gak ada dendam, ini pembuktian ke masyarakat,” ungkapnya. Dhani menilai jika tidak ada klarifikasi atau bantahan dari pihak Maia, maka ia menyimpulkan bahwa isi video tersebut bisa dianggap sebagai kebenaran. “Kalau tidak ada balasan dari Maia kalau itu fitnah, saya lempar bola nih nah kalau nggak ada balasan berarti itu bukan fitnah,” terangnya. Ahmad Dhani mengunggah dua video di channel Youtubenya yang dengan lantang memberikan judul bahwa video itu berisi fitnah . Isi video tersebut sebagaian besar adalah konflik masa lalu Dhani dengan Maia ketika mereka masih bersama dan dalam proses cerai.",

A residential development proposed in Dallas could be a small step toward reversing a trend of low single-family permitting levels in the city. Arlington-based homebuilding giant D.R. Horton aims to construct a relatively small single-family community on a roughly 28-acre property bounded by Bonnie View Road, Southerland Avenue and Arrow Road. The development will feature 126 lots and about 6 acres of open green space , according to a conceptual plan submitted to the city. The Dallas City Plan Commission will consider the residential project during its July 10 meeting. The City of Dallas is actively working to increase the supply of housing, including single-family homes, through various incentives and policy changes. Some of the incentives to encourage developers to build communities for more affordable homes include tax abatements and development grants. The city has also worked in recent years to streamline the building permitting process. The 25-story Winners Tower will also appear before the commissioners. The $240 million mixed-use high-rise will feature luxury condos, small business offices and a hotel. This also comes a few months after the City of Dallas launched DallasNow , a new land management system seeking to simplify, modernize and potentially accelerate the permitting and zoning process following complaints from...",

Di tengah gegap gempita Jakarta Fair Kemayoran (JFK) 2025, satu pemandangan unik kembali muncul dan menyita perhatian antrean panjang warga yang memborong camilan dalam jumlah besar, bahkan tak jarang dengan harga fantastis hingga jutaan rupiah.

Di area hall makanan dan minuman, deretan booth snack dan makanan ringan lokal dan impor selalu ramai dikerubungi pembeli. Tidak hanya sekadar membeli sebungkus dua bungkus, banyak dari mereka terlihat mengangkut belanjaan dalam jumlah besar kardus, tas jinjing jumbo, bahkan koper beroda yang biasa dipakai untuk traveling.

As evidence of this, she points out four investigations that have been launched concerning some of his companies. In our society, a person is innocent until proven guilty. None of the issues mentioned in her letter have led to a conviction of Musk. She conveniently does not mention anything about NeuroLink or Starlink, probably because they’re clearly beneficial for mankind, and therefore do not fit into her preconceived notion that Musk is greedy. So I stand by my previous conclusion that Musk is a great humanitarian and scientific visionary (“Musk is the man,” Letters, May 22). I should point out that I did not say that he was perfect. Nobody is, and I am sure that being human, he has many flaws. However, no one in the 21st century has done more to advance the human condition than he has. Before we seek to criticize him, we should ask ourselves what have I done in my life that even vaguely compares to what he has achieved? Please don’t say that if you had his money, you would have done better because you did nothing to achieve his level of wealth. Michael Gallagher Forest Hills",

        "content": "A Manhattan man on June 27 was convicted of two counts of attempted murder and other charges for shooting at two NYPD officers in 2011, the Queens District Attorney’s Office announced last Tuesday. According to the charges, on Dec. 11, 2011, at approximately 3:45 p.m., NYPD Officers Stephen Danisi and Matthew Ferrara were on foot patrol in the vicinity of 37-55 76th St. in Jackson Heights when they were alerted about a suspicious man wearing a long trench coat, fedora, eyeglasses and a fake mustache and fake beard. When the officers spotted the defendant, Antonio Olmeda, 66, he had his hands in his pockets. They asked him to remove his hands and he refused. Danisi placed his hands on Olmeda’s back, the charges said, and felt that the defendant was wearing a bulletproof vest underneath the trench coat. Olmeda freed himself from the officer’s hand, stepped away from the cops and turned around to reveal a .38-caliber Taurus revolver, according to the DA. Olemda fired three rounds in the direction of the officers. One round penetrated the window of a nearby pediatric dentist’s office. As the defendant fled, he discarded his fedora, mustache, beard, eyeglasses and hat, which were recovered and swabbed for DNA, the charges said. The DNA matched a sample on file from Olmeda’s previous weapon possession conviction. More than one week later, on Dec. 19, 2011, Olmeda was apprehended as he tried to enter his vehicle on East 16th Street in Manhattan. A .38-caliber revolver with two live...",

There are individuals and institutions that help mitigate said behavior and bring much-needed levity and happiness to life. The Flushing Meadow Aquatic Center, even with its imperfections, has provided adults and children alike a venue where joy prevails. The adult class, which I attend, is mostly seniors from all walks of life who have found a common space that enhances not only their health but their quality of life. The very well attended classes average 50-plus participants per session. Our instructor Consuelo greets everyone with a smile and is the most solicitous of individuals with special needs, making certain they feel comfortable and included, which sets the tone for a wonderful morning. Unfortunately, on June 20 we were told that we should call the following week as possible schedule changes could take place. Well, since that day all adult and children classes have been canceled, and the calendar for the next couple of weeks states only lap swim. Queens is fortunate to have such an amazing resource in its midst but, unfortunately, it is so poorly managed. Although this has occurred in the past, I was hopeful that the new management would have better planning skills. I have reached out to the mayor, Queens borough president and parks commissioner, as well as two nonprofit media outlets, but my efforts have fallen on...",

Mayor Adams and Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez on July 7 unveiled the new Department of Sustainable Delivery, an enforcement-focused division within the DOT aimed at regulating the growing use of e-bikes, e-scooters and mopeds tied to app-based delivery services. The department will conduct enforcement against illegal moped, e-bike and e-scooter riding; oversee safety compliance; crack down on reckless riding; and hold delivery apps accountable for setting unsafe expectations for their workers, the city said. The DSD, backed by $6.1 million in funding from the city’s 2026 budget and housed within the DOT, will hire up to 45 peace officers trained to issue moving violations and enforce commercial cycling laws. The officers will be unarmed and work in teams, including units on e-bikes, targeting high-risk areas across the city. They will work in conjunction with the NYPD and the DOT’s Vision Zero Street Team. “Our administration continues to make the safety of every New Yorker our number one priority, and that includes keeping everyone on our streets safe, including pedestrians and bicyclists,” Adams said. He added that the new department is “yet another step that we’re taking to support delivery workers, keep pedestrians safe, and hold delivery app companies accountable for placing...",

According to Gov. Hochul’s office, as of September 2024, more than 2.5 million children under the age of 18 in the state are enrolled in Medicaid and Child Health Plus. With the bill’s sweeping cuts to Medicaid, some are concerned about the impact on students. Councilmember Lynn Schulman (D-Forest Hills), a member of the Education Committee, in a statement said that as a result of the bill’s passing, the ability to get a good education “will be greatly diminished.” Schulman said, “Out kids get one chance at a good education. ... This budget bill will do a lot of damage to New Yorkers, from a severe reduction of funds for healthcare to taking crucial funds from public schools that help underserved communities and students with disabilities.” She continued, “At a time when we should be investing in public education, supporting immigrant families, and ensuring every child has the resources to succeed, this bill does the opposite ... I stand firmly with our students, educators, and families in opposing these short-sighted measures and will work with my colleagues to ensure all students get the education they deserve.” Councilmember Shekar Krishnan (D-Jackson Heights), also a member of the Education Committee, in a statement said, “To pay for a massive tax cut for the wealthy, Donald Trump...",

But the federal spending bill passed by the U.S. House and Senate last week and signed by President Trump could cause some problems down the road. U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-Manhattan) is the only New York State representative on either the House or Senate Transportation Committees. And while it is still early in the process, Nadler is preparing for the possibility of a transportation turf war. “This bill was just signed into law, and the agencies still have to act on it,” a senior Nadler staffer told the Chronicle. “There are no direct funding cuts to New York, but there are some dangers.” One, he said, is that the reconciliation bill signed by Trump sets topping caps on non-defense spending. With New York City transportation programs and projects relying on non-defense appropriations, those dollars could become less available in the future. “It’s not just are people competing for slices of a smaller pie,” the senior staffer said. “Capital investment grants are funds that the Second Avenue subway and other projects rely heavily on. So caps could lead to reduced investment grants, and less funding available for transportation. But we’re going to fight very hard for that, and the other cuts in general.” The cuts also include many parts of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, also known as the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs...",

At the outset I acknowledged that process is power and that responsive process is accountable power. I cited the recently introduced Queens Bus Network Redesign, which, no matter how well intended, represents such a colossal failure of government that it undermines democracy itself, not to mention public trust. Where were local NYC Council members in getting the word out about this once-in-a-lifetime change? Where was the entire Queens County Delegation, state and federal, in communicating block-by-block, route-by-route news of the impending extraordinary change? Where were all the Queens-based community boards? No question some attention was paid by the three aforementioned groupings, but it clearly was not sufficiently comprehensive and thoughtful to effectively achieve intended goals. Yes, the Queens borough president did yeoman community engagement sessions, as did the MTA. Sadly it wasn’t enough. It’s time to get the MTA assistant director(s) and directors of government and community relations out of their Manhattan offices and into the streets. What good is a “faster, more reliable, more connected” bus network if you don’t even know where you can board, let alone disembark? Of course there will always be workarounds required for every new initiative, especially one of this scope, but as it now stands, it’s not moving; it’s stalled and is...",

Hochul took time out over the weekend to declare the Manhattan tolling program a hit. “Six months in, it’s clear: congestion pricing has been a huge success, making life in New York better,” Hochul said in a press release from her office. “In New York, we dare to do big things, and this program represents just that — traffic is down throughout the region, business is booming, transit ridership is up, and we are making historic upgrades to our transit system. We’ve also fended off five months of unlawful attempts from the federal government to unwind this successful program and will keep fighting — and winning — in the courts. The cameras are staying on.” Her last sentence has repeatedly been directed to President Trump and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy since before Feb. 21, which was the first of multiple deadlines Duffy has set for the state to end the tolls. Hochul said it is on a pace to bring in more than $500 million for the MTA this calender year, and that traffic delays and air pollution have been reduced. Congestion pricing went into effect on Jan. 5. On top of the $9 for cars entering Manhattan at or south of 60th Street, trucks pay $24 to $32, depending on their size. Drivers without an E-ZPass pay more. The aim is to set a steady revenue stream for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and to allow it to borrow $15 billion. The one-way toll will go to $12 in 2028 and $15 in...",

Since the Citywide Doula Initiative was launched in 2022, the program has served 3,245 people and there were no maternal deaths for program participants, according to City Hall. Last year alone, the initiative surpassed its goal to serve 1,000 participants giving birth a year and served 1,128 clients. Additionally, there has been a 25 percent increase in doula coverage for city residents overall from 2022 — the first full year of data collection — to 2024, said the Mayor’s Office. The initiative accounted for nearly half of all doula-attended births in disinvested neighborhoods in 2024 and served a large proportion of women of color, shelter residents, and non-English speakers, resulting in better maternal health outcomes for Black women. Studies have found that Black, non-Hispanic women were four times more likely to die of a “pregnancy-associated” cause, such as pregnancy complications, and six times more likely to die of a “pregnancy-related” cause, such as postpartum suicide or overdose, than their white counterparts. About 61 percent of clients were Black or a mixed-race Black person in 2024, 44 percent identified as Hispanic or Latina combined with another race and 22 percent were...",

The budget reconciliation legislation, which was signed into law July 4, will reduce federal Medicaid spending by around $1 trillion, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on major national healthcare issues. The BBB Act mandates that able-bodied adults who are eligible for Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act meet work and reporting requirements; it repeals former President Biden administration’s rule simplifying eligibility and renewal processes; it establishes a moratorium on new or increased provider taxes and reduces existing provider taxes in expansion states; it revises the payment limit for state directed payments; and increases the frequency of eligibility redeterminations for the ACA expansion group, said the KFF. New York State would have about $120 billion fewer federal funds over the course of a decade toward Medicaid. The National Council on Aging said the law would make life more difficult for older Americans, especially 27 million who already cannot afford their basic living needs. The NCA said the work requirements for the program harms older Americans who depend on Medicaid for healthcare and cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program under the law will exacerbate senior hunger.

According to the NYPD, at approximately 6 a.m., a BMW 428i, driven by Noah Thompson, 24, was traveling eastbound on the Belt Parkway approaching the Nassau Expressway when Thompson failed to navigate the roadway near Exit 17 at Cross Bay Boulevard. Thompson’s BMW collided with the median divider, cops said, and entered the westbound lanes of the Belt, where it crashed into a Honda CRV and a Hyundai Tuscon. Photos of the scene taken shortly after the crash and later uploaded to social media show the BMW engulfed in flames and the Tuscon, totaled. EMS transported all three drivers to One Brooklyn Health-Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, police said. The operators of the Honda, a 44-year-old male, and the Hyundai, a 34-year-old female, were in stable condition, police said. Thompson was initially listed in critical condition, but later died at the hospital. Other passengers in the BMW — a 21-year-old female and two males, 25 and 29 — were transported to Brookdale in stable condition. But Jewel Perez, 22, also one of Thompson’s passengers, succumbed to critical injuries at the hospital, police said. Perez on a GoFundMe page started by her brother was described as a “loving, energetic mother who dreamed of entering the medical field so she could help others the way she always helped others.” The fundraiser, at gofund.me/00508204, says...",

        "content": "There was a time, not too long ago, when the reductions in violent crime in the city became so great they were getting difficult to believe. “Murder is down to the levels of the early 1960s” we were told, and soon it was “Murder is at the lowest levels since reliable statistics have been kept.” New York became “the safest big city in the country.” Then something happened, or a couple of somethings, and the trend was reversed for a few years. Now, the stats are moving in the right direction again, and once again we’re entering territory we haven’t been in for generations. Mayor Adams and NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch — who both deserve full credit for leading the masterful effort police have engaged in to drive down crime — announced on July 1 that shootings for the first six months of the year are down to the lowest level in “recorded history.” The number is 337. Just last year, in the same time frame (minus one day) it was 435. So it’s been cut by nearly a quarter — in just one year. It’s down 49.5 percent from five years ago, and down 86.8 percenwt from 32 years ago, the furthest time back that regular NYPD CompStat figures reach. This is a stunning improvement. It shows what can happen when you have leadership unencumbered by a shady circle of corrupt advisors, which is what the mayor had before. Between federal investigations and the actions of Tisch, that crew is mostly gone, and the results are apparent. Commensurate with the drop in shootings, the murder rate is...",

Ariola’s office said the funding will allow for a comprehensive upgrade to “one of the neighborhood’s most well-used recreational spaces.” The playground is adjacent to PS/MS 207, the Rockwood Park School, and serves as an outdoor play space for the students there. The funding will be used toward improving play equipment, safety features and overall park infrastructure. “This is a major win for Howard Beach families,” Ariola said in a statement. “Walter Ward Playground has served generations of residents, and this investment ensures it will continue to do so for generations to come. Parks are the heart of our communities, and this kind of investment is exactly how we build a stronger and more connected neighborhood.” Lisa Nevins, the principal of PS/MS 207, said the playground is “in many ways, an extension of our school.” She said the investment in the playground is also an investment in the school. “This funding means our children will have a safer, better equipped environment to learn and grow, and I thank Councilwoman Ariola for securing these funds and investing in our students,” Nevins said. PS/MS 207’s PTA president, Anna Pace, said, “This is great news.” She added, “The parents in this community have been asking for a renovation of the playground for some time, and I’m...",

In a press conference on Tuesday, FDNY officials said she was a patron in Singas Famous Pizza at 43-69 Kissena Blvd. when the blaze broke out at about 3 p.m. Five people escaped. The News reported that she had been out shopping with a friend at the time “These are the devices that the FDNY has been talking about for years, because they are very dangerous,” said FDNY Commissioner Robert Tucker in an FDNY YouTube video. “And somebody died in this fire.” Cheung is the first person in the city to die this year as the result of a lithium-ion battery fire after six last year and 20 in 2023. But Chief Fire Marshal Daniel Flynn said they have responded to more than 120 this year, an increase over 2024 year to date. Flynn said Cheung was in the bathroom when the battery went off. The scooter was being stored outside the bathroom. “These things can take off very quickly, like a blowtorch effect,” Flynn said. “This woman was in the bathroom ... She was trapped.” He said she was able to make it a few steps outside the bathroom when the heat and smoke overtook her. “These fires are very treacherous,” Tucker said. “They move very quickly and they are very hot.” Cheung was taken out by the first crew to arrive on scene and brought to EMS personnel.

Executive Director Regina Bain prefers to focus more on how far the center has come, and where it is headed as her team preserves and expands the legacy of the legendary jazz trumpeter, singer and band leader. The center serves as an archive, museum and research center, with more than 60,000 artifacts and exhibits and is located at 34-49 107 St., across the street from the Louis Armstrong House Museum, where Satchmo and his wife, Lucille, lived and were part of the neighborhood. “Two years later we’ve had 50 concerts through the museum, and they’ve been amazing,” Bain said, fondly remembering appearances such as one last fall by the late poet Nikki Giovanni in perhaps her final public appearance before her death. “We’ve had amazing community programs, including our trumpet learning program,” she said. “Kids 8 to 14 can learn the trumpet. We loan them a trumpet for free. It’s low-cost, and we can do it now that we have indoor space and we don’t have to bother neighbors with trumpet classes.” Branching out further, the center has started a justice arts music program for those recently released from incarceration. “Louis Armstrong was incarcerated when he was a young boy,” Bain said. “In the place where he was incarcerated they had an arts program. That’s where he learned to play the trumpet and that helped launch...",

Rodriguez Meza is charged with first-degree assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a concealed weapon, a Class A felony and a gross misdemeanor, respectively. Meanwhile, on Monday, July 7, police arrested the man Rodriguez Meza is accused of shooting at, under investigation of attempted vehicular assault. Formal charges against the victim-turned-suspect have not yet been filed, but College Place Police Department spokesperson Dylan Schmick said the arrest was made after consultation with the Walla Walla County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office. According to a College Place Police Department news release, officers heard the gunshots while they were on patrol near College Avenue Sunday about 12:15 a.m. They responded to the area of College Avenue and Blalock Avenue and found a man whose car had been struck by bullets. The man was not struck by gunfire. Officers' investigation led them to seek Rodriguez Meza, who turned himself in to police at 8:40 p.m. Sunday. Security footage from a nearby business showed an altercation between two men that ended when one of the men fired a gun as the other man fled in a vehicle, according to police. Schmick said in a follow-up release that further investigation led police to arrest the original alleged victim as well.

        "content": "One thing that Americans across the political spectrum could agree on is that Joey Chestnut is the greatest hot dog eater of all time. Chestnut won his 17th Yellow Mustard Belt, the most prestigious in sports, by devouring 70 franks at the Nathan’s July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest. There was some drama going into this year’s contest because Chestnut was not allowed to take part in the 2024 contest after he signed an endorsement deal with a vegan hot dog brand not affiliated with Nathan’s. Details about how things got resolved have not been released, but my guess is Nathan’s executives realized how much attention Chestnut brings to their event. Word filtered out three weeks ago that Chestnut would be returning to the riser on Stillwell and Surf Avenues on July 4. The question was whether he would be the unconquerable gustatorial warrior he was after a year off, as well as being 41. While he did not break his previous record of devouring 77 hot dogs in ten minutes, Chestnut may have turned in his best performance ever by consuming 70 franks and beating his nearest rival, 2024 champ Patrick Bertoletti by 24 wieners. You have to feel bad for Bertoletti who was clearly intimidated having to compete right next to Chestnut. Major League Eating, which is the governing body of the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, should place an asterisk next to Patrick Bertoletti’s name as the winner of the 2024 contest since Joey did not compete that year.

        "content": "The Walla Walla City Council did not properly back up its resolution denying an agreement with developers planning to build 257 homes south of Walla Walla, a judge said in a letter published Monday, July 7. “So, they have to do it over,” said Jim Hayner, the attorney for developers Cottonwood Investors LLC, in an interview. Cottonwood Investors filed a land use petition in November 2024 after the City Council denied the development proposal for a 104-acre wheat field near Cottonwood and Kendall roads. The denial of the plan in a 4-3 vote was based on arguments laid out by Tom Scribner, Rick Eskil and other council members, who voiced concerns about roads, flooding and the plan’s incongruence with the city’s Comprehensive Plan. Walla Walla County Superior Court Judge Pro Tempore George B. Fearing said in his letter of opinion that the City Council did not follow the proper process for recording findings of fact in the decision. The reasons for the City Council’s decision were shared verbally at the hearing and appeared in the record via a transcript, which the city said made it part of the written record. But Fearing asked that the City Council enter the findings of fact beyond a hearing transcript, including producing a detailed list of findings. “Detailed written findings help the city council, Cottonwood Investors, and this court to determine what matters,” Fearing wrote. He wrote that the City Council can take new evidence and argument if it wants, or base its findings on...",

        "content": "At a City Planning Commission public hearing for the Jamaica Neighborhood Plan held last Wednesday, stakeholders had mixed opinions about the proposal to rezone 230 blocks of Downtown Jamaica for housing, infrastructure and public space improvements. Lynette Townsley, chair of Community Board 12’s Youth Committee, was opposed to the plan because it would create high-density 18-story towers that would require energy provided from lithium-ion batteries, which, while efficient, are also prone to fires. “These towers will block sunlight, stunt tree growth and worsen already dangerous asthma rates in Southeast Queens, especially among our children,” said Townsley. She also warned that if there was a fire there are only four hazmat units across the city capable of addressing a lithium-ion battery emergency. “These batteries release toxic gases like hydrogen fluoride and can burn for hours,” said Townsley. Lisa Edwards, an urban studies professor at Queens College, said the plan would accelerate gentrification and make Downtown Jamaica similar to Downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City. Ben Englander, CEO of Rosco Vision, a manufacturing and technology company, said the rezoning plan would provide affordable housing to his union workers. “By encouraging development and investment, the plan would bring significant and needed improvements like affordable housing for our employees so they can afford to live near their work,” he said.

Kangela Moore, who lives on 148th Drive, said that the project impacts nearly 200 homeowners. “Part of my driveway has been selected to be removed,” said Moore, who has concerns that not enough homeowners are aware that they can file claims for damages while the city does the work in early fall. “There are time sensitive documents that need to be signed in October,” said Moore. “There are legal ramifications if there are damages.” Moore said some banks are filing claims against properties and if homeowners don’t file to recoup their loss it will be the bank that gets reimbursed. Moore said that along with fears of her neighbors not being reimbursed, she feels there is not enough transparency regarding the design and scope of the project. “What are we to expect as we move further down?” she said about the project. “Let’s have a conversation about this.” Moore said that her husband Dwayne Moore reached out to City Council Majority Whip Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Laurelton) about having a meeting regarding the project in the spring, but he said he was given the brush off and then told the majority whip won’t be available until September, which they both thought was too late to address the claims matter and other issues regarding the project.

Artists Emily Davidson and Kerri Ammirata’s show at Mrs. entitled “Relay,” which opened June 14 and runs through Aug. 15, embodies both juxtaposition and convergence. While there may be distance between Davidson’s depictions of daily life and Ammirata’s of celestial bodies, their works both dive deep into the human psyche. Firsthand observation takes a starring role in Davidson’s new works, which draw from scenes captured through windows, on signs and in advertisements. A mother of identical twins, the artist painted each work twice, such that the pairs echo her own experiences even further. Her works “East of Eden” and “West of Eden” directly mirror each other, reflecting scenes containing the word “Eden” seen throughout the New York metropolitan area. They point both to singularity and ubiquity, reminding the viewer of the biblical garden while also noting the name’s frequent usage. Up in the sky, the Ridgewood-based Ammirata’s oil on wood paintings depict suns, moons and planets in various hues, bringing the cosmos down to earth right before the viewer’s eyes. They invoke sacred geometry and mandalas, or symbols for the universe in Buddhism and Hinduism. Ammirata’s works combine vastness with intimacy as she, too, connects them to her own experiences.

Currently, travel is as slow as 4 miles per hour. The project, a complement to the Queens Bus Network Redesign, will improve service for 194,000 daily bus riders along 17 MTA bus routes — in addition to 21,000 daily riders along five Nassau County bus routes, while improving connections to four nearby subway lines, the Long Island Rail Road and the JFK AirTrain, according to the agency, which said the buses on Hillside Avenue would be the 18th largest transit system by ridership in the U.S. Buses on the corridor move more passengers than the NJ Transit Rail, The Port Authority Trans-Hudson and the Bay Area rapid transit systems, said DOT. The Hillside Avenue Bus Priority Project is one of the longest for the agency and brings nearly eight miles of offset dedicated bus lanes, or center lane busways.

It was reported to police at around 4:12 p.m. that the trio entered a residential building at 102-40 62 Ave. Once inside, they broke into a 28-year-old man’s apartment, punched him about the body and stole medication and about $60, cops said. They then fled on foot to parts unknown. EMS brought the victim to Long Island Jewish Forest Hills in stable condition, according to the NYPD.

        "content": "City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez last week was celebrating the completion of the borough’s most recent cycling- and pedestrian-friendly street makeover. Astoria’s 31st Avenue has been converted to a “bike boulevard” between Vernon Boulevard in the west and Steinway Street in the east. The DOT said the rationale for the change is to better accommodate cyclists and pedestrians, whom the agency says are the the most frequent users of the street; to have more connections to existing bike lane networks; and improve overall safety in the corridor. “Thirty-first Avenue’s innovative redesign as a bike boulevard will help protect pedestrians and cyclists, support Open Street operations, and strengthen connections to the 16.5 lane miles of protected bike lanes, and 21 lane miles of standard bike lanes and shared lanes in the area,” Rodriguez said in a press release from his office on July 3. “Streets are public space, and designs like this show that we can reimagine the use of public space to benefit all road users.” A two-way protected bike lane provides an east-west cycling connection from Vernon Boulevard to Steinway Street, resulting in a continuous protected bike route from Astoria to the Queensboro Bridge. Drivers now must negotiate a road that has been broken up into multiple one-way segments, with eastbound sections running from 21st Street to Vernon Boulevard and 31st Street to 35th Street. Westbound segments include Steinway Street to 35th Street, 31st...",

Meng obtained $2 million in Community Project Funding in the 2025 House Appropriations bill that would go toward renovations at the 68th Street building. The money is moving through the legislative process, as per a press release issued Monday. “We need to ensure that our brave firefighters have the resources they need to keep us safe and save lives, and that includes those at Squad 288/HazMat 1 in Maspeth,” she said. The funds would go toward replacing the floor of the apparatus, the firehouse’s main space that includes its vehicles, bunker gear, workbenches, tools and equipment. The New York Post reported June 28 that the floor had holes in it until firefighters paid for a new one themselves for fear that someone would get hurt before the city responded. Sewage backups, mold, exposed asbestos and cracked walls and floors are among the other issues plaguing the building. The Post reported that repairs are set to start in the fall. “Our firehouses have sadly been allowed to fall into deplorable states, but this funding would go a long way towards righting the wrongs at the Squad 288/HazMat 1 house,” said Councilmember Joann Ariola (R-Ozone Park), who chairs the Committee on Fire and Emergency Management. “Our heroes deserve safe, structurally sound firehouses to go back to when they aren’t saving the lives of their fellow New Yorkers,” Ariola said. “This...",

        "content": "Overcrowding is still an issue at Animal Care Centers of NYC’s Ridgewood location a year into its operations, with the shelter housing double its capacity of dogs. The New York Post on Sunday reported packed, filthy conditions at the $75 million site at 19-06 Flushing Ave., which opened last July. The report states that, during a recent visit, several dogs’ cages were not cleaned when the animals returned to them after a walk. The Post also reported that many of the dogs suffer from kennel cough. Councilman Bob Holden (D-Maspeth) said it is “unacceptable” that animals are still living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, even though the facility is new. “We are past sounding the alarm and now demand immediate action to improve staffing, expand capacity, and ensure humane care,” Holden said. He also called on the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to increase support for expanded spay and neuter services and animal welfare programs. “It’s time for the ACC to find solutions and stop with the incessant excuses,” the lawmaker said. But Katy Hansen, the ACC’s director of communications, told the Chronicle that the Ridgewood location is far from the only shelter to face overcrowding. “Every shelter in the nation is going through this, and I’m not using that as an excuse, but just to put things in context,” Hansen said. “Every shelter is packed with dogs, across the country, and so when you’re doing animal services for a city of 8 million people, it can be hard to...",

        "content": "A member of Ridgewood’s Sunset Community Garden has withdrawn a request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the city Parks Department from terminating its license agreement, according to court documents filed Monday. The court had been set to rule on the injunction when the plaintiff’s counsel, Jonathan Wallace, said he spoke with attorneys from the Corporation Counsel the day prior, according to a transcript of the hearing. Stating that he anticipates finding a resolution, he said he would prefer to set a control date rather than proceed with the injunction. The judge then requested an off-the-record discussion regarding plans for a potential resolution. The litigation began after Parks moved to terminate the garden’s license in May, stating that it failed to comply with the rules for community gardens by requiring ideological commitments from members. Among the required commitments is one to interrupt “behavior or rhetoric that expresses all forms of hate,” including homophobia, racism, Zionism and anti-Semitism. The agency said it had been working with members since last September to address violations, and the garden has said the city falsely labeled its community agreements discriminatory. The garden group also said in May that its conflict with Parks centered on the agency’s order to remove a memorial for transgender activist Cecilia Gentili. Parks said the memorial did not qualify for permanent installation and suggested ways for it to remain on display, none of...",

CB 6 District Manager Christine Nolan, Councilmember Lynn Schulman (D-Forest Hills), Assemblymember Andrew Hevesi (D-Forest Hills) and state Sens. Joe Addabbo Jr. (D-Woodhaven) and Leroy Comrie (D-St. Albans) on Monday wrote a joint letter to the agency requesting prompt action to clean up the medians from 63rd Drive to Union Turnpike, as well as conduct upkeep on a consistent schedule. “Given the current state of the Boulevard, we’re hopeful that a proactive response can be coordinated by mid-July, so that our communities may enjoy a safe and well-maintained public space throughout the remainder of the summer,” the letter reads. Volunteers at community cleanups and from organizations such as Friends of MacDonald Park are not qualified or equipped to maintain the medians themselves, it continues. A DSNY spokesperson told the Chronicle via email that it would clean the medians along that stretch early Wednesday morning on the overnight shift, and it will continue to monitor and maintain them. “We appreciate these leaders’ continued advocacy around this important issue,” the spokesperson said. This is not the first time the medians had seen better days. Residents lamented similar signs of deterioration toward the end of last summer, the letter states, and they were ultimately resolved...",

The Department of Transportation said its overall project will not only expand Queens’ bike lane system, but involve a redesign that will improve traffic flow and safety, with accommodations to offset things like the loss of parking for businesses. But a number of business owners who spoke with the Chronicle said everyone from shopkeepers to large, longtime manufacturers will be hurt. Members of the 31st Street Business Association, in a six-page letter to Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez dated June 3, state that the planned changes will make conditions more dangerous along with making it impossible for some of the larger businesses to accommodate tractor trailers and other large trucks that they depend on. The letter has more than 50 signatures; and the association told the Chronicle it has more than 4,000 other signatures on a petition to stop the plan. The DOT told the Chronicle that various parking accommodations for customers and new designated loading zones already are accounted for; and that it has reached out to 52 businesses on the corridor. The agency also said it has more than 3.400 names on a supporting petition. The bike lanes will be eight feet wide, as will be parking spaces that will be pushed from the curb to spaces between the massive steel supports for the train...",

No matter the topic, the various theories related to how we wish to interpret what’s happening have their own unique meaning. In recent years, the political landscape has been influenced by more speculations than ever before in our history. The obvious question these days is no longer based on an acceptance of truth, but more on what narrative best suits our views. If groomed to believe something is what we perceive it to be, nothing can deter us from believing what we want to see and hear. It’s no longer about finding a balance, but rather about embracing the story that best suits our perceptions. Hearing so many opposing opinions on any number of issues fundamentally eradicates the idea of being well informed. Getting to a place of understanding requires us to take the high road when faced with another person’s anger. How difficult is it to understand we have reached an age of constant conflict? Those people steadfast in their belief about politics, the environment and the state of the nation truly adhere to narratives that coincide with what they choose to believe. Nothing can be more compelling than a refusal to admit one side of any argument has a single point of view that makes total sense to everyone. Here’s hoping we can all agree the arrival of warmer weather is followed by the promise of summer. Maybe having faith in the inevitable changes...",

Just imagine how half the country felt when the Constitutional Amendment establishing Prohibition was passed in 1920. And how half the country felt when it was repealed in 1933. The institution of Social Security in 1935 terrified some constituencies but here it is, a feature of our society. The Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 and Shays’ Rebellion in 1786-87, seriously threatened the stability of the new nation; those crises now are only occasionally remembered. Four score and seven years after the founding of the nation, we were in the midst of a civil war that battered and bloodied the nation for four years, 1861-65. A hundred years later, dinner tables became combat zones from 1965 until 1973 during the Vietnam War. But we’re still here. Many of us are. I hope you enjoyed the Fourth of July. Voice your opinion.

On Tuesday, during a public hearing, Vancouver City Council unanimously approved the rezoning application to redevelop the 1.15-acre restaurant property at 1527 Main St. into a mixed-use development with secured purpose-built rental housing and commercial uses, entailing a 220-ft-tall, 21-storey tower and an 181-ft-tall, 17-storey tower interconnected by a seven-storey base podium. The McDonald’s restaurant building, surrounded by surface parking, has occupied this site since 1972. It was especially prominent during Vancouver’s major events over the decades, including the Expo ’86 World’s Fair, the annual Molson Indy race, and the 2010 Winter Olympics, with the Olympic Village located right next door.

        "content": "MARICOPA COUNTY, Ariz. — We're halfway into 2025, and 12News is taking a look at the number of eviction cases filed in Maricopa County so far. In June of 2025, 7,029 evictions were filed, compared to 7,247 cases filed in June of last year, data from the Maricopa County Justice Courts shows. At this time last year, there had been 42,254 eviction cases filed overall—the highest number of evictions filed by June of any year since 2000. A spokesperson for the Maricopa County Justice Courts says that 2025 is on track to have the second-most evictions filed in any year since 2000, just behind 2024. \"This number is in line with what we’ve been seeing all year long: relatively high compared to past years but not at record levels,\" the spokesperson said of June's numbers. An eviction filed does not mean the person or people being served an eviction notice are forced out of their home, according to the Justice Courts of Maricopa County. In some cases, the eviction is filed, and the dispute is handled between residents and landlords out of court. In other instances, the issue is taken to court to be resolved. When a landlord files an eviction, a tenant can still pay the \"past-due\" amount before a judge issues a ruling. Some tenants may move out before the eviction goes to court. A population increase also tends to lead to increased evictions filed. Watch 12News+ for free You can now watch 12News content anytime, anywhere, thanks to the 12News+ app!

        "content": "KERRVILLE, Texas — In the heart of Kerr County’s flood-ravaged communities, volunteers and nonprofit organizations continue to work around the clock to support victims and survivors. But for many, the emotional toll is heavy, even for those offering help. On Wednesday, a group from Houston made a special trip to bring some much-needed relief, not just for flood victims, but for the helpers themselves. Walking along the banks of the Guadalupe River in Kerrville reveals a landscape scattered with debris, a haunting reminder of lives turned upside down. Amid the damage, four therapy dogs arrived to offer comfort to anyone who needed it. “We knew that God wanted these dogs here, so we just came,” said Debbie Benningfield of Angel PAWS, the pet therapy ministry with Champion Forest Baptist Church. Angel PAWS drove 270 miles to the Salvation Army in Kerrville. The therapy dogs quickly became a source of comfort for both disaster survivors and the relief workers on the ground. “To come here and to be here and to be a blessing to these people, just to see the reaction of their faces, and just that moment where they’re just calm, where they’re happy, and they’re there to comfort. That’s what their job is, is to comfort, and these dogs know their jobs very well,” Benningfield said. The simple act of petting one of the dogs or giving them a snuggle proved to be a powerful gift to those under strain. “Thank you. It’s much appreciated,” said Cathy Clark with the Salvation Army Texas...",

The opposition is on the verge of giving the President a diet prepared with the President’s one recipe. The President has been touted to be a master in the game. Before 2015, he had begun to do what the opposition has now set out to do, namely, to form a coalition against the government in power. At that time the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) was the behemoth in the political arena. The party even went to town with the declaration that it would be in power for no less than sixty years, but the party did not know that Tinubu was lurking in the corner.President Goodluck Jonathan did not seem to understand what befell him when Lagos became the centre for unrestrained protest against attempts to adjust fuel prices, not to stop subsidy but to reduce the funds expended on it. As the protests were rocking Lagos, the President, who still runs the political Machinery of Lagos, in spite of Labour Party’s incursion at the Presidential election which made the All-Progressive Congress come next to the best in the Presidential elections, began to form an alliance with other parties.

        "content": "President Donald Trump praised Liberian President Joseph Boakai for speaking English articulately, seemingly unaware of the fact that English is Liberia’s national language. “Such good English, that’s beautiful,” Trump said during a Wednesday meeting at the White House with five African leaders. “Where did you learn to speak so beautifully?” Boakai chuckled awkwardly as Trump’s praise continued. “Were you educated?” Trump pressed. When Boakai replied “Yes, sir,” Trump asked his counterpart if he went to school in Liberia, which the West African leader also confirmed. “Well, that’s very interesting,” Trump said, again calling Boakai’s English-speaking skills “beautiful.” Trump then joked he had advisers at Wednesday’s meeting who were less fluent in English than Boakai. A fact sheet published by the CIA says 20% of Liberians speak English in the predominantly Christian nation settled by freed U.S. slaves in the 19th century. More than two dozen indigenous languages are also spoken in the country, including variants of Liberian English. According to his official biography page, Boakai, 80, attended secondary school at the reputable College of West Africa before earning a degree from the University of Liberia. He also attended Kansas State University. Trump similarly complimented French leader Emmanuel Macron for speaking French when the pair met at the White House in February. “I have no idea what he said but that is the most elegant, beautiful language,” Trump interjected...",

Calipari spoke about his first year at Arkansas on Wednesday. The Razorbacks started Southeastern Conference play last season with five straight losses. But Arkansas ultimately reached the Sweet 16. Now, Calipari has taken a different approach in rebuilding the Razorbacks’ roster heading into his second year in Fayetteville. “I came here saying I want eight or nine guys because of NIL (name, image, likeness). I can’t pick 12,” Calipari said. “Now I’m like ‘Let’s have eight or nine that know,’ but you have other players we’re developing.” Calipari has long been known as a master recruiter of high school players, regularly collecting top-10 classes at Kentucky and Memphis before that. Now, the transfer portal has changed things. High school recruiting is not irrelevant, but preps players aren’t as big a focus. Now, it’s about veterans with college experience.

Calipari spoke about his first year at Arkansas on Wednesday. The Razorbacks started Southeastern Conference play last season with five straight losses. But Arkansas ultimately reached the Sweet 16. Now, Calipari has taken a different approach in rebuilding the Razorbacks’ roster heading into his second year in Fayetteville. “I came here saying I want eight or nine guys because of NIL (name, image, likeness). I can’t pick 12,” Calipari said. “Now I’m like ‘Let’s have eight or nine that know,’ but you have other players we’re developing.” Calipari has long been known as a master recruiter of high school players, regularly collecting top-10 classes at Kentucky and Memphis before that. Now, the transfer portal has changed things. High school recruiting is not irrelevant, but preps players aren’t as big a focus. Now, it’s about veterans with college experience.

The son and father of major leaguers, Coleman became the No. 3 pick in baseball's inaugural amateur draft in 1965 when he was selected by the Washington Senators. His father, also named Joe — who pitched in the majors from 1942-55 — negotiated a club-record $75,000 signing bonus.

He enjoyed his greatest individual success with the Tigers, going 88-73 with a 3.82 ERA from 1971-76. In 1971, he went 20-9 with a 3.15 ERA after recovering from a skull fracture that hospitalized him for two weeks.

Casey Coleman said his father died in his sleep in Jamestown, Tennessee. The son and father of major leaguers, Coleman became the No. 3 pick in baseball's inaugural amateur draft in 1965 when he was selected by the Washington Senators. His father, also named Joe — who pitched in the majors from 1942-55 — negotiated a club-record $75,000 signing bonus. The 6-foot-3, 175-pound Coleman became the first player to reach the majors after being drafted when he debuted for the Senators on Sept. 28, 1965. He threw a four-hitter to beat the Kansas City Athletics 6-1. After the 1970 season, Coleman was traded to Detroit in a deal that sent Denny McLain to Washington. He enjoyed his greatest individual success with the Tigers, going 88-73 with a 3.82 ERA from 1971-76. In 1971, he went 20-9 with a 3.15 ERA after recovering from a skull fracture that hospitalized him for two weeks. He was an All-Star the following season and made his only postseason appearance, striking out a then-playoff-record 14 batters to shut out the Oakland Athletics in Game 3 of the five-game American League championship series. The Tigers lost the series 3-2 and Oakland went on to beat Cincinnati in the World Series. Coleman's strikeout record stood for 25 years. Baltimore's Mike Mussina fanned 15 in the 1997 ALCS against Cleveland. Coleman also...",

More than 150 earthquakes and aftershocks with magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 5.7 have been reported since Tuesday afternoon. President Bernardo Arévalo said on social media that the body of a woman who had been buried by debris south of Guatemala's capital had been recovered along with the body of her dog.

Decker has been wanted since June 2, when a sheriff’s deputy in Washington found his truck and the bodies of his three daughters — 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker — at a campground outside Leavenworth, Washington.

The discovery came three days after he failed to return the girls to their mother’s home in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle, following a scheduled visit. The family was near a Bear Creek area campsite when they saw a man who was the same height and roughly the same weight as Decker, and also had similar hair, beard and tattoos on his arm and calf. Additional tips followed, and federal, state and local law enforcement agencies joined the Marshals Service in the search. They found the man Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Marshals Service Supervisory Deputy Michael Leigh said in a press release, and determined he was not Decker. “Investigators interviewed the cooperative man and confirmed he was hiking in the Bear Creek area this past weekend,” Leigh wrote.

        "content": "It's been almost a year since the Mariners acquired Randy Arozarena, and he's finally made himself at home. The All-Star left fielder, who was traded by the Tampa Bay Rays on July 25, smashed six home runs in seven games last homestand, hitting .346 with a 1.038 SLG. He ranks sixth in the American League with a 1.006 OPS since June 7 and now has 14 home runs this season. “I feel good,” Arozarena said before Saturday’s game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. “I think the confidence has always been there, but I feel good being able to help the team and be able to produce on the field.” Arozarena, 30, has steadily improved his performance to recover from a rocky start to the season. He had his best offensive month in June, hitting .294 with a .854 OPS. Arozarena raised his average by more than 80 points after hitting a low of .211 with a .727 OPS in April. The Cuban Mexican has demonstrated his ability to spray the ball anywhere over the wall, hitting two of those six homers to center field, two to right and two to left. “It’s big,” Mariners manager Dan Wilson said after Arozarena’s opposite-field homer on Friday. “It proves to him that he can wait on it and drive it anywhere, and he can drive it out of any part of the ballpark. As a hitter, that only makes you better.” Arozarena’s home run to left field on Sunday earned the Mariners a 1-0 win to sweep the Pirates. “[Arozarena] with that big blow, just that line drive home run, put a really good swing on a pitch and drove it out...",

        "content": "Federal prosecutors filed an order petitioning the court to compel disgraced ex-Boston City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson to pay $13,000 as a penalty for the City Hall kickback scheme she was convicted for this past May. U.S. Attorney Leah Foley filed a motion for order of forfeiture (money judgment) in federal court Wednesday that states the government will seize the ex-councilor’s assets and property up to $13,000, if Fernandes Anderson is unable to produce the restitution payment both sides agreed upon as part of a plea deal in early April. “Based upon the defendant’s admissions in the written plea agreement and her guilty plea on May 5, 2025, the United States is entitled to an order of forfeiture consisting of a personal money judgment against the defendant, in the amount of $13,000,” Foley wrote in the filing. “This amount represents the proceeds of the defendant’s crimes.” Citing the federal rules of criminal procedure, Foley said forfeiture can take several forms, including the amount of money the defendant obtained as proceeds of her offense, specific assets related to her criminal activity, or “substitute assets” if the specific assets are not available. “Once the order of forfeiture is entered, the United States may move at any time ... to amend the order to forfeit specific property of the defendant, having a value up to the amount of the money judgment,” Foley’s filing states. A money judgment, issuance of which the U.S. Attorney’s office is seeking from...",

Camp preparations took a hit. Early warning signs took a hit. Seems like everyone took a hit. Talk about a hard hit. Someone got fired because she said the victims got what they deserved because they voted for Trump and denied climate change. In all fairness to the white girls at the Christian camp, most weren’t eligible to vote. Even if they were, the comments were cruel. Like comments made back in 2005 after the hurricanes hit fast and hard in New Orleans. Certain religious leaders attributed the disaster to divine retribution, suggesting it was God's punishment for the city's perceived sins against the LGBTQ community. How cruel. Wonder if any of those leaders got fired? Regardless of the blame game and the cruel comments, I would wager to say the thing that hit the hardest during the hurricane back in 2005, or the flood in Texas this past week was the sudden and unexpected loss of a loved one. And though it’s been 20 years since the hurricanes and not even a week since the flood in Texas, I would also wager that what comes faster and hits harder are the overwhelming endless emotions flooding the soul, knowing that a loved one is gone. So, how about we quit playing the blame game or claiming some divine revelation about why these things happen, at least until loved ones are laid to rest. And whether it’s...",

SNAP offers monthly benefits to low-income families to help them purchase food.Addressing over 50 meeting participants, Food Share CEO Kim Da Silva acknowledged that there has been a lot of curiosity about how the new bill will impact the local community. Community Food Share serves Boulder and Broomfield counties.Data provided by Feeding Colorado, a coalition of five Colorado food banks including Community Food Share, shows that SNAP currently supports 615,000 Colorado residents. This includes 19,358 people in Boulder County and 3,631 people in Broomfield County.According to Feeding Colorado, 298,000 Colorado families will lose some or all of their SNAP benefits because of the budget reconciliation bill.Volunteer Louise Sternberg selects produce for clients of the Feeding Families Pantry at Community Food Share on Wednesday.

Casey Coleman said his father died in his sleep in Jamestown, Tennessee. The son and father of major leaguers, Coleman became the No. 3 pick in baseball’s inaugural amateur draft in 1965 when he was selected by the Washington Senators. His father, also named Joe — who pitched in the majors from 1942-55 — negotiated a club-record $75,000 signing bonus. The 6-foot-3, 175-pound Coleman became the first player to reach the majors after being drafted when he debuted for the Senators on Sept. 28, 1965. He threw a four-hitter to beat the Kansas City Athletics 6-1. After the 1970 season, Coleman was traded to Detroit in a deal that sent Denny McLain to Washington. He enjoyed his greatest individual success with the Tigers, going 88-73 with a 3.82 ERA from 1971-76. In 1971, he went 20-9 with a 3.15 ERA after recovering from a skull fracture that hospitalized him for two weeks. He was an All-Star the following season and made his only postseason appearance, striking out a then-playoff-record 14 batters to shut out the Oakland Athletics in Game 3 of the five-game American League championship series. The Tigers lost the series 3-2 and Oakland went on to beat Cincinnati in the World Series. Coleman’s strikeout record stood for 25 years. Baltimore’s Mike Mussina fanned 15 in the 1997 ALCS against Cleveland. Coleman also...",

Tak hanya ramai dibicarakan di media lokal, kasus ini bahkan mencuat di dunia maya karena dianggap mengandung ironi: seorang kakek membawa darah dagingnya sendiri ke pengadilan. Namun, dari pihak sang kakek akhirnya angkat bicara dan menjelaskan bahwa apa yang terjadi tidak sesederhana seperti yang terlihat di permukaan. Ade Firmansyah Ramadhan, pasangan lansia bernama Kadi dan Narti, memberikan klarifikasi mengenai perkara yang menyeret nama Zaki Fasa Idan (12), sang cucu, sebagai tergugat ketiga. Selain Zaki, ibunya, Rastiah (37), dan kakaknya, Heryatno (20), masing-masing turut disebut sebagai tergugat satu dan tergugat dua. Inti sengketa ini berkutat pada hak tinggal di rumah yang dulunya merupakan milik Suparto, ayah Zaki dan Heryatno, yang sudah meninggal dunia. Rumah tersebut berdiri di Desa Karangsong, Kecamatan/Kabupaten . Meski telah sampai ke meja hijau, Ade menegaskan bahwa niat awal dari Kadi dan Narti bukanlah untuk membawa cucunya ke jalur hukum. Mereka disebutnya sempat menahan diri untuk tidak mengambil langkah hukum, mengingat perkara ini menyangkut keluarga dekat. “Ini berarti kan mereka yang minta digugat, padahal sebenarnya dari pihak kakek dan neneknya sendiri untuk melaporkan ke polisi atau pengadilan tidak mau, karena ini cucunya sendiri,” ujar Ade saat dijumpai di Kantor LBH Dharma Bakti Indramayu, Selasa...",

Liberian-flagged MV Eternity C sank on Wednesday after sustaining “significant damage” and had lost all propulsion, the UK Maritime Trade Operations, a liaison between the UK Navy and commercial shipping, said. The Houthis claimed responsibility. US officials said some surviving crew has been kidnapped. “After killing their shipmates, sinking their ship, and hampering rescue efforts, the Houthi terrorists have kidnapped many surviving crew members of the Eternity C,” the U.S. Embassy in Yemen said in a statement, calling for the sailors’ immediate and unconditional release. The Houthi group earlier said it rescued a number of the ship’s crew members, provided them with medical care and transported them to a safe location. The vessel was a bulk carrier carrying grains to Somalia for the World Food Programme, and was targeted Monday after completing the trip. The attack represents one of the deadliest carried out by the militant group since it began targeting commercial vessels in the Red Sea in 2023 over Israel’s war on Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza. The assaults are also the first Houthi attacks on vessels in the maritime region since late last year and come just weeks after Israel’s military confrontation with Iran and as the Jewish state’s war on Hamas is still raging.

The federal government froze over $33 million in Idaho education funding, the Boise School District said in a Wednesday news release addressed to staff and parents, forcing school administrators to weigh tough decisions on possible last-minute cuts to language learning, teacher training and after-school programs. The money, part of $6.9 billion in K-12 funding frozen nationwide by the Trump administration, would normally have made its way to states starting July 1, according to a National Education Association news release . The Idaho State Department of Education does not know when the federal government will make decisions about whether to release the funding, Debbie Critchfield, Idaho superintendent of public instruction, told the Idaho Statesman in a statement. The amount Idaho stands to lose totals about 16% of the funding the U.S. Department of Education usually gives to the state, according to the Learning Policy Institute , a nonpartisan think tank focused on education. The frozen funding targets migrant education, teacher training, English-language acquisition and after-school enrichment programming, including literacy programs, according to data shared by Scott Graf, a spokesperson for the state’s Department of Education.

Ezewudo avers as follows: “If the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led presidency and the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) hope to secure votes and reasonable support from the South-east in the 2027 general election, this is the time they must call the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, to order and separate themselves from his ill-advised current brand of politics”. This statement suffers credible premises that lead to unreasoned inference. Ezewudo’s wild-chase leads him to advise President Tinubu to make friends amongst the South-easterners in the country. What reasons did the writer adduce as basis for advising APC to disregard Hon. Kalu? Again, one fails to find the rationale of Ezewudo’s thought: “It remains to be known why Kalu believes he will proceed further from where he currently finds himself today by daring those he should woo to accept him as a leader? His question is neither here nor there for a writer who ought to know that Hon. Benjamin Kalu is the highest-ranking national leader in the South-east. The people of the South-east recognize this irrespective of their political affiliations. Ezewudo’s counsel to the Tinubu-led administration to look...",

The council paid the first $900,000 back in February. The city had agreed to pay the second $900,000 once a certificate of occupancy was obtained for the center, but instead voted on Tuesday to pay $700,000 of that amount now and the other $200,000 when there is a certificate of occupancy for the Nevada Gold Mines Recreation Center. Elko City Manager Jan Baum told the council the Boys and Girls Clubs requested the money before the completion of the center because of cash-flow issues. Ryan Honea, chief operating officer of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Northeastern Nevada, said the money from the city will help now because grants are coming later. Ryan Honea, far right, chief operating officer of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Northeastern Nevada, talks with council members on Tuesday. Mayor Reece Keener said that “obviously, the project is progressing full steam ahead. They are putting the roof on, and the walls are going up. It’s really coming along nicely.

Creo que eso hizo que se ganara el cariño y la admiración del pueblo”, recordó Vivoni. “Perdimos a un chef con un carisma increíble”, lamentó, no sin antes destacar que ese “¡Dímelo, máster!” con el que Campis solía llegar a los lugares resonará siempre en su memoria al recordarlo. Asimismo, el chef Raúl Correa, quien junto a Iván Clemente y otros miembros de la comunidad culinaria en Puerto Rico lideró los esfuerzos de recaudación Todos por Campis —en apoyo al chef y su familia durante el proceso de tratamiento— manifestó sentirse “triste” por la pérdida, aunque le consuela saber que “dentro de todo, ya no está sufriendo”. Correa lo recuerda como una persona alegre, sumamente positiva, siempre con una sonrisa y con palabras inspiradoras. “Nunca competía con nadie; hacía lo suyo y siempre quería compartir.

Prince George’s University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) will host camps throughout the remainder of summer in northern B.C. communities, including on July 14th and 15th at North Peace Secondary School. Other stops on the tour include Burns Lake, Smithers, Terrace and two First Nations communities: Gitlaxt’aamix, a Nisga’a community north of Terrace, and Yekooche First Nation northwest of Fort St. James. According to UNBC’s athletics and events coordinator Dorion Van Caeseele, the Fort St. John camp is unique. While other camps showcase basketball, the Fort St. John camp is soccer-exclusive. She added that plans for the camp were finalized just a week ago. She said discussions within the athletic department suggested coaches wanted to “spread the love” to communities with campuses in the UNBC system, including Fort St. John. “Coaches sometimes go out to communities such as Burns Lake,” said Van Caeseele. “We wanted to make it a bit more, see how many [towns] we could get, and then kind of just keep building it year [after] year.” The camps are slated for youth ranging from ages seven to eight all the way through to high school and will be overseen by Claire Turner. Turner is from Fort St. John, and she played five seasons with the Timberwolves. She called the program run by Neil Sedgwick an “amazing experience.” “I loved...",

        "content": "By Ngozi T. AkuemeThe old man or woman may be grappling with dementia. He or she is neither a wizard/witch nor the source of anyone’s misfortune. This article is driven by several incidences that I have witnessed in person, and also seen on social media over the years. They all follow a similar pattern. The narrative usually begins with a bird falling from the sky, turning into a human being upon landing. The man/woman then starts to confess his/her evil deeds, and many times, saying things that they are prompted to say by the growing surrounding crowd. Some even claim to witness the point where the bird turned into a human being but nobody has ever provided a footage of such in this day and age of technology. Someone manages to start the story, and this attracts a large crowd who mock, bully and sometimes beat up the poor victims who have no memory of where they are, and never did the things they claimed they did. Families have abandoned their grandparents/parents with dementia because they do not understand this medical condition. These poor men/women are left to suffer and eventually succumb to death.My last personal experience was at Iwo community of Ibadan some years ago. A friend who happened to be around the scene of the incident sent me a video footage of an old woman being tortured. The crowd threw things at her, driving her away and calling her a witch. I recognized this pattern and quickly alerted my colleague, a consultant Neurologist. We went to the scene to...",

Durante la inundación de 1987, Manley recordó que una canoa hirió a la directora del campamento, Jane Ragsdale. Pero Ragsdale, de 68 años, fue una de las más de 100 víctimas que murieron en la inundación que comenzó el pasado 4 de julio, muchas de ellas en el condado de Kerr. “Esta agua, hizo algo diferente”, dijo Manley. “Jane conoce las inundaciones más que nadie. No hay manera de que hubiera estado sentada en su casa si hubiera pensado que esto era peligroso”. Es al menos la quinta vez en el último siglo que las inundaciones cerca del río Guadalupe se vuelven mortales. El área, conocida localmente como “Flash Flood Alley” (\"Callejón de Inundaciones Repentinas\"), tiene colinas que recogen rápidamente el agua y la canalizan hacia estrechos cauces de río.

Governor Aliyu brought his Kogi State counterpart, Usman Ododo, to cut the tape to flag off the construction as part of activities to celebrate his second year of service to the people of the state. Speaking at the event, Ododo said: “Investment in housing is not just a necessity; it is a catalyst for growth and prosperity. This project will not only provide shelter but also stimulate economic opportunities and elevate the standard of living in Sokoto.”Governor Aliyu also brought in his Yobe state counterpart, Mai Mala Buni, and the Aviation and Aerospace Development Minister, Festus Keyamo, to participate in a flurry of projects commissioning around the state.However, the interesting thing here is not just that the Sokoto state government was committed to addressing the housing deficit in the state, despite previous actions of the governor in the same direction. The curious side to this is the fact that the state government said it will spend only N22 billion on the ‘luxury housing estate’ consisting of 500 housing units. That is incredibly unbelievable. It speaks to the governor’s prudence in managing public funds. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1718806029429-0'); }); For Governor Aliyu, housing is a critical area where his administration has demonstrated a...",

        "content": "A senior lawyer at a major law firm who grabbed a junior colleague’s penis at a Christmas party and made other lewd comments about people he worked with has been suspended for 15 months. The man, who has interim name suppression, was drunk at two different parties run by his firm several years ago, where at the first he commented about employees’ genitalia and sex lives and touched staff inappropriately. At the second party weeks later, he spanked a woman with a piece of wood, kissed her on the top of the head and danced in a sexualised manner. The Lawyers and Conveyancers Disciplinary Tribunal described the man’s behaviour as “appalling and uncouth”. A hearing into the man’s conduct was held earlier this year, where several of the junior staff gave evidence that they had chosen to downplay how the behaviour affected them for fear of not getting hired for a permanent role. Now, the same tribunal has ordered the man to be suspended from practising as a lawyer and to pay a combined $73,000 in compensation and legal fees. The tribunal compared the man’s behaviour to inappropriate conduct by other lawyers it had penalised like James Gardner-Hopkins, Richard Dean Palmer and a Mr Q. Gardner-Hopkins was suspended for touching five interns inappropriately, also at a Christmas party. Palmer clocked a suspension for taking female interns to a sex shop and for a series of inappropriate emails, and Mr Q drunkenly offered a colleague “the best orgasm” of her life in a taxi ride home from...",

In this clime, illegal mining is rampant in the northern and western parts of the country ,often perpetrated with the connivance of foreigners. Ilegal mining constitutes serious economic sabotage, it is a major ill militating against the economic growth of Nigeria. Ilegal miners pay no tax, remit nothing to government coffers and are accountable to no one. In fact, they are authority unto themselves. Countries that suffer from the illegal mining of their solid mineral resources often have horrible economic stories to tell; it has always been tales of woes of mindless exploitation by illegal miners, mostly foreigners with active collaboration of locals. Apart from Nigeria, Congo Democratic Republic, DRC is one country that has been mercilessly subjected to decades of illegal mining. Note that buried beneath the soil of the vast Eastern DRC are a plethora of priceless solid mineral resources, including gold, tin, tantalum, cobalt, copper, and diamonds which have, since the country gained independence in the early 60s, been mined illegally, most often by Western interests, to the detriment of the economic growth and well being of the DRC and its people.The extraction of the above named solid mineral resources has fueled and still fuelling conflicts and instability in Eastern DC as illegal foreign miners...",

Sammy Loehr, whose mother, brother, grandparents and great-aunt are all buried at Nameless Cemetery, said he rushed to the site as soon as he heard about the flooding. Loehr said he feared the worst as he walked through the cemetery, which was inundated after Big Sandy Creek overflowed its banks . “Are they being washed away? Am I going to find them here?” Loehr recalled thinking as he surveyed the damage. Loehr found his mother’s headstone nearly covered in dirt, with only part of the inscription visible. The markers for his brother and other relatives were missing entirely. “When I got here the other day, her little face was covered up, but her little eyes were showing,” Loehr said. “It’s heartbreaking, you know?” Loehr estimates at least 30 headstones were either toppled over or washed away somewhere else by the floodwaters, and he’s determined to find them. Loehr said his brother’s headstone was handmade by their cousin 20 years ago, and it’s irreplaceable. “You can’t replace something that somebody put their love into 20 years ago with so much meaning and love, and all that love is washed away,\" Loehr said.

InformNet registers more than 3,000 students annually in Grade 9 to 12 independent-study courses. Combining fall, winter and summer intakes, enrolment has more than doubled since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Academic integrity issues have also surged, so much so that InformNet hired a technology company to start monitoring test-takers in November, principal Tom Tarrant told the Free Press. “We proctor every test. It’s really levelled the playing field again,” said Tarrant, who’s been at the helm of the e-school for the last 10 years. He said that ChatGPT, along with other artificial intelligence chatbots and online resources, have tempted some students to cut corners in recent years. InformNet, based out of Jameswood Alternative School in Winipeg, is operated jointly by the St. James-Assiniboia and Pembina Trails school divisions. The administrative team has allocated $150,000 throughout the school year and $50,000 for summer school, which runs until July 30, for Integrity Advocate services. Tarrant said they chose the firm founded in St. Albert, Alta., because it’s Canadian-owned and offers “passive” proctoring. Integrity Advocate does not require students to install anything on their computers and allows teachers to review content that is flagged prior to making any hard determinations, he noted. Students require a microphone,...",

Politico cited internal documents showing that NASA plans to cut 2,694 staff members through a combination of early retirement offers, buyouts, and deferred resignations. Key details from the report include: 875 GS-15 employees, the agency's most senior civil servants, are among those leaving. 1,818 of the departing staff work in core mission roles; the remainder are in support functions, such as IT and finance. Departures are widespread, with Goddard Space Flight Center losing the most (607), followed by Johnson (366), Kennedy (311), and HQ (307). \"The departures follow a proposed White House budget for 2026 that would slash NASA's funding by 25 percent and cut over 5,000 staff,\" the report said, adding, \"The cuts, if enacted by Congress, would force the agency to operate with the smallest budget and staff since the early 1960s.\" Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, told the left-leaning outlet, \"You're losing the managerial and core technical expertise of the agency.\" He asked: \"What's the strategy and what do we hope to achieve here?\" The proposed large-scale reorganization and reduction comes a day after the Supreme Court announced President Trump can move ahead with plans to slash the federal...",

It's not where I want to be, but I have six weeks to do everything humanly possible to be ready and better at the U.S. Open.\" He added: \"It's my favorite tournament of the year, and I go after it.\" The American also said that facing a player of Sinner's caliber showed, especially since Shelton admitted it felt like he was taken out of his rhythm during his match.

There was a different tone with the Wildcats compared to last year.

        "content": "Di tengah memanasnya dinamika internal Kamar Dagang dan Industri (Kadin) Jawa Barat, sejumlah pengurus Kadin daerah angkat bicara dan mengimbau agar perhatian tak terpecah oleh maklumat-maklumat sepihak yang dinilai tidak sah secara organisasi. Sorotan pun mengarah pada maklumat yang dikeluarkan oleh sekelompok orang yang mengklaim sebagai Ketua Kadin kabupaten/kota di Jawa Barat. Ketua Kadin Kota Bogor, Maryanti Dona Hasanah, menanggapi kemunculan maklumat tersebut dengan tegas. Ia mengajak para pengurus Kadin di berbagai daerah untuk tidak memberikan perhatian lebih terhadap isi maklumat yang menurutnya menyimpang dari Anggaran Dasar/Anggaran Rumah Tangga (AD/ART) maupun mekanisme resmi organisasi. Menurut Dona, saat ini sebaiknya seluruh energi diarahkan untuk mendukung langkah-langkah yang sedang ditempuh oleh selaku Ketua . \"Lebih baik fokus mendukung program yang sedang dilakukan Ketua yang sedang melakukan pembenahan administrasi kadinda kota/kabupaten,\" ujarnya. Ia juga menyampaikan harapannya agar Musyawarah Provinsi (Muprov) segera diselenggarakan demi menentukan kepemimpinan definitif Kadin Jawa Barat. Dona menyebut, sosok yang terpilih nanti idealnya adalah figur yang punya rekam jejak mumpuni serta visi dan misi yang kuat untuk memajukan Kadin di tingkat provinsi. Dukungan terhadap sikap Dona juga disuarakan oleh Ketua Kadin Karawang, Emay Ahmad Maehi.

        "content": "BUFFALO, N.Y. — The race for mayor in the City of Buffalo has now shifted over for the general election in November and the Republicans are now gearing up behind their candidate. Despite the overwhelming Democratic registration advantage, GOP leaders feel they can find city voter support over the endorsed Democratic candidate. From his primary election night win , the Democratic candidate for mayor is already drawing the \"socialist\" label from Republicans who also sought to connect him with the other Democratic primary winner for mayor in New York City. At the same time their GOP candidate, James Gardner, on Wednesday sought to boost his chances despite a certain reality as he told reporters: \"By party registration there's no doubt about it that Buffalo is a Democratic city. But if you look at the values that Buffalonians have, those aren't the values of the Democratic Party of Erie County, and certainly not the Democratic Party of New York State.\" Gardner added: \"What people want is common sense. They don't want ideological talking points. They don't want spoon-fed socialism.\" The campaign of Democratic candidate Sean Ryan responded that the Republican slings at him were \"laughable\" and a \"scare tactic.\" That is even as Ryan's campaign during the primary used divisive GOP figure and developer Carl Paladino with their own linkage strategy against another opponent as Paladino's son William got involved as a fundraiser. Ryan spoke to 2 On Your Side Wednesday as he still...",

The marbled murrelet forages on open waters throughout the Salish Sea, but nests in inland old-growth forest habitat. The loss of nesting habitat, combined with oil spills and net fisheries, has brought about a decline in population for the species, according to the department. The state listed the species as threatened in 1993, then as endangered in 2016. The species has continued to decline at a rate of about 5% per year. The species' most recent population estimates within the state have dropped from 7,500 birds in 2015 to 4,400 in 2023. The department's draft periodic status review for the species concludes that the species continues to lose habitat, and that the murrelet could disappear from regions within the state in the next several decades. The state completes draft periodic status reviews every five years to assess species’ populations, habitat trends and management activities. The listing recommendation is part of the draft periodic status review process. \"Without effective action soon, Washington’s marbled murrelet population may become extinct in Washington in the coming decades,\" Jen Mannas, department marine species lead, said in a news release. \"Continued protection and expanded conservation efforts are essential to prevent that outcome.\" Those interested in commenting on extending the listing can do so through email to...",

But we’re just now learning how angry some of them are. It’s not just grandstanding Democratic lawmakers like Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. Axios reports that “at town halls in their districts and in one-on-one meetings with constituents and activists,” Crockett’s more moderate Democratic House colleagues are “facing a growing thrum of demands to break the rules, fight dirty – and not be afraid to get hurt.” “Our own base is telling us that what we’re doing is not good enough,” said one Democratic lawmaker (out of nine) quoted in the Axios article. “Some of them have suggested ... what we really need to do is be willing to get shot [in protests at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities] ... that there needs to be blood to grab the attention of the press and the public.” Another lawmaker told Axios that constituents say “civility isn’t working” and to get ready for “violence ... to fight to protect our democracy.” And another said, “It’s like ... the Roman Coliseum. People just want more and more of this spectacle.” Obviously, these are Democrats who have moved beyond the defeat-them-at-the-ballot-box stage of politics, and even beyond the protest-by-civil-disobedience stage. They’re ready to turn a political fight into a physical fight. Violence is already going on. In Alvarado, Texas, a militant group broadly allied with Democratic...",

U.S. attorneys cited multiple occasions where Martinez, a Mexican national, was detained and deported out of the U.S. in its response filed July 7 to an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus filed by Upper Seven Law attorneys July 3. \"For example, in 2007, the United States voluntarily returned Martinez on two occasions after he illegally entered the United States.

Lujan also offered a tentative list to the Mayors’ Council of Guam during their regular meeting. “We’ve done a survey and we’re in the process of finishing up the island on the east side. Homes, businesses, and commercial buildings [from] 1975 are considered eligible, so think about it as you go around your villages,” Lujan told mayors and vice mayors. The nationwide statute for when a location or landmark can be submitted for national recognition is 50 years. This applies to various memorial sites and battlegrounds throughout Guam, such as Manenggon, Asan and Apra Harbor. “We are a resource for you,” Lujan said. “We have a lot of data and information for us to work together from a historical point of view or archaeological point of view to add value to your village.” Sinajana Mayor Robert Hofmann, vice president of MCOG, asked about the likelihood of other memorial sites becoming National Historical Landmarks after the Manenggon Memorial was designated one in December 2024. While Lujan’s intention is to submit as many as he can, he said it is “harder to justify a memorial than a battlefield.” However, should a memorial site be successfully added to the National Register, it will receive additional financial support for maintenance and preservation, he...",

(Ret), USAFR, NC. \"All anesthesia providers are trained in and use the exact same techniques to administer anesthesia, yet no other providers face the same cut – UnitedHealthcare is blatantly targeting CRNAs, based on their licensure alone. This action is unlawful, unacceptable, and unconscionable, particularly as our nation continues to face a shortage of anesthesia providers.\" The policy is targeted specifically at anesthesia services appended with the QZ modifier, meaning CRNAs working independently and legally working to the top of their license. This is in direct conflict with the federal provider non-discrimination provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Christopher Martinez, 31, listed in court documents as Christopher Martinez Marvan, was detained by federal agents July 1 following a traffic stop by Helena police for expired registration near the intersection of Billings and Montana avenues. U.S. attorneys cited multiple occasions where Martinez, a Mexican national, was detained and deported out of the U.S. in its response filed July 7 to an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus filed by Upper Seven Law attorneys July 3. \"For example, in 2007, the United States voluntarily returned Martinez on two occasions after he illegally entered the United States. In 2021, law enforcement arrested Martinez four times after he illegally entered the United States,\" the U.S. attorney's office said in court documents. Christopher Martinez pictured with a member of his family. Martinez was detained by ICE agents in Helena on July 1. The petition is scheduled to be heard Thursday in federal court in Missoula. The detainee — who lived in Helena with his wife, Maria Pacheco, a U.S. citizen, and their four children — was expelled from the country in 2021 on May 5, May 15, May 26 and June 2, according to documents.

William F. Medley, bishop for the Owensboro diocese. \"When I first came here 15 years ago, there were probably seven or eight priests living there. We haven't had our more recent retirees interested in going in there because its dated, and it wasn't well designed for seniors anyway. Bishop (John) McRaith told me when he lived there, he said, 'I wish I knew then what I know now, having moved in there.' \"For example, the bathrooms, there was no special consideration given to seniors' needs.\" Renovating the apartments had been a consideration, but Medley said that quickly proved unrealistic. \"Our first plan was to go in and figure out if maybe we could take these eight units and redesign the whole thing and have four units,\" he said. \"But moving all of those walls, (bathrooms) and all that, it was just beyond. We tried to explore with some other parties if they could utilize it in some way, but any use would have such a massive investment that we really are going to find it's probably cheaper...",

        "content": "The iPhone 17 Air is now rumored to come in four colorways: black, silver, light gold, and light blue. The light blue will be \"very light\" according to one leaker, barely blue at all and more white in a lot of lighting scenarios. The subtlety theme continues with the light gold version, which is muted and not at all an in-your-face shade of gold. It seems like the overarching theme of this device will be lightness and thinness, and Apple doesn't want its colors to get in the way of that. The iPhone 17 Air is now rumored to sport the A19 Pro chip, though a lesser version than the one featured in the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max . Still, it's a step up from what the iPhone 16 Plus had to work with, and let's not forget that the iPhone 17 Air is replacing the iPhone 16 Plus. It will also get the same RAM amount as the Pros. So its only downsides will be the laughable battery capacity and the fact that it only has one rear camera. Perhaps a lot of people will be willing to overlook those in the name of thinness (5.5mm to 5.65mm) and lightness (145g). Via",

This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration. Onshore wind farms cost less to build and operate than natural gas plants on average in most regions of the United States, even without tax credits. Though natural gas plants are available to...",

        "content": "President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the U.S. would impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil after a public spat this week with his Brazilian counterpart who called him an unwanted \"emperor.\" In a letter, Trump linked the tariffs to Brazil's treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro who is on trial over charges of plotting a coup to stop President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office in 2023. The levies were imposed due \"in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans,\" the letter said. Brazil's real currency added to earlier losses to fall over 2% against the dollar after the announcement, and companies such as planemaker Embraer and oil major Petrobras also suffered setbacks in the U.S. stock market, as markets reacted to levies that are expected to inflict great pain in Brazil. The Brazilian government didn't immediately comment on Trump's tariffs, but Lula, his vice-president, his finance minister, and others were called to an emergency meeting in Brasilia on Wednesday night to discuss the new levies. The U.S. is Brazil's second-largest trading partner after China and the tariffs are a major increase from the 10% that were announced in April.

Namun menurutnya kebijakan tarif impor AS sebesar 32 persen bagi RI, memberikan kesadaran betapa penting negara dapat berdiri di atas kaki sendiri.

DENVER , July 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize how businesses operate, a growing number of small business owners are asking the same question: Where's the AI that's actually built for me? Ally Solutions, an AI tech startup headquartered in Denver , is answering that call, quietly becoming the go-to provider of affordable, human-like voice and chat assistants for small business owners across the U.S. While AI quickly becomes a standard tool for larger businesses, small teams are still struggling to access the tools they need. Most are either priced out, overwhelmed by complexity, or ignored altogether. Ally is changing that dynamic by giving small businesses a 24/7 AI-powered \"front desk\" without the enterprise price tag or technical barrier. Earlier this month, the company announced a new pricing model. $450 / month for Voice AI with unlimited minutes and full onboarding support. With the lowest price points in the industry, Ally is swiftly following through on its mission: to help business owners handle calls, boost customer support and conversions, and stay focused on what matters.

        "content": "The Trump administration has resumed sending some weapons to Ukraine, a week after the Pentagon had directed that some deliveries be paused, U.S. officials said Wednesday. The weapons heading into Ukraine include 155 mm munitions and precision-guided rockets known as GMLRS, two officials told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been announced publicly. It’s unclear exactly when the weapons started moving. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the pause on some shipments last week to allow the Pentagon to assess its weapons stockpiles, in a move that caught the White House by surprise. Affected was Patriot missiles, the precision-guided GMLRS, Hellfire missiles, Howitzer rounds and more, taking not only Ukrainian officials and other allies by surprise but also U.S. lawmakers and other parts of the Trump administration, including the State Department. It was not clear if a pause on Patriot missiles would hold. The $4 million munition is in high demand and was key to defending a major U.S. air base in Qatar last month as Iran launched a ballistic missile attack in response to the U.S. targeting its nuclear facilities. President Donald Trump announced Monday that the U.S. would continue to deliver defensive weapons to Ukraine. He has sidestepped questions about who ordered the pause in exchanges with reporters this week. “I would know if a decision is made. I will know,” Trump said Wednesday. “I will be the first to know. In fact,...",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Elie Saab , the Lebanese designer long favored on the red carpet, returned to familiar territory on Wednesday, with fall haute couture — and did so unapologetically. Fashion insiders gathered in Paris among marble columns as models descended a gilded stone staircase to the strains of harpsichord music, setting the tone for a collection steeped in historical romance. Saab leaned into his signature codes: sumptuous velvets, gowns gathered at the back, and pearl and jewel-adorned chokers. Floral appliqués — another hallmark — appeared throughout, anchoring the collection in the romanticism that has defined the house for decades. This was a particularly thoughtful collection, evoking Romantic silhouettes from the turn of the 19th century in Europe. The soft draping and historical references gave the show a sense of emotional depth beyond its surface opulence. The color palette ranged from deep emeralds and sapphires to dusky mauves, offering a moody backdrop for the jewel-encrusted embroidery that shimmered under the lights. Among the standout pieces were gowns with cascading trains and bejeweled details, encasing the body in a kind of luxurious cage. Though luxury and opulence may be Saab’s well-trodden path, he showed that consistency remains its own form of artistry. Saab’s couture is less about surprise and more about control — control of silhouette, embellishment, and fantasy. Where other houses have veered into avant-garde or gender-fluid territory this...",

PSG mampu menambah keunggulan pada menit 24 lewat sontekan Fabian Ruiz, dan tambahan satu gol dari Goncalo Ramos dalam 10 menit terakhir Waktu normal (87').

Perubahan yang terjadi di lini pertahanan Real Madrid di bawah asuhan Xabi Alonso dalam pertandingan ini menggambarkan betapa banyak kelemahan mereka. Terutama dalam 10 menit pertama yang mematikan. Dua gol hanya dalam tempo 5 menit. Dua kesalahan fatal pemain bertahan Los Blancos dibayar mahal dengan gol lawan.

Canal Fest has been a shared summer tradition between the cities of Tonawanda and North Tonawanda for more than 40 years. But this year, the festival won't look the same on both sides of the canal. In Tonawanda, the event will run six days instead of eight after city leaders voted to scale back. With Tonawanda stepping back, North Tonawanda is taking on more responsibility, including hosting all the rides. City officials still expect more than 100,000 people to attend on both sides of the canal. North Tonawanda Mayor Austin Tylec said they don't anticipate overwhelming crowds on just one side. \"I think it's still going to be a successful event even with the reduction on the Tonawanda side with days. It is still going to have the meat and bones of Canal Fest. We aren't too nervous about being overworked in our first responders, police, fire, parks, DPW. We're confident we can bear that extra weight,\" Mayor Tylec said. Despite the changes, both cities say Canal Fest remains a celebration of summer, community and now, compromise.

        "content": "VATICAN CITY, — Pope Leo XIV prayed Wednesday for the world to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis and “hear the cry of the poor,” as he celebrated the first papal Mass using a new set of prayers and readings inspired by Pope Francis' environmental legacy. The Mass, in the gardens of the Vatican’s new ecological educational center at the papal summer estate in Castel Gandolfo, indicated a strong line of ecological continuity with Francis , who made environmental protection a hallmark of his pontificate. Wearing flowing green vestments, Leo presided at the Mass in front of a statue of the Madonna and at the foot of a reflecting pool, immersed in the lush green gardens on an unusually cool summer day. He said the world needed to change its mindset about the planet and what is causing “the world to burn.” “We must pray for the conversion of so many people, inside and out of the church, who still don't recognize the urgency of caring for our common home,” he said. “We see so many natural disasters in the world, nearly every day and in so many countries, that are in part caused by the excesses of being human, with our lifestyle.” The private Mass was celebrated for about 50 staffers of the Laudato Si center, named for Francis’ 2015 environmental encyclical, in which the first pope from the Global South blasted the way wealthy countries and multinational corporations had exploited the Earth and its most vulnerable people for profit. Leo approved the new Mass formula “for...",

Interestingly, this same accusation went for the immediate past President of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari. While the immediate past President is from the Northern part of the country, the current President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is from the southern part of the country. The allegation simply was that while the former president populated the offices with Nigerians of northern extraction, the current president is recruiting largely from the southern part. The validity or otherwise of this allegation is not the crux of my intervention, and as such, I will not dissipate energy on trying to justify it or otherwise. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1718806029429-0'); }); The essence of this intervention is to actually appraise the inherent advantages in the appointment of competent hands into public offices regardless of extraction while balancing the equities.

By this, I will be ready and willing to have my competent team from a pool than diverse people that are incompetent. The...",

        "content": "The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has been sued in an effort to compel release of public records related to expanded federal immigration enforcement at the county jail. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada filed the complaint Wednesday in Clark County District Court. “The Nevada Public Records Act exists to ensure that government agencies, including law enforcement, are open and transparent,” ACLU of Nevada senior staff attorney Sadmira Ramic wrote in a news release. Ramic said the civil rights organization had requested records “months ago to better understand how (Metro’s) policies are affecting our community but we have been delayed or blocked at every turn.” The ACLU filed records requests related to Metro’s immigration policy two days after President Donald Trump took office and in early June after the police department signed up for a voluntary 287(g) agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Clark County Detention Center. The federal program allows Metro staff to execute immigration warrants for “foreign born” inmates booked at the jail, giving ICE up to 48 hours after they’re set to be released on local charges. Before the 287(g) agreement went into effect in mid-June, Metro flagged certain migrant inmates accused of violent crimes, domestic violence, and DUI. The list of reportable crimes was expanded to include theft-related arrests under the Laken Riley Act, which Trump signed into law in late January. ‘Foreign born’...",

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save LOS ANGELES — Gymnast and social media influencer Olivia Dunne was all set to buy her first home, and it wasn't just any home. Dunne had a contract in place to buy a $1.6 million apartment that was once owned by baseball great Babe Ruth on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. It ended up not being a Dunne deal. The recent LSU graduate won't be moving into the former digs of the player known to fans as \"the Bambino\" because the building's co-op board rejected her application. In a video posted to TikTok on Tuesday, Dunne told her 8 million followers that she is \"so upset\" after coming so close to residing in the same seventh-floor apartment where the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox legend is said to have lived from 1929-40. \"It was Babe Ruth's apartment,\" said Dunne, who grew up less than an hour away in Hillside, N.J. \"So naturally, like, I'm telling everybody. I'm excited. I was gonna buy it and I was gonna pay with cash, like I wanted this apartment bad.\" The 2025 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model said her real estate agent \"was so confident\" the deal would go through that she brought boyfriend Paul Skenes, the Pittsburgh Pirates' All-Star pitcher and former LSU standout, to see the place. \"I got an interior...",

The Trump administration has switched from “a charity-based foreign aid model” to partnerships showing that other nations have “the ability and willingness to help themselves.” A study published in the Lancet medical journal projects Trump’s shift will lead to more than 14 million additional deaths globally by 2030, including 4.5 million children.

According to the Spokane Fire Department, the first of the 15 fires was reported just after midnight on July 8 in front of the Red Wagon in Riverfront Park. Crews arrive to find a scorched landscaping bush. Just after 4:15 a.m. that same morning, a second fire was reported outside My Fresh Basket. Around 30 minutes later, firefighters responded to two more fires near East Spokane Falls Boulevard and North Pine Street. One of these fires was burning in bushes and another had damaged an EV charging station. Just before 5:15 a.m., firefighters were sent to the area of South Sherman Street and South Sheridan Avenue for two separate homes on fire as well as several small fires in a two-block radius. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Spokane Fire investigating multiple suspected arsons in downtown Spokane Later Tuesday afternoon, SFD and Spokane County Fire District 9 put out a grass fire in a field between two homes on North Atlantic Street. Around 2:30 p.m., crews also responded to two brush fires along the Centennial Trail near West Elliot Drive. While at those fires, firefighters found two more fires that had spread rapidly uphill toward Spokane Falls Community College.

        "content": "The School Lunch Act, passed into law in 1954, did not go so far as to require schools to serve meals. Nonetheless the vast majority of schools in Japan have taken the statute to heart: Based on data from 2014, 99.2% of the country's primary schools and 87.9% of junior high schools provided meals to their students. In the postwar period, school lunch programs have come to be regarded as a resounding success, having not only contributed to Japan's low rates of obesity among children, but also credited with narrowing the socioeconomic gaps in consumption of fruits and vegetables. Recently, an outcry was heard over a meal served at a public primary school in Fukuoka City. As can be seen by an accompanying photo in Weekly Playboy (July 14), the lunch consisted of a bowl of rice, a container of milk, a bowl of miso soup and a single, lonely piece of fried chicken, plopped in the center of a dish with space for at least one or two more. What's the explanation for this miserly meal? The city's board of education insisted the meal in question met nutritional standards; but its appearance seemed so paltry that some were moved to post such remarks on social networks as, \"The fare served in prisons is better than this.\" Along with the meager portions, a second problem has surfaced in the occasional finding of inedible foreign objects in the food. Yuki Inoue, vice president NKK ( Nihon Kyushokugyou Keiei Sokenkyujo ), a consulting organization working with meal caterers, offered this...",

        "content": "As new food vendors prepare to set up shop at the Capitol complex this summer, current workers say many in their ranks have not received offers to keep their jobs. The House chief administrative officer in May announced that a slate of eateries will take over starting this August, including a Starbucks replacing the existing Dunkin’, a QDOBA, Panera and more. Some cheered the news as a sign that the House was turning the page on a lackluster dining era. But members of Unite Here Local 23, the union representing nearly 200 House food service workers currently employed by Sodexo, said the decision was made without considering them. And with just a few weeks before the changes take effect, many are wondering if they’ll still have jobs come next month. “We have no idea ... what all of this is going to look like,” said Porshia McCullum, who has been with Sodexo on the Hill since 2019 and is a union steward. “It’s stressful coming to work for me, because people want answers.” Sodexo’s departure wasn’t necessarily a shock to the workforce, according to the union. The French catering giant was reaching the end of its agreement with the House this year, and Jesse Seitel, an organizing director at Unite Here, said the union was aware that the contract was out for bid.

These two factors (religion and culture) and, perhaps, many others have kept many Nigerian women away from the knowledge and freedom they require to make informed decisions about their health, education, human rights particularly reproductive health rights. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1718806029429-0'); }); Sadly, despite several campaigns that have lasted for decades championed by local and international organisations, many women in Nigeria are still held down in silence and obscurity due to the strong and significant roles that religion and culture play as regards the level of liberty a woman could enjoy particularly in decision of sexual and reproductive health. Ummi Salisu, an indigene of Katsina State but resident in Abuja, told journalists at an event in Abuja recently that she got married six years ago, and her father solely decided who became her husband. “I was just informed about the decision a few days before my husband and his people came to carry me.“I couldn’t contest the decision because it has been the tradition for years, and no one particularly the women could contest it. Many women passed through that tradition, and many are still being subjected to that tradition....",

But with temperatures expected to soar, organizers are emphasizing sun safety for attendees. The current forecast for the festival predicts near-cloudless skies and temperatures approaching 90 degrees, which may be ideal for some but also pose risks of dehydration, sunburn, and heatstroke. This could catch both residents and visitors off-guard in Butte's typically cooler climate. \"It's kind of a catch-22, where in general, we don't have to worry as much, but on the hot days we have to worry a little extra, since we're not acclimatized to it,\" said Trey Vincent, a licensed athletic trainer of Intermountain Health. \"That puts us at a little bigger risk for heat illness.\" According to Vincent, children ages four and younger as well as seniors pose the biggest risk to various types of heat illness. To help counter the extreme conditions, Intermountain Health will have a booth at the Folk Festival near the Original Mineyard, offering sunscreen, UV tests, and additional information. \"We need people to make sure that they're taking extra precautions that they wouldn't normally take on an average day,\" Vincent said. \"Maybe they're drinking more water, or wearing SPF, hats and sunglasses.\" \"Getting in the shade occasionally, giving yourself breaks from the sun, [is also important],\" Vincent added. \"I know we...",

But with temperatures expected to soar, organizers are emphasizing sun safety for attendees. The current forecast for the festival predicts near-cloudless skies and temperatures approaching 90 degrees, which may be ideal for some but also pose risks of dehydration, sunburn, and heatstroke. This could catch both residents and visitors off-guard in Butte's typically cooler climate. \"It's kind of a catch-22, where in general, we don't have to worry as much, but on the hot days we have to worry a little extra, since we're not acclimatized to it,\" said Trey Vincent, a licensed athletic trainer of Intermountain Health. \"That puts us at a little bigger risk for heat illness.\" According to Vincent, children ages four and younger as well as seniors pose the biggest risk to various types of heat illness. To help counter the extreme conditions, Intermountain Health will have a booth at the Folk Festival near the Original Mineyard, offering sunscreen, UV tests, and additional information. \"We need people to make sure that they're taking extra precautions that they wouldn't normally take on an average day,\" Vincent said. \"Maybe they're drinking more water, or wearing SPF, hats and sunglasses.\" \"Getting in the shade occasionally, giving yourself breaks from the sun, [is also important],\" Vincent added. \"I know we...",

An amendment tucked into the more than 1,000-page budget legislation by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo , R-Idaho, changed the tax code, limiting the amount gamblers can deduct from their winnings from 100% to 90% of their losses. For example, someone may win $100,000 during a Las Vegas casino trip, but for the year, have $100,000 in gambling losses which they can write off on their taxes. Under the new bill, that person would now have to pay taxes on $10,000 in gambling income under the withholding change in the bill. It didn’t take long for gaming observers to express their outrage at the change, which would go into effect in 2026. Gaming consultant Steve Ruddock, writing on Substack , said the bill “sent shockwaves through the gambling world with a contentious amendment that could significantly impact professional and some recreational bettors.” Las Vegas-based Gary Kondler, who prepares taxes for full-time sports bettors and poker players from across the country, told The Washington Post about the “absolute chaos” fielding clients’ panicked calls. CBRE Equity Research gaming analyst John DeCree wrote in a research note that the change could cause some high-volume gamblers, such as poker players and sports bettors, to break even or lose money in a given year. “Although this customer isn't particularly profitable for the industry given the...",

Russia has recently sought to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses by launching major attacks that include increasing numbers of decoy drones. The most recent one appeared aimed at disrupting Ukraine's vital supply of Western weapons. Lutsk, a city that's home to airfields used by the Ukrainian army, was the hardest hit, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It lies near the border with Poland in western Ukraine, a region that is a crucial hub for receiving foreign military aid. The attack comes at a time of increased uncertainty over the supply of crucial American weapons and as U.S.-led peace efforts have stalled. Zelenskyy said that the Kremlin was \"making a point\" with its barrage. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces took aim at Ukrainian air bases and that \"all the designated targets have been hit.\" Meanwhile, Ukraine fired drones into Russia overnight, killing three people in the Kursk border region, including a 5-year-old boy, the local governor said. The Russian attack, which included 728 drones and 13 missiles, had the largest number of drones fired in a single night in the war. On Friday, Russia fired 550 drones, less than a week after it launched 477, both the largest at the...",

The restrictions will go into effect on the following stretches of rivers and will be in place until further notice: The restrictions go into effect when water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three straight days or when flows drop below critical levels that can harm cold-water fish. If water temperatures reach 77 degrees, it can be deadly for species like trout. went into effect on June 19 on the upper stretch for the Madison River coming out of Yellowstone National Park and on July 2 for the lower section from the Warm Springs day-use area down to the Jefferson River.

More than two-thirds of Montana is experiencing moderate drought, including most of the area where the restrictions are going into effect.

Luminary Theatre (formerly the Legacy Theatre) is preparing to launch its inaugural production, Fiddler on the Roof, directed by veteran theatre artist Peggy Horton Price, with Nicholas Moose as Musical Director and MacKenzie Myers as Choreographer. Performances will be held at Heritage Fellowship on the following dates: • Friday, August 8, 2025 – 7 p.m. • Saturday, August 9, 2025 – 3 p.m. • Friday, August 15, 2025 – 7 p.m. • Saturday, August 16, 2025 – 3 p.m. Luminary Theatre continues the proud tradition started with the Legacy Theatre with a new name and fresh vision. Set in the tight-knit village of Anatevka, Fiddler on the Roof, book by Joseph Stein, music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, produced by Harold Prince and choreography by Jerome Robbins, tells the story of Tevye, a poor milkman, who struggles to maintain his Jewish traditions as outside influences encroach upon his family’s lives. This timeless musical explores themes of family, faith, and change through unforgettable songs like “Tradition,” “If I Were a Rich Man,” and “Sunrise, Sunset.” Benjamin Myers leads the cast with depth and humor as Tevye, alongside Connie Sexton as his strong-willed wife, Golde. Their daughters come to life through standout performances by Crystal LaPlue (Tzeitel), Mercy LeMarr (Hodel), Hannah Myers (Chava), Harper Williamsand Nora Whaley (Shprintze and Bielke).

The Pentagon has just a quarter of the Patriot missiles it needs . According to the Guardian , \"The United States only has about 25% of the Patriot missile interceptors it needs for all of the Pentagon’s military plans after burning through stockpiles in the Middle East in recent months, an alarming depletion that led to the Trump administration freezing the latest transfer of munitions to Ukraine.\" US weapons manufacturers can only produce approximately 500 Patriot missiles per year . The US used dozens of interceptors to defend Israel from Iranian retaliatory attacks last month. Additionally, the Pentagon engaged in its largest Patriot battle in history to repel a symbolic Iranian missile attack on the US airbase in Qatar. The US stockpile of air and missile defenses has been drained to aid Ukraine during the war with Russia . Missile interceptors are in short supply in the West. In May, Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio told Congress that “The Ukrainians asked for air defense systems – Patriot systems, which, frankly, we don’t have.” \"In fact, if the Ukrainians asked for anything additional, they asked for air defense systems, Patriot systems, which, frankly, we do not have. But we cannot produce them fast enough. And one of the problems we face in Ukraine is that ammunition is being used up much faster than we can...",

        "content": "Hoot-owl fishing restrictions will go into effect 2 p.m. Thursday on portions of five rivers in southwest and central Montana because of warm water temperatures and low flows. The restrictions mean anglers will have to stop fishing between 2 p.m. and midnight on the designated stretches of the rivers in order to protect cold-water species of fish, like trout, Montana Fish, Wildfire & Parks said Wednesday. A tributary of the Jefferson River, the Big Hole has long been a favorite destination for not only fishing, but floating as well. The restrictions will go into effect on the following stretches of rivers and will be in place until further notice: Past sampling by Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks suggests that populations of brown trout are at historic lows in sections of the Big Hole and other rivers in the Jefferson River Basin. The restrictions go into effect when water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three straight days or when flows drop below critical levels that can harm cold-water fish. If water temperatures reach 77 degrees, it can be deadly for species like trout. Hoot-owl restrictions went into effect on June 19 on the upper stretch for the Madison River coming out of Yellowstone National Park and on July 2 for the lower section from the Warm Springs day-use area down to the Jefferson River. They are also in effect on the Sun River from the mouth of Muddy Creek to the Highway 287 bridge. DNRC's drought outlook for Montana is grim going into hot, dry...",

Excerpts:You mentioned clinical decision support in your recent presentation. What exactly does it mean, and why should Nigerian hospitals care about it? googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1718806029429-0'); }); Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is software that help physicians make better and informed decisions at the point of care by giving them patient-specific information and knowledge that has been intelligently filtered. In Nigeria, where there are many patients and little specialized knowledge in many fields, CDS can help make sure evidence-based recommendations are followed to reduce medication errors, and expedite triage, all of which will improve patient outcomes and save costs.How does AI fit into the picture?AI is responsible for introducing predictive analytics and machine learning into the CDS. An AI model trained on local maternal health data, for instance, might identify high-risk pregnancies before problems occur. This translates into early intervention in settings with limited resources, which is a huge benefit when there is a shortage of specialized outreach. $(document).ready(function(){(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})}); Nigeria still struggles with...",

On Wednesday, Williamson County officials confirmed three people died. However, they said one person from Leander, identified as Jay Dunn, is still missing. Jay's son Brandon Dunn said family checked in on him during the floods over the weekend, and panic set in when a welfare check was done and he was nowhere to be found. Dunn said he and his brother - who don't live in the area - immediately drove down. Jay's phone and wallet were found inside his home, which sits along County Road 177 by Brushy Creek. Dunn said it's an area where water tends to rise. \"He's usually pretty good about staying away from [the creek], [it] doesn't get up to the porch, but we couldn't get ahold of him,\" said Dunn. Dive teams with the Williamson County Sheriff's Office were in the water Wednesday afternoon outside of Dunn's home. During a press conference, Williamson County officials noted that a scooter and \"articles of clothing\" were found on Dunn's property. The scooter remained on the grass by the creek Wednesday. Officials in Leander said an \"extensive search\" started on July 6 and, \"evidence at the scene suggested he may have been near the river when water levels rose.\" Dunn is expected to turn 75 in September. His son said his home along County Road 177 was not only home to him and his brother, but also...",

The facility provides 10 assisted living units, and offers round-the-clock staffing, meal services, cleaning, with the possibility of personal care through Home and Community Care staff. In a release, NFN noted, “The new facility will provide much-needed assisted living units that allow NFN Elders to remain in their home community, surrounded by culture, family and familiar spaces.” Yvette Bellefeuille, a NFN councillor, emphasized, “This project has been decades in the making. The vision has evolved over the years, but the goal has always been the same – to keep our Elders close to home, in a space that reflects their culture and importance to our Nation.” Nipissing First Nation held an official opening on June 30 at 530 Couchie Memorial Drive that drew around 70 attendees. The project was made possible by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s Rapid Housing Initiative, which provided $6.85 million for the project in 2023. Donna Dodgson, CEO of NFN noted, “This is more than a building. It is the result of listening to our members and responding to the gaps they identified. With support from CMHC, we’ve created a place of dignity, connection, and care for our Elders.” David Briggs is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of BayToday, a publication of Village Media.

Dan Evans, 72, and Donald Willi, 71 went on a hike near the Del Rio community in Cocke County on Monday on what was supposed to be a short trek along a ridge. A search party of around 30 individuals was deploying when the two emerged from the wilderness on Tuesday. ““They went up one side of the ridge and come back off on the other side... so they missed their car,” Newport Rescue Squad Lt. Jason Freshour said of their initial “wrong turn.” The search attempt got off to a slow start when rescuers received word that the pair was supposed to hike in an area known as “Buzzard Roost.” The problem with that information is that there are several sites in western North Carolina and in East Tennessee with that moniker. Responders found the right area to search when the car the men were using was found. Freshour said it’s important to know the correct, formal name of where hikers are going and for them to let someone know so, if needed, help can move as quickly as possible. Evans and Willi eventually found a creek and followed it out to a spot on Old 15th Road. “They were extremely lucky and blessed to be able to find water and get back out,” Freshour said. “The terrain is very difficult up there and there were very high temperatures.” Another piece of advice he had was to place a used piece of...",

        "content": "Lungs, the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans, are constantly working. All day, every day, their function is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream; and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Unfortunately, it can also be an entry point for pollutants, irritants, dust, mold, fungus, harmful organisms, and other toxins into your body. These, when released into the atmosphere, mix with air you breathe. So, the very air we breathe in to stay alive sadly, can sabotage our wellness, thereby leading to diseases. Needless to add that the constant assault from impurities can take its toll. And so, daily life toxins overload the body’s natural detoxifying systems accumulating in your lungs and other organs of the body. Because these natural elimination organs are overwhelmed, the toxic burden spreads in the entire body, sapping its energy.Why do you need to cleanse?There is no question about that: as noted above, our daily lives generate toxins, and we live in a toxic environment too. We even manufacture toxins with our own hands. Many people use harsh household cleaners containing ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and other toxic chemicals that can cause ill health ranging from nausea to allergic skin reaction, wheezing or fluid in the lungs. How about your beauty skin products? The products you apply to look your very best, may be what is killing you. In the quest to attain...",

Search and rescue teams are covering a large search area, and boots on the ground says there is a need for more of these dogs. We spoke with Texas Eqqsearch and the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State, who gave us some insight into the role cadaver dogs are playing in search operations. “The cadaver dogs are very invaluable when you're doing searches,” said Dr. Michael Ben Alexander. Dr. Alexander is a canine training coordinator at the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State University. He says when the searches for the missing began, he was contacted by local officials. “We were able to help find teams to come in,” said Dr. Alexander. Teams from Tennessee, Louisiana and Kansas have been called in to aid in search efforts. Dr. Alexander says these teams were trained at Texas State. “The biggest thing that we provide is the opportunity for handlers to work their dogs, on whole bodies, fresh bodies, decomposed bodies, mummified bodies, bodies basically in various stages of decomposition,” said Dr. Alexander. Brenda Peek, Caine Handler with Texas Eqqusearch, is currently assisting in search and recover efforts in Kerr County. Peek says cadaver dogs are key in their searches. “We use drones, we use boats, and sonar equipment. Cadavers, they just can maneuver in and under and through, and get on top of things that that some equipment can't get to,\" said...",

        "content": "BUFFALO, N.Y. — After two men were arrested on gun-related charges near the Tops on Jefferson Avenue, Masten District Councilmember Zeneta Everhart is calling for stronger gun safety education and greater transparency from Buffalo Police. The push comes after Buffalo Police say two men were found with illegal guns and ammunition near the store last month and were allegedly seen passing one of the weapons around before reportedly threatening a man and his daughter outside. The location remains a painful symbol for the community, still reeling from the racist mass shooting that killed 10 people there in May 2022. “We just want to make sure that our businesses in the area understand what their rights are,” Everhart said. Everhart introduced a resolution calling for a formal presentation and Q&A session with the New York State Police — or another agency familiar with gun laws — to help educate business owners on how they can legally restrict firearms from their property. “They can post signage in their store, on windows,” she said. “They can post signage in the parking lots or things like that, just to let people know that that’s a gun-safe zone and they don’t want guns on their property.” Everhart, whose son was seriously injured in the racially motivated 2022 mass shooting, expressed frustration that police never issued a public alert about the latest gun incident. “That is frustrating.

Ernas mengatakan harus dalam kondisi kesehatan yang prima saat pulang, mengingat perjalanannya yang cukup memakan waktu lama. \"Pemberangkatan dari Arab Saudi ke Indonesia itu memang harus pasien dalam keadaan sehat, karena perjalanannya dalam waktu lama,\" jelasnya.

And if that is the lesson, why don’t we learn it already? Wimbledon has not used AI properly. First problem was it missed a ball out. By a foot. The match got stopped and everyone waited four minutes. Yes, it was confirmed the AI got it wrong, so the match resumed. It turned out someone turned the AI off. Then we’re at the quarter finals. AI calls a ball out. It's not. It’s a metre inside the baseline. The match is stopped, the umpire calls the tech people, or whoever, and everyone waits. Yes, it's confirmed it was in and the match resumes. It turns out a ball boy was crossing the net at exactly the moment the ball was moving and the AI can’t handle that. Players are cross. The waiting has broken the game’s momentum. The crowd is cross. They’ve paid to watch the play, not sit around waiting for tech to be checked. On the other side of the world, here, we are again complaining about the TMO in last weekend’s test involving itself too much. Even Wayne Barnes is complaining that the TMO is ruining the continuity of the game. Other sports have already learned this lesson. League has limited what the bunker can look at, football is thinking about limiting the VAR, ice hockey has limited video review and it's the same with volleyball.

        "content": "FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Rich Rodriguez has more gray around the temples than the last time he was at West Virginia, nearly 20 years ago when he bolted for Michigan as one of the hottest coaching prospects in college football. Two more head coaching stops and plenty of losses later, Rodriguez is more than just back at West Virginia . He's home again, in the state where he was born and raised, for a second tour at his alma mater. “I know where the bodies are buried and the traps are laid and kind of understand the environment,” Rodriguez said Wednesday during Big 12 media days at the headquarters of the Dallas Cowboys in the northern suburb of Frisco. “But then again, times have changed.” Rodriguez speaks of a different conference — it was the Big East back then — and the rapidly changing landscape of college athletics, along with the money West Virginia has spent on facilities that wowed the 61-year-old when he got a good look at the campus for the first time in 17 years. Times have certainly changed for a coach who was the youngest in the country as a 24-year-old at Salem in 1988, and two years later took over at tiny Glenville State not far from a hometown that is just 20 miles from the WVU campus in Morgantown. There was the humbling experience starting in 2008 at Michigan, where Rodriguez was fired with a 15-22 record after a three-year stint that began with the first back-to-back losing seasons for the Wolverines in 46 years. Next was a six-year stay at Arizona that ended...",

From Friday to Sunday, the free balloon festival will be held in the open field across from Erie High School, on the northwest corner of County Road 5 and Colliers Parkway. The first balloon launch will begin at 6 a.m. Friday, just after sunrise. On Saturday, there will be both a morning flight and an evening “glow,” the website says. A balloon glow is a display of balloons after sunset, where balloons stay on the ground and light up, the site says. The evening event will also have food trucks, music and face painters, according to the website. The final launch will be at 6 a.m. Sunday morning. It is encouraged to arrive from 5:30-6 a.m. for launch and to get a seat on the mowed hill on the east edge of the field for optimal viewing, the website said. It could be cooler in the morning, around 55 degrees, warming up to 80-90 degrees in the later morning, the site said, so dressing in layers is recommended. Volunteer opportunities were still available as of Wednesday. No prior experience is necessary, but it’s helpful for volunteers to be able to lift equipment. An event map and food truck lists are provided on the website at erieballoonfestival.com/event-guide.",

At about 9:25 a.m., a Trinity Railway Express train collided with an SUV at a rail crossing near Market Center Boulevard and Harry Hines Boulevard, officials said. \"The car was unrecognizable. You can barely tell it was a car,\" said Damani Whitlock, an electrician working nearby who came upon the wreckage shortly after the crash. The train struck the driver’s side of the SUV, pushing the vehicle about 150 yards down the track. Its bumper was torn away, left behind near the intersection—a grim marker of where the tragedy began. Two people in the car died at the scene, officials said. Their names have not yet been released. Nearby, a bent \"Do Not Stop on Tracks\" sign lay on the ground. \"I have seen, especially working here over the last year, I have seen people even when their arms go down, try to get across the tracks by going around,\" Whitlock said. \" And I said you can't stop a train. The train is going to come regardless.\" Four and a half hours after the crash, what remained of the SUV was pulled down the embankment with heavy equipment and loaded onto a tow truck. But investigators stayed. More than six hours later, they were still walking the rails—marking, measuring, and documenting the scene—trying to understand how a routine crossing turned fatal. \"Nothing is more important than your life,\" Whitlock added. \"So why rush, risk anything to get...",

        "content": "HOUSTON — As Mayor John Whitmire's administration aims to accelerate efforts to address homelessness in Houston , City Council will soon consider whether or not to add a revision of the city's civility ordinance to that plan. On Wednesday, Housing and Community Development Director Mike Nichols and Public Safety and Homeland Security Director Larry Satterwhite presented to City Council a report on the administration's progress so far in being able to move homeless people off city streets and connect them with resources as well as why they believe expanding the civility ordinance can help. \"Homelessness, as all of you know, is a complex issue that requires multiple tools to help people move off the street,\" Nichols said. Whitmire hopes ramping up efforts can better link those without a home to pathways that could lead to more permanent housing situations. \"If you get folks in a treatment facility, housing, mental health services, about half of them, if you give them a caseworker, we can solve their problem,\" Whitmire said. Currently, the city's civility ordinance is a targeted approach where residents of a neighborhood have to collect signatures, bring those before City Council, and have the body approve it in order for the ordinance to apply to their part of the city. There are a dozen neighborhoods that have the ordinance, which prohibits people from lying down, sitting or placing personal possessions on city sidewalks from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The proposed expansion of the...",

The floods are now the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976, when Colorado’s Big Thompson Canyon flooded, killing 144 people, said Bob Henson, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections. Crews used backhoes and their bare hands Wednesday to dig through piles of debris that stretched for miles along the Guadalupe River in the search of missing people. “We will not stop until every missing person is accounted for,” Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday. \"Know this also: There very...",

Broward Circuit Judge Martin Fein showed little patience for the state’s insistence that the matters being considered by the Fourth District Court of Appeal leave him with no choice but to delay the trial, which was first put on hold during jury selection in October 2023. Demons, 26, was the most prominent member of the YNW rap collective, with a string of hits including “Suicidal” and “Murder on My Mind.” He is accused of the October 2018 murders of fellow rappers and childhood friends Anthony “YNW Sakchaser” Williams and Christopher “YNW Juvy” Thomas. A co-defendant, Cortlen “YNW Bortlen” Henry, is also awaiting trial. Investigators and prosecutors say the four rappers attended a late-night recording session in Fort Lauderdale and left together in a Jeep driven by Henry. A short time later, Henry pulled up to Memorial Hospital Miramar with Williams, 21, and Thomas, 19, shot to death in the front and rear passenger seats. Henry told police they were victims of a drive-by shooter. Investigators poring over phone records, witness testimony and video from the Fort Lauderdale recording studio determined that Demons, who had been sitting behind Henry, shot and killed his two former friends before they had a chance...",

        "content": "The Trump administration made good on its threat of legal action earlier this week and is suing California for allowing transgender athletes to compete in K-12 sports. The U.S. Department of Justice filed suit Wednesday, two days after the California Department of Education said it would not strip trans athletes of their medals or repeal a 2013 law that allows student-athletes to compete on sports teams and use facilities that reflect their gender identity. The U.S. Department of Education said that law violates cisgender girls’ rights under Title IX and had given California 10 days to change its policies. U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Attorney General Pam Bondi would respond after the state issued its refusal. Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative San Francisco attorney who now heads the DOJ’s civil rights division, invoked Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recent remarks on trans athletes several times , including in the opening paragraph of the suit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The suit names as defendants the state Education Department and the California Interscholastic Federation, a nonprofit that sets standards for school sports. “These discriminatory policies and practices ignore undeniable biological differences between boys and girls, in favor of anamorphous ‘gender identity,’ ” the 24-page filing read. “The results of these illegal policies are stark: girls are displaced from podiums, denied awards, and miss out on...",

The Department of Economic Security confirmed to Capitol Media Services that it is renewing the contract for Allmond to be a \"senior executive consultant'' for the agency. Christian Slater, press aide to Gov. Katie Hobbs, said she is part of the DES \"senior engagement team'' helping veterans access the services they need from the agency. But what's different now is that the new contract comes as DES just announced it had eliminated 5% of its regular staff position because of both elimination of federal grants supporting the unemployment insurance program that is administered by the agency and the federal government shifting costs to the state. The fired workers got 2 1/2-week notices with their final day last week — just days after Allmond's new contract took effect. Slater, however, said that development is irrelevant to Allmond's new contract. \"The workforce reduction at DES was an unfortunate consequence of the Trump administration's reckless cuts that endanger DES' work to combat fraud and efficiently deliver the critical services Arizonans rely on,'' he said. And what of the money being spent — not only on Allmond but a $114,00-a-year separate contract for Marcus Trombetta to work with her — while DES staffers are losing their jobs? \"To conflate the two is...",

Justin also posted a picture on his Instagram of him hugging Hailey, with his face on her neck, and his arms around her. Their backs faced the camera, as they sat in front of the water and enjoyed the view of the boats. He captioned the post with 19 heart eyes emojis and the song, \"Me and My Drink\" by Greg Street featuring Short Dawg and Lil Wayne. The Biebers visited Majorca for Hailey's Rhode \"Lemontini\" drop. The brand has been teasing its new limited edition peptide treatment that is a \"shimmery, sheer gold gloss that smells like a sweet, citrusy lemon cocktail,\" according to an Instagram post.

        "content": "The All Blacks selectors have favoured consistency. Ahead of the second test against France in Wellington this weekend, Scott Robertson, Scott Hansen and Jason Ryan have named a largely settled side with just two injury-enforced changes. Patrick Tuipulotu comes into the starting XV at lock with captain Scott Barrett out of the series due to a calf injury. That sees Tupou Vaa’i remain at blindside flanker. With Barrett out, Ardie Savea has been named as captain. In the backline, Rieko Ioane moves to the right wing with Sevu Reece ruled out due to a concussion, which sees Caleb Clarke join the run-on XV on the left. Both selections see experienced campaigners join the starting side, with Tuipulotu having featured for the All Blacks 51 times and Clarke 29. Damian McKenzie will again come off the bench, after a solid 79-minute outing in Dunedin last weekend. On the bench, utility back Timoci Tavatavanawai will have the opportunity to make his All Blacks debut as he replaces Quinn Tupaea in the only other change. All Blacks rookies Fabian Holland, Christian Lio-Willie, Ollie Norris and Du’Plessis Kirifi all retained their places in the 23. “Test series are a unique and exciting opportunity. Both teams now have a better idea of what they’re going to get on Saturday night, and both will lift for this next occasion. We know where we need to improve,” head coach Robertson said. “It is also awesome to be part of a double-header with the Black Ferns, who will take on Australia at...",

Charles D. Morris, 48, filed a federal lawsuit in 2018 accusing several state prison medical officials of “callous disregard for my personal health and wellbeing” after he was repeatedly denied back surgery that a doctor had deemed necessary. According to the lawsuit, Morris often waited months to receive sufficient care for his back, developed spasms that caused his legs to collapse and only received surgery after a fall in 2018 that left him partially paralyzed. In August, a jury found three Nevada Department of Corrections (NDOC) officers liable and ordered a $1.25 million payout, but the state appealed the ruling. The sides agreed to a settlement of $939,000 earlier this year, and the deal was unanimously approved Tuesday by the state Board of Examiners, a panel composed of the governor, attorney general and secretary of state that approves major contracts and state spending decisions. As part of the settlement, Morris agreed to drop two other pending lawsuits against the state. “No amount of money will make Mr. Morris whole. He is wheelchair bound in his 40’s due to the lack of medical care he was provided by NDOC,” Paola Armeni, Morris’ lawyer, said in a statement. “Nonetheless, the...",

It was, statistically, his least productive season since 2019, when he played in just 12 games for the Kansas City Chiefs. Hill has been rumored to be on the move, and the 31-year-old receiver is still one of the best in the game, but one analyst doesn’t think he’s going anywhere. Yet.

Deputy Agriculture and Food Security Minister Datuk Arthur Joseph Kurup launched the event, held in conjunction with the grand opening of Wagyu by La Moon restaurant, Zenrich Wagyu’s flagship restaurant at The Greens, in Taman Tun Dr Ismail, Kuala Lumpur. That record volume recognised by Asean Records was 192,000kg, a weight that is equivalent to 12.86 million slices or approximately 600 cattle. Asean Records is a regional record-recognition platform established with consent from the AseanSec, celebrating measurable achievements across all 10 Asean member countries. “This record is an example of the hard work of Malaysian companies like Zenrich Wagyu’s, our trade partners, and our commitment to bringing the best of the world to Malaysia while strengthening our place in the global food scene,” said Kurup. “Such import volume also reinforces stronger agricultural trade ties with partners like Japan, apart from building a food culture that is as dynamic as our people.” Japan Embassy in Malaysia deputy chief of mission Daisuke Nihei, who was present at the ceremony, said Malaysia’s appreciation of wagyu reflected the strength of Malay­­­sia-Japan partnership. “The Asean record achieved by Zenrich Wagyu is a great testament to that strength,” he said.

Cafe Nanas Montel, operated by QAF Foods (Malaysia), serves an array of dishes and drinks featuring the tropical fruit, using in-house developed recipes. “We use only the MD2 pineapple species. This particular variety is known for its sweetness, golden yellow colour, uniform size and high vitamin C content,” said Mohd Azli Abdol Mihat, who owns both Cafe Nanas Montel and QAF Foods. “The Malaysian Pineapple Industry Board, an agency tasked with developing the local pineapple industry, recommended that the MD2 species be used. “It takes about 14 months to grow and harvest MD2 pineapples. I work with more than 15 farms all over Peninsular Malay­sia to ensure I have ample supply.” Mohd Azli claimed that MD2 was the pineapple equivalent of Musang King durians.

        "content": "Even though home prices in Utah have grown less than 1% since 2022, Utah in 2024 ranked as the ninth most expensive housing market in the nation. Statewide, the median sales price of a single-family home hit $547,700 in the fourth quarter of 2024. That’s according to a new report published Tuesday, marking another yearly iteration of the “State of the State’s Housing Market” published by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. The report, written by Jim Wood, senior research fellow and one of the state’s leading housing market experts, paints the latest picture of Utah’s housing market for 2024. “High but stable housing prices” underscored Utah’s housing market that year, he wrote. “Stable prices, however, offered little relief to potential homebuyers as high interest rates and housing prices excluded many households from homeownership.” His big takeaway from last year? Utah’s housing marketplace — for both homebuyers and renters — is seeing a “correction” from the COVID-19 era, when low interest rates and new remote work opportunities sparked a homebuying spree, especially in the West. “We’re living in the shadow of that,” Wood told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Tuesday, adding that when prices skyrocket more than 40% in two years like they did from 2020 to 2022, some level of correction is “inevitable.” But the housing market isn’t imploding like it after the 2008 bubble popped. What’s happening now isn’t as dramatic of a correction. Price increases...",

Championship Training Dojang, a Missoula-based school, placed third at the 2025 AAU Taekwondo Nationals. The accomplishment, Master James Corbin said, is a testament to the program's community. \"We have a really great team,\" Corbin added, \"everyone is building each other up.\" Thirty seven athletes competed for Championship Training in gyeorugi, the Korean term for sparring in taekwondo. Athletes were split into brackets based on divisions, some brackets including more than 40 individuals, Corbin said. Over 150 teams made the trip to Utah for the event. Corbin said his high-level athletes consistently train five days a week, each session lasting from 90 minutes up to three hours. The finish marks Championship Training's first podium performance since 2014 when the squad took home first place. The team also placed first in 2013 and second in 2012. \"We've been preparing for it for a year, but it's been great to represent Montana,\" Corbin said. \"It's been a decade since we've been on top of the nation, so it's been good to kind of get back there.\" Carson Cashion is a sports writer for 406 MT Sports.

        "content": "Early estimates show around 40,000 Idahoans could lose Medicaid coverage and an additional 35,000 people could lose their health care insurance through the state marketplace under the sweeping budget reconciliation bill passed last week by Congress. Idaho’s Republican congressional delegation, two senators and two House members, supported the bill. U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo said Sunday on the Senate floor that the bill was “rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in federal spending programs, like Medicaid,” a contention that health care advocates dispute. Idaho’s House representatives supported both an earlier House version of the bill, the Idaho Press reported, and the updated version, created by the Senate, with about $100 billion more in cuts to Medicaid over 10 years. The changes made in the Senate version passed on Tuesday were approved by the House Thursday and will go to President Trump signed it on July 4th. The Senate version of the budget and tax cut bill is expected to cut federal spending on Medicaid by around $1 trillion and increase the number of uninsured Americans by 11.8 million over the next 10 years, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. Erin Riley, outreach and engagement coordinator with the advocacy group Idaho Voices for Children, said the estimates in health care reductions are “conservative,” and many of the losses of coverage would be due to increased paperwork under new requirements in the bill. “In general, we might see...",

Thomas, who was coming off her 16th career triple-double on Monday, was 14 of 24 from the field to top her previous high of 28 points. She also had eight rebounds and five assists. >> Download the 12News app for the latest local breaking news straight to your phone. Phoenix tied it at 69 and 71 before Thomas scored on back-to-back possessions to take a 75-71 lead. She scored 10 points during the Mercury’s game-closing run. DeWanna Bonner, Thomas’ fiancee and former Connecticut Sun teammate, signed with Phoenix as a free agent on Tuesday and played her first game since June 10. Bonner, who spent the first 10 years of her career with the Mercury and helped them win titles in 2009 and 2014, finished with seven points and six rebounds in 26 minutes. Monique Akoa Makani added 13 points and Sami Whitcomb, coming off a career-high 36 points, scored 10 for Phoenix (14-6). The Mercury were without Satou Sabally (right ankle) and Kahleah Copper (right hamstring) for a second straight game. Courtney Williams led Minnesota (17-3) with 21 points. Napheesa Collier added 18 points and Bridget Carleton scored 10. Williams' off-balance 3-pointer with the shot clock winding down gave Minnesota a 67-60 lead with 5:45 remaining. But the Lynx made only two field goals the rest of the way — both by Collier at 4:01 and...",

        "content": "LEANDER, Texas — Torrential rains and flash flooding in Central Texas not only damaged homes and businesses, but also disrupted the final resting places of many families at Nameless Cemetery, a historic site northwest of Austin. Sammy Loehr, whose mother, brother, grandparents and great-aunt are all buried at Nameless Cemetery, said he rushed to the site as soon as he heard about the flooding. Loehr said he feared the worst as he walked through the cemetery, which was inundated after Big Sandy Creek overflowed its banks . “Are they being washed away? Am I going to find them here?” Loehr recalled thinking as he surveyed the damage. Loehr found his mother’s headstone nearly covered in dirt, with only part of the inscription visible. The markers for his brother and other relatives were missing entirely. “When I got here the other day, her little face was covered up, but her little eyes were showing,” Loehr said. “It’s heartbreaking, you know?” Loehr estimates at least 30 headstones were either toppled over or washed away somewhere else by the floodwaters, and he’s determined to find them. Loehr said his brother’s headstone was handmade by their cousin 20 years ago, and it’s irreplaceable. “You can’t replace something that somebody put their love into 20 years ago with so much meaning and love, and all that love is washed away,\" Loehr said. Despite the devastation, Loehr said he feels fortunate compared to others in the community who lost their homes, and are still searching for...",

        "content": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson has made three changes to his lineup for Saturday's second test against France, confirming Ardie Savea as captain in place of the injured Scott Barrett . Patrick Tuipulotu will take Barrett's place in the second row while Caleb Clarke comes in on the left wing in place of Sevu Reece who suffered a grade one head knock in the first minute of the first test. Rieko Ioane moves from the left to the right wing and uncapped Highlanders center Timoci Tavatavanawai joins the reserve bench. Robertson was expected to make more changes after a dire first test performance in which the All Blacks scraped home 31-27 against a French team stripped of most of its Six Nations stars. Ioane is lucky to retain his place in the starting lineup after a poor first test performance. His failure to secure the kickoff at the start of the second half led directly to a France try. Robertson has also retained Beauden Barrett at flyhalf, though Barrett's tactical kicking game in the first test was flawed and New Zealand was unable to win recoverable kicks. “Test series are a unique and exciting opportunity,\" Robertson said. \"Both teams now have a better idea of what they’re going to get on Saturday night and both will lift for this next occasion. \"We know where we need to improve.” Improvement is needed across the board unless the All Blacks are to produce another of the rudderless performances that have become typical during...",

In a message to students and staff Monday, UK President Eli Capilouto said the university is “still analyzing and understanding” the specifics of the spending package, but knows it “represents an important challenge to our entire university and especially our health care system.” “It is clear that over time we will be confronted with financial challenges and difficult decisions,” he wrote. “We will need to think about new strategies to meet this moment, create more efficient operations to fund our work and develop and enhance more partnerships to advance our efforts.” “What is also clear is this: Our mission hasn’t changed,” Capilouto continued. “We exist to advance this state — its health, its education and its economy.” Medicaid payments for hospitals will be reduced by 10% annually starting in 2028, when the proposed budget cuts are enacted, Capilouto said. That means funding for treating patients will be reduced “to levels far below our cost for providing the advanced, specialty care that only we offer,” he said. “Reductions in funding can also significantly impact our efforts to extend access — particularly among rural populations that make up so much of our patient base — and for preventive services and primary care,” Capilouto said.

Courtney Nerbas for their efforts to raise money following the fire. Now, crews are working on demolishing what remains of the building, and hazardous materials contractors are on site, geared up in white suits and masks, to ensure potentially hazardous items are safely disposed of. “I’m glad I’m not there for that,” Anderson said, explaining she’s left town to be with family while the site gets cleared, though she said she’s glad it’s happening. “When it’s gone it’s gonna be easier for me to maybe not be so depressed.” Anderson is hoping the depression which overcomes her when thinking of the business will dissipate...",

Courtney Nerbas for their efforts to raise money following the fire. Now, crews are working on demolishing what remains of the building, and hazardous materials contractors are on site, geared up in white suits and masks, to ensure potentially hazardous items are safely disposed of. “I’m glad I’m not there for that,” Anderson said, explaining she’s left town to be with family while the site gets cleared, though she said she’s glad it’s happening. “When it’s gone it’s gonna be easier for me to maybe not be so depressed.” Anderson is hoping the depression which overcomes her when thinking of the business will dissipate...",

When Niagara Gospel Mission lost around 10,000 pounds of food from accidental freezer shutoffs, the community really stepped in to help. It happened almost a week ago. Within just two days, the freezers—once full—could no longer be used. It was two tragic accidents. \"Some boxes had fell in the freezer and hit the emergency exit button, which disengaged all the locks because it thought that someone was in the freezer, opened it up, and started to thaw,\" Niagara Gospel Mission executive director John Cooper said. And it wasn’t just one unit. \"Within the span of two days, 10,000 pounds of food, which is a $25,000 value. We don't take state or federal funding, so all of that food is donated food or food that, through donations, we pay for. So we kind of hit emergency mode,\" Cooper said. Monya Gibbs is the head chef. She knows what it likes to feed dozens of people and make dozens of meals each day. \"All of our meat was in there. We had bread in there. We had vegetables in there. I was like, what are we going to do?\" Gibbs said. For an organization that serves a lot of meals a day, the loss was devastating. But faith—and action—carried them through. \"We're going to rely on God. And I always say, frog, fully rely on God, and God's going to see us through. And he really has,\" Gibbs said. The call for help went out quickly—and so did the...",

However, from his point of view, the Diddy jury ultimately got it right. On NewsNation’s Banfield (weeknights, 10 p.m. ET), he said, \"I think if I was able to, given the chance to deliberate and review all my notes, review all the evidence, everything I needed to see, and also, most importantly, review the government, the judge’s charges, I would have, I would have eventually reached the same conclusion that the other 12 jurors found .” Diddy faced five charges across three federal indictments, including sex trafficking, conspiracy racketeering, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Diddy pleaded not guilty to all charges against him. Additionally, he vehemently denies all allegations of wrongdoing against him, including those alleged in civil lawsuits. He was acquitted on the most serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. However, the jury found him guilty on both counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. George explained that he didn't think the witnesses in the case were lying necessarily, and he gave immense praise to the prosecutors. However, he also believed the defense successfully...",

The game will be broadcast on ESPN2. Here are the former Tigers and Columbia stars competing in the Las Vegas event and when you can watch them. The 6-foot-5 guard looks to make an immediate impression for the Nuggets and continue the team's recent trend of successful two-way contract players, joining the likes of Monte Morris, Torrey Craig and P.J. Dozier. Bates is set to make his Summer League debut against the Milwaukee Bucks at 8:30 p.m. Thursday (NBATV) at the Cox Pavilion. His team then takes the court against the Minnesota Timberwolves at 9 p.m. Saturday (NBATV) and Toronto Raptors at 7 p.m. Tuesday (ESPN+ and ESPN3), before the matchup...",

Cardoso made her way back to the United States after Sunday's heartbreaking loss to Team USA in the final.

That agency head, Ben Edtl, is a Tualatin-based political consultant who is also the chief petitioner for a 2026 ballot initiative that would end Oregon’s pioneering vote-by-mail system. Edtl, 47, is a rising player in the MAGA wing of the Oregon Republican Party. Ben Edtl has an unusual stake in the future of Roseburg. He also runs the public transit agency in Douglas County. In April, he became the full-time CEO of the Umpqua Public Transportation District, which serves about 110,000 people in the state’s ninth-most-populous county. In the May 20 election, races for five seats on the transit district’s board of directors were on the ballot, although only four were contested. People are also reading...

The decision on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for renewable energy sources. The watchdog group was denied access to two meetings in 2024 where the public service commission decided how Alabama Power — the state's largest electricity provider — should adjust prices based on volatility in global fuel costs. The lawsuit argued the denial flouts both local regulations and regional norms . Montgomery circuit Judge Brooke Reid ruled against the environmental advocates in a one-page order after a hearing in June. She said the group's rights had not been substantially violated. At the June hearing, Reid said the commission’s “interpretation of its own rules should be given deference.” Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, blasted Reid’s decision in a statement on Monday. “While other Southern states have meaningful public engagement in fuel cost proceedings, Alabama Power customers will continue to be shut out of the process,” Tidwell wrote.

(AP) — Alabama 's utility regulators can continue to hold closed-door meetings to determine price hikes, in an apparent departure from common practices in neighboring states, a circuit court judge ruled. The decision on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for renewable energy sources.

        "content": "DEAR ABBY: My best friend of 40 years and her boyfriend live several states away from my husband and me. Every winter she and her friend expect to come to our home for a week. We simply can no longer do this. Her friend is a nice guy, but after a few days we can hardly stand it. He talks constantly and knows everything about everything. How can I politely tell my friend that we can’t accommodate them anymore without hurting her feelings and maybe ending our friendship? — WEARY OUT WEST DEAR WEARY: Try this. When your old friend mentions coming to visit, tell her you aren’t up to having houseguests. If she asks why, and she probably will, say you’re not as young as you used to be — it’s true. Neither am I. Tell her you can accommodate them for a weekend. If that doesn’t work, say your husband isn’t up for company. (Also true.) However, if neither excuse suffices, you may have to choose between telling your friend the truth and fibbing by saying you plan to be out of town. DEAR ABBY: For mothers out there who wonder why their “wonderful” grown daughters don’t have boyfriends, maybe it is because they are too dependent on YOU. No guy wants to be involved with a woman who calls or texts her mom multiple times a day (unless she is ill). No guy wants a girl who can’t make a decision without consulting mom, and he certainly doesn’t want the intimate details of his relationship to be shared with you. Men want confident women, not girls still tied to their mother’s apron strings. If...",

        "content": "WEST SENECA, N.Y. — As you make outdoor plans this summer, one Western New York woman wants to make sure you're also coming up with a plan to deal with ticks. The founder of Lyme WNY told 2 On Your Side on Wednesday that she's getting a lot more questions this year about ticks, and ticks bites, than in the past. \"Every year, I always say it's getting worse, or we're getting more, or we're getting inundated. This is by far the heaviest of requests I've gotten for help, and panicked phone calls, or panicked emails, especially in children,\" said Rebecca Roll, founder and chair of Lyme WNY. Roll started the nonprofit Lyme WNY after her husband Chuk found out he had Lyme disease. She wanted people to have a way to talk with a family who had gone through it already. Most people contacting her this summer have already found a tick on themselves or a loved one. \"Finding the bull's-eye rash, which I always kind of consider lucky. Only 25 percent of people get the bull's-eye rash, or not everybody sees the tick, so I think that's what's happening. We always kind of say secondary prevention isn't working right now, and what I mean by that is people typically call me, or reach out to the organization, once they have a tick bite, or once they were diagnosed with Lyme disease, and we always just say spray before you play,\" Roll said. Roll says you can find the sprays online. She recommends picaridin and permethrin. There are sprays you use like sunscreen and other sprays you can put on...",

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Bryce Harper homered and doubled three times, Jesús Luzardo struck out seven and gave up three hits in seven innings, and the Philadelphia Phillies kept Justin Verlander winless with a 13-0 rout of the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday. Verlander (0-7), the 42-year-old right-hander in his first year with the Giants, gave up four runs (two earned) on seven hits in six innings. The three-time Cy Young Award winner struck out seven and did not issue a walk. It was his 15th start of the season and his longest previous streak of starts without a win was seven. The Phillies scored an unearned run in the second before Harper opened the fourth with his 10th homer, taking Verlander to left field. Harper led off the sixth with a double, igniting Philadelphia’s two-run inning. He doubled twice in the eighth inning when the Phillies broke open the game with seven runs off San Francisco’s bullpen. The big blow was a three-run homer by Kyle Schwarber off Scott Alexander, Schwarber’s 29th homer of the season. Mike Yastrzemski, normally an outfielder, pitched the ninth for the Giants. He gave up two runs but got Harper on a foul popup to end the inning. The Giants’ lone threat against Luzardo (8-5) came in the second when they had runners at first and second with one out before the lefty struck out Jung Hoo Lee and Luis Matos. The game was Verlander’s sixth quality start (at least six innings pitched, no more than three earned runs allowed) of 2025. Philadelphia LHP...",

        "content": "ERVING — The town has applied for two state grants that, combined with a recent Town Meeting appropriation, would cover most of Erving’s portion of costs related to construction of the affordable senior and multi-generational housing project called Evergreen Circle at Care Drive. The project is a combined effort to upgrade the infrastructure on Care Drive and build a total of 26 housing units on the street. The housing would be made up of 18 one-bedroom apartments for seniors ages 62 and older, and eight multigenerational units, each with two or three bedrooms. The updated plans were discussed during an information session at the Erving Senior & Community Center on Tuesday that was led by members of the Senior Housing Committee, Rural Development Inc. (RDI) representatives, Town Administrator Bryan Smith, and representatives from Berkshire Design Group and Austin Design Cooperative. “What we’re really trying to do is update everyone on all the work that both the town and RDI has been doing over the last year,” explained Alyssa Larose, real estate project manager and housing development director with RDI, a nonprofit created by the Franklin County Regional Housing & Redevelopment Authority. Erving is responsible for the extension of Care Drive, along with water and sewer improvements, and providing Franklin Regional Transit Authority (FRTA) access. The town’s portion of work is estimated to cost $2.65 million. Meanwhile, RDI is focusing on the housing development. The...",

The commission’s recommendation comes less than a month after it heard testimony from two women who say they were sexually harassed by Rep. Daniel Grossberg, a Louisville Democrat. The Herald-Leader first reported the then-anonymous accounts of Kentucky Young Democrats President Allison Wiseman and Lexington-Fayette Urban County Councilwoman Emma Curtis last year, along with other stories from more women and people who knew Grossberg, who detailed a behavioral pattern that dated back to college. Grossberg has denied any wrongdoing. Grossberg also testified at that six-hour closed-door June 17 ethics commission hearing, as did the co-owner and former manager of Foxys Gentlemen’s Club in Louisville. Grossberg was kicked out and banned for life from the strip club, the Herald-Leader reported last year, after he attempted to touch a dancer’s genitals on stage and solicited another for prostitution. One freshman lawmaker said she was “surprised” to learn earlier this year that sexual...",

Effective from 1 October 2025, CMS and commercial health insurers will recognise the HCPCS Level II code A9616 assigned for reimbursement of Gozellix. The assignment of the code is a significant milestone supporting provider billing and reimbursement for Gozellix, and a further step toward receiving Transitional Pass-Through (TPT) payment status. After radiolabelling with 68Ga, Gozellix is indicated for PET scanning of PSMA positive lesions in men with prostate cancer who have suspected metastasis and are candidates for initial definitive therapy, and those with suspected biochemical recurrence (BCR) based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.3 With its extended shelf-life and flexible production options, Gozellix overcomes many of the logistical barriers that have historically limited access to PSMA-PET imaging. Telix believes receiving a HCPCS code will support clinical adoption of Gozellix and expanded access to PSMA PET imaging. Kevin Richardson, Chief Executive Officer, Precision Medicine, Telix, said, “Being granted a HCPCS code...",

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan) Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is instituting new hoot-owl restrictions on rivers in the southwest and central Montana beginning Thursday, in response to warm temperatures and low streamflows across the state. The fishing restrictions prohibit angling on the designated stretches of river from 2 p.m. to midnight each day and will remain in place until conditions improve. The new restrictions are as follows: Hoot-owl restrictions are already in place on the upper Madison River above Hebgen Lake, and on the lower Madison River from Warm Springs BLM day-use area downstream to the confluence with the Jefferson River near Three Forks. On the Sun River , the restrictions are in place from the mouth of Muddy Creek to the Highway 287 Bridge. To check for other restrictions, click here . In accordance with the department’s drought policy, FWP institutes angling restrictions when streamflows drop below critical levels for fish, when water quality is diminished or when maximum daily water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three consecutive days. Water temperatures of 77 degrees or more can be lethal to trout. The restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when water temperatures warm and can help reduce catch-and-release mortality by restricting fishing to only cool morning hours....",

For an idea of exactly how many DC 33 workers are integral to Philadelphia, try walking more than 10 blocks on either Broad or Market Street, from City Hall in any direction, and count how many of these DC33 jackets you see. Philadelphians will tell you - they're everywhere, all the time. Nearly 10,000 members of District Council 33 (DC 33)—representing sanitation workers, 911 dispatchers, water department employees, and others—walked off the job after contract talks broke down. The union initially sought 8% annual raises over four years, totaling a 32% increase. The city had countered with a 7% total increase over three years. Mayor Cherelle Parker announced the agreement early Wednesday morning, hours after both sides resumed negotiations Tuesday afternoon at the Community College of Philadelphia and worked through the night. “The work stoppage involving the District Council 33 and the City of Philadelphia is OVER,” Parker posted on social media. “We’re valuing our workforce and we’re safeguarding our city’s hard-earned fiscal stability at the same time. The strike is over!” According to Parker, the deal—pending ratification by union members—combined with a one-year extension agreed to last fall, will raise...",

        "content": "AUSTIN, Texas — A Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) official said on Wednesday all but one of the agency's roads in the Austin area damaged during the July 4 weekend floods will be open by the close of the business day. TxDOT’s Austin District covers 11 counties in Central Texas and the Hill Country. However, it does not include Kerr County, which saw the worst flood damage. Originally, around 20 sections of TxDOT roads or bridges were damaged in the Austin district. Repairs began on Sunday, with TxDOT workers from other parts of the state coming in to help. By late Wednesday afternoon, FM 1431 at Cow Creek is expected to be the last remaining closure. Floodwaters washed away the bridge on Saturday, destroying the direct route between Lago Vista and Marble Falls and forcing drivers on a lengthy detour. “It's literally now in pieces and segments in the river bottom,” said Tucker Ferguson, a TxDOT Austin District engineer, during an interview with KVUE on Wednesday afternoon. “We have a contractor out there right now, cleaning up debris, preparing the site, so we can expedite the replacement here, getting started in the next couple of weeks.” Ferguson said TxDOT officials are still assessing how long the rebuild could take. “Our design team is putting together the plans,” Ferguson said. “We're going to bring contractors in to do emergency repairs and get bid quickly, hopefully sometime next week. After that, we'll have a better idea of what their schedule will look...",

The trail plan, which serves the Hidden Valley and Macpherson subdivisons, proposes a number of motorized and non-motorized trails. Snowmobilers would be allowed to use the non-motorized trails in the winter. It was introduced at June 30’s council meeting. A previous version of the trail plan was adopted in 2022, but public concern over the public engagement process resulted in a renewed trail plan development. Coun. Anne Middler brought forward a motion to postpone the council vote on adoption to Aug. 11, the next city council meeting scheduled after the council’s summer recess. Middler cited her need for more time to gain information. The motion to postpone was passed unanimously, with support from every council member. The motion also followed a delegation from Hidden Valley resident Liz Reichenbach, who asked council to either vote against adoption of the trail plan, or to delay making a decision. Reichenbach said that the statistics shared at last week’s council meeting, which showed 67 per cent of survey respondents opposing banning snowmobiles, were an “inaccurate, skewed reflection of true supporters in favour of snowmobiles on non-motorized trails.” Reichenbach said that the survey questions didn’t have enough detail. She said that she had spoken with residents who preferred narrower trails. She said they would have opted for non-motorized trails without...",

        "content": "The Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts to weather programs could damage the accuracy of hurricane forecasts, slowing or even reversing progress made in delivering storm warnings needed to keep Floridians safe, a group of retired scientists said Wednesday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s budget request calls for the closure of a dozen weather research labs — including a premier one in Miami — along with other deep funding reductions. That could undermine advances in projecting how strong a hurricane will be when it makes landfall, said James Franklin, former branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the National Hurricane Center. “My fear is that we’re going to look back 25 years from now and say, ‘This is when the progress stopped’,” he said. Franklin and two other former government weather officials spoke at a Wednesday news conference, along with Democratic lawmakers seeking to highlight the proposed cuts ahead of the peak of hurricane season. The Miami lab performs “critical” functions for hurricane forecasting, such as manning hurricane hunter flights, processing radar data and launching ocean gliders to gather measurements, said Robert Atlas, director emeritus of NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorology Laboratory. NOAA and the National Weather Service are already reeling from the loss of probationary employees who were terminated and staff members who took buyouts. That has resulted in fewer launches of weather balloons, which...",

Originally interested, New York Giants legend Eli Manning has officially decided to pass on the opportunity to purchase an ownership stake in the franchise, stating that “it’s too expensive for me.” Back in February, the Giants announced that a limited stake in the franchise was going to be put up for sale, potentially up to 10%. And that the numbers were likely going to break records when it comes to the valuation of an NFL team. (RELATED: Dan Orlovsky Staying Put With ESPN After New Deal) The last valuation from Forbes has the Giants at $7.3 billion. CNBC has that amount at $7.85 billion. “Basically, it’s too expensive for me,” said Manning to CNBC Sport . “These numbers are getting very big. ... A 1% stake of something valued at $10 billion — it turns into a very big number. I love the Giants, and I think it is deserving of that valuation. There will be people that want to go for it, and I was kind of along for the ride.” Eli Manning says he’s no longer interested in buying a piece of the NFL’s Giants: ‘It’s too expensive for me’ https://t.co/6pahex6LO9 — CNBC (@CNBC) July 9, 2025 I get Eli Manning’s beef here, paying $1 billion for a 1% stake is straight up robbery, and it makes me think ...

This past September, MTL Manufacturing began moving into the massive structure at 1901 Gateway Blvd. The company initially will take up about 150,000-square-feet of the building with plans to quickly occupy the entire building. MTL Manufacturing is not new to the area. The company has been part of the Beloit business community since 2010 and moved into about 30,000-square-feet of space on the Ironworks Campus nearly five years ago. Still, it's a significant investment for a company that started with a single welding station by Mike Nimmo. After graduating from Milton High School, Nimmo went to work for a metal fabrication shop. He stayed there until he was 29 when he decided he could \"do this on my own.\" He borrowed $1,500 from his brother and got cheap space in an old building from a friend - then he started making phone calls. \"You know, I was always trying for the big score, but really, at first I was just fixing a lot of tractor components,\" the now 54-year-old Nimmo said. His first big break came in 2001 when he got a contract from Lear Corp., a global automotive supplier that focuses on seating and electrical distribution systems. \"A guy running a department got into a pinch on something and gave me the opportunity to rework some components,\" Nimmo said. \"Next thing...",

        "content": "An Idaho Falls man signed a plea deal Wednesday with Bonneville County prosecutors on multiple drug charges stemming from a traffic stop last month. According to court records, Shawn Micheal Pelkowski, 40, was stopped at the intersection of Potomac Way and East Sunnyside Drive in Idaho Falls at 12:36 p.m. June 25 after Bonneville County Sheriff's deputies noted his vehicle failed to stop before turning and then made an improper lane change. After a K9 positively identified drugs being present, deputies initiated a search of the vehicle. They reported finding a brown box with 30 vape pens containing 60 grams of marijuana. A bag also located in the back seat held more than 15 grams of a substance that tested positive for MDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly. A second bag was found to hold more than 5.5 grams of LSD. Pelkowski was arrested and later charged with felony possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, felony possession of LSD, felony possession of MDMA and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Pelkowski faced a maximum penalty of nine years imprisonment, fines of up to $21,000 and restitution. According to court documents, Pelkowski will plead guilty to the first two counts with the other counts being dismissed. The defendant does agree to pay full restitution on all charged and uncharged crimes. In response, the state will recommend he serve three months local jail time and probation. While the plea deal isn't binding on the court, Pelkowski...",

The free event traces its origins to the storied National Folk Festival. Audience members dance to a performance during the Montana Folk Festival at the Granite Street stage on Saturday, July 13, 2024. In 1938, W. C. Handy, known as the \"Father of the Blues,\" made his first appearance on a desegregated stage at a National Folk Festival held in Washington, D.C. A history of the National Folk Festival reports, “The festival presented black and white performers every year — and got away with it. How the festival managed this remains unclear to this day, but its organizers seem to have simply ignored the prohibition and the Daughters of the American Revolution never challenged them on it.” Ken Heath leans backwards after finishing a song with his band the True Disciples during the 2023 Montana Folk Festival in Butte. Nearly 90 years later, attendees at the annual Montana Folk Festival will likely revel in the multicultural mix of peoples and genres gracing stages in historic Uptown Butte.

        "content": "ROUND ROCK, Texas — A suspect who had been charged in a fatal May 6 hit-and-run crash in Austin died two months later in a separate crash on Interstate 35 in Round Rock, Travis County prosecutors have confirmed. Agustin Guillen, 38, was one of three people killed in the crash in the early morning hours of June 29. Round Rock police said three vehicles were involved, and their investigation led to the arrest of 22-year-old Kearra Thomas on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Guillen was facing a felony charge of collision involving death for the May 6 crash in the 2900 block of North MoPac northbound that killed 47-year-old motorcyclist Shawn Oveisi. According to arrest documents, investigators believe Guillen hit Oveisi and ran away from the crash scene. He also later reported his car stolen, which police believe was a false report to evade responsibility for the crash. Police arrested Guillen on June 11, but he posted bond and was released the next day. The Round Rock crash happened around 2:30 a.m. on June 29. Arrest reports from Round Rock police indicate that Guillen was driving a silver Toyota and was involved in a single-vehicle rollover crash on I-35 near U.S. 79. Round Rock police believe two other victims – 48-year-old Maximo Ramirez and 21-year-old Quinn Stegall – exited their vehicles and were attempting to help Guillen. Police say that's when Thomas crashed into the overturned silver Toyota, killing both Ramirez and Stegall. Thomas is facing two counts of...",

The Valkyries held Clark to just 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting as the Fever scored their second-fewest points of the season. Clark returned after missing the past five games with a left groin injury. The All-Star captain participated in practice Monday — the first time she’d done that since getting hurt on June 26.

(AP) — Tina Charles set season highs with 29 points and 11 rebounds to help Connecticut end a 10-game losing streak with a victory over Seattle. Connecticut (3-16) won its first game since June 6. Charles made a baseline jumper with 5:36 left in the fourth quarter to give Connecticut its first lead of the game at 79-77. Charles also made two layups in eight seconds — following a steal by Saniya Rivers — for a 91-81 lead. The Sun pulled away by scoring 11 straight points late in the fourth. Charles finished 11 of 22 from the field for her sixth 20-point game of the season. Jacy Sheldon added 16 points and Bria Hartley had 15.

The body of Sunshine Stewart, 48, of Tenants Harbor, Maine, was found Thursday on Crawford Pond in Union. The manner of death was determined to be a homicide, though the cause of death is not being released to the public yet, Maine State Police said in a statement. Police have asked that anyone who may have seen Stewart paddleboarding on July 2 between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. near 100 Acre Island on Crawford Pond contact them. Maine State Police said in a Wednesday evening statement it remains \"steadfast in our efforts to investigate\" the killing. Stewart lived about a half hour from the pond, which is a popular summer destination about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the scenic coastal areas of the state's midcoast region. Friends and family who gathered at Stewart’s home on Wednesday declined to comment. Crawford Pond is located in the 2,400-resident town of Union, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) northeast of Portland, the largest city in the state. The area is popular with campers and daytrippers. The pond is approximately 600 acres (243 hectares) and does not have public access. It is available for a variety of uses, including boating and fishing.

According to the Spokane County Sheriff's Office, 61-year-old Maureen G. Mortlock was driving west on the trail near East Trent Avenue at around 9:10 p.m. on Saturday. Deputies deployed spike strips ahead of the SUV and yelled at Mortlock to stop while using flashlights to show where they were. Mortlock ignored the deputies and drove over the spikes. She continued to drive on the trail with deflated tires. Deputies chased her on foot while yelling at her to stop. SCSO said there were several pedestrians, including children, on or near the trail at this time. Mortlock eventually stopped and was told to put her SUV in park. SCSO said Mortlock was fumbling around and seemed to have problems putting the car into park. When Mortlock got out of her car, she appeared unsteady and smelled of alcohol. Mortlock was detained and showed more signs that she was under the influence while speaking with deputies. She told deputies she was new to the area and trying to find her way home. Mortlock denied drinking any alcohol that night. SCSO said Mortlock agreed to do a field sobriety test. After the test, Mortlock was arrested for DUI. A breath test showed Mortlock's blood alcohol level at 0.150 and 0.147. The legal BAC limit is 0.08. Mortlock was booked into the Spokane County Jail for DUI and reckless driving.

The legend of the “Superman Curse” originated after one of the superhero’s creators, Jerry Siegel, promised to curse the character after he barely made a penny off of its creation. Siegel, and co-creator Joe Schuster sold the rights to DC Comics for just $130 in 1938. The men agreed to a work-for-hire contract that allowed DC to pay them once the comic was published. However, the deal meant that the company could profit off of anything created with Superman, including merch, movies and more, but they had no obligation to pay Siegel and Schuster anything. Afterward, Siegel allegedly told one of the DC executives that he’d “put a curse on him.” Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content. Thanks for the feedback.",

You can also make a case that “College Football ’26,” the latest video game offering from EA Sports, didn’t get that hair quite right. The popular game added head coaches to its mix this year. Naturally, that sparked some commentary about the accuracy of the coaches’ likenesses. Gundy, the veteran Oklahoma State coach who is approaching his 21st season with the Cowboys, has become well-known in recent years for sporting a mullet. EA Sports appeared to try to replicate that look, only to unveil something that screamed more “Welcome Back, Kotter” than Florida Georgia Line. “Oh my gosh, that afro?” said Cowboys tight end Josh Ford. “I know what they were trying to go for, but I don’t know who that was supposed to be.” Oklahoma State head coach Mike Gundy, the dean of Big 12 coaches, said he liked the look of his video-game character in “College Football ‘26.” OSU defensive back Cam Smith agreed that EA Sports may have missed the mark with Gundy’s signature hairdo. “The video game did him crazy. I can’t lie,” Smith said. “We talked about it earlier. I can see what they were going for, but I think they missed it just a little bit, a little bit.” For his part, Gundy said he was a fan of his video game self. “I have not played the game, but I think it’s pretty cool that somebody put me in a video game,” Gundy said. “Somebody showed me a picture recently, and they gave me a great hairdo.

La persona, que habló con la AP bajo condición de anonimato por tratarse de un asunto legal, dijo que la apelación se presentó el martes y que el sindicato ha sostenido conversaciones continuas con su consejo ejecutivo sobre el asunto. No hay un plazo para la decisión que tomará un panel de apelaciones permanente compuesto por tres personas. El 14 de enero, el juez de arbitraje Christopher Droney dictaminó que no había pruebas suficientes de colusión por parte de los propietarios en las negociaciones de contratos con los mariscales de campo después de que los Browns de Cleveland le otorgaron al quarterback Deshaun Watson un contrato récord de 230 millones de dólares totalmente garantizados. El podcast “Pablo Torre Finds Out” fue el primero en publicar la decisión del árbitro. Cualquier intento de colusión para mantener bajos los salarios viola el contrato colectivo entre la NFL y el sindicato de jugadores. AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

On June 28, Sandy officers responded to a home and were led downstairs by the girl’s 29-year-old mom, later identified as Amber Lee Leary, according to a news release by the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office . The child was breathing but not moving or speaking and had no eye movement, prosecutors said. She had gone to the bathroom in the corner earlier that morning, and her mom and dad, later identified as Tyrel Scott Belone, 28, woke up to clean it, officials said. Leary was leaving for work around 5:30 a.m., when Belone picked up his daughter and “threw her on the mattress, where she ricocheted, and hit her head and face on the wall,” officials said. Although Belone said he checked on her and said she was “fine,” she was not “really responding,” prosecutors said. Leary left for work but got threatening texts from Belone, saying she needed to come home, according to a criminal complaint. Texts between the two revealed Belone told Leary, “I’m going to murder her” and that he was “going to break her nose” and “crack her skull,” court documents said. When Leary got home, she saw her daughter with her “eyes bruised and swollen shut,” officials said. Leary eventually FaceTimed Belone’s mom, a nurse practitioner, who advised that the toddler be taken to the hospital, officials said. Leary later told officers that Belone didn’t allow her to call 911,...",

Image courtesy of Longroad Energy The “one big, beautiful bill” that Republicans crafted and President Donald Trump signed last week eliminates a number of incentives for clean energy that will directly lead to billions in lost investments for the state of Arizona and thousands of lost jobs. Trump’s $3.4 trillion deficit-boosting tax cut and spending package fulfills a number of his administration’s domestic policy priorities, including a major reversal on clean energy initiatives . In a letter to lawmakers on Capitol Hill while debate on the bill was still ongoing, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs urged them to vote no on it , citing in part the impact the rollbacks on clean energy initiatives would have on the state. In the letter, Hobbs cited the Arizona Commerce Authority as identifying $58 billion in possible investments and 69,000 jobs that could be lost. “That is real capital and construction jobs that are just walking out the door,” Advanced Energy United’s Arizona lead Michael Barrio told the Arizona Mirror. Part of the budget bill signed by Trump includes ending tax credits used by businesses and residents for the installation of solar or wind technology.

The Court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that, throughout the Class Period, the defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business and operations. In particular, the Court found that plaintiffs plausibly alleged that Doximity misrepresented the number of active physician users on its platform and falsely claimed increasing user engagement, despite internal data and survey evidence suggesting otherwise. The complaint also alleges that defendants touted Doximity’s growth prospects and revenue sustainability, while downplaying challenges such as increased competition, tightening macroeconomic conditions, and the Company’s reliance on “upselling” advertising and services to existing clients.

That’s because oftentimes insurance doesn’t cover what the policyholder thinks it does — or thinks it should. The disappointing surprise is that while the standard home insurance policy does cover fire and wind damage, even good property insurance typically doesn’t cover things like flooding and earthquakes, which usually require a special and separate policy for each. Here are the things to know about flood insurance. Who has flood insurance Most people who have flood insurance are required to have it.

Congress created the federal flood insurance program more than 50 years ago when many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas.

        "content": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Two former West Virginia correctional officers were sentenced to decades in prison on Wednesday for their roles in an assault that resulted in the death of an inmate. Mark , 41, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Johnathan , 33, was sentenced to 21 years in prison for the March 2022 attack in the Southern Regional Jail, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. Quantez Burks, 37, was a pretrial detainee who died less than a day after he was booked into the jail in Beaver on a wanton endangerment charge, according to court documents. When Burks tried to push past an officer to leave his housing unit, he was taken to an interview room where he was handcuffed and restrained while officers including Holdren and Walters assaulted him. Burks was struck in the head multiple times, kicked and pepper-sprayed, according to the Justice Department. After the assault, Burks became unresponsive, so officers including Walters carried him to a different pod. Walters swung Burks' head into a metal door to open it and the officers dropped his body onto a concrete cell floor. He was pronounced deceased a short time later by emergency medical personnel. Along with their guilty pleas, Holdren and Walters admitted that the interview room where they took Burks had no surveillance cameras. They also knew that officers used this room and other “blind spots” in the jail to assault inmates accused of misconduct. Holdren and Walters are two of six...",

(AP) — Two former West Virginia correctional officers were sentenced to decades in prison on Wednesday for their roles in an assault that resulted in the death of an inmate. Mark Holdren , 41, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Johnathan Walters , 33, was sentenced to 21 years in prison for the March 2022 attack in the Southern Regional Jail, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. Quantez Burks, 37, was a pretrial detainee who died less than a day after he was booked into the jail in Beaver on a wanton endangerment charge, according to court documents. When Burks tried to push past an officer to leave his housing unit, he was taken to an interview room where he was handcuffed and restrained while officers including Holdren and Walters assaulted him.

Ulmer is charged with felony abuse of an elder person and causing bodily harm and substantial battery along with misdemeanor disorderly conduct. If convicted of the two felony charges, Ulmer could be sentenced up to six years in prison on each. According to a criminal complaint, on July 1 police responded to a call on Washburn Avenue. The victim told police that Ulmer approached him angrily asking about a bag. When the 87-year-old man told Ulmer he didn’t have any bag belonging to Ulmer, he began shoving him outside his residence, followed him inside, shoving him again and then followed the victim out of the front door of residence, pushing him to the ground, where he hit his head hard enough to require stitches. Ulmer made his initial appearance in Rock County Circuit Court on July 3. The court set a cash bond of $5,000 for his release. Ulmer is due back in court on July 15.

GEC Executive Director Maria Pangelinan told senators that the Trump White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget does not have money for the Election Security Grant, which annually gives Guam $200,000. “Right now it doesn’t look good for the federal funds for Guam in terms of the budget bill,” Pangelinan said, responding to Sen. Chris Barnett’s question about federal funding for the commission. GEC also reached out to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission but there’s no clear answer given the court injunction and other events related to the executive order. “We’re watching closely, EAC is watching closely but right now, taya, there’s nothing for the Election Security Grant, which is the formula grant that we get from them for 2026,” Pangelinan told senators. Pangelinan was the only one to testify on Sen. Telo Taitague’s bill seeking to reinstate the requirement for documentary proof of U.S. citizenship, to make it part of Guam law once again. A few weeks after Trump’s signing of an executive order on March 25, however, GEC commissioners decided to take a pro-active approach and started seeking proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote as soon as possible....",

A cascade of ambulance rides ensued — a ground ambulance to a local hospital, an air ambulance to Denver, and another ground ambulance to Children’s Hospital Colorado. Silva’s daughter was on Medicaid, which was supposed to cover the cost of the ambulances. But one of the three ambulance companies, Northglenn Ambulance, a public company since acquired by a private one , sent Silva’s bill to a debt collector. It was for $2,181.60, which grew to more than $3,000 with court fees and interest, court records show. The preschool teacher couldn’t pay, and the collector garnished Silva’s wages. “It put us so behind on bills — our house payment, electric, phone bills, food for the kids,” said Silva, whose daughter recovered fully from the 2015 crash. “It took away from everything.” Some state legislators are looking to curb bills like the one she received — surprise bills for ground ambulance rides. When an ambulance company charges more than an insurer is willing to pay, patients can be left with a big bill they probably had no choice in.

LOUIS — Printing of the Post-Dispatch, now handled by a facility in Columbia, Missouri, will shift in a few weeks to presses in Peoria, Illinois, but the move won't affect the size of the newspaper, our deadlines or our delivery schedules. The newspaper company Gannett announced this week that it planned to close the Columbia location in September. The company also said it would shift printing of publications from Columbia to facilities it owns in Peoria and Des Moines, Iowa. Over the last several years, newspapers across the country have shuttered press plants — moving printing to nearby facilities they own or outsourcing to other companies — as they look to operate more efficiently and continue transitioning to digital platforms. The Post-Dispatch outsourced its printing to the Columbia plant in January, ending a 146-year history of printing in St. Louis. We’ll share more information as we get closer to September, though, again, we don't anticipate any major changes for readers as our printing moves to Peoria. Thank you for reading, and thank you for your support. Alan Achkar is the executive editor of the Post-Dispatch.",

The Planning and Zoning Commission unanimously voted to recommend approval of the zone change at its June 3 meeting. Two resolutions will be considered approving eligibility reports for urban renewal districts. The first involves the Riverside Urban Renewal District, which is the first step required by Idaho Statute in creating a new urban renewal district. The second involves the Riverwalk Urban Renewal District, with the Idaho Falls Redevelopment Agency board having reviewed and approved the report on June 18. The council will hold a legislative hearing for consideration of an ordinance approving the First Amendment to the River Commons Urban Renewal District. The ordinance includes validation of conformity with the city's Comprehensive Plan and has been reviewed by the Idaho Falls Redevelopment Agency board. The plan includes tax increment financing and a feasibility study demonstrating that expected tax revenues can cover project costs.

Foley, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said in a statement. “These defendants allegedly turned quiet homes across the Northeast into hubs for a criminal enterprise — building a multi-million-dollar black-market operation off the backs of an illegal workforce and using our neighborhoods as cover.” Zhu was stopped by law enforcement alongside one of his alleged co-conspirators, Quincy resident Hongbin Wu, after they left a grow house in Greenfield on June 5, 2023. Police seized $36,900 in cash from the vehicle and photographed Wu wearing a “money laundering” T-shirt, depicting an iron gliding over money, according to the defendants’ 18-page criminal indictment. As of Tuesday, however, Zhu remains the sole defendant at large in an investigation involving six alleged co-conspirators. Zhu, alongside defendants Jianxiong Chen, Yuxiong Wu, Dinghui Li, Dechao Ma, Peng Lian Zhu and Hongbin Wu, all face a federal charge of conspiracy to manufacture, distribute and possess with intent to distribute...",

        "content": "The Detroit Tigers have the best record in the majors. Now they are tied for having the most All-Stars, too. Zach McKinstry was picked Wednesday to replace Astros shortstop Jeremy Peña, who has been dealing with a rib injury. The infielder-outfielder will join Detroit second baseman Gleyber Torres and outfielders Javier Báez and Riley Greene — all AL starters — and staff ace Tarik Skubal, who also is among the candidates to start the All-Star Game on Tuesday night in Atlanta. Meanwhile, Houston third baseman Isaac Paredes was picked Wednesday to replace the Guardians’ José Ramírez, who had been the starting third baseman. That gives the Astros four All-Stars in Peña and pitchers Hunter Brown and Josh Hader. The Guardians said Ramírez wanted “to focus on recovery and preparation for the second half of the season.” Milwaukee closer Trevor Megill also was added to the NL All-Star team Wednesday, shortly after he struck out Freddie Freeman, Andy Pages and Tommy Edman in order in the 10th inning to earn the win in the Brewers' 3-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Megill earned his first career All-Star selection by going 2-2 with a 2.41 ERA, 21 saves and 43 strikeouts in 33 2/3 innings. \"This was the goal in the offseason,\" Megill said. “Just worked my butt off for it, and here we are.” Megill is filling the roster spot of Milwaukee teammate Freddy Peralta, the scheduled starting pitcher for the Brewers game against Washington on Sunday.

The five All-Stars for Detroit is tied for the most with the World Series champion Dodgers, who have DH Shohei Ohtani, catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman starting for the NL along with pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto is scheduled to start Sunday for Los Angeles, so Reds left-hander Andrew Abbott has been picked to replace him. McKinstry was among several replacements announced Wednesday for the Midsummer Classic. Houston third baseman Isaac Paredes was chosen for the AL team in place of starting third baseman José Ramírez, the seven-time All-Star, who wants to spend the week rehabbing an Achilles injury; Twins right-hander Joe Ryan was selected as the replacement for Astros pitcher Hunter Brown; and Brewers closer Trevor Megill was added to the NL team in place of teammate Freddy Peralta, their scheduled starter for Sunday's game against Washington.

(AP) — Two former West Virginia correctional officers were sentenced to decades in prison on Wednesday for their roles in an assault that resulted in the death of an inmate. Mark Holdren , 41, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Johnathan Walters , 33, was sentenced to 21 years in prison for the March 2022 attack in the Southern Regional Jail, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. Quantez Burks, 37, was a pretrial detainee who died less than a day after he was booked into the jail in Beaver on a wanton endangerment charge, according to court documents. When Burks tried to push past an officer to leave his housing unit, he was taken to an interview room where he was handcuffed and restrained while officers including Holdren and Walters assaulted him. Burks was struck in the head multiple times, kicked and pepper-sprayed, according to the Justice Department. After the assault, Burks became unresponsive, so officers including Walters carried him to a different pod. Walters swung Burks' head into a metal door to open it and the officers dropped his body onto a concrete cell floor. He was pronounced deceased a short time later by emergency medical personnel.
