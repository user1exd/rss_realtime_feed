        "content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.

        "content": "KOCHI: On the 30th, the High Court will again consider the case filed by the former employees of the State Warehousing Corporation demanding their rightful pension. The case is being considered for the 100th time. The petitioners, aged up to 85 years, have been in a legal battle for 23 years. A petition filed in the High Court in 2001, seeking pension payment received a favourable response only when the case was considered in 2010. The corporation approached the Supreme Court against this with a petition but was dismissed in 2017. However, the court order remained unimplemented. At this stage, the pensioners filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court. The petition was withdrawn after the corporation announced that the court verdict would be implemented immediately, but the pension hike was still not implemented. The pensioners then approached the Supreme Court but the petition was referred to the High Court. The High Court ruled that a minimum of Rs 5,000 and a maximum of Rs 15,500 including dearness allowance till April 1, 2018, should be paid. The court back then also ordered the corporation to complete all dues till then within three months. The High Court will now consider the appeal filed in the Corporation Division Bench and the petition of the pensioners. 45 pensioners died during the legal battle while 603 are still hoping for a favorable result.",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Efforts to reduce the availability of alcohol in the state on one side. Measures to increase the number of bars on the other. 801 bars at present. 14 new applications in various districts under scrutiny. 97 bar licenses were issued after the second Pinarayi government came to power. UDF had shut down all but 29 five-star hotels in 2016 before leaving. Four-star bars among the closed bars were allowed to function as per the decision of the left government. 200 new licenses were also granted. By the end of the Left government's term in 2021, the number of bars reached 671. Now there are 801 bars, including those licensed by raising the classification and new ones. High profit business The constant argument of the bar owners is that there is no loss-making business like the bar business. However, even a normal bar has an average daily sales of Rs.1.5 to Rs.2 lakh. Depending on the quality of the bar and the speciality of the location, it can go up to five or six lakhs. 15 to 20 percent of the sale goes to the owner's pocket after all expenses including the share of license fee. Common man's favourite Jawan rum is priced at Rs 640 per litre at Bevco Shop. Jawan rum is sold at bars at peg rate. Rs 65 per peg is the minimum rate. One litre is 16.5 pegs. A litre of Jawan rum is sold for Rs 1072.50. Profit from this is Rs.432. Depending on the quality of the bars, the peg rate can increase and so can the profit. A typical bar sells 750 to 850 pegs of Jawan rum a day. As the price of liquor increases, the peg rate and profit will rise. Burden of donation Owners get amazing profits but donation is a burden. Bar owners have to donate huge sums of money to major political parties during elections. The amount determined will be collected from each bar and handed over by the owners association. Earlier it was up to 25,000, 50,000, now it has become lakhs. Contribution to local leaders is on top of this.",

The sub inspector reached the place while Sabu was feasting with Faizal. On seeing the official, Sabu hid in a bathroom. Faizal told the SI that the other two cops are his workers. All three were taken to the police station, where it was revealed that the other two with Faizal are cops and they came with the DySP. However, Sabu told the Alappuzha police chief that he was at his residence during this time. On checking the call details of the police officers, it became clear that didn't contact Faizal, who testified that the said DySP didn't come and there was no feast. Jollymon, a driver of Alappuzha Police special branch, and CK Deepak, a CPO, were suspended for visiting the goonda leader's house.",

        "content": "Portuguese international footballer Cristiano Ronaldo could not stop securing a new set of recognition as his Al Nassr are set to conclude the Saudi Pro League playing its last match with Al Ittehad Monday. The 39-year-old star joined the Saudi club in January 2023, after signing a contract for two-and-a-half years. As the Saudi Pro League comes to its end, with Al Hilal winning the title, Cristiano Ronaldo is set to become the top scorer of this season with 33 goals on his name. This recognition is expected to be formally given at the end of Al Nassr's game with Al Ittehad at King Abdullah Sports City. Cristiano Ronaldo is not only finishing this season with Saudi Arabia but the forward holds the record for the highest number of goals in the UEFA Champions League. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner is in high spirits to complete the number of 900 goals as he was just 9 nets away from writing his name into the books of football history as the best player. His total tally is 891. He is also at the top of the list of the best international football players ahead of Pele, Lionel Messi and many more with 128 strikes under his name.",

        "content": "The Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru visited the Cocoland Sugar Development Project in Abau, Central province on Sunday. He was received by the chairman of the Yaosoeng Sugar and Cane Consultant Company, Prapat Jenlapwattanakul and his team, the landowners, community leaders, and the people of Cocolands. Mr Maru described his visit as ‘‘a very useful visit’’. After visiting the project site, Mr Maru said: “I do appreciate that there is enough grassland for the project, there is enough State land to build the sugar mill, and the local people are very supportive of this project.” Mr Maru explained the processes that will now follow which include putting together a NEC Submission before the cabinet for endorsement. ‘‘The Cabinet will basically approve that the Government must support this project and it will be developed as an SEZ meaning the company will be given incentives to invest here including tax holiday and duty-free exemptions. ‘‘This is subject to phase two which is negotiations between the company, the landowners, the DDA, the LLGs, the local MP, the Provincial Government, and the State, to agree to the elements of the project like benefits for landowners, new wharf, power supply, etc which will be captured in the project agreement. The project agreement will be signed and subject to the negotiations. ‘‘After the signing of the project agreement, the State will give the land title to the company. ‘‘The company will need the title to have security of land tenure so they can go to the banks to raise capital to build the sugar mill and to start this project. ‘‘The shareholders of this project the State through Kumul Consolidated Holdings, the provincial government, and other investors,” Mr Maru explained. The proposal is for a 40, 000-hectare sugar farm, a processing mill, and a power plant. This follows a successful trial in Abau on the proposed sugar farm land. The plantation will produce 3 million tonnes of sugar every year with the target market to be PNG and other countries, especially Indonesia.",

        "content": "CALGARY — Steve Blake has a powerful message — don’t give up on your dreams no matter what life throws your way. The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada’s lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. “You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn’t mean life’s over,” said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. “You’ve still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.” Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. “The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,” Blake said. “I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. “As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. “It’s incredible,” Blake said. “The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage. The situation being what it is, they were very open to receive my letter and have me in there.” A non-smoker with an active lifestyle, Blake developed a nagging cough in August. “I made a deal with my wife that if it did get worse that I would go to the hospital,” said Blake. “Long story short, about 16 hours later and my wife had shown up by that time, sitting in emergency going through a bunch of tests and stuff and they came back with the diagnosis.” Blake faced his prognosis from his oncologist with his family by his side. “We knew it wasn’t going to be good,” Blake said. “He said 12 to 24 months, but I kind of really grabbed onto that and said, ‘I just want this to be the starting point. Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.’ “Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.” The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. “When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,” said Kelly. “We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).” Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. “I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.” After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. “Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,” said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.” Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. “It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,” said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. “It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much. It will be different, just playing for something maybe just a little bit bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "description": "More than half of the state’s perfect scorers have come from the Latur division",
        "content": "The dominance of the Latur pattern was evident again in this year's , as it registered the highest number of students in the state scoring 100 per cent marks. This year, the Latur division produced 123 students who scored cent percent marks in the SSC board examination, which is more than half of the total 187 students across the state who achieved a perfect score. This success did not happen suddenly or by chance. For over two decades, teachers and educational institutes in the Marathwada region have worked hard and evolved a system—popularly called the ‘Latur Pattern’—which has helped hundreds and thousands of students crack competitive exams like NEET and IIT-JEE and get good grades in class X and XII board exams. ADVERTISEMENT Despite the Latur division securing a seventh position among the nine divisional boards in Maharashtra with respect to overall pass percentage, its overall pass percentage this year is 95.27 per cent. However, known as a \"topper factory\" in academic circles, the Latur division lived up to its nickname even this year. Building on the much-talked-about ‘Latur pattern,’ schools across the district have managed to secure a strong presence in the elite ‘100 per cent club,’ year after year, a phenomenon that has been especially evident in the state board results post-2016 after the state education department introduced bonus marks for art and culture for the Class X exams. The state board awards extra marks to students for their remarkable achievements in the fields of art and sports in the SSC board exams. For the past few years, the state board has been declaring results based on the best of five subjects. This year, a total of 187 students achieved a perfect 100 per cent score. Division-wise, Latur had the highest number with 123 students, followed by with 32, and Pune with 10. Mumbai had eight students, Amravati had seven, while Kolhapur and Konkan each had three. Nagpur had one student, and Nashik had none. Last year, of the 151 students with 100 percent, 109 were from Latur, while six were from Mumbai. In 2022, 70 students from Latur scored 100 percent among the 122 from across the state. Of these, Pune had five and Mumbai had one student who scored 100 per cent that year. In 2020, of the 242 students who scored a perfect 100 across the nine divisions in the state, 151 were from the Latur division. In 2018, 125 students scored 100 percent marks, of which 68 were from Latur alone. The Latur pattern of study is a model that gained prominence during the 1980s as an initiative by a group of dedicated academics in the district, who aimed to enhance the quality of education in the region. After the district was established in 1982, schools and colleges began actively training students with parental support to improve learning outcomes. “It is an old model started by a group of educationists and passed on to the new generation, followed to date. The term ‘Latur pattern,’ however, was coined when the then education minister Vilasrao Deshmukh used it while felicitating meritorious students at an event during that time,\" said a teacher from a Zilla Parishad school in Latur. An official from the state board said, \"The Latur pattern has been successful for years. While it has produced many high-scoring students, we are now focusing on improving outcomes for all students. Over the years, the overall pass percentage in the division has been declining, and we are actively working to reverse this trend.\"",

Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people, about half of Gaza's population, displaced from other parts of the territory. On Sunday Hamas launched a barrage of rockets from Gaza towards heavily populated central Israel , setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The US National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the US was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians.

        "content": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. It recently released a 8,000 word exposé on how 3M knew that its PFAS chemicals were in people’s bodies. The information in the article is too important to overlook, so here are its highlights. In 1997, Jim Johnson gave a 3M Corporation chemist, Kris Hansen, an unusual assignment: Hansen was to test human blood for chemical contamination. With a doctoral dissertation on tiny particles in the atmosphere, she was the right choice. What was the reason for Hansen’s assignment? Several of 3M’s most successful products contained human-made compounds called fluorochemicals. The company’s PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) had tested positive in the bodies of 3M factory workers. General population samples, too, seemed to contain the blood contaminants. Were these results a lab error? She used a mass spectrometer, which weighs molecules and makes identification possible. She and her team devoted several weeks analyzing more blood — every single one was contaminated. She updated Johnson on her team’s findings. His response was “cryptic.” Without any feedback from her supervisors, she and her team ordered fresh blood samples from every supplier with whom 3M worked. Each of the samples tested positive for PFOS. Then her boss took early retirement. Although Hansen had been told that PFOS wasn’t harmful in factory workers, she wanted to be certain. She knew from her studies and previous field research that the most reliable way to gauge the safety of chemicals is to study them over time, in animals and, if possible, in humans. What Hansen didn’t know was that 3M had already conducted animal studies, starting in the 1970s. The studies had shown PFOS to be toxic, yet the results remained secret, even to many at the company. Rats and monkeys died within weeks of PFOS exposure. In 1979, an internal company report deemed PFOS “certainly more toxic than anticipated” and recommended longer term studies. Hansen’s bosses never told her that PFOS was toxic. Meanwhile, one superior intimated that her lab testing equipment might be contaminated. After careful cleaning, the results stayed the same. 3M bought three additional and very expensive mass spectrometers, and she repeated her tests on different populations and in different venues. Each sample contained PFOS. The chemical seemed to be everywhere. On its website today, 3M describes fluorochemicals. “3M helped pioneer the science of fluorochemistry more than 60 years ago – and we’re continuing to find new ways to put these amazing materials to work ... 3M fluorochemicals are engineered for high purity, performance and sustainability – including our next-generation C4 chemistry, offering a favorable safety and environmental profile for its intended uses.” These compounds are now considered “forever chemicals.” In 2023 the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) released the first tranche of testing data for PFAS in drinking water. They found hundreds of water systems are contaminated with the toxic “forever chemicals.” About 8% of water systems that serve approximately 14 million people detected two of the most common of these chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, in their drinking water at levels that exceed EPA’s proposed drinking water limits. A colleague gave Hansen more blood samples to test, which were positive for PFOS — yet the samples came from a horse. Instead of succumbing to humiliation, Hansen questioned why PFOS was making its way into animals. Her answer was unnerving: the chemical had spread through the food chain and perhaps through water. Hansen and her team ultimately found PFOS in eagles, chickens, rabbits, cows, pigs, and other animals. They also found 14 additional fluorochemicals in human blood, including several produced by 3M. Some were present in wastewater from a 3M factory. Hansen found no recourse for the way senior colleagues kept questioning her work. Instead, she devised an experiment in which blood without PFOS might be located. She was successful — samples that showed no trace of PFOS were located in blood that had been collected before 3M created PFOS. “Apparently, fluorochemicals had entered human blood after the company started selling products that contained them,” the ProPublica article explains. “They had leached out of 3M’s sprays, coatings, and factories — and into all of us.” Hansen met a scientist who revealed to her a paper written in 1981 by 3M scientists. It outlined experiments and confirmed suspicions about 3M origins of PFOS, but 3M lawyers had urged the lab not to reveal their findings. A presentation Hansen was asked to give to 3M’s CEO, Livio D. DeSimone, “seemed to view her diligence as a betrayal: Her data could be damaging to the company.” The CEO fell asleep in the meeting. While defending herself, she recalled other scientists before her who had been unsuccessful in persuading the upper 3M echelon. Soon afterward, Hansen’s job description changed. Only experiments specifically requested by a supervisor would be permitted. Her new role would be to analyze samples for studies that other employees were conducting — and to do so without question. Yet Hansen’s research was not lost. The results of her research “were quietly making their way into the files of the Environmental Protection Agency.” By 1998, 3M officials admitted that the company had measured PFOS in blood samples from around the US — Hansen’s research — but did not believe that its products presented a substantial risk to human health. Hansen, meanwhile, was ostracized by her superiors and co-workers. Over 2 decades Hansen worked on many new tasks at 3M — except fluorochemicals. Pressure from the EPA forced 3M to discontinue its entire portfolio of PFOS-­related chemicals. In 2006, after the EPA accused 3M of violating the Toxic Substances Control Act, in part by repeatedly ­failing to disclose the harms of fluorochemicals promptly, the company agreed to pay a small penalty of $1.5 million, without admitting wrongdoing. A swath of 150 square miles around 3M’s headquarters was found to be polluted with PFAS — local fish and water supplies were full of it. In October 2022, after Hansen had been at 3M for 26 years, her job was eliminated, and she chose not to apply for a new one. She reached out to ProPublica for what would be her first public discussion of her fluorochemicals research. She expressed regret that revealing what she had known earlier in her life “would have been too much to bear at the time.” Johnson, Hansen’s former boss, not only concurred with her accounts but added multi-layered details of his own attempts to uncover flurochemicals in 3M products and their reaction in humans. 3M has now settled a lawsuit filed by cities and towns with polluted water to the tune of $12.5 billion to filter out PFAS — depending on how many water systems need the chemicals removed. “The settlement, however, doesn’t approach the scale of the problem,” the ProPublica article concludes. “At least 45% of US tap water is estimated to contain one or more forever chemicals.” The cost of removing them all will likely reach $100 billion. An April 2024 Biden-Harris rule will designate the PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, and “will help ensure that polluters pay to clean up their contamination.” The original story in its entirety is exempt from ProPublica’s Creative Commons license until July 19.

        "content": "Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory used additive manufacturing to produce the first defect-free complex tungsten parts for use in extreme environments. The accomplishment could have positive implications for clean-energy technologies such as fusion energy. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, making it ideal for fusion reactors where plasma temperatures exceed 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the sun’s center is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit. In its pure form, tungsten is brittle at room temperature and easily shatters. To counter this, ORNL researchers developed an electron-beam 3D-printer to deposit tungsten, layer by layer, into precise three-dimensional shapes. This technology uses a magnetically directed stream of particles in a high-vacuum enclosure to melt and bind metal powder into a solid-metal object. The vacuum environment reduces foreign material contamination and residual stress formation. “Electron-beam additive manufacturing is promising for the processing of complex tungsten geometries,” said ORNL ’s Michael Kirka . “This is an important step for expanding the use of temperature-resistant metals in energy resources that will support a sustainable, carbon-free future.” Image and article courtesy of ORNL , U.S. Department of Energy.

        "content": "Geneva: The World Health Organization chief on Monday urged countries to nail down a landmark global agreement on handling of future pandemics after they missed a hard deadline. Scarred by Covid-19 -- which killed millions, shredded economies and crippled health systems -- nations have spent two years trying to forge binding commitments on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. Negotiators failed to clinch a deal ahead of this week's World Health Assembly -- the annual gathering of WHO's 194 member states -- the deadline for concluding the talks. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus opened the assembly Monday, saying he was confident that an agreement would be secured. \"Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and crossed the finish line,\" he said. \"But I remain confident that you still will, because where there is a will, there is a way.\" Tedros said the task before negotiators had been \"immense, technically, legally, and politically\", and that they had been \"operating on a very ambitious time line\". \"You have demonstrated a clear commitment to reaching an agreement,\" he said, adding that negotiators had \"worked long days and nights\", closing meetings as late as 4:00 am. He hailed their dedication to push forward despite \"a torrent of misinformation that was undermining your negotiations\". While missing Friday's deadline, countries have voiced a commitment to keep pushing for an accord. Negotiators are due on Tuesday to present the outcome of the talks to the assembly, which runs until June 1, and the assembly will take stock and decide what to do next. \"I know that there remains among you a common will to get this done, so, there must always be a way,\" Tedros said. \"Meaning the solution is in your hands,\" he stressed. Parallel talks have also taken place on revising the International Health Regulations, which were first adopted in 1969 and constitute the existing international legally binding framework for responding to public health emergencies around the world. The proposed amendments to the IHR, including adding more nuance to a system meant to alert countries to potential health emergencies of global concern, might have a better chance of being adopted during this week's assembly, observers said.",

Flagg refused to stop, striking Zayas with his car door before driving off, Jiron said. Zayas fell and injured his right hand and arm, she said.",

By John C. Azu The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal has affirmed the election of Governor Duoye Diri. In a unanimous judgement on Monday, the three-member panel led by Justice Adekunle Adeleye dismissed the petition filed by the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timipre Sylva, for lacking in merit. The panel further held that the reliefs of the petitioners were contradictory since they did not tender any electoral material to show that any irregularity occurred during the election. The tribunal also observed that the petitioners were unable to discharge the burden of proof that was placed on them by the law. Reinstatement of Emir Sanusi done in Kano’s best interest –Gov’t BREAKING: Court orders police to evict Bayero from mini palace The panel added that the APC and Sylva failed to show, “polling units by polling units evidence of the non-compliance submitted and how it substantially affected the outcome of the election” The tribunal struck out as incompetent, all the additional proof of evidence as well as statements on oath of some of the witnesses that testified for the petitioners. Sylva had challenged the result of the November 11, 2023 governorship election which saw the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declaring the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with 175,195 with APC’s 110,108. Sylva further contended that INEC also excluded results from three local governments of Southern Ijaw, Ogbia and Nembe. Governor Diri commended the judiciary for upholding his victory and the wishes of the people. He vowed not to be distracted in his commitment to serve the people of the state. Meanwhile, Sylva has vowed to challenge the outcome of the election at the Court of Appeal after meeting critical stakeholders of the party. “No quantum of miscarriage of justice will make us lose confidence in the Nigerian judicial system,” he said.

This week, the pregnant beauty brand founder posted a series of snaps , one of which included a selfie of her wearing a small strawberry sticker on her forehead. The strawberry design may have looked a bit familiar to some, as Bieber, 27, sent customers a sheet of the stickers when they ordered her strawberry glaze Peptide Lip Treatment upon its release last summer. But the one that she was sporting in her Instagram post was much smaller, with Jenner pointing out in the comments: 'R these rhode pimple patches or am I tripping?' Her observation sent Rhode fans into a tizzy, as they enthusiastically replied to The Kardashians star, 28. In a new series of snaps, Hailey Bieber posted a picture of herself wearing a strawberry sticker on her forehead - which Kendall Jenner believes may be a part of her latest Rhode Skin drop Jenner commented on the photo, writing, 'R these rhode pimple patches or am i tripping?' 'ABSOLUTELY,' one user wrote. Another agreed, 'Omgeeeee good catch @haileybieber can I place an order.' 'Right?! Kendall thinking what I was thinking!!!!' someone else chimed in. One more person even seconded, 'The design is TOO CUTE TY KENNY FOR SAYING LMAO.' Bieber herself even replied to Jenner, leaving her with a cheeky string of side-eye emojis. Jenner and Bieber have been friends for more than a decade, and even 'sealed' their friendship by molding a pot to the shape of their bodies during a pottery class earlier this year. The pals posted the adorable moment on their Instagram stories. 'Friendship sealed @haileybieber,' Jenner captioned the video at the time.

        "content": "Revenue worth $100 million to be generated through the export: PTC ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited (PTC) has announced the launch of its ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative, marking a significant milestone in the company’s history of economic contribution. This initiative aims to export PTC’s modern oral tobacco-free nicotine pouches, Velo, to Japan, potentially generating $100 million annually through all its exports, as estimated by PTC. The launch event was attended by Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, along with guests from both the public and private sectors and members of the media. Recognized as Pakistan’s first multinational company, PTC has been a cornerstone of the nation’s economy. Over the past five years, the company has contributed over Rs 680 billion to the national exchequer, earning the prestigious ‘Highest Taxpayers Award’ in 2024 in recognition of its substantial fiscal contributions. In April 2019, PTC embarked on its ‘Made in Pakistan’ initiative, aligned with the Government of Pakistan’s export ambitions, focusing on exporting cigarettes and processed tobacco to various countries. This venture has generated over $157 million since its inception, significantly bolstering the Pakistani economy. Building on this success, the ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative aims to further enhance Pakistan’s economic standing. The introduction of nicotine pouches to the Japanese market represents a pivotal step in PTC’s commitment to innovation and growth, potentially adding an additional $50 million annually through foreign exchange earnings. Federal Minister Jam Kamal stated, “Today marks a new chapter in PTC’s history. The ‘Made in Pakistan 3.0’ initiative not only exemplifies PTC’s dedication to economic progress but also showcases Pakistan’s capability to produce high-quality, innovative products for the global market.” Minister Kamal added, “Pakistan has always been an ideal destination for foreign investors. The government is doing its best to facilitate large-scale investors at all levels. Today’s event is a testimony to the government’s extended support under the premiership of PM Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif.” British American Tobacco Group’s Regional Director for Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, Michael Dijanosic, remarked, “It is a proud moment as PTC prepares to export modern oral nicotine pouches to key markets like Japan. This achievement highlights our strong partnership and marks a major step forward for both BAT and Pakistan. Expanding into international markets creates new revenue streams and opportunities, reinforcing our position as global leaders.” PTC’s Managing Director and CEO, Ali Akbar, added, “We are thrilled to expand our reach with Velo and contribute further to the economic development of Pakistan. Our commitment to excellence and innovation drives us to continuously seek new opportunities and markets. I would like to further request the Government of Pakistan to continue extending their valuable support by framing the right regulatory and fiscal regime for this segment, enabling it to flourish. Sensible regulations will certainly determine the long-term success and sustainability of this business.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

        "content": "How Mike Tyson's mystery illness could be deadly... and what it means for his upcoming fight against Jake Paul READ MORE: Mike Tyson, 57, suffers medical scare during flight to Los Angeles By Maiya Focht For Dailymail.Com Published: 14:09 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:26 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Fans of heavyweight champion fighter Mike Tyson , 57, are concerned about his health following an alarming scare on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday . Tyson, who is set to fight 27 year old Jake Paul in a mere two months, became inexplicably dizzy and nauseous — symptoms that are said to be linked to an ulcer, thought to be in his abdomen. Paramedics boarded the plane in California to deliver immediate medical attention to Mr Tyson. The debacle has led to speculation as to what exactly has happened to cause these odd symptoms, and whether or not it means he will have to delay the long-awaited fight. Concerningly, some research suggests that Tyson could be at risk of developing a more sinister condition, including a catastrophic internal bleed. Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday. Stomach ulcers are small sores that develop on the lining of the stomach or small intestine and can cause a host of GI symptoms, from nausea and bloating to vomiting and dizziness. One of the most severe and rare complications of an ulcer is the potential for the sore to turn into a rupture - splitting your stomach or colon open in what's called a perforation, according to the NIH . This is a rare complication, affecting approximately 2 to 14 percent of people with ulcers. When the stomach or colon splits open, the acid and bacteria that they normally contains may spill out into the body, which can lead to a life-threatening condition known as sepsis. Initial symptoms can present a bit like a fever, causing dizziness, nausea and a high temperature. An ulcer stomach perforation and is fatal in about 30 percent of cases. The risk may be a concern to Tyson's doctors, as being hit in the stomach can also cause perforation, particularly in ulcerated regions. Having an ulcer or getting punched in the stomach, 'doesn’t mean you will have a gastrointestinal perforation, but your risk of having one is higher,' according to doctors from the Cleveland Clinic wrote . GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement However, more likely is simply that the altitude made the typical symptoms of an abdominal ulcer much worse. The everyday symptoms of an ulcer include burning stomach pain, heartburn and bloating, according to Mayo Clinic . But some people develop more troubling symptoms, like nausea, vomiting or dizziness. Elevation can make GI conditions, like ulcers, worse, according to a 2022 review from exercise scientists at The University of New Mexico. This may be because a change in air pressure affects the amount of vital oxygen available to the body's cells, the authors wrote. If your gut cells have less oxygen, they might not produce the same amount of protective coating that they normally do - which is the body's natural defense against stomach acid and ulcer. Even temporary changes in elevation that happen over the course of a flight could be enough to disrupt your gut, a 2014 study from the University of Zurich found. Despite popular ideas that pin the condition on stress or coffee, ulcers are usually caused by a bacteria, called H. Pylori, according to Mayo Clinic. You can get this bug by contact with an infected person, or bad food or water. Doctors don't quite understand how the bacteria causes ulcers, but estimate that it behind the roughly 4 million cases of the problem in the US. Smoking, drinking alcohol or using over the counter pain medicines like aspirin or Advil can all increase your likelihood of developing an ulcer. Tyson will take on Jake Paul in his return to the ring on Netflix later this year. One study , which looked at data from over 50 million hospitalizations, found that Americans who regularly used cannabis were 18 percent more likely to have ulcers as compared to those who didn't use the drug. Mr Tyson is the founder of Tyson 2.0 a weed company that is worth an estimated $400 million dollars. The entrepreneur has been known to smoke $40,000 worth of pot a month from his California cannabis ranch. It's such a common habit of his, in fact, that he publicly swore it off in previous months to prepare for his July match against Mr Paul. Whatever caused Mr Tyson's ulcer, it might be a dangerous liability ahead of his first fight in years. There's no official recommendation for when professional fighters should put down the gloves. There's no official recommendation for when professional fighters should put down the gloves, and anyone who steps into the boxing ring is at risk for brain damage, Dr. Gail Rosseau, a neurosurgeon at North Shore University Health System in Illinois, told the Grio . But those stakes become much higher as a fighter ages. 'The older you are when you sustain a traumatic brain injury [as in boxing], the less likely you are to recover to your pre-injury status,' Dr Rosseau said. She added: 'the typical time course for recovery from the same blow is longer in the older age group.'

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Alexer Perez Gopa, the estranged wife of Harrison Tare Okiri, aka Harrysong, has fired back at the singer over his recent claims about her. The singer recently accused her of infidelity, claiming she got pregnant for another man while they were still married. But in a series of posts on her Insta stories, Alexer denied the claims made by Harrysong. In the now-deleted posts, she also alleged that the singer is always broke because he is a chronic cheat. Alexer claimed he infected her with sexually transmitted diseases as a result of his infidelity. She asked the singer to come forward with evidence of her infidelity, adding that she was ready to undergo a DNA test for all her children. Alexer also made several allegations against Harrysong, claiming he bedwets. “Do you all know that Harrysong bedwets? Yes, celebrity wey dey piss for body. Oh, so sorry to break it to u all. I also get to deal with this daily, while calling him my lord. You said I convinced you to get married to me? A 20-year-old girl, convincing a full-grown man to get married to her? “Please make me understand, never knew I was married to a robot who couldn’t make decisions for himself. Same you who told me your ex-girlfriend used charms on you and now your eyes are open since u met me. So, it’s now me that forced marriage on you, really? I never knew my mum married 6 husbands wow, chronic. My mum only remarried when she lost her husband, as I speak, she is happily married with her dowry paid in full. “Since when did it become a crime for a widow to remarry? And what do the words “till do us part” mean? Pained soul, why are you trying to project your insecurities on me? We all know your mum gave birth to 6 children for 6 different men. None of which she was married to. And you, a product of incest. Imagine having 5 siblings and you don’t know who their fathers are. Why throw stones when you live in a glass house? “Wait, did you just say my mum lives in an uncompleted building? Please, you all can go and verify. My mum is sitting comfortably in the house her husband built, let us not forget the house she built for herself. Now Harrysong show me your house, the only legacy your dad left on earth is a mud house which you have no plans of renovating. “Ever since I knew you, we have been on rent. A reasonable man will sit down with his wife and plan a future but Harrison’s plans are always centred on women. If I start to mention the amount of side fowls, both old and young, I know, Instagram will not even contain the names. They even go as far as calling me to threaten me because of you. Harrison is always broke because he is a chronic cheat. “Now let’s come to me, if you are a man or men that I had sexual relations with while I was married to Harrysong, please step forward with evidence. And if there is any way we can run a DNA test on all my kids, including the one I lost, I am open to it because I fear nothing. A clear conscience fears no accusation. “Like I said, you keep projecting your insecurities on me. Harrison, how many times did I get to treat STDs because of you? The only sexually transmitted infections I did not get to treat weekly were HIV and Hepatitis B. You are on Nedu’s podcast spewing shit about me, same Nedu that you warned me about. Same Nedu you said was cunning and was a bad friend when Soso got you arrested,” she wrote. Harrysong married Alexer in March 2021 and they have two children. Their marital crisis unfolded in January after an alleged WhatsApp chat between them surfaced on social media. The chat showed the singer asking his wife to abort a pregnancy. In another conversation, Alexer accused Harrysong of having several side chicks, which he admitted and claimed that they were better than her. The alleged chat, however, prompted a statement from Harrysong. The singer, in the statement, admitted that they were going through a marital crisis while pleading with the public to respect his family’s privacy. Alexer also opened up about their marital issues, adding that Harrysong abused her verbally and physically.",

'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' a spokesperson for President Joe Biden 's National Security Council said. 'Israel has a right to go after Hamas , and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we've been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened, and understand that the IDF is conducting an investigation.' At least 45 people were killed by the blast and subsequent fires, according to the Gaza health ministry, including 23 women, children and older people. The ministry said that 249 people were wounded. Israel's strike on Rafah killed at least 45 civilians Yassin Rabia, a Hamas commander, and Khaled Nagar, another senior Hamas official, were the targets and were killed. Israel's military said it was investigating the civilian deaths. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the civilian deaths a 'tragic accident.' Netanyahu said the Israeli Defense Forces tried to minimize civilian deaths by asking Gazans to evacuate, but 'despite our supreme effort not to harm uninvolved civilians, a tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.' He accused Hamas of hiding among the general population, saying: 'For us, every uninvolved civilian who is hurt is a tragedy. For Hamas it's a strategy. That's the whole difference.' The strike caused a fire that blazed through the camp in the Rafah governorate's Tal Al-Sultan area, reducing tents and shelters to ashes. Footage released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of ambulances racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded, including children. As Palestinians cleared the site on Monday, only blackened metal sheeting and charred planks remained, the tent shelters having been all but obliterated. The strike came after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive of Rafah and officials are trying to restart ceasefire negotiations. A Palestinian man and his children sit in a destroyed room following the targeting or a residential building by an Israeli airstrike in Rafah in the southern Gaza President Joe Biden's administration admonished Israel over the attack It caused caused international outrage. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was 'outraged' over Israel's latest attacks. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,' he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. 'International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,' Baerbock said. Additionally, Israeli forces exchanged gunfire with Egyptian troops along their shared border that resulted in the death of at least one Egyptian soldier. The IDF this afternoon reported a 'shooting incident' at the border close to the crossing into Gaza, adding that it was discussing the issue with the Egyptian authorities but revealed no further information. 'A few hours ago, a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,' the military said this afternoon in a statement. Cairo quickly confirmed the shooting as a military spokesman said authorities had opened an investigation into the incident.

The storms, so far, have killed at least 21 people, after tornadoes and severe weather struck the central and southern United States. Among them were four children, spurring a statewide emergency declaration in Kentucky, as the mass of severe weather is set to move east Monday. More than 100million people across the East Coast are thus at risk, including the Tristate - where thunderstorms and possibly even a tornado are in the forecast. New York City will be under a red alert from 6pm Monday due to the threat of severe thunderstorms - which is expected to last into the early hours of Tuesday. People in the Big Apple will experience torrential rain, hail, and gusty winds, and hail - which may produce flash flooding. Seven people have died in northern Texas , eight in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and four in Kentucky - with a fifth person 'fighting for their life,' the Blue Grass State's governor revealed in a press conference called Monday. Scroll down for video: A tornado spins in Eddyville, Kentucky, Sunday - part of a system of severe weather that's so far killed at least 21 people in four states Seven are dead in northern Texas, wreckage was strewn across a property Sunday the day after a deadly series of tornados hit Valley View and much of the rest of the central United States 'Sadly we can confirm that we have lost at least four Kentuckians from last night's storm,' Gov. Andy Beshear said at the emergency conference from the Kentucky Emergency Operations Center. 'That means we know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting. 'We ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them and the days the weeks and the years to come,' he added - before revealing the uncertain fate for the fifth person is 'fighting for their life.' The four fatalities included a 67-year-old woman in Mercer County, a 62-year-old woman in Hardin County, a 48-year-old woman in Hopkins County, and a 34-year-old man in Jefferson County - all of whom went unnamed. The update brought the nationwide death toll over the Memorial Day Weekend up to 21, after a woman and two of her children saw their home struck by a tornado Saturday night in Valley View, Texas, killing all three. 'It was a really terrible thing,' Benito Esparza, the sole survivor's brother, told CNN in Spanish Monday, of the fate of sister-in-law Laura Esparza and her children Marco, 10, and Miranda, 16. His brother, Refugio Esparza, survived the tornado, but suffered a broken leg and pelvis. 'He lost three people, his wife and two kids,' Benito Esparza said. 'It's not easy.' The mass of severe weather is now set to move east, leaving more than 100million across the East Coast in places like New York City (seen here Monday Morning) are at risk One of at least 20 powerful tornadoes spotted Saturday and Sunday - this one seen in North Texas later Saturday in Cooke County Another eight have died in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma and four in Kentucky - with a fifth person 'fighting for their life' in the Blue Grass State, Gov. Andy Beshear revealed in a press conference called Monday. The update brought the nationwide death toll over the Memorial Day Weekend up to 21, after a woman and two of her kids saw their home struck by a tornado Saturday night in Valley View, Texas. Pictured: Laura Esparza (center) and kids Miranda, 16, and Marco, 10 He added how two of Refugio's older children were not at the home at the time of the tornado, which first surfaced outside the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight Saturday, and saw at least seven killed. That made it the deadliest tornado in state history since 2015 - leaving residents to dig through the tons of rubble and debris left behind. That distinction was not lost on Benito, who spent Monday morning sifting through the remains of his brother's home for what was left. 'It's a very big disaster for everyone, as you can see,' said Esparza of storm's ongoing effect, as recovery efforts to continue. He further recalled how his three family members died after their trailer was thrusted across a street - a scene that was sadly not unique across the country Saturday and Sunday. There were more than 20 tornado reports within that span ranging from Texas to Missouri, bolstered by several detailing the damage left behind and, of course, the casualties. Elsewhere in Texas, violent storms overtook 18-wheelers, destroyed homes, and brought down power lines - even crushing a Shell station in Cooke County. This left 125 people trapped for a period Saturday night, officials said - revealing how all miraculously were retrieved uninjured. Several of the deaths were reported in Valley View in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park That made it the deadliest tornado in state history since 2015 - leaving residents to dig through the tons of rubble and debris left behind. The area as it was Sunday, as recovery efforts persist Also hit was nearby Denton County, where search and recovery efforts are still underway There, the storms inflicted some of their worst damage - in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. The system then threatened to bring more violent weather to parts of the Midwest, affecting counties in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. A slew of deaths in those states were recorded Sunday, mostly from falling trees. One such death was confirmed in Mercer County early Monday, before the governor confirmed four overall had died. That person was pronounced dead along with another in Louisville , where Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed it was a storm-related death. Hours later, the state's governor revealed the tally was up to four - a number that very well could still rise, he said. The trees and homes damaged in those states were hit not only by tornados, but by winds that reached 135mph in some places, leaving some 500,000 without electricity across Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Texas. Out of the 21 who died, seven of the storm-related deaths came from Cooke County, Texas, as well as eight across a range of areas in Arkansas. Juana Landeros, who rode out deadly tornado with her husband and her 9-year-old son when it rolled through the previous night, salvages items from her destroyed home Sunday More damage in Denton county is seen here, as much of the central US was not spared by the twisters A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday in savaged Valley View The storms left a wide trail of destruction Sunday, before moving northeast into Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky Guadalupe Virgin statue lays among the rubble of a destroyed home in Valley View, which was one of the town's most affected by the tornados and more than 100pmh winds Wreckage is strewn across a property the day after a deadly series of tornados hit the central United States, in an aerial view over the north Texas town near Oklahoma Several cars are seen heavily damaged outside the remains of a Shell gas station, after it collapsed in on itself trapping more than 100 people taking shelter. Miraculously, they all survived unscathed, officials said Another two were recorded in Oklahoma's Mayes County, where trees have been uprooted by twisters all over town, with powerlines down and structures flattened. In Arkansas, The National Weather Service in Tulsa said a survey team found EF-3 damage near the town of Decatur, where at least one tornado hit. Another two hit Beaver Lake and others in Benton County, where three of the eight casualties were recorded. A 26-year-old woman, moreover, was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, as recovery efforts in all four states continue. In addition to the incident described by Esparza, the dead in Texas included two other children, ages 2 and 5, and three other family members also found together in a tornado-struck home in Cooke County. The severe weather, meanwhile, is not over, after it pushed east into the Midwest and the Ohio Valley over the course of Sunday. Missouri was the state hit hardest Sunday, where residents of Mehlville reported a violent storm and possible tornado that destroyed dozens of houses. This saw cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, Nashville, Tennessee, St. Louis, and Cincinnati hit by strong showers and damaging winds, but no tornados, as of writing. It is set to finish off today over the East Coast, where risk of severe weather was issued to mid-Atlantic strongholds such as Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; and Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina. Damage is seen to Tom Jones' home after the roof blew off during a storm Sunday in nearby Claremore, a community just across the border in Oklahoma view storm damage to their next door neighbor's home in the small town, which is located in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains People view more of the storm damage Sunday in the same community, after the weather moved east to other states Two deaths were recorded in Oklahoma's Mayes County (seen here Sunday), where trees have been uprooted by twisters all over town, with powerlines down and structures flattened People view the damage at the town's First Baptist Church, after a curfew was put into effect the night before Businesses in Arkansas were also damaged from the storm, with Home Town Flea Market in Rodgers left in ruins Sunday Eight people overall died as a result of the weather in the state, which left the city in Benton county 'unrecognizable', officials said Missouri was the state hit hardest Sunday, where residents of Mehlville reported a violent storm and possible tornado that destroyed dozens of houses Meanwhile, clean-ups in several counties in those five states continue, as officials continue to look for any others hurt by the disasters There, 27 million people are at risk of strong to severe thunderstorms, with more than 110 million people are at risk of severe weather in general. That includes south of New England, where there is a level 2 out of 5 threat. Meanwhile, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, are at risk for tornadoes, but the chances for any to develop are low, officials said. The travel hubs of Atlanta, New York, and Philadelphia will also have to contend with the prospect of damaging storms, and even the odd tornado. This will likely lead to delayed or canceled flights Monday, as Memorial Day winds to a close. Travelers are urged to check the current weather conditions of the states they are heading to.

New formations of soldiers and “expanded activities” at depots and warehouses in settlements north of Ukraine ’s second city, Kharkiv , have been identified by the Institute of War Studies. Volodymyr Zelensky warned that “thousands” of troops were preparing for a fresh assault, and issued a fresh plea to the West to allow them to fire Western missiles into Russia to halt the advance. A US think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) , however, concluded that the build-up may also be to “stretch and fix Ukrainian forces” which are struggling to hold positions across the front lines. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) READ MORE: Ukraine dealt blow as Putin's troops claim to have captured key village [LATEST] On a visit to Spain on Monday, Mr Zelensky secured another £850,000 military aid package (Image: Getty) Ukrainian officials are frustrated that they have been banned from striking targets inside Russia with Western missiles, arguing that this has given Russian forces a safe area to prepare ground attacks and fire missiles at Ukrainian cities. Following an attack toward Kharkiv on 10th May, officials have warned that the Kremlin also plans to attack Sumy, which lies 100 miles from Kharkiv. On 3rd May, the UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said it was up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons and insisted it had a right to strike targets on Russian territory. Meanwhile, over the weekend Poland and Sweden gave permission for Ukraine to hit targets inside Russia , along with the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. Pressure is now building on the US to follow the UK, despite concerns that this will escalate the war. Germany and Italy have both ruled out such permission. Don't miss...

On a visit to Spain on Monday, Mr Zelensky secured another £850,000 military aid package but the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez , did not give Ukrainian commanders permission to fire Spanish weapons at Russia . “Spain has been supporting Ukraine for two years. Unfortunately, Russian aggression continues and we have to increase our support,” Mr Sanchez said at a joint press conference. So far, Ukraine has been using domestic drones to hit targets across Russia , mainly oil refineries, railways and military airfields. However, on Monday, sources confirmed that it had struck a Russian nuclear radar station near the border with Kazakhstan, 1,000 miles away. This became the second Ukrainian strike against Russia ’s nuclear missile infrastructure in four days, which comes as a concern to its Western allies, who are worried about further escalation .

        "content": "A flood advisory was issued by the National Weather Service on Monday at 2:02 p.m. in effect until 4 p.m. for Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties. The weather service comments, \"Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.\" \"Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas,\" says the weather service. \"Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Please report observed flooding to local emergency services or law enforcement and request they pass this information to the National Weather Service when you can do so safely.\" A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is imminent or occurring. If you are in a flood-prone area, move immediately to high ground. A flash flood is a sudden violent flood that can take from minutes to hours to develop. It is even possible to experience a flash flood in areas not immediately receiving rain. A flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring. A flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property. A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It doesn't guarantee that flooding will occur, but it signifies that the possibility exists. In flood-prone regions or while camping in low-lying areas, understanding and following the weather service flood safety guidelines can be a lifesaver: 1. Move to higher ground: 2. Adhere to evacuation orders: 3. Disconnect utilities and appliances: 4. Steer clear of flooded basements and submerged areas: 5. Swift evacuation for your safety: 6. Stay away from floodwaters: 7. Seek high ground if trapped: During periods of intense rainfall, the risk of flooding increases, particularly in low-lying and flood-prone areas. It is imperative to avoid driving through any water on the road, even if it seems shallow. According to the weather service, most cars can be swept away by just 12 inches of rushing water. Prioritize your safety by staying informed and prepared. When heavy rain sets in, the risk of flooding and hazardous driving conditions rises. Whether it's prolonged rainfall or rapid runoff, being prepared is essential. Here are some valuable safety tips from the weather service to ensure you stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of rapid water flow: Maintain safe driving distances: Slow down and stay cautious: Choose your lane wisely: Visibility matters: Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

        "description": "The three current Habs who took part in world championship — Kaiden Guhle, Cole Caufield and Juraj Slafkovsky — return home empty-handed.",
        "content": "Article content Last year, Canadiens goalie Samuel Montembeault left the IIHF World Championship, held in Finland and Latvia, with a gold medal around his neck after playing for Team Canada. This year, former Canadiens forward Tomas Plekanek left the world championship in Czechia with a gold medal as an assistant coach with Czechia. The Boston Bruins’ David Pastrnak scored the winning goal at 9:13 of the third period Sunday as Czechia beat Switzerland 2-0 to become only the fifth country to win the world championship on home ice. David Kampf added an empty-netter in the final minute in front of 17,413 fans who went wild at the O2 Arena in Prague. The victory kicked off a huge celebration throughout Czechia, including at the Old Town Square in Prague. Fans in Czechia will be thrilled for Plekanec, as will fans in Montreal. Plekanec played in 11 world championships for Czechia, but never won a gold medal. He did win two silver and three bronze medals. The 41-year-old retired as a player last October because of an injury after playing nine games with Kladno in the Czech Extraliga, posting 1-3-4 totals. Plekanec played 15 seasons with the Canadiens and ranks seventh on the list for career games with the club with 984, trailing only Henri Richard (1,258), Larry Robinson (1,202), Bob Gainey (1,160), Jean Béliveau (1,125), Claude Provost (1,005) and Andrei Markov (990). Montembeault took a pass on playing at this year’s world championship , saying he wanted to take some more time to rest his body and then have a full summer to work out in preparation for next season. Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki also took a pass , instead getting engaged to longtime girlfriend Caitlin Fitzgerald at a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic. Canadiens defenceman Mike Matheson also took a pass because his wife, Emily, was pregnant and she gave birth to the couple’s second child on May 17. There were three Canadiens players who took part in this year’s world championship and they all came home empty-handed. Team Canada, with Canadiens defenceman Kaiden Guhle, lost 4-2 to Sweden in Sunday’s bronze-medal game. Guhle missed the game with TSN’s Gord Miller reporting the defenceman was injured while blocking a shot during Saturday’s 3-2 shootout loss to Switzerland in the semifinals. Guhle finished the tournament with 1-4-5 totals and a plus-4 differential in nine games. Former Canadien Sven Andrighetto scored the shootout winner for Switzerland in the semifinals. Team USA, with Canadiens forward Cole Caufield, lost 1-0 to Czechia in the quarterfinals. Caufield finished the tournament with 4-4-8 totals in eight games. Slovakia, with Canadiens forward Juraj Slafkovsky, lost 6-3 to Canada in the quarterfinals. Slafkovsky finished the tournament with 0-8-8 totals in eight games to finish second in team scoring behind Libor Hudacek (5-5-10). “Maybe it’s distorted by the information that I didn’t score a goal, but we did other things,” Slafkovsky told Slovakian reporters . “It could have been better. Sure, it could have been better. Maybe I expected more from myself, but not every championship is as expected. The other boys did well, which I’m glad for, and when it was necessary, they made the decisions. In such a short tournament, it doesn’t matter who scores the goals.” Slafkovsky played on the same line with former Canadien Tomas Tatar, who said the 20-year-old is the most popular player in Slovakia. “He’s huge,” Tatar told Luc Gélinas of RDS, who was in Czechia to cover the tournament. “He has a great personality, which is awesome to see. He’s humble, he’s fun to be around.” Among those cheering on Slafkovsky in Czechia were his two grandmothers. “They didn’t have a chance to come to Montreal yet,” Slafkovsky told Gélinas. “It’s great to see them here and hopefully they have a chance to come (soon) to Montreal.” The 22-year-old Guhle is hoping his performance at the world championship might lead to him earning a spot with Team Canada for the 2026 Olympics as NHL players return to the Games for the first time since 2014. “Obviously, that’s in the back of my mind,” Guhle told Gélinas. “’26 would be pretty crazy I think for me. Olympics, it’s a dream. Ever since I was a kid watching the Olympics was something that I always dream of. Seeing Sidney Crosby score the golden goal in 2010 (in Vancouver), it’s still something that I think about and still have in my memory. Would definitely be a dream come true getting to play for the Olympics and play for Canada.” The next major international competition for NHL players will be the Four Nations Cup , slated for Feb. 12-20 in Montreal and Boston with teams from Canada, the United States, Sweden and Finland. The tournament will replace the NHL all-star weekend, but it won’t include the two countries who played in the world championship final. Pastrnak isn’t happy about that and after winning the world championship posted a photo on Instagram of himself in the Czechia locker room with a gold medal around his neck, the trophy in one hand and a beer in the other, writing: “Maybe Four Nation invite now?” scowan@postmedia.com x.com/StuCowan1",

        "content": ", - The high price of airline tickets is still widely discussed by the public, especially after Garuda Indonesia president director proposed to increase the price of airline tickets due to high operating costs. The head of the National Consumer Protection Agency (BPKN), Mufti Mubarok, rejected the idea, saying that increasing the price of airline tickets would burden the public. \"Expensive ticket prices will make consumers scream,\" he said on May 25, According to Mufti, ticket prices were already expensive before the increase. He claimed that airlines often violate government-imposed fare caps without strict sanctions from the regulator. \"High operating costs are a classic reason for airlines to raise ticket prices,\" he added. Irfan Setiaputra, president director of Garuda Indonesia, is aware that his proposal to raise the fare cap could trigger public protests. He appealed to the public not to compare domestic ticket prices with international ones, particularly in terms of services. He argued that airplanes are not the main means of transportation, but are used by certain groups who sometimes have certain interests. He hopes people can understand that airplanes come at a high cost. \"As much as 30 percent of our costs are for jet fuel, 30 percent for [aircraft] leases, and 20 to 30 percent for maintenance. Should we have a zero budget for maintenance?\" he said on Wednesday, May 22. Several international airlines offer programs that turn layovers into stopovers at no additional cost. Check out this list. National flag carrier PT Garuda Indonesia records a surge in revenue growth of up to 18.07 percent. Garuda Indonesia CEO disagrees with the government's plan to impose tourism fees on airline tickets. Check out the top 10 longest flights in the world, ranked according to distance and travel time AirNav Indonesia has directed 52,567 aircraft movements, both take-offs, landings, and overflights during the Eid homecoming flow from April 3 to 15. Check out this list of the top 10 airlines with the most expensive plane tickets in the world. State airliner Garuda Indonesia launched the GarudaMiles Diaspora Indonesia Program in Hong Kong which offers discounts on ticket prices. The Central Statistics Agency or BPS stated that airfares in Ramadan in March 2024 experienced deflation of 0.97 percent. KPPU has scheduled summons to seven airlines to clarify airplane ticket price hikes. The Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU) highlights the spike in ticket prices offered by airlines ahead of the Eid al-Fitr holiday.",

        "content": "View of the Pasig River where the Pasig River Expressway is expected to emerge. INQUIRER.net MANILA, Philippines — San Miguel Corp. (SMC) might still pursue the P81.53-billion Pasig River Expressway (Parex) as it puts the project only on hold for further review, taking into consideration the public’s opinion before proceeding. Ramon Ang, SMC president and CEO, told reporters on Monday in Pasay they were “clarifying” the concerns of the public about the project. “[If] it will benefit more people, why not,” he said when asked if they would still go ahead with the project after postponing it for further review.This showed Ang’s easing of stance about the tollway project as he previously said in March they were dropping it due to adverse public opinion. In 2021, the scientist group Advocates of Science and Technology for the People said the proposed elevated expressway would cause damage to the river as it would block the natural sunlight and “affect the remaining food chain of Pasig River.” Private-sector group Ilog Pasiglahin, in a statement in March, said it was critical to preserve the Pasig River as it is also connected to other bodies of water, including Manila Bay, Laguna de Bay, and the rivers of Marikina, San Juan, and Taguig. Toll Regulatory Board Executive Director Alvin Carullo told the media last week the project was on the final engineering design stage. The planned Parex project is a 19.37-kilometer six-lane expressway passing through the Pasig River from Radial Road 10 in Manila and the proposed South East Metro Manila Expressway at Circumferential Road 6.Following the cancellation of the Parex project, SMC announced they broke ground for the 76.8-km Pangasinan Link Expressway, which is seen to support economic activities by linking the eastern and western corridors of the province. —Tyrone Jasper C.

        "content": "Philippine National Bank (PNB) — INQUIRER.net photo MANILA, Philippines — Philippine National Bank (PNB) will be raising $300 million via a medium-term note offering, to build up its coffers for its financing requirements. In a disclosure on Monday, the Lucio Tan-led lender announced that its board had approved the issuance of the note, with an option to upsize, from its $2-billion euro medium-term note program. The bank, however, has yet to disclose further details about the offer period and interest rates attached to the notes, among others. PNB’s euro medium-term note program was established in 2018 to provide a funding source for the company. In 2019, the listed financial institution raised $750 million via the offshore bond market, drawing down from the program. The offered fixed-rate senior notes maturing by September 2024 have a coupon rate of 3.27 percent per annum. READ: PNB raises $750M via offshore bond issuance The bank also tapped the medium-term note program for the launch of $300-million fixed-rate senior note offerings with a coupon rate of 4.25 percent annually and a tenor of five years. Last month, credit watcher Moody’s Ratings affirmed the bank’s foreign currency senior unsecured medium-term note program rating at “(P)Baa3,” which means moderate credit risk. Moody’s also noted that PNB’s nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio has remained “stable” at 7.3 percent as of end-2023 compared to 7.2 percent in 2022. An NPL ratio indicates how much loans extended to clients have remained unpaid and a lower figure means less credit risk for the lender. Should NPLs rise, banks allocate a bigger credit loss provision, which will eventually hurt their bottom line. In the first quarter, PNB grew its net income by 10 percent to P5.3 million as interest income improved by 17 percent to P16.08 billion. Total assets stood at P1.196 trillion as of end-March, while net loans and receivables amounted to P610 billion and deposit liabilities reached P916.4 billion.

        "content": "A recent decision of the Supreme Court is cautionary to people who sign contracts without reading or understanding their content. The case involved a woman who died of hypertension shortly after she finished her exercise routine at a fitness center. Her husband sued the center for negligence on the grounds that it failed to take her blood pressure and for not having a doctor on-site at all times. The lower and appellate courts decided in favor of the husband, but the high court reversed their rulings and dismissed the claim for damages. It said the center was not negligent because she stated in her application that she was not suffering from hypertension despite her duty to inform it of any medical problem before engaging in any exercise activity. In addition, the center’s records and handouts to its members showed that it had no obligation to take their blood pressure and have a doctor on standby at the premises at all times. This case brings to mind the dismissive attitude of many Filipinos toward written contracts in business transactions that require the accomplishment of supporting documents. Thus, for example, transactions with banks, insurance companies, and car dealers are accompanied by various kinds of documents that spell out in detail the duties and responsibilities of the parties, including the consequences that may arise in case those terms are not complied with. Because those papers often consist of several pages and are written in legalese or arcane business words that can cause a nosebleed to a layperson, their signatories often hardly read them and simply affix their signatures. They assume that the other party would act in good faith and would not take advantage of the trust they’ve given them. Besides, requesting clarifications or asking questions may not sit well with the counterparty who may want to conclude the transaction as soon as possible and receive his or her commission, if any. Those documents may be described as “contracts of adhesion” or agreements that have been prepared by the party with whom a transaction is being forged and, for obvious reasons, contain fine print that is favorable or advantageous to it. These are often cleverly concealed in “provided, however” clauses or references to other provisions elsewhere in the document that require close reading. Under these circumstances, the party being asked to sign them is put in a “take it or leave it” position, with the chances of making changes or adjustments in their terms practically nil lest they result in unsustainable precedents. Although going through those papers may look tedious or time-consuming, it is prudent that they be read carefully and when some items are unclear, to ask for clarification. There should be no room for shame or embarrassment about requesting explanations, if warranted, because once the document is signed (and in most cases, notarized) it becomes binding on the parties. Belated claims that a party did not understand the meaning of some of the terms and conditions or had misinterpreted the consequences of failure to comply with them will not receive a favorable ear if the contract becomes the subject of litigation. Bear in mind, however, that business transactions cut both ways. That is, they would, if satisfactorily completed, be mutually beneficial as they would serve the interests of the contracting parties, so the right to be enlightened on vague provisions should be exercised. Another flaw in the treatment of documents in business transactions is ignoring or making light of disclosure requirements or provisions that request relevant personal or professional information. Because these data are relevant to the transaction under consideration, it is essential that they are accurate or up to date, otherwise the failure to do so could be cited as legal basis to invalidate any claims that may arise from the subject documents. Going back to the case of the disallowed claim for damages, the high court had no choice but to dismiss it because if the rules were bent for humanitarian reasons, it would create an unfavorable precedent on the principle of sanctity of contracts that businesses feel very strongly about.

        "content": "Bureau of the Treasury MANILA, Philippines — Rates on short-dated securities snapped four straight weeks of decline during Monday’s sale of Treasury bills (T-bills) amid hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Auction results showed the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) was still able to fully raise its target amount of P15 billion via T-bills sale. The offer attracted total demand amounting to P38.3 billion, 2.5 times larger than the original size of the issuance. Michael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said T-bill rates “corrected slightly higher” after some Fed officials hinted at a delayed rate cut, which may have an influence on the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ own easing moves. “Treasury bill average auction yields corrected slightly higher after slightly declining for four straight weeks, after consistent higher-for-longer signals from most officials and from the Fed minutes recently that reduced the odds of a rate cut,” Ricafort said in a commentary sent to journalists. READ: Less hawkish central bank tempers T-bill rates According to the BTr, the 91-day T-bill fetched an average rate of 5.719 percent, more expensive than 5.712 percent in the previous auction. The yield on the 182-day debt notes stood at 5.886 percent, higher than 5.864 percent previously. The 364-day T-bill fetched a rate of 6.043 percent, up from the previous auction’s 6.007 percent. The Marcos administration plans to borrow P585 billion from local creditors in the second quarter of 2024—the same as the financing program in the first quarter. Under the plan, the government is targeting to raise P195 billion via T-bills and P390 billion via Treasury bonds. Overall, the Department of Finance had announced a bigger borrowing plan for this year at P2.57 trillion—from the old program of P2.46 trillion—as the government raises funds to plug a bigger-than-previously-expected budget hole of P1.5 trillion.

        "content": "A new drama has unfolded amid the “ghost employees” scandal haunting the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). On Monday, Monetary Board (MB) member Benjamin Diokno said he “strongly objects” to the “allegation” that the BSP was “politicized” during his term as central bank governor from 2019 to 2022. He issued a strongly worded statement related to the scandal hounding his two fellow MB members—Bruce Tolentino and Anita Linda Aquino, whose offices allegedly hired ghost employees who may have been on the BSP’s payroll for over a year. READ: BIZ BUZZ: MB seats going vacant soon? Diokno took over the BSP as governor in 2019 when he was appointed by former President Rodrigo Duterte, who also picked Tolentino and Aquino as members of the MB, the highest policy-making body of the BSP. “I’m proud of what I did as BSP governor,” Diokno said, adding that Duterte “has respected the independence of the BSP during the most difficult period in the Philippines’ recent history.” “President Duterte never called me to influence monetary policy. It was never politicized,” an incensed Diokno said. Sources said the BSP wants to recover a “significant” amount of salaries and bonuses paid to the ghost employees, as well as give the MB members tied to the controversy an “orderly exit.” That said, the scandal could potentially trigger a major revamp of the MB at a time the BSP is battling stubbornly high inflation and tackling a volatile peso. And markets are watching how the BSP would come out of this crisis that has brought reputational risks to an institution revered for professionalism. —Ian Nicolas P. Cigaral During the Philippine Economic Briefing in Pasay on Monday, tycoon Ramon S. Ang made his stance clear on the country’s territorial dispute against China in front of top government officials. The chief of San Miguel Corp.—an industry giant with diverse business interests including Petron Corp.—told the country’s economic managers the contested West Philippine Sea would benefit the country in terms of oil production. “We have a very big reserve at the West Philippine Sea. That’s why they’re very interested in the Philippines,” said Ang, who was standing tall and poised in the middle of the Philippine International Convention Center’s reception hall as he delivered his short speech. “Let’s not let go of it. We should claim our territory,” he stressed. A round of applause filled the room after. The Department of Energy estimated in 2021 that the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone has 6.2 billion barrels of oil reserves. — Tyrone Jasper C. Piad The government is eyeing bigger private sector participation in the capital buildup of Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), as the state-run lender moves to beef up its buffers following its hefty contribution to the country’s nascent sovereign wealth fund. The Department of Finance’s (DoF) version of a bill seeking to amend DBP’s 26-year-old charter included a proposal to allow the lender to float 30 percent of its capital stock for public ownership, instead of the 20-percent minimum requirement that corporate regulators currently impose to publicly listed firms. READ: IPO seen to strengthen LandBank, DBP Such a proposal came from the DoF, not from DBP, according to Michael de Jesus, company president and CEO. The bank official said such an amendment would give DBP “more flexibility” in raising capital and “encourage” investments from the private sector. De Jesus said that, at the end of the day, the government would still own more than 67 percent of DBP. ”It’s still a super majority,” he said.

At the heart of the charter amendment is the increase in DBP’s authorized capital stock to P300 billion, from the current P35 billion. The proposed capital hike, in turn, would pave the way for the bank’s stock market debut. — Ian Nicolas P. Cigaral",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Cyberattacks targeting Philippine businesses surged by over threefold last year as threat actors stepped up their game amid increasing digitalization, according to Kaspersky. In a statement on Monday, the Russian cybersecurity firm reported that web-based attacks aimed at local enterprises surged to 1.69 million last year from 492,567 in 2022. Web attacks come in different forms, including the typical phishing emails embedded with suspicious web addresses linking to fake websites. The goal of cyber attackers is to illegally obtain sensitive and personal data they can use to take over one’s bank, e-wallet, and other accounts. Perpetrators have remained active because of financial motivation. With a successful account takeover, they can siphon off money and transfer the amount to their own accounts. Southeast Asia, in total, dealt with more than 13 million cyberattacks last year—about the same amount it fended off in 2022. Kaspersky tracked most of the digital threats in Indonesia with nearly five million attacks, followed by Vietnam with about two million. READ: PH faces more cyberattacks from China-based hackers More than 36,000 online attacks were deployed every day last year in the region, Kaspersky noted. “As most governments in the region build and boost their policies to foster their digital economy and infrastructure, it is urgent for local businesses to prioritize strengthening their cyber defenses against threats lurking online which can hamper their efforts to harness the benefits digitalization brings about,” said Yeo Siang Tiong, Kaspersky general manager for Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Kaspersky also blocked nearly 300,000 ransomware attacks last year in the region. Most of these were detected in Thailand with 109,315 incidents, followed by Indonesia, with 97,226, and Vietnam with 59,837. The Philippines came next with 15,312 ransomware attacks foiled during the period. READ: PH cyberdefenses building up; attacks down in 2023 Ransomware is a cyberattack whereby hackers hold an entity’s network hostage until a ransom is paid. The disruption in operations caused by such cyberattacks is detrimental to the business due to spending related to the retrieval of their data or system, in addition to opportunity costs because of the downtime.

The person driving the $1 million boat told the Coast Guard over the radio that their vessel 'struck an object in the water and was taking on water,' according to a press release . The radio mayday was made at 11:37 a.m. The Coast Guard coordinated with county authorities and 'nearby good Samaritans' to assist in the rescue. A marine unit from St. John's County Fire and Rescue reached the sinking boat first and got both people out safely. One of the boat's passengers sustained minor injuries and was transported to a hospital, Boat International reported. 'We extend our heartfelt gratitude to St. John's County Fire and Rescue for their invaluable assistance during this case,' said Senior Chief Petty Officer Ricardo Santacana, a Coast Guard Sector Jacksonville command duty officer. The yacht is seen tipping over to its starboard side, or the right side. Rescue boats surround the $1 million vessel Santacana continued: 'With the weather improving and mariners heading out onto the water, it's imperative for everyone to verify the presence of all necessary safety equipment aboard their vessel. 'This ensures that responders, as demonstrated in this case, can swiftly locate you and render assistance when an emergency arises.' Additional photos from rescue teams show that the boat took on water and eventually went vertical before slipping beneath the water. The ship that sank, called 'Atlantis,' and has a top speed of 45 knots, or about 51 miles per hour. The boat is about to go vertical moments before it completely sinks off the coast of St. Augustine Beach The yacht has clear signs of damage as it's about to capsize. The cause of the sinking is still being investigated and the owner will have to arrange salvaging plans for the wreckage It's unclear what 'object' the yacht hit, but there are at least seven reefs off the coast of St. Augustine Beach, where the vessel ultimately sunk. The owner of the capsized vessel will arrange to have it salvaged as authorities investigate what caused the crash.

The two royal ladies joined forces in Denmark in February 2022, when Kate accompanied Mary on a visit to the Danner Crisis Centre, which helps women and children affected by domestic violence. The British royal couple were also reunited with the Danish royals at a Buckingham Palace reception the night before King Charles' coronation. The Prince and Princess of Wales also held a meeting with Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit at Windsor Castle in March 2023, having also carried out a royal tour to Norway in 2018. Kate's first ever solo trip abroad in 2016 saw her fly to the Netherlands, where she met King Willem-Alexander for lunch. The Dutch royals also enjoyed a state visit to the UK during Queen Elizabeth II's reign in 2018. And in 2017, William and Kate joined the Belgian royals at commemorations for the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele. The royal family has postponed engagements \"which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign\" after Rishi Sunak called a surprise summer General Election for 4 July. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \"Following the Prime Minister’s statement this afternoon calling a General Election, the royal family will, in accordance with normal procedure, postpone engagements that may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign. Their Majesties send their sincere apologies to any of those who may be affected as a result.\" While the D-Day commemorations on 5 and 6 June and Trooping the Colour on 15 June are expected to go ahead as planned, there is no confirmation as to whether the upcoming Japanese state visit, which was previously postponed due to the pandemic, will still happen in late June.

        "description": "An inside source has claimed Kate is focusing on her mental health.",
        "content": "A royal source has claimed Princess Kate may not be returning to work for the ”rest of the year” as she continues her cancer battle. Speaking to the Daily Beast last week, an insider close to the princess, 42 - who heartbreakingly revealed her cancer battle in March - has claimed the mother of three currently has an “empty” diary for the rest of the year, insinuating she may not return to public facing duties until 2025. “Lots of people involved in planning need to know what all the principals are doing a long way in advance,” the source said. “I am told that Kate’s diary for this year is empty. There is nothing planned. She may not appear in public for the rest of the year.” The insider continued to allege that the princess is largely focused on her mental health and is doing everything she can to avoid any compromising situations, “The key thing for her now is avoiding any kind of stress or anxiety and just getting on with the business of getting better,” they said. Referencing Prince William and the couple’s three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9 and Prince Louis, 6, the source added, “They will bail out and be off to Sandringham the moment school breaks up.” Elsewhere, Page Six has reported that parents whose children attend the same school as William and Kate’s have not seen the future Queen for months. “There have been rumours she has done drop-off, but I haven’t seen her since the video,” one parent told the outlet. “We all feel very protective of her. Ask anyone at the school — they are amazing parents.” It comes after a source shut down claims that Prince Harry sought to mend his estranged relationship with Kate and William after her cancer diagnosis, insisting any chance of a reunion is “a fantasy”. “Meeting with Harry is the last thing that William or Catherine want or need right now,” the source said. “It’s a fantasy. It’s not about apologies or who said what, it is about protecting his family. Kate is recovering from cancer, and they are avoiding stressful situations.” They continued to claim if the Sussexes believe they will “descend on Balmoral this summer” it would be “wishful thinking”. “It’s all just very sad,” the source said. Rumours first began swirling about the alleged phone call when royal expert, Tom Quinn claimed, “Since leaving the UK, Harry has actually contacted at least one royal: Kate.” He added, “She is sympathetic, but fully supports her husband and, struggling with her own health problems, has no intention of playing peacemaker.” Kate announced in March she was undergoing treatment after doctors detected cancer in her body following her major abdominal surgery in January in The London Clinic. She said in the short video: “In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful, however, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. “My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventive chemotherapy and I’m now in the early stages of that treatment.” The princess solemnly confessed the news had come as a “huge shock” and continued to praise her husband for his support during “an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family”.

        "content": "A bakery that was hit with nearly 20 infractions earlier this year has been shut down by Toronto health inspectors. New King of Kings Bakery, which received 18 infractions in March but remained open after receiving a conditional pass, is closed until further notice. The bakery, which offers fresh baked goods and boasts a hot table with everything from turkey to fried fish, had previously passed with no or minor infractions prior to March’s inspection. However, New King of Kings, located at 248 Eddystone Ave. in North York, was forced to shut down after health inspectors issued it a summons and health hazard order on Friday, according to Toronto Public Health . The first of two new crucial violations pertained to the food premises being maintained in a manner permitting a health hazard, specifically insects. The other crucial infraction was that the establishment was “maintained in a manner permitting adverse effect on food,” but the bakery received a “notice to comply” action for the issue. The bakery received five additional infractions — four significant and one minor. The four significant violations were that it failed to protect against the breeding of pests, used food equipment not of readily cleanable form, did not maintain hand-washing stations with soap and paper towels and did not provide an adequate number of hand-washing stations. The one minor infraction was that its equipment surfaces were not sanitized as necessary. A detailed list of infractions at Toronto restaurants can be found on DineSafe .",

They started moving in different directions in their careers and their priorities started to change.' 'Eamonn was desperate to return to Belfast, which he thinks of as home, but Ruth would never move. It became a bone of contention. 'As her ITV career continued, Eamonn went down another path and they became ships in the night. For the past two years they had led separate lives, professionally and personally.' Eamonn spoke about his desire to return to Belfast last year, revealing how his wife was always 'very irritated' when he called it home. He said last year, when asked where he thinks of as home: 'Well, it's not Surrey. When people ask me what I'm doing at the weekend, I tell them I'm going home.

        "content": "Questioning the Centre’s position on China, Congress candidate Shashi Tharoor on Monday said the Bharatiya Janata Party’s position on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) is only an “election tactics” adding that it must also focus on what is happening on the Chinese borders. Union Home Minister Amit Shah recently made a statement that PoK is a part of India and it will be taken back once BJP retains power. Reacting to this, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, “These are all election tactics. Those who talk about PoK, don’t think about what impact it will have internationally. What they have done about China? On 65 patrolling points, the agreement was going well in the last 45 years. But, now at 26 points, the Chinese military is there and our Jawans can’t go, when they tried, 20 of our Jawans were killed. The government is in no position to talk about this and they are talking about the PoK. It’s nonsensical to talk such things.” On Amit Shah claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has crossed 310 marks in the five phases of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, Tharoor said, “Whatever Amit Shah says about the number of seats, we should discount it by 30-40 per cent, then we will see the reality. I think it’s (NDA to cross 400) not going to happen, BJP is in a bad state and the time has come for a change in the government”. Regarding the potential Prime Ministerial candidate for the INDIA alliance, if it comes to power, Tharoor remarked that the decision would involve consultation among the 26 parties. “Twenty-six parties collectively ponder over this matter. With so many leaders among them, there shouldn’t be much concern. After all, it’s not a Presidential system. Prime Minister Modi seems to be operating the parliamentary system as if it were a Presidential one. In a Presidential system, everyone casts their vote for a single individual.In a parliamentary system, we consider the party, various candidates, and then select a leader. In the 2004 elections, who could have predicted that Manmohan Singh would emerge as the leader?” Tharoor said. (ANI)",

        "content": "Yomi Faparusi, a Nigerian-American based in Tennessee, in the United States, is vying as an independent candidate to represent Tennessee District 5 in the US Congress. The election is slated for November 5, 2024. Faparusi, who made this known while speaking during a virtual meeting with reporters at the weekend, said his victory in November 5, 2024 election would inspire the next generation. He said there is hyper-inflation in the country, making it hard for the generality of the people to survive. He added that the middle class is disappearing, and that the American dream was threatened. Faparusi, who is a researcher, said he is contesting because America is divided and weakened, and that he was running to unite Americans across various divides. “America is so divided and weakened because politicians now run on divisive and wedge issues. Hence, I decided to run as a unifier, so that things can get done. I also hope my victory in November would inspire the next generation. “There is inflation making it hard to make ends meet; the middle class is disappearing, and the American dream is threatened. I want to tackle inflation. I want to create an environment that is conducive to small businesses, the most important units of job creation. “Congress is in stalemate, and nothing is getting done. I will work across the aisle for the common good. Americans are tired of cyclical threats of government shutdowns. “Immigration is in total disarray. Open borders are not a policy; it only makes it hard to have a comprehensive plan. Immigration is not only a social issue; it is a financial/economic issue: you don’t have papers; you can’t get a job. “The reality is that most legislators would not entertain any immigration relief package unless the border is secure. Hence, we need to secure the border and get back with a bipartisan comprehensive immigration plan. “I am running as an Independent because I do not want to be beholden to any party. I still have a political ideology. There is something called an advantage of incumbency, but incumbents lose, as I hope in November. The TN 5th district is ideologically diverse, and it needs to be represented by someone who understands and appreciates this diversity. I will represent all the people and not just a partisan segment. “I am a business owner and I know about job creation. Also, I have had to work with diverse stakeholders hence I learnt how to listen and be humble. These have allowed me to be a good negotiator in any forum. “As an immigrant and now an immigration attorney, I know the practicalities of immigration. “As simplistic as it seems, the theme of my agenda is ‘I care’. I care about your concerns, and I want to go to Washington to serve you. I hope that you will give me a chance to represent you and I will always be answerable to you, my constituents. I will advocate for your concerns and needs without fear of retribution because I have placed the people above party. At the end, everything will be okay.” Faparusi was born at the University of Ibadan, Oyo State, while his ancestral hometown is Ode-Ekiti, Gbonyin LGA of Ekiti State. He graduated as a medical doctor from the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan. He was into students’ union politics, where he served as the Hall Chairman of Alexander Brown Hall, while he was in school. He is a licensed physician (medical doctor) and a licensed attorney (Lawyer) based in Tennessee. He has a law practice where he focuses mostly on immigration law. Faparusi, who was involved in the agitation against military rule during the Abacha regime in Nigeria, fled Nigeria to escape being persecuted by the tyrannical military regime.",

Now Julia Bednarek will be amongst a host of other Premier League WAGs. Snapchat is an app largely used by a younger audience and is popular for its feature of only being able to view messages once, but it was Southampton defender Jan that originally messaged Julia on the app to kickstart their romance. Julia originally hails from Poland and first met her husband and his parents in a daunting first date experience when Poland played Kazakhstan in a previous international match between the pair. Julia Bednarek will be a Premier League WAG next season after Southampton sealed promotion Julian and Saints defender Jan wed in 2022 after originally meeting on social media The glamorous mother-of-one is now based in Winchester according to her Instagram and regularly takes her daughter to various events while Jan is busy competing with Southampton.

'We started texting each other every day, then we talked on FaceTime, because Janek was in England and I was in Poland. It was hard to meet. 'And the first time I saw him live was at the Poland-Kazakhstan match, where I first met his managers, then Janek's parents and then him!'. Sofia Lepore - Will Smallbone's girlfriend (Southampton) The girlfriend of Saints midfielder Will Smallbone is different to a host of Premier League WAGs due to the Italian possessing a university degree after graduating two-years ago.

Rebekah Vardy - Jamie Vardy's wife (Leicester) Read More Rebekah Vardy says she no longer cares about Wagatha Christie trial and insists she 'knows the truth' after losing high court battle with Coleen Rooney Perhaps one of the most famous partners of a player in English football, in large part due to her involvement in the Wagatha Christie scandal back in 2022. Coleen Rooney's accusations that the wife of Leicester City star Jamie, was leaking posts from her private Instagram account to The Sun and the line 'It's Rebekah Vardy's account - sparked a media storm between the pair. Vardy sued Rooney for libel and the case came to a halt in May 2022 when the court dismissed her claim insisting that the statements by the wife of Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney were substantially true. She was left with a £3m court fee, but back in December she said she no longer cares about the trial and 'knows the truth'. Vardy is perhaps best famed for the Wagatha Christie saga which Coleen Rooney accused her of leaking messages to the Sun Despite losing her court case, Vardy said she no longer cares about the Wagatha Christie saga Vardy wrote: 'I certainly didn't expect what became known as the 'Wagatha Christie' trial. If you care, you'll know the details. If you don't, I'll spare you: thinking about it is a total waste of time and energy. All I'll say is that I know the truth, as do many others.' Rebekah has five children, three of which are fathered by Jamie, who also another child from a prior relationship. Former Premier League title winner, Jamie, is now 37, and approaching the end of his football career. However, he is still ruthless in front of goal and scored 20 goals in all competitions -- including 18 in the Championship - as he prepares to take to the top flight one more time. Before Leicester's relegation last season, he had scored 136 goals in 307 games - putting him 15th on the list of all-time top scorers since the Premier League's inception. Rebekah and Jamie have three children together, as well as both having children from prior relationships Suwilanji Mpondela - Patson Daka's wife (Leicester) Another Foxes striker returning to the Premier League is Patson Daka, who is married to Zambian sprinter Suwilanji Mpondela.

She computed at the U20 World Championships back in 2018, and in 2021 she along with her 4x100m relay team-mates set a new national record with a time of 43.85 seconds. In 2019, she was voted in as the inaugural chairperson for the National Olympic Committee of Zambia - making her Africa's youngest elected Athletes Commission Chair at the age of 19.

        "content": "Despite an alert issued from the administration and India Meteorological Department (IMD), fishermen were seen fishing in the Mohana near Digha area in West Bengal’s East Medinipur district on Monday in the wake of the landfall of Cyclone ‘Remal’. The IMD has issued an alert message and warned the fishermen not to venture into North Bay of Bengal along and off West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts on May 27. On the other hand, a large number of tourists visited Digha beach on Monday. The Cyclonic Storm “Remal” (pronounced as “Re-Mal”) over Coastal Bangladesh and adjoining Coastal West Bengal moved nearly northwards, with a speed of 15 kmph during past 06 hours and lay centered at 0830 hrs IST of today, the 27th May, 2024 over the same region, near latitude 22.8°N and longitude 89.3°E about 40 km northwest of Mongla (Bangladesh), 90 km east of Kolkata (West Bengal), 90 km northeast of Canning (West Bengal), 130 km northwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh) and 140 km southwest of Dhaka (Bangladesh). West Bengal Power Secretary Santanu Basu said, “South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hoogly, parts of Medinipur, Murshidabad, and Nadia districts have been affected by cyclone Remal the most. We started our restoration work early in the morning today...” “We have been able to restore 45 out of the 50 substations that were affected and 80% of the restoration work, be it in the substation level or in the downstream infrastructure with respect to the 33kV feeders or the 11 kV feeders has been restored. In certain areas in the North 24 Parganas, we have been unable to restore 6-7 substations because of the wind and rain... In South 24 Parganas we have been able to restore almost all the substations... We have engagements of additional gangs from the nearby districts which have moved to North and South 24 Parganas to help in fastening up the restoration,” he said. The Cyclone is likely to move north-northeastwards, and gradually weaken further into a Deep Depression by night of Monday. “The severe cyclonic storm ‘Remal’ has weakened since making landfall last night and is expected to downgrade into a deep depression by this evening,” the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) announced on Monday. The NDRF made the announcement based on the latest update from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). “The current information that we have from the IMD is that the severe cyclonic storm has now transformed into a cyclonic storm. The wind speed, which was earlier about 110 to 120 km/hr during landfall, now has come down to 60 to 70 km/hr,” NDRF Deputy Inspector General Mohsen Shahedi told ANI when asked about the status of ‘Remal’ after its landfall. Pointing out the downfall in the intensity of the cyclone, Shahedi said “This is a big relief and it is expected that by evening today, this will further change into a deep depression.” (ANI)",

        "content": "The Alaska House of Representatives chamber, photographed on Monday, Jan. 16, 2023 at the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau. (Loren Holmes / ADN) With days remaining before the filing deadline for Alaska’s legislative candidates, more than a third of the state’s 40 House members are poised to run for reelection unopposed. Candidates have until June 1 to formally declare their intent to run with the Alaska Division of Elections. Some candidates wait until the last minute to file their paperwork. But in large swaths of the state, lawmakers could keep their seats with little or no competition. The 2022 election led to the largest freshman class of lawmakers in two decades, with 20 out of 60 lawmakers new to the Alaska Legislature. The change was brought about in part by a one-a-decade redistricting process that put multiple incumbents in the same districts, and allowed newcomers to run outside the shadow of longtime politicians. But 2024 is set to bring far less turnover. In the Senate, every incumbent up for reelection has indicated an intention to run again. In the House, only three lawmakers have indicated they don’t plan to attempt to keep their seats — creating limiting possibilities for open races. Rep. Jennie Armstrong, D-Anchorage, whose Alaska residency was challenged during the 2022 election cycle, is not running again. Democrat Carolyn Hall is currently the only candidate registered to run for the seat. Rep. Laddie Shaw, R-Anchorage, is retiring this year at the age of 75. Multiple candidates have indicated they could run for the seat, including Girdwood Republican Lee Ellis, a craft brewery president, and Ky Holland, a nonpartisan candidate and entrepreneur. Rep. Ben Carpenter, R-Nikiski, is not seeking reelection to his House seat, instead running for a Senate seat against incumbent Sen. Jesse Bjorkman. The two Republicans differ on key issues, including education funding. Bjorkman voted to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill that would have permanently increased education spending, while Carpenter voted to sustain Dunleavy’s veto. Two Republicans have registered to run for Carpenter’s seat — Ben Elam and John Hillyer, both of Soldotna. Elam is a member of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly. Hillyer is a retired Air Force general and pilot. Rep. Jesse Sumner, R-Wasilla, said Thursday that he was still undecided on whether he would run again, after winning the open seat in 2022 a four-way Republican race. He said he was weighing several factors, including his family and his business, and would likely decide whether to run close to the June 1 deadline. Where incumbents do face challengers, several races promise repeats of 2022 match-ups. Rep. Tom McKay, R-Anchorage, will again face Democrat Denny Wells. In 2022, McKay beat Wells in a ranked choice tabulation by seven votes, and the race is again expected to be very tight this year. Rep. Stanley Wright, R-Anchorage, has indicated he plans to run again. So has Democrat Ted Eischeid, who in 2022 lost to Wright by 72 votes. Rep. Dan Ortiz, I-Ketchikan, is again facing Republican challenger Jeremy Bynum. In 2022, Ortiz beat Bynum by 343 votes. Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage, will again face nonpartisan candidate Walter Featherly. In 2022, Featherly received over 45% of the vote but was bested by Coulombe in a ranked choice tabulation , after third-place Republican finisher Ross Bieling was eliminated. Rep. Cliff Groh, D-Anchorage, will face Republican David Nelson. Groh bested Nelson in 2022, when Nelson garnered 44% of votes in the district. Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome, will face Tyler Ivanoff, a member of the Alaska Independence Party from Shishmaref. In 2022, Foster beat Ivanoff by 92 votes. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, will face Democrat Janice Park, who lost to Kaufman by more than 1,300 votes in 2022. Sen. Kelly Merrick, R-Eagle River, is set to again face Republican Ken McCarty, along with two other Republican challengers. McCarty, a former House member, ran to the right of Merrick in 2022, and lost to her by more than 2,400 votes. At stake for challengers hoping to unseat incumbents is control of the Alaska House and Senate. The Senate is governed by a 17-member bipartisan coalition that is likely — though not guaranteed — to survive the coming election. But in the House, Republicans narrowly gained control of the chamber in 2023 thanks to support from four non-Republican members of the Bush Caucus, which represents rural districts. Control of the chamber could easily flip, many say, if one or more seats currently held by Republicans are won by Democrats or nonpartisan candidates. A single seat can make a difference in control of the Legislature and in the outcome of key legislation, as lawmakers learned earlier this year, when they failed by a single vote to override Dunleavy’s veto of the education bill. In District 6, incumbent Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, faces multiple challengers — including nonpartisan candidate Brent Johnson, who is currently the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly president. Announcing his legislative bid earlier this month, Johnson cited Vance’s decision not to override the governor’s veto of the education bill, which was broadly supported by public school educators across the state. The announcement foreshadows what lawmakers have discussed behind closed doors ever since Dunleavy vetoed Senate Bill 140 earlier this year: that opposition to veto override vote would come back to haunt some Republican incumbents in their reelection bids. Johnson said in an interview last week that he had first considered running for the Legislature more than a decade ago. But he enjoyed working on his local borough assembly and living in his Clam Gulch home. “I didn’t want to change any of that. And I held that position consistent, even though people asked me to run several times, until the failure to override the governor’s veto of education funding,” Johnson said. Vance is a conservative member of the current Republican-dominated majority, and a key backer of Dunleavy’s policies. Johnson said that if elected, he would look to join a bipartisan caucus, and to rebuke some of Dunleavy’s policies, including in the areas of education and fishery management. The Kenai Peninsula is not the only place where the veto override vote has motivated some challengers to enter a race. In District 40, which includes the North Slope and Northwest Alaska, Robyn Burke, an Utqiagvik Democrat, said she decided to run for the state House after Rep. Thomas Baker, R-Kotzebue, became one of several Republicans who initially voted in favor of the education legislation but later voted to sustain Dunleavy’s veto. “Baker’s vote virtually assured deep education cuts that make it improbable to adequately staff our schools or provide basic materials,” Burke, the North Slope Borough School District board president, wrote in an op-ed that appeared in the Daily News. Burke is one of two challengers who have so far indicated they plan to run against Baker, along with Kotzebue city mayor Saima Chase. Baker was appointed to the seat by Dunleavy after former Rep. Josiah Patkotak was elected North Slope Borough Mayor last year. Baker had not yet filed to run for the seat as of Thursday and did not respond to a message asking if he intended to. Earlier this month, Baker announced on social media that he would change his party affiliation from Republican to undeclared “to more effectively address the specific needs” of his constituents. The primary election is set to take place on Aug. 20. Under Alaska’s election system, the top-four vote getters in every legislative race, regardless of political party, advance to the general election.",

Higgs used his time with the mic as an opportunity to , who lost his life after on Friday. His on Sunday morning, letting everyone know that their son tragically took his life. He used his platform to remind people how precious life is and to . “I would challenge everybody here, and I’m going to do this myself as well each day, say something nice to someone you love and also make a point to say something nice to someone you do not even know,” Higgs said. \"Everyone here could be a difference. The difference.\" honored Grayson Murray in his speech after winning . That challenge was just a piece of the statement Higgs sent. It was a moment in time that made someone stand still and listen. He did not have to go that route but chose to. “We lost, yesterday morning, one of our own,” Higgs said. “I don’t know if you guys heard the news, but somebody who went through a lot of difficult things, somebody that was open and honest about it... I thought about this moment and how to maybe remember Grayson. This golf stuff and the result, it’s lovely, sure, but it’s not that meaningful.” Higgs acknowledges that while he does not suffer from mental battles, he recognizes those that do. The 32-year-old has not played his best in recent years. He had to go back and play Q-school last year. The former SMU golfer knows how challenging this sport is and how hard this world makes things for people. “Lord knows how many people do, and it’s only ever increasing, so if we can — Everybody here could make a difference. The difference,” Higgs said. “Brighten up somebody’s day — it could mean the world.” After the trophy ceremony, Higgs continued to explain why he made the tribute to Murray. As a professional golfer, he knows all too well how terrible people can be on and off the internet. Higgs is one of the most humble individuals. He usually keeps things light and fun. The Dallas resident claims he is not the influential type, but his words suggest otherwise. “It’s OK to not be OK — to reach out,” he said. “The world’s tough, man. Social media is awesome but also a pain in the you-know-what. People can be mean. I’m mean sometimes, too. I’m certainly not perfect, but I’m going to certainly try to live what I said.” “That will be part of my routine, part of the things that I can control outside the golf course and hopefully bring light to somebody that may be having a hard time. Hopefully, make a difference in a few people’s lives over the course of however many years I have left on this crazy planet.”",

        "content": "An Antiques Roadshow guest shared a chilling tale about her family's \"haunted\" painting. Expert Ken Farmer was presented with a grand portrait of Aaron Delano, the fifth great-grand uncle of the elderly guest. The woman explained that the painting had been passed down through generations, from her grandmother to her parents and then to her. She said: \"We believe that he is, through both research and word of mouth, that he was the youngest sea captain in the New England area. He was born in 1767 and unfortunately, he passed away, lost at sea in 1794.\" She further detailed that during his lifetime, it was believed Delano was trading along the New England coast, journeying from Plymouth and Nantucket to somewhere in Nova Scotia. Then, the guest revealed the eerie side of the painting. \"Over the years, we have decided as a family that he's probably haunted\", she confessed. \"When I was a teenager in my home, when my parents got him, they'd hang him in the front stairway and I would swear that I could hear him open and close the front door, walk up the stairs and walk down the hall. 13 Best wedding guest dresses for summer 2024 under £100 from River Island, Mango, M&S and more Antiques Roadshow guest's tragic story of ‘haunted’ portrait worth a fortune ( Image: PBR) \"And I would think that it was my father or my mother coming home and I'd go out and there was no one there. My older sister also experienced the walking sound in the hallway. When I was taking the picture down to bring it here, my husband was helping me.\" He was on the ladder and all of a sudden, the ladder slipped and went: 'Oh! First thing he said was: 'Oh Aaron'\". Antiques Roadshow expert Ken Farmer had some interesting observations: \"It's as much an illustration of his occupation as anything else. But he's very handsome, he's young. I love his face and the way that's painted and I love the patterned cloth on his vest. There, he's using the tools of his trade. That looks like a map and that instrument is an octant which means that it would do an eighth of a circle.\" He noted that it was a bit unique for an oil painting to be behind glass but was certain that she had \"something that's very extraordinary in terms of what appeals to people who collect Americana and folk art\". Farmer went on: \"We don't know who the artist is, because lots of times, these artists were itinerant, and we don't know who a lot of them were. Just in the condition that it's in right now, it's got paint loss, if you look right here, I think there's actually some film on the glass. But most importantly, there's no loss in his face or in the instruments, and the detail of the painting that I think really makes it valuable. And so after much conversation at the folk art table, we feel like at an auction, in as-is condition, its value would be £7,000 to £8,000.\" Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

        "content": "Aligning with the position of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a coalition of civil society groups, the Conference of Civil Societies (CCS), has warned that the proposed amendments to the extant Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Act will weaken the Bank and its autonomy. The group therefore urged the National Assembly to resist the attempt to deliberately weaken the CBN, adding that attempting to take away the bank’s autonomy under any guise would be tantamount to throwing spanners into the effective management of the economy. Addressing newsmen on Monday in Abuja on the economy and monetary policy, the Chairperson, Conference of Civil Societies, Adams Otakwu, expressed concern about the Nigerian economy, monetary policy, and its impact on ordinary Nigerians ahead of the forthcoming anniversary of the current administration. He noted that Nigerians are desirous of having in place a vibrant economy supported by an independent central bank. He urged the government to focus on fixing the economy and not create confusion by amending sections of the CBN Act that might weaken the institution. He said, “Nigerians in the past year have had great expectations concerning a major turn-around in the economy. Particularly of interest is the rate of inflation, which has continued to rise. Only last week, the Central Bank of Nigeria increased its monetary policy rate to 26.25% to check inflation, which now stands at 33.69%. “While we, as civil society groups, continue to engage the CBN and the fiscal authorities to improve the fortunes of the economy, we are of the view that having an independent central bank in place will help to put inflation under check. “This is why we would like to sound a note of caution ahead of the proposed amendment to the CBN Act by the National Assembly, which we consider ill-timed. “Without prejudice to the proceedings of the public hearing at the National Assembly, which we shall be part of on Thursday, May 30, 2024, we, in a rare move, align with the position of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that many of the proposed amendments to the extant CBN Act will weaken the Bank as its autonomy will be severely threatened. “Studies worldwide show a direct correlation between independent central banks and adequate checks on inflation. We, therefore, urge the NASS to resist the attempt to deliberately weaken the CBN. Attempting to take away the bank’s autonomy under any guise would be tantamount to throwing spanners into the effective management of the economy. “In a few days, the current administration will be a year in office. We should focus on fixing the economy, not creating confusion by amending sections of the CBN Act that might weaken the institution. Now is not the time to push for an amendment to the CBN Act. “Our advice is that an amendment to the CBN Act, if any, should wait and be well thought out. The present Act contains enough checks that the National Assembly can trigger if it so wishes.” Otakwu appealed to the media “to continue to flag issues around exchange rate pressures, rising input prices, and security that still challenge the economy in your reports, thereby putting pressure on the fiscal and monetary authorities to play their constitutional roles in managing the economy.” ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "description": "An international meta study reveals that there may be less of certain mold toxins in organically grown grain, compared to grain grown in the conventional manner. This, and other findings from research into agricultural products, can have major consequences.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Anne Wennberg, University of Oslo An international meta study reveals that there may be less of certain mold toxins in organically grown grain, compared to grain grown in the conventional manner. This, and other findings from research into agricultural products, can have major consequences. \"Up until now, the general assumption has been that grain grown using organic methods is more contaminated with mold toxins than grain grown in the conventional way and contaminated grain can pose a health risk to humans. \"An extensive meta analysis published in Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety , demonstrates the opposite,\" says professor Per Ole Iversen. He is one of two scientists from the Department of Nutrition at UiO who participated in the study. Carlo Leifert, professor of organic agriculture and currently a guest professor at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, also both initiated and participated in the study. Iversen is the representative of human medicine in the research group and believes that the study is greatly strengthened by being interdisciplinary. \"The meta study we have just published makes it clear that organic methods of cultivation do not lead to a higher incidence of mold in crops than conventionally grown grain, and to some extent, the opposite is the case: for two types of mold, there was no difference.\" In addition, the study has also revealed a number of advantages linked to organic cultivation. \"Research into organically grown foods has been carried out for many years and many people believe that this type of cultivation is good for both livestock and farmers—and for human health—but we were not quite sure about the latter. \"Now it looks as if organically grown fruit and vegetables have a more favorable content of antioxidants and micronutrients than agricultural products produced in the conventional way, and this can be good for both you and me,\" says Iversen. Iversen believes that the study will have major consequences. \"The myth that organic cultivation has a higher risk of being affected by mold has now been largely refuted. In any case, it should not weaken the message that organic food production is to be recommended,\" says Iversen, adding that these findings are very surprising and have weight, since they are based on a large number of well documented findings from different parts of the world. Iversen and his colleagues have previously conducted a randomized, clinical study among university students , where they also found that organically grown food is advantageous compared to agricultural products cultivated in the normal way. \"We are currently carrying out a new randomized study, which examines two groups of pregnant women : one group is eating organic food while the other is eating ordinary food during pregnancy. We will then carry out a thorough study of the effect of the organic food intake on both mothers and babies for two years following each baby's birth,\" he explains. Per Ole Iversen played two roles in the extensive meta study. \"I participated in the selection of the studies to be included. In addition, I contributed with reflections from a doctor's point of view on what kind of consequences the study could have for the health of ordinary people.\" More information: Juan Wang et al, Mycotoxin contamination in organic and conventional cereal grain and products: A systematic literature review and meta‐analysis, Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety (2024).

Georgie Campbell died after falling from her horse during a competition at the Bicton International Horse Trials in southwest England on May 26. She was 37. \"Medical professionals attended immediately following her fall at fence 5b however, unfortunately, she could not be saved,\" British Eventing, the sport's national governing body in the UK, said in a statement the same day. \"The horse, Global Quest, was assessed by the on-site vets and walked back to the stable and is uninjured. The organization concluded the announcement, \"To respect the family's privacy at this extremely difficult and sad time, no further details will be shared.\" Georgie was a decorated rider and competed in more than 200 events, the BBC reported. Her husband Jessie Campbell is also a fellow event rider, who competed for New Zealand at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The couple came together to form Team Campbell Eventing . They highlighted their riding career on the joint Instagram with videos, photos and updates from competitions. Less than three weeks before the incident, they posted a video of her practicing with Global Quest. The May 5 caption said with a starstruck emoji, \"Global Quest at his Best.\" Georgie has also praised the horse for other rides. In October, she shared several pictures of the 11-year-old animal, writing, \"Brilliant week with Global Quest doing what he does best—flying round the XC giving me a class ride.\" \"After picking up an injury at the start of the year and needing some quiet time we lacked a bit of match practice which showed in the dressage and [showjumping],\" she explained, \"but it was so great having him back feeling so fit and well.\"",

According to the statement, Abiodun urged other participating States to emulate Edo state Governor in this regard. Omoruyi also said that the payment of N147 million counterpart funds to LIFE-ND would enable the state access funds for the ongoing transformation of rural economy via agribusiness. “Gov. Obaseki has done well to restate his commitment to sustainable development of the agricultural sector by promoting modern farming techniques, supporting smallholders farmers, encouraging value addition and fostering agribusiness innovations. “Furthermore, this feat by the Obaseki administration will not only contribute to economic growth but also enhace food security, reduce poverty and empower rural communities in Edo State. “This is in addition to boosting agricultural productivity and value addition across four commodities’ rice, cassava, poultry and Fishery value chains,” he said. According to Omoruyi, LIFE-ND as of today in Edo State, has created jobs for 2,348 women and youth enterprises out of the targeted 4,250 across the participating ten local government areas and 100 communities across the State. He said the release of this counterpart fund by the Governor, will further create employment for over 2,500 women and youths targeted for year 2024.",

Two-time NBA champion and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton died [...]The post Just In: NBA Legend Bill Walton Dies at 71 After Long Health Battle appeared first on The Western Journal.",
        "content": "One of the most gregarious and beloved players in NBA history has died at the age of 71. Two-time NBA champion and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton died on Monday, the NBA announced in a news release. The following has been released by the NBA. — NBA Communications (@NBAPR) According to the release, Walton was surrounded by his family. The former UCLA star died after a “prolonged battle with cancer,” it said. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position.” Indeed, while modern players such as the Denver Nuggets’ may have normalized the idea of centers who have the passing ability of a point guard, Walton was an absolute anomaly for his day. His passing was the crux of his very unique skill set. Silver continued, “His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.” Walton won two NCAA championships as a member of John Wooden’s Bruins. UCLA mourns the passing of two-time NCAA champion Bill Walton, a Naismith Hall of Fame inductee (1993) and charter member of the Hall of Fame (1984). IN MEMORIAM: — UCLA Men’s Basketball (@UCLAMBB) His two NBA championships came in vastly different roles. The 1977 Portland Trailblazers won a championship with Walton as the focal point and star of the team. The 1986 Boston Celtics — considered by some to be the greatest professional basketball team of all time — brought an older and injury-riddled Walton off the bench for effective backup minutes. Injuries plagued Walton’s career until the bitter end, but the 6-foot-11 center soon found another venture in which he would fall in love: broadcasting. Silver said he “translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball.” “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” the commissioner said. “He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” In a testament to how generally beloved Bill Walton is and was, the generally toxic landscape of NBA chatter on X was all unified in mourning over the loss. Massive loss. All time great that appreciated every era of basketball and didnt tear Any player down. Very smart basketball mind. He will be missed — Richard 🐐 (@pbp_Rich) RIP to the greatest Blazer of all time — President Curry. (@Curry4daW) Rest on Legend 🕊️❤️ — DC🥤 (@DCWale_CFC) Walton is survived by his wife, Lori, and his four sons, Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke. We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

About 20 of its customers comprising of importers and exporters, were present on the trip which began from Ebute Metta rail station, Lagos, ending at the Moniya Freight Yard, Ibadan. Last year, the terminal began the evacuation of cargo via the standard gauge rail line from the Lagos Port Complex Apapa to Moniya Freight Yard in Ibadan, Oyo State, to boost the handling of exports and imports. Speaking on the trip, undertaken to create awareness on the opportunities the standard rail gauge offers for the economy and ease for the customers, the APM Terminals Nigeria Inland Sales Manager, David Abbey underscored the critical role of rail in facilitating trade. He said APM Terminals’s vision of “improving life for all by integrating the world’” is one of the many reasons this product was created which gives the customers the option of rail, road and barging of containers out of APM Terminals Apapa. “The rail runs from APM Terminals Apapa to Moniya in Ibadan which connects nicely to the North. “The standard gauge rail line will guarantee safety, faster turnaround time for cargo exchange, create reliability, predictability and ease of doing business for our valued customers, in addition to creating a one-stop shop for import, storage and export consolidation through container freight station (CFS) operations at the rail terminal in Moniya Ibadan,” David said. On his part, Market and Commercial Intelligence Manager for APM Terminals Nigeria, Adetunji Igbaugba, encouraged importers and exporters to use the standard gauge rail line for fast delivery of their containers to and from Ibadan. He said the Moniya Freight Yard has 8,000 square metres of land and a warehouse measuring about 4,000 square metres which can be used for stuffing and unstuffing of boxes. “We do a lot of exports in Moniya. However, we need to continue to improve on the processes to ensure that we surpass our customers’ expectation like scheduling and reliability. We will continue to partner with the Nigerian Railway Corporation and other stakeholders to bring the needed efficiency for the customers to have a better trust in the product and service,” he said. The Executive Director, Bueno Logistics Limited, Jedson Nwankwo said the Moniya Freight Yard, consisting of two terminals (A and B), is well positioned to handle many containers. He said Terminal A is operated by Diamond Star and Terminal B operated by Bueno Logistics. Also speaking, Director of Primlaks Nigeria Ltd – Logistics Division, Bhagu Vasnani expressed appreciation to APM Terminals for the rail trip and assured of cooperation to optimize the use of the standard gauge rail line and the Moniya Freight Yard. Other exporters who were part of the trip also commended APM Terminals for the initiative.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

North's acting debut came after she announced her first album Elementary School Dropout in March, a nod to her dad's 2004 debut The College Dropout. The preteen was also featured on 'Talking / Once Again', from Vultures 1, Ye's collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign.

        "content": "A joint delegation from the Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) visited Gombe State on Monday for an investment promotion drive. Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, led members of the State Executive Council to receive the delegation at the Government House in Gombe. The delegation visited to seek collaboration with the Gombe State Government on the implementation of the UNDP-funded Nigerian Investment Certification Programme for States (NICPS), for which Gombe has been selected, along with Ekiti and Anambra states, for the pilot phase. While receiving the joint delegation, Inuwa Yahaya informed the guests of his administration’s sustained efforts in investment promotion since his assumption of office, citing the establishment of the sprawling 1,000-hectare Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park and other reforms and initiatives as factors that continue to position Gombe as the best destination of choice for investors. He added that by creating an enabling business environment for all forms of investment in Gombe, the state earned the No. 1 ranking in Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria for two consecutive years by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC). According to him, “We are delighted to receive this delegation from the NIPC, UNDP, and the presidency. This visit is timely, considering that it comes at a time when Gombe is actively seeking investors for the state. It is coming just a few months before the second edition of the Gombe State Investment Summit.” “I am proud to say that Gombe is always open to any partnership that could advance our investment drive. Since 2019, we have been making efforts to make Gombe the destination of choice for investors,” the governor said. The Governor added that “our desire to advance investment in the state led to the establishment of the 1,000-hectare Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park, which has all the necessary infrastructure, including adequate energy for companies at the park. We have also introduced reforms and initiatives that helped us earn the PEBEC ranking as No. 1 in Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria for two consecutive years.” “We understand that investment will not come without creating a favourable climate, and this is what we have been doing and will continue to do, even if it means fostering more partnerships with entities that support us in this endeavour,” Inuwa Yahaya added. The Governor further assured the delegation of his full support for the implementation of the new initiative aimed at helping beneficiary states promote their investment potential to global investors. He stated that his administration will maintain a strong partnership with the NIPC, UNDP, and SDGs to boost Gombe’s investment drive while pledging to rally his colleagues at the Northern States Governors’ Forum, where he serves as Chairman, to join the initiative in order to collectively propel the economic prosperity of Northern Nigeria and the country at large. Addressing the State EXCO, the Executive Secretary/CEO of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Ms Aisha Rimi, who led the delegation, informed Governor Inuwa Yahaya that the Nigerian Investment Certification Programme was introduced in late 2023 to support states in demonstrating their competence in providing information capable of attracting investments. She stated that, “Your Excellency, the partnership we seek with the Gombe State Government aims to strengthen the Gombe State Investment Promotion Agency by providing them the necessary capacity to promote, attract, and manage investments.” “This will ultimately enhance the overall ability to attract new investments and provide aftercare services to existing investors in Gombe State. We are proud to learn that Gombe has been making significant efforts to advance its investment drive, and we assure you of our support in achieving this goal,” she said. She commended Governor Inuwa Yahaya for the visionary idea of establishing the Industrial Park, noting that during their tour of the facility, they observed the necessary infrastructure for companies to operate there, which includes, among others, an administrative building that will house all relevant government agencies as it serves as a one-stop centre for the administrative and regulatory needs of potential investors. In her remarks, the representative of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Mrs Rose Kefas, informed Governor Inuwa Yahaya that Gombe State has been chosen to serve as the SDGs Donation Hub for the Northeast sub-region, attributing the choice to Governor Yahaya’s commitment to mainstreaming SDGs programmes in Gombe State. She added that, in recognition of Governor Inuwa Yahaya’s development efforts, the SDGs will present the Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park at the SDGs Global Investment Forum next year in New York, United States, with the aim of showcasing the park’s capacity to global investors and attracting direct foreign investment into Gombe State. According to her, “Your Excellency, let me express my appreciation for all the support you have given to the SDGs programmes in Gombe State. Your commitment has made Gombe a shining light at the national level. We commend your efforts in advancing Gombe State.” “We are aware of the 10-Year Development Plan you have created, which is in line with our goals at the SDGs. Based on this, I am delighted to inform you that we have decided to present the Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park at the SDGs Global Investment Forum next year in New York, United States. This will showcase its capacity to global investors and attract direct foreign investment to Gombe State,” she said. Also speaking, Fatima Umar, the representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), reiterated the UNDP’s commitment to supporting Gombe State in its investment promotion efforts, emphasising that the UNDP recognises the significant strides Gombe has made in creating a conducive environment for investment and is dedicated to providing ongoing assistance to further enhance these efforts. She further highlighted that the UNDP’s support would include capacity-building initiatives, technical assistance, and facilitating connections with potential local and international investors, all aimed at improving Gombe State’s economic growth and development.

        "content": "Kieran McKenna is set to stay at Ipswich and sign a new long-term contract after attracting interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Brighton. The 38-year-old coach has guided Ipswich to back-to-back EFL promotions and a first Premier League campaign at Portman Road for 22 years, but there were question marks over whether he would remain at the club next season. Sky Sports News revealed McKenna was a candidate for the vacant Brighton job following Roberto De Zerbi's departure, while Man Utd officials met with representatives of the Ipswich boss . McKenna was also linked with replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Chelsea, but was told by phone on Sunday that the club were looking elsewhere. Sky Sports News also learned that Ipswich Town majority shareholder Ed Schwartz flew into the UK from the United States at the end of last week for talks with the club's chief executive officer Mark Ashton and McKenna. It is understood discussions were over a proposed new deal. And now the speculation around the Ipswich boss' future is set to end with McKenna poised to extend his stay at Portman Road in what would be a major boost for the newly-promoted club. Ipswich appointed McKenna in 2021, and in his first full season in charge he led Ipswich to promotion from League One to the Championship.

Softly spoken at first, but methodical, clear and honest in his media engagements, fans soon welcomed the departure from McKenna's more brash and at times, overbearing predecessors.

Freddie Ladapo, Dom Ball and Leif Davis would be the notable summer signings and from the off, it was clear the race to win League One that season would be hotly contested. Plymouth set and maintained the pace throughout while Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley tried to keep up. After slipping down to fourth on February 14 with a goalless draw at Bristol Rovers, thoughts were understandably turning to another season of disappointment with Town eight points adrift of the top two. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player But January's transfer window had already seen four key additions in George Hirst, Harry Clarke, Massimo Luongo and Nathan Broadhead. They would prove to be pivotal as Ipswich went on to win 13 of their 15 remaining league games, including eight in a row, to amass 98 points and automatic promotion back to the Championship after a four-year absence. It felt good to be back in the second tier and as this season began, many supporters were hoping to just win more games than they lost and use it as a chance to continue building on the good work of the previous 18 months. But 46 games later they are heading back to the top flight. A season of free-scoring, free-flowing, full-throttle football has seen both Ipswich's and McKenna's stock soar. Erik ten Hag will be replaced as Manchester United manager only if the club believe there is a better option out there. The final decision on Ten Hag’s future will be made during the season review United are carrying out now. Ten Hag is waiting for the outcome of the review but is convinced he is the best man for the job. He is confident United will perform much better in the league next season if he stays – especially if key players remain fit and the club sign a centre back, midfielder and striker.

        "content": "B.C. Place is going to turn into “Da Club” with U.S. rapper 50 Cent set to perform at a pre-game concert at the B.C. Lions’ home opener. The team announced Monday that 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, will headline the Lions’ third annual concert kickoff on June 15 before its first home game of the season against the Calgary Stampeders. “It’s an honour to give our great fans the opportunity to see a world class performer who resonates across multiple generations of music lovers,” said Lions’ owner Amar Doman in a statement. “Concert Kickoff has become a great tradition in Vancouver and 50 Cent is our best one yet.” The Grammy- and Juno-award winning artist skyrocketed to fame in 2003 with his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ and its massive hit In Da Club. The rapper was a guest performer in Super Bowl LVI halftime show in 2022 in Los Angeles, performing with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar in what was the first Super Bowl halftime show to feature entirely hip-hop music. The artist performed in Vancouver last year at a sold-out show at Rogers Arena as part of his Final Lap tour.

Place at 3 p.m. on June 15 before kickoff at 4 p.m. There will also be a backyard party at 10:30 a.m. with games, food and drinks, including $5 beers, at Terry Fox Plaza. It will be the Lions’ first game at their home arena, but their second game of the season. The team start their first game on the road against the Toronto Argonauts on June 9. Tickets for the concert kickoff start at $25 for adults and $17 for 17 and under. This is the third time the B.C. Lions are kicking off their season with a celebrity performer. Last year, LL Cool J drew large crowds to B.C. Place , while pop group OneRepublic kicked off the pre-game concert series in 2022, drawing more than 34,000 to the game, the largest crowd of the regular season for the CFL. chchan@postmedia.com",

        "description": "Over 130 people died at a single hospital in Sudan's besieged city of El Fasher, inDarfur region, according to Médecins Sans Frontières",
        "content": "Fighting between rival groups in Sudan’s civil war in the battle for control of the city has recently intensified. El Fasher is the last major urban centre in Darfur that remains in the hands of Sudan’s army. The army has been fighting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for more than a year, in a civil war that has killed thousands and forced millions from their homes. The army remains in control of El Fasher. The city has become a refuge for people displaced by fighting in other areas. On 10 May the RSF intensified their assault on the city, in what UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called “an alarming new chapter” in Sudan’s conflict. MSF said one of its hospital was struggling to cope with the increased casualties. South Hospital had treated 979 casualties in just over two weeks, the charity said on Sunday. 134 had died, “a sign of the violent intensity of the fighting”, it added. The medical director of El Fasher’s government-run Saudi hospital told the BBC the situation was “terrible”. “Since the early morning, the RSF began violent artillery shelling of the city, targeting residential areas, markets, and hospitals,” Modther Ibrahim Suliman said. The Saudi and South hospitals are the last functioning in the region. The Saudi Hospital was previously shuttered by the violence but it partially reopened to treat emergency cases. Supplies at the hospital are running low and will last barely a week, the UN said. MSF said it treated more than 900 casualties in the past two weeks. El Fasher residents say that access to food and water has become increasingly difficult. The RSF has been attacking the city from three sides and blocked all supply routes. Despite the hardships, many residents in the city are not leaving their homes because of the fighting, even for emergency medical care. Journalist Mohamed Zakaria said he had no plans to flee. “There is no place to go to... the road is very difficult and dangerous right now”. Earlier this week, a UN expert warned civilians in El Fasher were being targeted because of their ethnicity. Special adviser Alice Wairimu Nderitu added that the Darfur region as a whole was facing a growing risk of genocide as the world’s attention remained focused on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. War erupted in the East African nation on April 15 last year, when the RSF militia and Sudan’s army turned on each other. That followed months of talks over merging their forces and transitioning the mineral-rich country toward democracy. The fighting has killed almost 15,000 people and left half of the population of 50 million in need of food assistance. Some 11 million are displaced internally, and the capital, Khartoum, lies in ruins. The UAE is a key backer of the RSF, supplying it with weapons and funding, according to a report by United Nations investigators seen by Bloomberg in January. The US is engaged in talks with Emirati officials about their role in the war, while the UK has initiated discussions on Sudan at the UN Security Council in New York. Those moves have irked officials from the UAE. Last month, UK Deputy Foreign Secretary Andrew Mitchell told Channel 4 News that his boss, David Cameron, had raised the issue directly with the UAE. “They must not allow arms to get into this conflict — because if they do it will damage them, as well as everyone else. So it’s a message which Britain is putting very forcefully,” Mitchell said. The UAE affirmed its “categorical rejection” of the allegations in a statement on Tuesday, saying the country was engaging with the US and others to work for a settlement. “This dissemination of disinformation and false narratives by a warring side of the conflict after more than a year of this crisis aims to only deflect responsibility and undermine international efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan,” the UAE said. At least 134 people have been killed in the past two weeks as a result of recent escalations in the ongoing conflict between Sudan’s military and paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Doctors without Borders reported Sunday. Doctors without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said, “We have now treated 979 casualties since the fighting began over two weeks ago, and the death toll has reached 134 – a sign of the violent intensity of the fighting.” The loss of life is a result of escalated conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group aided by Arab militias known as Janjaweed. The conflict began in April 2023, when tensions between the two groups boiled over in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. Over a year later, the fighting has anchored itself in el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur and the military’s final stronghold. The abhorrent humanitarian crisis that grips Sudan continues to leave a pathway of displacement and loss of life in its wake. USA executive director Avril Benoît says, “Our medical teams on the ground are providing emergency medical treatment, carrying out trauma surgery and caesarean sections, and running mobile clinics for displaced people”. Benoît warns of a looming famine and alarming backdrop of malnutrition, as well as the intensification of ethnic violence as the conflict wears on. Per Benoît, “What has been a collection of localised humanitarian crises has quickly evolved into an all-consuming humanitarian catastrophe”. Last month, the UN Security Council issued a press statement urging the Sudanese Armed Forces and RSF to de-escalate the conflict, seek a sustainable ceasefire and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law. The Security Council has also called on all Member States to refrain from external interference, which could threaten instability. Member States must adhere to the arms embargo measures in Resolution 1556 (2005). The resolution obliges states to prevent the sale or supply of arms to the Janjaweed operating in North, South, and West Darfur. Doctors without Borders is an international aid organisation whose mission is to offer medical humanitarian assistance to those in war-torn, disease-stricken areas. On May 25, the group reported the loss of a staff member who was tragically killed when shelling hit his home in Sudan; “[m]any of our staff lost family members or their homes during the shelling as well”. As the fighting continues, the shortage of medical staff and the urgent need for medical supplies become ever-apparent. The warning of Claire Nicolet, head of emergency programs, rings clear: Medical supplies are running out—we have only around 10 days of supplies left, so we urgently need to be able to restock the hospital. We need safe access and authorizations from the warring parties to be able to do this. If we don’t get these supplies, it will be extremely difficult to continue to treat the wounded.",

        "content": "( ) – Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency on a flight headed to Los Angeles from Miami on Sunday night. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” Tyson’s representatives said. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Reports that the flight was delayed due to the emergency are inaccurate, Tyson’s reps said. The flight took off two hours later than scheduled. “It’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,” his team stated. “This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” According to , the flight was also delayed 25 minutes once it landed at LAX as paramedics boarded the aircraft to tend to Tyson. This comes a little under two months before Tyson, 57, is set to return to the ring after almost 20 years. On July 20, about a month after his 58th birthday, he’ll take on 27-year-old Jake Paul in a boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix.",

        "content": "The legendary former champion is having his final fight in his home nation of Brazil, and bringing along for a long-awaited trilogy. The pair will compete on June 15 at a catchweight of 216lb, with the American making his boxing debut in the five-round exhibition. Sonnen has promised to arrive in terrific shape, but hasn’t fought since retiring on a two-fight skid in 2019. Meanwhile, Silva spent the three years between 2020 and 2023 fairly active before taking a two-year break from competition when he lost to . Anderson Silva’s coach reveals impressive shape ahead of Chael Sonnen fight The legendary duo are 49 and 47 respectively, and will only compete for two minute rounds during their exhibition bout. Sonnen has been noticeably improving his physique in recent TV appearances, while Silva has stayed training with his sons Gabriel and Kalyl, the latter of whom features on the undercard. And , Silva’s coach Luiz Dorea detailed how he is looking like a man in his prime despite his advanced age. “His condition is above normal,” the coach explained. “His age doesn’t reflect the reality. “He’s 49 but looks 10, 15 years younger. The way he moves, his notion of time and distance and how fast he learns, his reflexes. You’ll see that on June 15. I always say the knockout is the consequence of good hands that connect. “And Anderson is ready to connect and go for the knockout. I believe Sonnen is taking care of himself, because Anderson is coming in his best shape and motivated to fight in Brazil.” Despite the fact the fight is an exhibition, Silva is training as if it were a full pro bout with Dorea adding: “Anderson always respects all of his opponents. He’s a boxer now. He was doing boxing for , with kicks and takedowns. “But we’ve been working on pure boxing for the past four or five years so he’s a complete professional now. He’s a heavyweight that moves like a lightweight, basically. That’s rare, brother.” Anderson Silva’s coach brand Chael Sonnen ‘a complete athlete’ ahead of trilogy The first two meetings between Silva and Sonnen went the way of the Brazilian, who landed submission and knockout victories after being dominated early in both outings. The American is renowned as a wrestler, but actually dropped his rival on the feet in their first fight. And despite never having boxed, there have been times when Sonnen has shown off decent hands in the cage. Dorea claims he is a well-rounded individual when it comes to combat, and one they are taking very seriously. “He’s a MMA athlete so he’s a complete athlete,” he said. “He’s experienced. Even though his background isn’t boxing, he can throw punches and defend himself, has good timing and distance and experience, so we can’t underestimate him. “Sonnen deserves respect for everything he’s done in the sport, and Anderson is very professional in how he’s approaching this match, because he wants to deliver a big show for the fans.”",

        "content": "MITCHELL – The Mitchell community remembered the brave men and women who fought and died while serving in the U.S. military by gathering on Memorial Day at the resting place of local fallen soldiers. During the Memorial Day ceremony at Servicemen’s Cemetery, former South Dakota Senator Mike Vehle delivered a moving speech that told the stories of area military men who died in combat. Vehle shared stories of the late Air Force pilot Tommy Callies and Army Sgt. Greg Wagner. Flying an F-4 jet, Callies, a Howard native, was shot down in 1969 by enemy fire in a Vietnam province during the Vietnam War. While Callies’ body was never found, Vehle said his “brave sacrifice” will live on forever. Wagner was killed on May 8, 2006 by an improvised explosive device (IED) in a Baghdad, Iraq, neighborhood. Prior to his death, Wagner capped off an decorated military career, earning himself a Bronze Star medal and a Purple Heart — one of the most coveted U.S. military medals. The Alexandria native climbed the military ranks to become a staff sergeant in the 665th Maintenance Company, which was based out of Mitchell. ADVERTISEMENT Callies and Wagner are among the few fallen South Dakota soldiers who have a bridge named after them. The Greg Wagner Bridge is located just east of Mitchell along Highway 38, while the Tommy Callies Bridge sits along Highway 34. Wagner and Callies’ bridges were part of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s bridge dedication initiative honoring fallen military men and women. Vehle attended Wagner and Callies’ bridge dedication ceremonies and said the packed gymnasiums filled with friends, family and community members showed their sacrifices were indeed “worth it.” While Memorial Day is a time to remember and honor those who died fighting for the freedom and values of America, Vehle said honoring the fallen should not be reserved for just one day of the year. “We need to be eternally grateful for the sacrifices these brave men and women have made, which allows us to be gathered here today,” Vehle said. In his closing remarks, Vehle challenged the crowd gathered at the Servicemen's Memorial Cemetery to be a “useful citizen” and respect the values of the United States of America. In 1988, Bonita Schuh became the first woman in the U.S. Army National Guard to receive a coveted honor when she was named the Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year. More than three decades have passed since Schuh was honored with the award, and she found herself receiving yet another award during Monday’s Memorial Day ceremony. Retired Army veteran Maylon Schuh was also on the receiving end of another award for his dedicated military service. Schuh holds a Soldier’s Medal, which he earned in 1973 for his courageous acts during the Vietnam War. ADVERTISEMENT On Monday, Maylon and Bonita Schuh received Army Commendation medals for their distinguished service and outstanding achievements. An active soldier with the local South Dakota National Guard’s 665th Maintenance Company presented Maylon and Bonita Schuh with their awards.",

        "content": "Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.

        "content": "The Arlo Pro 5S is easy to install, thanks to its built-in battery. The spotlight camera is down to $180 with this Memorial Day deal. camera is battery-powered and features 2K resolution for $250. The Pro 5S can go anywhere you need surveillance, is reliably accurate at detecting motion, and has a removable rechargeable battery. Arlo requires a subscription to access most of the in-app features, the video quality could be better for 2K resolution, and it is expensive. The is a completely wireless security camera that can be placed to surveil indoors or outdoors. It's sleek, compact, and reliable -- all qualities you'd expect from a new Arlo camera. But some things left me wanting, though I can't say for certain if it's because of Arlo or me. First, it's worth discussing the elephant in the room: the monthly subscription. I love a great security system; it's one of the few things I don't forget to switch on every night, and, as a diagnosed OCD sufferer, it helps me sleep at night. I have a Eufy Security system in my home because it doesn't require any subscription or monthly fees, though the startup cost isn't cheap. Arlo cameras are more expensive than the Eufy Security ones throughout my home and still require a subscription after purchasing. I could go on an endless rant on why I dislike security camera subscriptions, but I'll say this: if I buy the camera, I want to own the images. You don't buy a photography camera to pay the manufacturer for each photo or video you take. The Arlo Pro 5S 2K camera isn't meant to be a standalone product. While it is sold and can be used as one, it's meant to work best when linked with other Arlo Home Security devices. Users can buy a separate Arlo Ultra SmartHub to elevate their security system and enable local storage. The SmartHub can record onto a micro SD card that's sold separately. Once set up, users can only access the camera recordings when they are in the same network as the SmartHub, as the system works locally. This gives some users a much-needed sense of privacy and others a headache. Arlo consumers can bypass this setup and remotely access the video recordings saved in the SmartHub using port forwarding or a VPN. Arlo offers different types of Arlo Secure subscriptions to enable cloud storage of up to 30 days, smart interactive and animated notifications, audio detection of alarms, smart activity zones, theft replacement, critical alerts, 24/7 emergency response, and certain AI-powered features. The Arlo Secure subscriptions range from $4.99 a month for a single camera up to $25 a month for an unlimited amount of cameras, plus 24/7 professional monitoring services, video verification, Family Safety monitoring for check-ins and location alerts, and crash detection and response via the Arlo Safe App. Monthly fees aside, I've found the Arlo Pro 5S 2K to be extremely reliable and responsive -- the motion alerts come in immediately; as soon as there's movement on the Arlo's side of the yard, my phone lets me know. The battery life has been outstanding. The Arlo Pro 5S has a removable and rechargeable battery that lasts up to eight months on a single charge. I've only been testing the Pro 5S for a couple of months, but the battery is still going strong, with no low-battery alerts. The Arlo Pro 5S' battery sits tucked inside the camera. The image captured by the camera wasn't great. I'm unsure what is happening with my camera or if my backyard isn't pretty enough, but I was left waiting for the high-quality image from the Arlo Pro 5S. Instead, I was met with overexposed patches of grass in my feed that overpowered much of the rest of the image and made it hard to identify people when they walked by that area. I'll admit my backyard gets a lot of sunlight, and overexposure was the only issue I experienced with the Arlo Pro 5S. Through this experience, I determined the Pro 5S is better suited to surveil either the front or side of my home. ZDNET's buying advice Is the worth buying? The way I see it is it's the perfect camera for someone with an existing Arlo subscription or setup or someone interested in it -- as long as they don't mind the monthly fees. It's an exceptional camera, that's for sure, but it's one that doesn't live up to its full potential without a subscription or as part of a bigger Arlo setup. I don't believe I'd get the SmartHub to enable local storage, as viewing it remotely seems troublesome, but I can see why people do. If I were to add to my Arlo network, I'd probably get a monthly subscription. But since I'm on the cost-savings side of things, the Pro 5S 2K will be the only Arlo in my home for the time being.

According to an official statement from the Ministry of Endowments (Awqaf) and Islamic Affairs, the unit will serve the pilgrims while educating Sharia rulings and guiding them to perform the Haj rituals correctly. Sharia Unit head Mohamed Mahmoud al-Mahmoud said the unit’s work begins in Doha before the beginning of the Haj season. “The guides for the pilgrims are selected in cooperation and coordination with the Department of Da’wah and Religious Guidance at Awqaf. The guides are selected based upon the qualification and experience,” al-Mahmoud said. A total of 23 guides will accompany the pilgrims this year. The Sharia guide attends the introductory awareness meeting held by the Qatari Haj Mission for the pilgrims in Doha before they travel to Mecca. Al-Mahmoud said that a coordination meeting was held with the Sharia guides recently to discuss the arrangements. Video and audio clips will be published through Awqaf’s social media accounts to guide pilgrims and educate them on everything related to Haj and Umrah. They will educate the ways to perform rituals and what they must do while they are in the holy sites during Haj. A series of lectures and preaching lessons on Haj will be also held in several mosques across the country. The unit also makes field visits to the Qatari Haj Mission headquarters to follow up on the work of the guides and the extent of their commitment to the educational and awareness plan.

        "content": "JLGutierrez The Q2 ’24 Atlanta GDP Nowcast is projecting mid 3% GDP for the 2nd quarter, 2024. The scheduled GDP release this Thursday, May 30, ’24, is the 2nd look at Q1 ’24 GDP and the 2nd estimate is expecting 1.3% – 1.5%. The deflator, which is part of the GDP release and measures goods and services prices, is expected at +3.1% per the Briefing.com calendar. At a recent JPMorgan lunch in Oak Brook, Illinois, members of the fixed-income team were on hand, and given all of the inflation measurements that are populating the blogs and social media, I had to ask the team what – in their opinion – was or is the most important inflation measure(s) to be followed, and their immediate response was Core CPI and Core PCE data. Friday morning, we get Core PCE data for April ’24, and overall April PCE data is expected at +0.2%, while the April Core PCE data is expected at +0.3%. Don’t forget about “inflation expectations” One thing you learn studying money and banking and economics for that matter, is that while so much financial media attention is rooted in “inflation data” (actual inflation, which is important for sure), the more telling aspect of inflation is “inflation expectations” and one of only two measures that tracks this critical measurement, is the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Data, which was last released on Friday, May 24, 2024. This chart, cut-and-pasted from Briefing.com, shows the last two bullet points under “Key Factors” that both year-ahead and long-run inflation expectations have seen inflation expectations revised lower. Note in particular that last bullet point under “Key Factors”: that data shows the long-run inflation expectations, both pre- and post-Covid, and note the data. For Friday’s April PCE data, any number hotter than normal will likely send Treasury yields higher and stocks lower, and vice versa, if the data starts to come in lower, given inflation expectations. However, without any weakness in economic data, particularly the labor market, it’s an easy argument to make (and many make it) that the Core CPI and Core PCE inflation data will remain elevated. It really is a remarkable US economy and US stock market on this Memorial Day, May 27th, 2024. Summary/conclusion Inflation data is now as closely watched as labor market data, and for good reason. Technicians this blog follows keep noting the rather “iffy” technical support around crude oil, and despite what the inflation data might show this week, if crude oil does drop below $70, it would likely lead to a rally in Treasuries and help out the inflation data in May and June ’24. Now the opposite applies too: lower-than-expected inflation data this week would be negated if crude oil spiked over $90, as Treasury yields would rise and the S&P 500 would likely correct or stagnate. The point is crude oil still matters, and it’s often ignored, but it ultimately impacts Treasuries and thus stock prices and impacts inflation metrics. On this Memorial Day, 2024, as American citizens, we are blessed with a $27 trillion US economy, a $46 trillion stock market, and a $51 trillion US bond market. Today, we are living in the greatest wealth-creation machine in the history of civilization, and the Americans we memorialize today for their service and sacrifice, truly paid the ultimate price. None of this is a prediction about inflation data. We’ll have to wait and see what the data holds this week. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal even for short periods of time. Readers should gauge their own comfort with market volatility and adjust their portfolios accordingly. Thanks for reading.

With this bundle usually going for $6,097, this is the lowest price we have seen to date, with only two previous discounts to speak of. You can find the mower with its normal battery amount currently discounted to the same rate, meaning you’re getting two extra batteries for no added cost while already saving you $1,098. You can also find a similar bundle on , down from $6,597. The comes stocked with four 10.0Ah batteries that allows it to cover up to 2 acres of land on a single charge (which can be slightly extended with the extra two batteries). Its four independent brushless motors are housed within the 42-inch weather-resistant steel cutting deck, equivalent to a 22-horsepower engine, allowing it to move at up to 8 MPH. You’ll have 10 cutting heights to choose from here, ranging from 1.5 inches to 4.5 inches, three different driving modes, as well as 3-in-1 functionality for mulching, bagging, or side-discharges. It also sports some premium features like the 32 LED lights laid out on its front, sides, and rear for those early morning or late evening jobs – and even Bluetooth connectivity and a USB charging port for devices. As part of its , Best Buy is offering the . Regularly fetching $1,949, in 2023 we saw this particular model drop farthest during Black Friday sales, where it was brought down to $1,499. With this colorway no longer being offered from Aventon directly, we’ve mainly seen it included in Best Buy flash sales since the start of the new year, with today’s deal coming in as a $450 markdown that returns costs to the third-lowest price we have tracked – not only matching Black Friday rates, but also matching Aventon’s current Memorial Day rate. It’s also among some of the , which you can read about in our or by heading below. This comes ready to carry you wherever needed around town with its 500W rear-hub motor (750W peak) paired alongside a fully-integrated 14.0Ah battery that provides a 60-mile travel range on a single charge. Using only its throttle you’ll top off at 20 MPH, but when utilizing the five different levels of pedal assistance, that limit is bumped up to 28 MPH. It also comes with a rear-mounted rack for carrying along cargo as well as front and rear fenders to protect the bike from any adverse elements during your journey. It features integrated head and taillights, with the rear lights offering a brake light function, and you’ll find a handy backlit LCD display attached to the handlebars that gives you real-time status of all the important metrics: speed, travel distance, pedal assistance settings, and battery levels. As I stated before, this lowered price currently matches rate, albeit there is one tradeoff worth noting – by sacrificing the colorway, you’ll receive a free extra battery from Aventon’s direct sale that doubles the e-bike’s mileage from 60 miles to 120 miles! Alongside its , Amazon is offering the , . Already down from its $200 price tag, it entered the new year at $150 before steadily rising at small rates until April, when we finally started seeing some short-lived price cuts before once more rising back up. Today’s deal comes in to shake up the stagnation as a combined 36% markdown off the going rate that gives you $72 in savings and drops costs to a new all-time low. This can be stowed away in your vehicle (or kept out for regular use thanks to the included accessory parts) for quick and effortless charging solutions whenever you find yourself far from any official charging stations. It features an LED display that conveys in-time information, as well as a smart chip that provides protection against lightning, leakage, grounding, over voltage, under voltage, over charge, over current, and overheating. You’ll also be able to fully monitor and control the device through your smartphone, letting you even schedule charging for 1 to 12 hours, with options to take advantage of off-peak hours. It is compatible with vehicles and plug-in hybrids that comply with the J1772 standard, requiring only a NEMA 14-50 outlet to plug the charger into. The savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear. and subscribe to the .",

        "content": "Portugal is present at ITB China, the largest tourism fair in China, which takes place between May 27th and 31st, with the country represented by a delegation of 20 companies, led by Turismo de Portugal. In a statement sent to the press, Turismo de Portugal explains that participation in ITB China aims to “explore opportunities for cooperation between tourism entities in both countries, encourage cooperation in the area of student training and the training of tourism professionals and encourage local companies investing in the Tourism industry in Portugal”. “It is effectively an issuing market with strategic importance, not only because of its size but also because of the history that unites us. Tourism plays a key role in deepening bilateral relations and achieving a greater balance in Portugal's trade balance with China”, says Carlos Abade, president of Turismo de Portugal, remembering that this coincides with the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Portugal and China. In addition to participating in the fair, the occasion will also be used to sign contracts with local companies to launch marketing campaigns to promote Portugal throughout China, also giving rise to a roadshow that will take place in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Macau, and which should bring together more than 200 Chinese companies and encourage meetings with CEOs of the main partners of the tourism operation. China is the largest outbound tourism market in the world, which is why it is viewed strategically, especially because it continues to be a market with high potential for Portugal, since, between January and February 2024, it was the 17th tourist market in external demand for the destination Portugal measured by the overnight stays indicator (share 1.3%) and occupied 14th place in the guests' indicator (share 2.1%) totalling 37.1 thousand.",

        "content": "The UK is set to bask in 'summer-like' temperatures as early as next week, with some areas seeing highs of 23C - but Brits will first have to get through outbreaks of rainy and unsettled weather . New weather maps from WXCharts show a comeback for warmer weather this June. Balmy conditions will see areas including Manchester and Birmingham reach temperatures as high as 23C from June 5, while areas around Wick and Inverness are set to sizzle at 21C. But in order to enjoy the sunshine, Brits will first have to face showers, and in some areas, possible flooding. It comes as the Met Office issued three different yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms across the north of England, as well as large parts of central, southern and southwestern England. Brits will first have get through outbreaks of rain and unsettled weather ( Image: PA) Brits are also facing a Bank Holiday washout as low-pressure systems have brought some very wet weather to many areas over the weekend. And there is further bad news that the rain is expected to continue to come down throughout the week before there is a sign of change by the next weekend. But The Met Office has indicated warm weather this June will offer a welcome relief from the rain. It said: \"Low pressure will bring outbreaks of rain and showers through much of this week. However, there are hints that high pressure will return for the start of June and the start of meteorological summer at the weekend.\" BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker said the weather this Bank Holiday weekend \"has been a little hit and miss\". He continued: \"Further showers are expected not just on Bank Holiday Monday but indeed the rest of the week. Temperatures will be normal, nothing spectacular but at least by the end of the week it does look as though these low pressures should finally pull away as we see high pressure building but the winds will still come in from the north so the certainly isn’t any major warm up in the forecast.” Met Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Dan Harris warned of localised flooding for Scotland and northeast England but there could be drier weather in the west. He said: “The outlook for Bank Holiday Monday is for brighter, cooler and breezier conditions with scattered showers for England and Wales at first, but a steady drying trend from the west is likely. \"Northern Ireland could well start off fine but cool, and remain settled whilst feeling pleasantly warm in longer sunny spells. The focus for heavier showers is expected to transfer to Scotland and possibly northeast England, where again these could be slow moving, the heaviest of which could cause some temporary, localised issues such as flooded roads.\"",

Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Related articles NBA star diagnosed with Bell’s palsy 'Untapped potential': NZ Breakers confirm savvy new signing Share this article",

        "description": "PARIS — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out ” Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.",
        "content": "PARIS — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out ” Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him on this afternoon-into-evening match against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal’s last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. “It’s difficult for me to talk,” said the Spaniard, whose 11⁄2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure.” While Nadal said it’s doubtful that he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics’ tennis competition will be held at the French Open’s site. When Monday’s match ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion simply unable to play at his usual level after 11⁄2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the shouts of his two-syllable nickname echoed. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; indeed, he’d never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances going back to his days as a teenager. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal’s uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty beige chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday’s look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player, one coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday’s start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, he faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph ace and a 117 mph service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with a trademark on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain that level, and soon it was 2-all. Zverev later broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. “The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during my entire tennis career is amazing. But now I’m 28,” Nadal said, then paused and corrected himself with a chuckle: “Well, no, 38. I would love to be 28!” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around and applaud right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!”",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 On Thursday, May 23, history was made as BARK Air ‘s first-ever flight departed from New York, carrying six dogs of varying breeds and eleven humans, including both passengers and crew, to Los Angeles. This milestone marks the beginning of a revolutionary approach to air travel, offering a unique, pet-friendly experience designed specifically for dogs and their human companions. BARK Air is the world’s first airline focused exclusively on canine comfort. The innovative service promises to transform the often stressful ordeal of traveling with pets into a joyful and comfortable journey. With a mission to prioritize the needs of furry passengers, BARK Air has redefined the flight experience from the ground up, ensuring a stress-free journey for both dogs and their owners. Upon booking a flight with BARK Air, human passengers are contacted by a dedicated concierge who gathers detailed information about their dogs and travel plans. This personalized approach ensures that each dog receives the best possible travel experience tailored to their specific needs. On the day of travel, passengers and their dogs arrive at the airport just one hour before the flight, bypassing the typical hassles associated with air travel. The check-in process is streamlined and efficient, eliminating the need for crates and avoiding stressful lines. At the gate, a highly skilled BARK Air concierge welcomes the dogs, helping them socialize and settle into their journey.

        "content": "CALGARY — Steve Blake has a powerful message — don’t give up on your dreams no matter what life throws your way. The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada's lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. \"You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn't mean life's over,\" said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. \"You've still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.\" Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. \"The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,\" Blake said. \"I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. \"As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. \"It’s incredible,” Blake said. \"The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage.

Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.' \"Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.\" The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. \"When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,\" said Kelly. \"We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).\" Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. \"I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.\" After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. \"Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,\" said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.\" Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. \"It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,\" said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. \"It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much.

        "content": "CALGARY — Steve Blake has a powerful message — don’t give up on your dreams no matter what life throws your way. The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada's lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. \"You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn't mean life's over,\" said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. \"You've still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.\" Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. \"The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,\" Blake said. \"I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. \"As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. \"It’s incredible,” Blake said. \"The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage.

        "content": "NBA Hall of Famer and UCLA legend Bill Walton has passed away of cancer. He was 71. The announced Walton's death Monday. NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a statement on the two-time NBA champion. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" Silver said. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear, and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was a beam of light and one of the biggest and brightest stars in sports. His college and professional career was unmatched. The College Basketball Hall of Famer is a two-time NCAA champion, three-time National College Player of the Year, and a three-time Consensus first-team All-American. Walton was the Portland Trail Blazers' No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft. He spent 10 seasons in the NBA and was named a two-time All-Star, two-time All-NBA, 1977-78 NBA MVP, two-time All-Defense, and the 1985-86 Sixth Man. Walton spent his NBA career with the Blazers from 1974-79, the San Diego Clippers from 1979-85, and the Boston Celtics from 1985-88. His No. 32 is retired by the Trail Blazers. While Walton had a great career, he suffered numerous injuries throughout his historic career, including chronic foot injuries, a sprained ankle, a twice-broken left wrist, two dislocated toes, two dislocated fingers, a broken toe. He also injured his leg in a accident. These injuries limited his career totals, and he decided to call it quits after 14 seasons in the NBA. Walton finished his career averaging 13.3 points per game, 10.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists. The California native possibly had an even better post-playing career. Walton pivoted to college basketball commentary on national telecasts for ESPN, Sports, and Sports, among other outlets. He earned an Emmy Award for his analysis in 1991. Walton was a larger-than-life figure whose transcended basketball. He is survived by his wife, Lori, and four sons: Adam, Nate, Luke, and Chris.

        "content": "England star Jack Grealish has been linked with a shock exit from Manchester City, just three seasons after joining the club for £100 million (R2.3 billion). In what was arguably his toughest campaign in Manchester since his arrival from Aston Villa in 2021, the winger has finished the season with just three goals in 36 appearances. Reports suggest Grealish is unhappy with his reduced role this term, and could be interested in leaving the Citizens in the coming transfer window. Bayern Munich have been linked with the England international, who was named in Gareth Southgate's provisional 2024 UEFA European Championship squad, with Vincent Kompany reportedly eyeing a move for the player. The Belgian is expected to succeed Thomas Tuchel at the Allianz Arena after recently informing Burnley of his wish to take the opportunity in Bavaria. claims City could accept a big offer for Grealish should they receive one ahead of next season, with the winger still having three years on his deal at the Etihad Stadium. The ex-Villa captain made only 10 starts in the Premier League this season after injuries and the arrival of Belgian wide man Jeremy Doku seemed to impact his role in the side. Grealish was also an unused substitute in City's FA Cup final loss to Manchester United on Saturday, while he also played no part in the team's final three league games of the season.

        "description": "The developer says it has never worked on a project so emotionally charged as the Cal Neva renovation",
        "content": "From the police raids during Prohibition and the property’s underground tunnels to its alleged ties to the mob and the unanswered questions about what exactly happened when Marilyn Monroe visited in the final days before she died, the Cal Neva has provided Lake Tahoe with fertile ground for gossip, intrigue and mystery since its doors opened for the first time in 1926. But after its heyday during the Rat Pack era, the Cal Neva’s legacy faded as gambling declined in popularity and the hotel dwindled, desperately needing repairs and updates. By the early aughts, a stay at the Cal Neva was a far cry from the glamorous destination depicted in the desaturated Slim Aarons photos of swimmers lounging by the pool. Instead, the casino hotel was dark and smelled of stale cigarette smoke, with a soundtrack of slot machines. Ghost hunters came searching for celebrity spirits rumored to haunt the place, and it hosted the occasional concert, along with the annual Halloween parties. But for years, not much was going on at the Cal Neva. Then, in 2013, the Cal Neva shut its doors, and the property has languished ever since. Talk continues to swirl around the Cal Neva to this day, but now, the question is about what the legendary hotel’s next chapter will look like. At an open house Tuesday, developers unveiled a glimpse of their plans to completely renovate and update the Cal Neva, an overhaul that begins with about $5 million to $6 million of structural repairs and then a top-to-bottom remodel, from the hotel rooms in the tower to the celebrity room Frank Sinatra built when he owned the place in the 1960s. Ever since McWhinney, a Denver-based real estate and development company, purchased the Cal Neva last year from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, it has embarked on a steady outreach campaign throughout the Lake Tahoe community, talking with hundreds of people. The outreach includes more than 80 one-on-one meetings, 20 tours of the property and four open house sessions with more than 170 attendees, according to McWhinney. In total, the company said it has spoken with nearly 600 people at events it’s hosted. “We have never encountered a property that has so much of a community connection and emotional connection,” Jason Newcomb, McWhinney’s senior vice president of hospitality development, told SFGATE at the open house Tuesday. That’s saying something coming from the development firm that transformed Denver’s historic Union Station into a modern, urban plaza and transit center with retail, restaurants and a hotel. Indeed, McWhinney’s vision for Cal Neva is no less grand or transformational. From all of that community outreach, Newcomb says he came away with three big takeaways that he heard repeated, over and over again, and his team is folding them into its plans for the property: historic preservation, public access and bringing hotel rooms back to north Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe community members are clearly passionate about the history rooted in the Cal Neva, and McWhinney wants to bring the legendary hotel “back to its great glory,” Newcomb said. While some of the bungalows on-site, including the one where Marilyn Monroe stayed, are too far gone to restore, McWhinney is keeping the Cal Neva’s lodge and hotel tower intact, preferring to repair and renovate what exists rather than tear it down and build from scratch. The company also plans to build new villas in the woods, near the tower, replacing the old bungalows. Some aspects of the building aren’t going anywhere, like the giant boulders in the middle of the lodge, framing the giant stone fireplace. When the fireplace was built, a line was painted down its middle to mark the state line running through the building. McWhinney says it’s going to restore the fireplace but probably without that painted line — in fact, it was inaccurate. The state line is about 10 feet away from the fireplace. The underground tunnels are in rough shape, Newcomb said. They’re partially collapsed and full of dirt, so he couldn’t make any promises, but he did say one tunnel under the lodge still holds promise. If McWhinney can get it up to code, the company might turn it into a whiskey tasting room or wine room, a nod to the Prohibition-era tactics the Cal Neva used in the tunnels, moving liquor discreetly across state lines and evading police raids. When the Cal Neva reopens, most of the property will be open and accessible to the public, Newcomb continued. Design renderings feature a walking path weaving along the edge of the grounds, which will be landscaped with native plants and trees to get a “lodge in the woods feel.” McWhinney also has plans for multiple on-site restaurants and intends to restore the theater so the Cal Neva can step back into its role as a hub for art, culture and entertainment for guests and community residents. One of the most talked-about rooms in the Cal Neva is the theater where Frank Sinatra performed. The design renderings for the theater show a tiered ballroom with a stage framed by heavy drapes, much like the original, but updated and modern. “Everyone has some connection to the theater,” Newcomb said. All of this, plus the Cal Neva will reopen 216 upscale hotel rooms for travelers — an amenity in short supply across north Lake Tahoe, where most of the lodging accommodations are condos, short-term rentals or outdated motels. McWhinney is going to operate the Cal Neva as a Proper Hotel, taking a page from a playbook it’s done in both Austin, Texas, and Santa Monica. Kelly Wearstler, the designer for Proper Hotels, is working on the design for the Cal Neva, blending wood accents with a midcentury aesthetic. The developer wants to make all of this happen on a rapid timeline so the hotel can open for the Cal Neva’s centennial anniversary in 2026. But a massive amount of work needs to be done before guests can arrive, and many of McWhinney’s predecessors, who have come to the Cal Neva with ambitions of restoring the property, have failed to deliver. The Cal Neva was in decline throughout the 1990s and into the early aughts before it closed in 2013. The owner at that time, Criswell Radovan, announced plans to renovate the property, but a couple of years into the project, the company abruptly stopped making its loan payments and also shorted the contractor hired for the project . In 2016, Criswell Radovan filed for bankruptcy and canceled any plans for a grand opening at the Cal Neva. In 2018, Oracle founder Larry Ellison purchased the property, inciting hopes that the billionaire would bring the Cal Neva back to life. But no word of renovation ever came. The Cal Neva became another blighted, abandoned property in north Lake Tahoe until last spring, when news of McWhinney’s acquisition once again stirred hopes for the Cal Neva’s comeback. Drive past the Cal Neva, as many of the attendees at the open house Tuesday do on a regular basis, and you’ll see the ruins of the hotel’s glamorous past. Today, it’s hardly more than a slab of cracked pavement leading up to a deteriorating structure surrounded by a chain link fence. The old signpost for the Cal Neva still looms over Highway 28, but a giant screen below the Cal Neva’s logo — once a marquee advertising entertainment headliners — is blank. McWhinney has never put a project under contract and not closed, Dave Johnstone, the company’s executive vice president and chief investment officer of hospitality, told SFGATE. Newcomb added that McWhinney’s capital is family money that’s invested for long-range horizons. “These are families who have been investing for generations. Having that stability has allowed us to be successful,” Newcomb said. “We know what we can take on and what we can accomplish. And we’ve been able to leverage that track record.” Still, the Cal Neva is, from at least a regulatory standpoint, “by far the most challenging project” to get approved, Newcomb said. That’s why McWhinney is investing so much time at the outset on community outreach — so it can fold the community’s feedback into the project at the outset and hopefully drum up enough support at the beginning of the process to carry it through the regulatory gauntlet ahead. Later this summer, Newcomb said the project will be going through the permit approval process with the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, providing more opportunities for the public to comment. One of the trickier parts of the development is its location, immediately next door to homeowners who live in Crystal Bay and are accustomed to the quirky old hotel neighbor that’s been MIA for years. Newcomb and his team have already been talking with many of Cal Neva’s neighbors. In addition to traffic and construction noise, one of the concerns voiced by residents at the open house was about access to Speedboat Beach, the sliver of shoreline publicly accessible through the neighborhood. Speedboat Beach is already a sore spot for the local neighbors; often overcrowded, it’s the source of parking headaches and neighborhood noise and traffic. The Cal Neva does not have beach access. Instead, McWhinney says it’s building a terraced pool area with views of Lake Tahoe. There is also concern about the future of Crystal Bay and other businesses in the neighborhood. Across the street from the Cal Neva, a different developer has made big promises to tear down the Tahoe Biltmore, another long-loved local institution , and turn the property into a high-end lodging and village . But the time since the Biltmore’s closing, until ground breaks on the project, is stretching out, and in the meantime, the Biltmore has turned into a bigger eyesore than ever. The hotel is boarded up, and windows are smashed, with broken glass and debris littering the sidewalk. If the Cal Neva succeeds, Crystal Bay could soon become a bustling, thriving spot on the lake. But standing on the curb of the abandoned Tahoe Biltmore, across the street from the empty, falling apart Cal Neva that exists today, it’s hard to see that vision.

        "content": "RTE's Ray D'Arcy has opened up about his decision to give up alcohol and how it was his wife that \"inspired him\". The popular radio host has been honest about his childhood growing up and how his late father \"drank a lot\" . The Irish presenter has now explained how his own decision to give up alcohol for good was nothing to do with his familial experiences. Speaking to the RTE Guide, Ray revealed that he has never had an issue with alcohol , but admitted that he \"hasn't looked back\" since choosing to quit over four years ago. The 59-year-old told how he made the active decision to stop while out for a run one day. He said: \"One day I was on holidays down the country, I’d had a few glasses of wine and the next day, out on a run, I felt a bit fuzzy, and I just thought, I’m going to give this up. There was no big deal about it. \"I hadn’t discussed it with anybody, I just decided it was something I was going to do.\" The Den star confessed that he \"didn't drink that much\" to begin with and explained how his wife Jenny had quit six years before him. Ray highlighted how Jenny had \"inspired him\" to make the move with how much \"it changed her life\". The dad-of-two described how his kids would ask him, \"Daddy, why don’t you quit?\" to which he would tell them: \"I just have the odd glass of wine on a Friday evening, I don’t drink enough to give it up.\" And the Kildare man emphasised how he \"feels lucky\" that he doesn't drink now. He added: \"It’s the even keel and you get so much more out of the weekends . Some people might think that’s very boring, but I find it very attractive.\" The RTE One host recently signed a new megabucks deal with RTE. The Irish Sun has learned that Ray penned a new contract in January to present his afternoon show on RTE Radio One . While RTE would not say if Ray had taken a cut on his €250,000-a-year salary, a spokeswoman said the station was “committed to reducing the cost of its highest paid presenters to ensure no contractors or employees will earn more than the Director-General” (currently Kevin Bakhurst). That move appears to fly in the face of Bakhurst’s recent vows of a commitment to “transparency”. Ex-Today FM boss Willie O’Reilly, who turned Ray into a star said in terms of audience RTE has made the right move to tie him down. He told The Irish Sun: “Ray has a very good track record . If RTE put someone new and untested in there, they could lose 20 per cent of their audience in three months. “Ray has proven to constantly deliver big audiences. People have grown up with Ray and have an ingrained habit of listening to him in the afternoon.” Willie hailed the deal as a “clever move” by RTE bosses. Willie told us: “When you have a radio schedule, you don’t want to change too many things.\"",

        "content": "The Ghana Chamber of Construction Industry, has decried the state of many of its members due to unpaid GH₵15 billion debt owed it by government, accumulated from 2014. The situation, the Chamber said, had led to the death some members, others bedridden, while some had been sued in the court by their financiers over delays in paying back the loans. Speaking at a press briefing on Friday, May 24, Dr Mohammed Amin Adam, Finance Minister, said the government had spent about GHS49 billion to pay contractors. However, Mr Emmanuel Cherry, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Construction Chamber in an interview with the Ghana News Agency on Monday, May 27, denied knowledge of receiving such money. He gave a narration about the condition that many contractors found themselves as a result of government’s non-payment of the GH₵15bn loan accrued from to 2019. “Every day, labourers and professionals, financial institutions, cement dealers, and fuel suppliers, are all calling and demanding for their money from one contractor, bringing untold thinking and health difficulties to us,” he said. “Some contractors have died. There’s one contractor in good standing who is currently bedridden and cannot do anything; I spoke with the wife last week Friday, and even money to take care of him is a problem. A lot of them are also in court,” Mr Cherry added. The money that contractors receive are segregated into various components, including payment of interest on loans, which leaves many about five per cent or a maximum of 10 per cent of the contract sum, he explained. “So, if the contractor works and the certificate that’s supposed to have been honoured within 91 days travels to 600 days or 1,000 days and over, the financial institutions that loan money to the contractor will convert their simple interest into compound interest, because there’s a default. Therefore, at the end of the day, if a contractor is being paid, all those monies go to the financial institutions, without a drop left for the contractor... some contractors have now become blacklisted,” he said. A breakdown of the debt as provided by Mr Cherry included GHS6bn owed contractors since 2017, accumulated from Road Fund projects, and GHS5bn from Government of Ghana contracts since 2019. The rest are GH₵4.4bn Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) road projects accumulated from 2014 – of which GHS1bn has been paid in the last month, and GH₵600 million Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund) projects. Mr Cheery also stated that some debts were also owed contractors in the Energy sector as well as the government’s recent Agenda 111 hospital projects. He, therefore, stated that if the said GH₵49bn had been paid, a number of halted projects across the country would have resumed, and the pace of work increased, which is not the case at the moment. The Chamber’s CEO, however, said they were willing to jaw jaw with the government for a solution regarding the payment of debts, adding, “should things not go well, the government will see the other side of us [contractors].” He stated that the Chamber had already initiated steps in that regard and were scheduled to meet with the Works and Housing Minister on May 27, with another meeting expected with the Finance Minister later in this week.",

        "description": "An unusual way of eating fried chicken balls from a Chinese takeaway has gone viral after a video of the hack was posted to TikTok, with foodies desperate to try it for themselves",
        "content": "A TikTok creator has shared a genius way to eat chicken balls from her local Chinese takeaway – but the final product features no chicken at all. Nadine Campbell (@Nadz_xxxx) had foodies drooling after she revealed the hack , which involves removing the chicken from the batter and replacing it with rice and curry sauce. A video sharing the recipe had already been viewed two million times at the time of writing and saw her explain the technique after biting open the crispy ball. \"I pull out the chicken and then I take fried rice and curry and mix it together,\" she said. \"I then stuff it inside the chicken ball – I've eaten them like this since I was young – and I will never eat them [any] other way. Woman's 'life-saving' hack stops food going bad – you only need one ingredient \"I get chips and stick them inside and that's how I eat my chicken balls. It's delicious.\" Nadine warned viewers the technique \"works better\" with thicker batter. She captioned the clip: \"Anyone else eat them like this or just me?\" And it appeared several others do. One takeaway fan responded: \"Omg I thought I was the only one that did that!\" Another wrote: \"In my 24 years of living, I’ve never ever seen anyone else do this! I’m so happy!\" Meanwhile a third added: \"That's how I eat mine! without the chips though.\" The trick involves removing the chicken from the chicken balls altogether ( Image: @nadz_xxxx / TikTok) To everyone else, however, it was a new trick – and many hungry followers thanked Nadine for the suggestion. \"I feel like the last 42 years I was merely existing and now I am living with this recommendation,\" said one inspired TikTok user. A second wrote: \"I’m going to have to try this next time I have a Chinese, it looks amazing.\" A third agreed: \"What in the magical world of Harry Potter have I just witnessed?\" And a fourth gushed: \"Why have I not been doing this? Thanks darling!\" This isn't the first time Nadine has shared a food hack to social media, with Chinese takeaway often her cuisine of choice. Her \"plate-ups\" often cause controversy with her most recent combination of noodles, rice, and a variety of curries proving to be divisive. She's not the only one who loves a takeout – we Brits love putting our own stamp on some of the world's most treasured cuisines, often receiving mixed reactions for our takes on culinary classics. Earlier this month, Ruiz Asri, who runs the popular food blog and media site Honest Food Talks , told the Mirror: \"The history of a Chinese takeaway in the UK can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Chinese immigrants began arriving in the country. \"The majority of the early Chinese immigrants were seamen from southern China , primarily from the Guangdong province. Many of them were drawn to the port cities of Liverpool and London, where they opened small, family-run eateries known as 'chop suey houses' to provide other immigrants with a taste of home and create a sense of community in their new home.\"",

        "content": "Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said Monday under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” The Democratic president added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau , who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits , to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. Biden said that last year the Department of Veterans Affairs delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever before. He credited the PACT Act, which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned,\" Biden said. \"Not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans and Gold Star family members.",

Sarah Allen, who is a Peverell ward councillor, was chosen to contest the seat which Conservative MP Sir Gary Streeter stands down from after 27 years. Sarah, who works for an union and is the chair of ’s Audit and Governance Committee, said it was a “huge honour” to be selected to run in the July 4 election. “There are no ‘no-go’ areas for Labour in this election,” said Sarah, who overturned a significant Conservative majority to win her council seat in 2019. “I have lived in the and I know its communities well. I also know that 14 years of the Conservatives have left their mark on our corner of Devon. \"Farmers are struggling to make ends meet, rural poverty is endemic and you simply don’t know if an ambulance will arrive when you need it. “It’s time for a change and that’s why I want to fight to improve the lives of people right across the constituency as South West Devon’s representative in parliament under a Labour government,” said Sarah, who is a parent of two children. Sue Dann, who is chair of the South West Devon Constituency , said Sarah brings a “wealth of experience” to the role. “She knows the struggles families have to make ends meet,” said Sue. “Her work highlights the pressures in our schools, whilst her role as a councillor gives her firsthand knowledge of the importance of good local public services. Sarah will be the change we need to make sure our local needs become a priority.” Sarah, who grew up in rural Herefordshire, said she “can’t wait” to get out to speak to people across the constituency. “I will be talking to people about our hope for Britain's future, people are crying out for change and I will work tirelessly to deliver it for the people of South West Devon.”",

        "description": "The 22-time major champion is targeting the Olympics in Paris and is not keen on switching to grass",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal is set to miss Wimbledon next month and may never play at the All England Club again as retirement looms. The 37-year-old, who has won two Wimbledon titles amongst his collection of 22 grand slams, was beaten by Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the first round of the French Open. Nadal insists he will compete at Roland Garros again as he targets the Paris Olympics in two months and, as a result, put his presence on the grass at Wimbledon into serious doubt. Asked whether he thinks he will play on grass and at Wimbledon, he said: “[It] looks difficult, honestly. For me now, it looks difficult to make the transition to grass when we have the Olympics again on clay. “I cannot confirm anything, I need to analyse so many facts. I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happen to my body, to make a transition to a completely different surface, then come back to clay. “Today I don’t think that’s a good idea, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Nadal has won Wimbledon twice, in 2008 and 2010, and last competed in SW19 in 2022 when he reached the semi-finals before being forced to withdraw from his semi-final against Nick Kyrgios due to injury. The Spaniard was then absent from the rest of the 2022 season before the array of fitness issues which triggered his “farewell tour” announcement for this year. However, despite this, Nadal is unwilling to confirm his retirement date. Nadal’s first Wimbledon triumph in 2008 was an all-time five-set classic, as he beat Roger Federer in fading light for his first major outside of Paris. He had previously lost to Federer in two consecutive finals and the last time he lost a match he completed at Wimbledon was indeed to the now-retired Swiss legend, in 2019.",

        "description": "The money must be shared among the innocent people whose lives were ruined by the Post Office scandal, writes Vanessa Feltz",
        "content": "Show us the money, Paula Vennells (Image: Carl Court/Getty Images) We all heard former boss Paula Vennells sob and snivel her way through the public inquiry into the Post Office scandal. Vennells was paid £5.1million between 2012 and 2019. What were her excuses for presiding over the deliberatepersecution of sub-postmasters and mistresses resulting in at least four suicides, prosecution, imprisonment, bankruptcy, shattered marriages, smashed reputations, being shunned by friends and family and permanently impaired physical and mental health for more than 700 operators? Trending Between her sobs, Vennells claimed she did not fully understand the legal and technological sides of the business that she headed, and only became aware of glitches in the IT system in 2013. She claimed to be ignorant of the fact the Horizon software imposed on sub-postmasters by the Post Office could be accessed remotely by third parties. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Yet, after watching a BBC documentary about the software in 2014, she sent an email to senior colleagues saying that she was “more bored than outraged” by the programme and accused decent hardworking victim Jo Hamilton of “lacking passion and admitting false accounting on TV”. Vennells, an ordained church minister whose moral code should surely be pointing her towards righteousness, returned her CBE in January after a 1.2 million-strong public petition. Surely, she should now lose no time in refunding us the £5.1m she was paid? If, as she claims, she failed to grasp the basic but essential elements of the company she ran, does that not amount to an admission of negligence? You can’t run a branch of McDonald’s and claim you don’t know what goes into a Big Mac. You couldn’t be in charge of a launderette dyeing customers’ shirts shocking pink and use the excuse that you don’t know how the machines work while blithely continuing to draw your salary. On my radio show I asked employment lawyer Gillian Howard if it was naive to imagine Vennells could be prevailed upon to return her handsome remuneration. Ms Howard said Vennells’ protestations of ignorance may be tantamount to a confirmation of negligence. “You can’t be head honcho, take a fat pay cheque and admit that you didn’t have the faintest idea what was happening on your watch,” she said. “There is precedent for company chiefs having to pay back the money they have earned when their performance has been notably sub-par.” Give back the £5.1m Ms Vennells, for it to be shared immediately among the innocent people whose lives were trampled on and ground to dust by the Post Office. We don’t care if those were crocodile tears last week. Show us the money.

        "content": "By RNZ Rodger Fox - who has been synonymous with big band jazz in New Zealand - has died aged 71. The jazz legend founded the Rodger Fox Big Band in 1973 and toured extensively here and overseas, playing at international jazz festivals including Montreaux, Monterey and New Orleans. He also taught at the New Zealand School of Music in Wellington . The trombonist was honoured in 2022 for his services to music. Fox was only 18 when he began playing with a dance band in the Wellington / Porirua area. He told RNZ in 2022 that two of the biggest highlights were playing at Europe’s legendary Montreaux Jazz Festival in 1980 - the first-ever NZ band invited to play at an international jazz festival - and hosting American jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker’s visit to New Zealand to celebrate the Rodger Fox Big Band’s 30th anniversary. -RNZ Share this article",

        "description": "NBA Hall of Fame center Bill Walton has died. He was 71 years old.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. Video above: Remembering those we've lost in 2024 He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. \"Bill Walton,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, \"was truly one of a kind.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\"",

        "content": "The match of the 18th round of the Turkmenistan Football Championship between the local \"Nebitchi\" and \"Energetik\" from Mary ended sensationally in Balkanabat. FC \"Energetik\" has been performing extremely poorly this season. Before this match, the team had suffered 13 defeats in 15 games played, without a single victory, firmly occupying the last place in the country's championship. Therefore, few doubted before the game that the outsider would be able to put up a real fight away against the bronze medalist of last year's national championship. Moreover, the first meeting of these opponents in Mary ended with a 3:2 victory for \"Nebitchi\". However, as events on the field of the \"Sport Toplumy\" stadium showed, the guests were resolutely determined for the game. Having scored a goal in the 40th minute thanks to the efforts of Abdyresul Abdyev, the players of Dovlet Bayramov kept their goal intact in the second half as well. Having won their first victory in the Turkmenistan-2024 championship with a score of 1:0, \"Energetik\" with 5 points is still at the bottom of the standings. And \"Nebitchi\", having suffered their second defeat in a row, missed the chance to overtake \"Ashgabat\" and remained in 7th place with 15 points. In the other three matches of the 18th round, as expected, the leaders won again. \"Arkadag\", reigning champion of Turkmenistan, was losing 0:1 in the match on their home field against \"Shagadam\" from Turkmenbashi during the course of the meeting – the score was opened in the 14th minute by Rovshen Begjanov. However, later Vladimir Bayramov's players scored three goals against the opponent and won a hard-fought victory – 3:1. The winners were marked by: Shanazar Tirkishov (20th minute), Abdy Byashimov (32nd) and Begench Akmamedov (88th). The Ashgabat \"Altyn Asyr\" also won a hard-fought home victory over \"Merv\" – 5:2, initially losing 0:1 after an accurate shot in the 10th minute by Shazada Byashimov. However, then Yazguly Hojageldiev's players seized the initiative and scored five goals against the opponent. The winners had a brace from Arslan Saparov (23rd and 52nd minutes) and one each from Zafar Babajanov (30th), Selim Nurmyradov (44th – from a penalty) and Rovshengeldi Halmamedov (68th). Ali Haydarov scored the second goal for \"Merv\" in the 77th minute. In another match of the round in Ashgabat at the \"Nisa\" stadium, the two-time participant of the AFC Champions League \"Akhal\" convincingly defeated \"Kopetdag\" – 4:0, taking revenge for the 2:3 defeat in the first round. In the team of the Main Department \"Turkmennebitonumleri\", Alibek Abdyrakhmanov scored a brace (44th and 45th minutes), while Elman Tagaev (12th) and Gurban Annaev (54th) each scored a goal. Thus, based on the results of these matches, which completed the second round of the Turkmenistan Football Championship 2024, the leading trio looks as follows: in first place – \"Arkadag\" (48 points), in second – \"Altyn Asyr\" (37 points) and in third – \"Akhal\" (34 points). After the 18th round, there was a break in the national football championship due to the preparation of the Turkmenistan national team for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers against the teams of Uzbekistan on June 6 in Tashkent and Hong Kong on June 11 in Ashgabat.",

        "content": "New Delhi [India], May 27 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday congratulated Gitanas Nauseda on being re-elected as Lithuania's President. Nauseda was re-elected in the final round of the Baltic nation's presidential elections, as partial results showed him far ahead in the two-way race against his opponent, Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte. \"Congratulations to H.E. @GitanasNauseda on being re-elected as the President of the Republic of Lithuania. I look forward to working together to further strengthen the close cooperation between India and Lithuania,\" PM Modi wrote in a post on X. https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1795088401256919453 Notably, this is the second time Nauseda and Simonyte have competed in presidential run-off elections. Earlier in 2019, Nauseda beat Simonyte and bagged victory with 66 per cent of the vote. Ballots from nearly 90 per cent of polling stations on Sunday showed Nauseda, 60, winning roughly three-quarters of the vote, followed by Simonyte, 49, from the ruling centre-right Homeland Union party. Following his re-win, Simonyte conceded defeat while speaking to reporters and congratulated Nauseda. As president, Nauseda has a semi-executive role, which includes heading the armed forces, chairing the defence and national security policy bodies, and representing the country at NATO and European Union summits. The former senior economist with the Swedish banking group SEB, who is not affiliated with any party, won the first round of the election on May 12 with 44 per cent of the votes, short of the 50 per cent he needed for an outright victory, reported Al Jazeera. Moreover, Simonyte was the only woman out of eight candidates in the first round and came in second with 20 per cent. (ANI)",

        "content": "President Bola Tinubu on Monday averred that the sorry state of the local government system has contributed to the developmental setbacks and the country’s inability to tackle the prevailing security threats. The President who expressed the concern while delivering a keynote address during a one-day national discourse on Nigeria’s security challenges and good governance at the local government levels, however, said that good governance at all levels of government will foster development and reduce conflict. Represented by the Minister of Defence, Abubakar Badaru, the President said a well-governed state is better equipped to address internal challenges such as terrorism, insurgency and communal violence. He maintained that the absence of good governance leads to widespread corruption, political instability, economic disparities and social unrest which not only undermine human security by depriving individuals of their basic needs but also is a significant threat to national security by fostering conditions conducive for complete, complex and extremism. “Sadly, the state of our local government system in Nigeria is a cause of concern, as its degradation, and incapacitation have continued significantly and have contributed significantly to our developmental setback and our inability to effectively address the prevailing national security threat. “We find ourselves trapped in a paradoxical situation where the very areas most affected by security classes are rendered powerless and unable to mount any meaningful resistance or defence. “Local Governments are the frontline defenders against insecurity, as they are closest to the people and possess intimate knowledge of their community’s needs and challenges. This is why some are advocating for community policing, as a panacea to end security challenges,” he noted. He added that the scourge of insurgency, terrorism, banditry and other forms of criminality have inflicted untold suffering on people and undermined collective peace and prosperity. The President also harped on the need for Nigerian leaders to act in the best interests of their citizens, uphold the rule of law and promote accountability, it creates an environment where all individuals can thrive. He maintained that: “A well-governed state is better equipped to address internal challenges such as terrorism, insurgency and communal violence. Just through policies and programs that prioritize the well-being of the people and ensure that individuals meet their basic needs, the government can mitigate the root cause of conflict and promote peace within their borders. “Absence of good governance leads to widespread corruption, political instability, economic disparities and social unrest. These factors not only undermine human security by depriving individuals of their basic needs but also are a significant threat to national security by fostering conditions conducive for complete, complex and extremism. “On the other hand, Homeland Security is intrinsically linked to good governance, as it focuses on protecting individuals from various forms, such as poverty, disease, violence, and environmental degradation. “Without adequate human security measures in place, people’s lives are at threat and rights violated and their dignity is compromised. It is imperative to recognize that the promotion of human security has emerged as the central focus of the new development paradigm. “In today’s world, we understand that simply building arms and ammunition does not guarantee peace and security and political stability through national security lies in eradicating hunger, diseases, poverty and unemployment through sustainable development programs. “Those factors hold the key to achieving an enduring national security. They will amount to nothing if we do not address the underlying threat of hunger disease, poverty, unemployment, political and economic economic exclusion, and lack of social amenities.” In his address, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Tajudeen Abbas on Monday urged the 36 State Governors to prioritize the development of Nigeria and support President Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his quest to grant full autonomy to the Local Government Areas across the country. This is as his deputy, Hon. Benjamin Kalu underscored the urgent need to bridge the wide gaps in service delivery as people in the rural communities suffer due to the apparent failure of the Local Government system to meet up with their constitutional mandate. Both lawmakers expressed their views at the national discourse on Nigeria’s security challenges and good governance at the Local Government Level organized by the 10th Assembly in Abuja. Speaker Abbas who was represented by the Deputy Speaker at the event recalled that the Federal Government recently filed a legal action against the usurpation of local government functions by the sub-national governments. He said the action showed Tinubu’s determination to correct the anomalies in the system to encourage speedy development at the local government level, stressing that the House has also made frantic efforts through various legislative interventions to arrest the situation. The Speaker who decried the challenges of the third tier of government however said the House is committed to making the local government administration function optimally according to their mandate. He said: “The failure of local government is well known to us. Despite the extensive provisions of the 1999 Constitution regarding the existence and functions of local governments, that tier of government has failed to live up to its billing. Some of the most significant challenges impeding their ability to fulfil their constitutionally assigned roles include the covert usurpation of local government functions by state governments, lack of financial autonomy due to the State Joint Local Government Account, political instability from tenure irregularities, and pervasive corruption. “A critical component of the President’s Renewed Hope Agenda is the integration of local governments into the mainstream of governance in Nigeria. In a significant move, the Federal Government recently instituted legal action against the governors of the 36 states at the Supreme Court, addressing alleged misconduct in the administration of Local Government Areas (LGAs). This action underscores the President’s profound commitment to this issue, one he is intimately familiar with from his tenure as Governor of Lagos State. “We in the 10th National Assembly are determined and committed to ensuring local governments are recognised and sufficiently empowered to perform their constitutionally assigned roles. As contained in our Legislative Agenda, the House will continue to play a crucial role in advocating for and enacting the necessary legislative frameworks to ensure that local governments are granted the autonomy they rightfully deserve. “This is not just a legislative duty but a commitment to the democratic aspirations of the Nigerian people and the Constitution. For this reason, I call on all Governors to put Nigeria first and collectively support the President in the quest to grant full autonomy to local governments. “We must definitively resolve the controversy surrounding the status of Local Governments by providing the framework needed to ensure their optimal operation. “Let me reassure you that the outcomes of this national dialogue will receive the full attention of the House and its Committee on Constitutional Amendment.” In his own speech delivered by the House Leader, Hon. Julius Ihonvbere the Deputy Speaker regretted that non-State Actors are taking advantage of ungoverned spaces in the Local Government Areas to make life unbearable for people in rural communities. “History often takes unexpected turns. Like a once-mighty warrior whose shield has grown rusty, our local governance system has faltered. The gaps in service delivery are wide, and the very people who need them most – our rural citizens – are suffering. This, in turn, has fueled social unrest and violence, creating fertile ground for those who seek to exploit instability. “As many political analysts and development experts have noted, the near absence or complete breakdown of governance at the local level has created ungoverned spaces. These spaces have been exploited by non-state actors, making life increasingly unbearable for our rural populace. This is a stark reminder of the urgent need for reform and revitalization at the grassroots level. ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "description": "Study: GPT-4 can potentially make you more money on your trade investments by Paul Hill A new study freely published in the SSRN journal has found that large language models (LLMs) with large context windows, such as GPT-4 and Claude 3, can perform successful financial statement analyses to help determine the direction of future earnings. The study found that AI exhibited “a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle.” In addition, the researchers found that general LLMs were able to perform just as well as narrowly trained state-of-the-art machine learning models that had been trained to read financial statements. They also found that LLMs were able to make predictions that yield a higher Sharpe ratio which compared the return of an investment with its risk – the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better. Given these results, the researcher found that LLMs may be able to have a central role in decision-making when it comes to choosing investments. Interestingly, GPT-4 was able to outdo human investors just based on the financial statements alone, devoid of any context, which the human investors would have been aware of. The researchers also said that the LLM predictions do not come from its training memory but rather “generates useful narrative insights about a company’s future performance.” For investors out there who think this work sounds interesting, the researchers have created a ChatGPT bot which is available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers so they can submit financial statements and get an analysis. For anyone interested in analysing financial statements for free, Claude 3 allows you to upload documents and you can ask questions about the data too. While the researchers may be wondering if LLMs can replace human investors, another qualitative change with the availability of these tools is that hobby investors who may not know the ins and outs of financial documents, can get a better idea of what’s going on with various companies.

        "content": "Egypt is considering adjusting the price of subsidized bread to better reflect the soaring cost of production, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced on Monday. However, he reassured the public that bread subsidies “will continue.” Speaking during a tour of industrial projects in the Borg Al-Arab area of Alexandria Governorate, Madbouly emphasized the need for action. “There must be a move to make the selling price of bread commensurate with the tremendous increase in cost,” he said. “Egypt produces 100bn subsidized loaves annually, and we sell the loaf for only 5 piasters, meaning that we collect EGP 5bn from total sales.” This move comes as the Egyptian government grapples with a significant financial burden. Finance Minister Mohamed Maait revealed in March that Egypt has allocated over EGP 125bn to subsidize bread in the 2024-2025 budget. The current subsidy benefits approximately 70 million Egyptian citizens, constituting about 65% of the population. Addressing the Electricity Crisis In related news, Madbouly addressed the ongoing electricity outage crisis, stating, “We asked the Ministries of Petroleum and Electricity to stop load shedding by November or December at the latest.” Egypt experienced an electricity crisis last July, its first since 2014, which the government attributed to a heatwave. Officials promised to resolve the issue by increasing gas pressure and ensuring the availability of petroleum materials for electricity networks. However, these promises have not been fully realized. Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Tarek El-Molla, stated on Monday that strategies are being developed to close the gap between available resources and the actual cost of providing electricity. The goal is to achieve this by the end of the year, though a specific timeframe remains uncertain due to its dependence on broader economic reform measures. El Molla acknowledged the negative impact of this gap on both citizens and the state, noting that electricity was not cut off during Ramadan or Eid. He emphasized that the government is working towards complete and sustainable solutions. The minister also highlighted the financial strain on the petroleum sector, which provides fuel supplies worth $55bn annually at actual costs of $20-22bn. This figure includes extraction and production costs borne by international companies, as well as an annual import bill of $10-12bn, which fluctuates with exchange rates and global Brent crude oil prices.",

        "content": "A new study freely published in the SSRN journal has found that large language models (LLMs) with large context windows, such as and , can perform successful financial statement analyses to help determine the direction of future earnings. The study found that AI exhibited “a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle.” In addition, the researchers found that general LLMs were able to perform just as well as narrowly trained state-of-the-art machine learning models that had been trained to read financial statements. They also found that LLMs were able to make predictions that yield a higher Sharpe ratio which compared the return of an investment with its risk – the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better. Given these results, the researcher found that LLMs may be able to have a central role in decision-making when it comes to choosing investments. Interestingly, GPT-4 was able to outdo human investors just based on the financial statements alone, devoid of any context, which the human investors would have been aware of. The researchers also said that the LLM predictions do not come from its training memory but rather “generates useful narrative insights about a company’s future performance.” For investors out there who think this work sounds interesting, the researchers have created a which is available to subscribers so they can submit financial statements and get an analysis. For anyone interested in analysing financial statements for free, Claude 3 allows you to upload documents and you can ask questions about the data too. While the researchers may be wondering if LLMs can replace human investors, another qualitative change with the availability of these tools is that hobby investors who may not know the ins and outs of financial documents, can get a better idea of what’s going on with various companies.

        "content": "Steve Blake, one of Calgary’s best golfers, had a tee-time booked on that mid-September day. Except he had promised his wife that if his nagging cough worsened, he would go the emergency room for further examination of what doctors initially suspected to be a case of pneumonia. Instead of teeing it up at his home club, he drove to the hospital instead. After a series of tests, Blake received devastating news. He was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, a complete shock for an active family man and non-smoker in his mid-50s. It is, unfortunately, inoperable. “My oncologist, the day we met him and he sat down and went through everything with us as far as the diagnosis, he asked, ‘Would you like to know your prognosis?’ ” Blake said, choking up as he recounted this moment. “I looked at my family and said, ‘Yeah, I do.’ We knew it wasn’t going to be good. He said 12 to 24 months, and I really grabbed onto that. I said, ‘I just want this to be the starting point. I’ll see you in 24 months ... ’ ” In August, at roughly the 11-month mark, you will see Blake inside the ropes at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf & Country Club. Tournament officials announced Monday, on his 56th birthday, that the Calgarian has been granted an exemption to compete alongside the legends on the PGA Tour Champions circuit. This will be his second appearance at the award-winning and record-setting tournament, set this summer for Aug. 16-18. “The opportunity, it kind of leaves you speechless,” said Blake, who works as a financial advisor and is a member at Hamptons Golf Club. “In 2018, it was, ‘Let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here.’ This time, it will be different. I’m maybe playing for something a little bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams. “You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn’t mean life is over,” he added, fighting back tears as he credited his family — wife Kelly, son Connor and daughter Brooklyn — and friends for helping him to remain upbeat. “You still have a lot to give, so get out there and give it. The more you do that, the more I have something like this tournament to look forward to, the more alive I feel. I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who is going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I will be around for the next one and so on and so on.” Blake, who has completed chemotherapy and is now receiving a weekly round of targeted treatments, is the first confirmed entrant for the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic. There will be bigger names added to the tee-sheet, dudes with major titles and World Golf Hall of Fame credentials, but you won’t likely find a more heartwarming and inspiring story. Regardless of his score or his spot on the leaderboard, you can bet Blake will be a fan favourite during the three-round senior shootout at Canyon Meadows. As he put it: “If I can make a positive difference, even to one person that is struggling with this terrible disease, then I would consider any result in the tournament a total success.” “The patron group and Rogers continue to bring this event to Calgary to showcase the stars of the PGA Tour Champions to Canadian golf fans and to make a positive impact on the people in our community,” said Sean Van Kesteren, the executive director for the Rogers Charity Classic, in Monday’s announcement. “Giving one of Calgary’s top senior golfers, who needs the support of our entire community right now, this opportunity to play in front of his friends and family is not only extremely rewarding but supports this mission.” Blake admittedly wrestled with whether to request an exemption, which allows him to skip a two-part qualifying process. As he wrote a letter to tournament officials, he was asking himself: “Do you want to put yourself out there, with the illness, in front of everybody?” So why take this shot? Because Blake, who recently switched to senior shafts in his clubs as he tries to generate some of the speed that he’s lost in his golf swing, is a big believer in the power of positivity. During the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic, he wants to be proof of it. “You really have to believe that you can get past this or at least live as long as you can with it,” Blake said. “Unfortunately, too many people have that meeting with their oncologist. Too many family members have sat in on meetings like that. The devastation that you feel for the first period — it might be a week, two weeks, a month, two months, whatever — it can bury you. You just can’t allow it to bury you. You can’t allow it to define you. “I’m fortunate to have very positive people around me, always pulling for me, so it was a little easier to dig out of that initial hole. You just can’t let it beat you down and keep you down. If you do, chances are that prognosis is going to come true.”",

        "description": "Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war began.",
        "content": "JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on May 27 that a deadly strike that hit a displacement camp in Gaza’s Rafah was a “tragic accident” which his government was investigating. “In Rafah, we evacuated a million uninvolved residents and, despite our best efforts, a tragic accident happened yesterday,” Netanyahu told parliament. He added that “we are investigating the case and will draw the conclusions” after Gaza’s health ministry reported 45 dead as the strike late on May 26 sparked a fire that tore through a tent city for displaced Gazans. The ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip also said that 249 people were wounded. Israel faced a wave of international condemnation on May 27 over the Rafah strike, including from across the region as well from the European Union, France and the United Nations. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on “precise intelligence information” about two Hamas militants who it said were killed. It also said “the strike did not occur in the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF (army) has encouraged civilians to evacuate” since the ground operation began in Rafah. Netanyahu struck a defiant tone in his Knesset address while being heckled by relatives of hostages held in Gaza, and vowed to keep up the battle to destroy Hamas. “There is no substitute for absolute victory” in Gaza, he told the chamber. Netanyahu denounced pressure, both internal and external, that he said his government has faced since the war in Gaza began. “They pressured us then,” said Netanyahu, before listing calls to refrain from military operations which Israel carried out anyway. “Don’t enter Gaza. We entered! Do not enter Shifa! We entered! Do not enter Khan Yunis! We entered! Do not enter Rafah! We entered!” he said. “I don’t give up and I won’t give up! I stand up to pressures from home and abroad.” The Gaza war broke out after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry. AFP",

        "content": "A ballot initiative and a proposed substitute version are pushing for the legalization of psychedelics in Massachusetts within the next year, but opponents said “it’s too premature.” The ballot initiative promoted by Massachusetts for Mental Health Options, an organization affiliated with the Washington, D.C.-based New Approach PAC, could soon be put on November's vote. The initiative would allow Massachusetts voters to determine if the state should legalize, regulate, and tax certain psychedelics for therapeutic use. It also proposes the creation of a new regulatory commission to facilitate access to natural psychedelics. In 1970, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration passed the Controlled Substances Act. This statute legally classified and banned a variety of drugs including psilocybin, the psychoactive drug found in Psilocybe mushrooms. “Psychedelics didn't magically solve all my problems, but they were the key to unlocking parts of my brain itself that I couldn't access before,” said Emily Oneschuk, a U.S. Navy veteran and the grassroots campaign director for MMHO, before the public hearing on the ballot initiative last month. “This won't fix their whole system, but it will help people and it's an important piece in a complex solution. Massachusetts needs more mental health options, which is why I strongly endorse this initiative. ” Meanwhile, the opponents to the ballot questions — Bay Staters for Natural Medicine, New England Veterans for Plant Medicine, and Parents for Plant Medicine — requested an alternative ballot question to lawmakers, calling for a psychedelic ballot question to be changed to protect the affordability of future treatments. According to a document provided by Colomba Klenner, communication director of Bay Staters, the common price point for individuals to access facilitated experiences could be $3,500 excluding the cost of lodging and travel, which can add thousands in expenses. “If it costs thousands of dollars, like the PAC wants it to, like they've created in Oregon, then people won't have access to that quality advice on how to have the best experience for them,” said James Davis, founder of Bay Staters for Natural Medicine. “The biggest drawback of access to psychedelics is that people just need education on how to use them safely. And if that education costs thousands of dollars, a lot fewer people are going to have access to it.” Article continues after... Despite opposing the ballot initiative, Davis said they have long supported the legalization of plant medicines because it “saved people’s lives.” “A lot of people who don't formally have depression, don't have a diagnosable problem can still benefit a lot from psilocybin. Spiritually, it can help us process grief because we all lose people we love. Life is short for everybody, even for people who don't have diagnosable PTSD. We're trying to design a program that's flexible and still offers services to people who don't have a formal mental illness.” Jerrold Rosenbaum, director of the Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the situation is “nuanced.” “Given the many millions of people that have used psychedelics, and many of them who have testimonials to describe their experience as positive in some cases, it doesn't seem appropriate for governments to limit people's access to that experience or to criminalize it,” he said. “But they do have the potential for harms that are not entirely well-understood.” John A. Fromson, the president of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, and associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said psilocybin has “a significant optimism and excitement” within the scientific medical community as it can be helpful for mood disorders. However, the results of treating PTSD and depression with these agents are “not yet conclusive.” “We really don't know enough about dosing, limitations, and guidelines, and how it fits in with the overall treatment plan that includes therapy and other supports that this ballot initiative calls for, and short and long-term long term side effects,” he said. Nine communities in Massachusetts have passed measures legalizing psychedelics, Somerville being the first. Davis said the “sky doesn’t fall.” “When people have decriminalized access, when people can grow and share their own, there’s been no incidents of people having bad experiences,” he said. “It’s just people finally able to talk about this openly with their friends, loved ones, their therapists, their doctor. It just means that people are able to not face as much stigma and waiting to give it a try to grow and work on themselves spiritually.” Anthony Rothschild, professor of psychiatry at UMass Chan Medical School and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, said psychedelics is an “exciting” area of research, but it will be a “huge mistake” to make it legal because the side effects are not clear. “There are side effects from these drugs. They can range from mundane things like having a headache to more serious things like people becoming psychotic during the administration of the medication,” he said. “We don't understand fully all their side effect profile. That's why we're studying them.” One psychedelic drug, MDMA, also known as Ecstasy, used in combination with therapy to treat PTSD, was submitted to the FDA for approval. Rothschild said that at present, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for PTSD, but the data indicates that MDMA-assisted therapy effectively addresses this condition. “There isn't really like one medication that really can treat the whole thing; instead the treatments are more psychotherapy right now for PTSD,” he said. “If the FDA approves MDMA in August or September, it would mean a lot for the treatment of people with PTSD.” MDMA would be the first treatment of its kind. Rothschild added it's necessary to have trained therapists for the administration of MDMA, and he hopes the treatment can be approved in the manner it was studied. “Just to emphasize, it's done with a trained therapist,” he said. “It would probably only be administered by certain centers that had permission to do it and it would have to do it with the trained therapists and so forth. If you could just walk into a store like you buy cannabis and take it home, there's going to be no trained therapist presence if something goes wrong.” He added that apart from PTSD, many people support legalizing psychedelics to treat depression and anxiety, but the efficacy of these substances in treating these disorders is still in question. “We don't know whether they work, except maybe in PTSD,” he said. “But we don't know if it works for depression, we don’t know if it works for anxiety, and I suspect that people want this to be legalized or trying to self-medicate themselves for those kinds of conditions, but I don't know [about the effectiveness].” Rosenbaum said he anticipates that there will come a time when psychedelics will be available to people, but it would require a lot of preparation, and access to sites that allow individuals to experience these things safely. “It'll be complicated and it will require a lot of spots to protect the vulnerable, and make sure that we don't face unintended consequences,” he said. The psychedelic initiative petition was heard last month. A special legislative committee declined to act on it, meaning supporters must collect an additional 12,429 voter signatures to win a spot on the November ballot. That decision eliminated the potential for a substitute question proposed by Bay Staters for Natural Medicine. Ruihan Yang writes for the Recorder from the Boston University Statehouse Program .",

        "content": "Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the clearing out of the mafia from the state has resulted in large-scale investment flow into the Purvanchal region of the state. He added that the projects being set up in the region will facilitate jobs for a large number of youths from the region. Addressing a public meeting in Mohammadabad in favour of party candidate Neeraj Shekhar from the Ballia Lok Sabha seat, the Chief Minister took a dig at the Samajwadi Party, pointing out that while the party vowed to kill the poor, he has resolved to eliminate the mafia from Uttar Pradesh and has succeeded in this pursuit. He added “After Ayodhya and Kashi, we are preparing to head towards Mathura.” While paying heartfelt tribute to the revolutionaries, he emphasized the numerous aspirations of the late Krishna Anand Rai for the Mohammadabad region. “Rai was deeply concerned about the area’s development and consistently working towards achieving this goal. Yet, whenever leaders like Krishna Anand Rai endeavoured to foster development, they fell victim to mafia violence. Rather than expressing condolence on Krishna Anand Rai’s tragic demise, these people protected murderers. And now, they are lamenting the death of the mafia,” he remarked. “Along with Krishna Anand Rai, Shyam Shankar Rai, Ramesh Rai, Ramesh Patel, Munna Yadav, and others were brutally murdered. At that time, the state was under the SP government and the central government was led by the Congress. Whenever these two parties come together, chaos follows. We cannot afford to let such chaos happen again,” CM said. Yogi said that the SP and Congress should be reminded whether Munna Yadav and Ramesh Patel, who were killed by mafias like Mukhtar, were not from backward castes. “Was Pooja Pal’s husband Raju Pal and Jaya Pal’s husband Umesh Pal in Prayagraj not from backward castes? Their resolve was to kill the poor’s sons, and ours is to eradicate the mafias”, he quipped. Yogi Adityanath said that people should be proud of living in an environment that was envisioned by the first freedom fighters of the country, Mangal Pandey and Chittu Pandey. “PM Modi is making efforts to realise the dreams of Krishna Anand Rai, who was concerned about the development of Mohammadabad. PM Modi is also fulfilling the aspirations of former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar regarding the region”, he remarked. “Today, wherever we go in the country, we encounter the same sentiment and determination. People are saying, ‘Fir Ek Baar Modi Sarkaar, Abki Baar, 400 Paar’. It’s a cause of concern for the SP, which is contesting only 60-62 seats. Furthermore, they have given tickets to Yadavs from a single family”, he added. The Chief Minister said that he brought Nirahua from Mumbai and entrusted him with the responsibility of Azamgarh. Since Nirahua became an MP, Azamgarh has witnessed the establishment of an airport, a university, the Purvanchal Expressway, a medical college, a nursing college, and a music college, Yogi asserted, pointing out that wWhen competent individuals are elected, development naturally follows. Hitting out at the opposition, Yogi stated that the Congress, in its manifesto, declares that if they come to power, they will implement personal law. “This means daughters would be deprived of education, women wouldn’t be able to go out, and they would have to remain confined to their homes in burqas. However, we will not allow India to be governed by Sharia law or permit a Taliban-like regime to take over”, he remarked. Yogi remarked that the Congress promises to impose an inheritance tax if they come to power, proposing a survey of our ancestors’ properties and allocating half to infiltrators from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. He likened this to Aurangzeb’s ‘Jizya’ tax. “Today, even a civilized Muslim would not name their son Aurangzeb because he imprisoned his father, denied him water, and killed his brother. Aurangzeb imposed the Jizya tax, demanding conversion to Islam or payment of the tax. We will not allow a return of Aurangzeb’s practices”, CM Yogi asserted. He concluded, “Today, India’s respect has grown on the global stage, and our borders are secure. Terrorism and Naxalism have been eradicated. If even a firecracker goes off loudly, Pakistan feels compelled to offer an explanation. They understand that the new India does not provoke, but it does not hesitate to retaliate. During the SP regime, the ration meant for the poor was consumed by the mafia. Now, 80 crore people receive free rations. PM Modi has lifted more people out of poverty than the entire population of Pakistan.” (ANI)",

        "content": "by: Cameron Kiszla Posted: May 27, 2024 / 11:01 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 11:01 AM PDT A new front in the legal war over Arrowhead bottled water’s access to natural springs in the San Bernardino Mountains has opened up, reports the Los Angeles Times. While previous legal wrangling has sought to answer the question of whether Arrowhead parent company BlueTriton Brands is legally allowed to use water from the springs — bottled water has been taken from the creek and sold since 1906 — environmental activists are now petitioning the state to say the company’s use of water is hurting wildlife. According to Rachel Doughty, lawyer for the environmental nonprofit Story of Stuff Project, BlueTriton has “dewatered” Strawberry Creek. Doughty explained to the Times that if the company weren’t siphoning water in its network of pipes, Strawberry Creek “would be habitat for endangered species, it would be providing a downstream water supply, it would support fish, and it can’t do any of those things without water.” In an email to the Times, BlueTriton Brands said the company will “partner with people in our communities, governments, policy makers, businesses, and consumers to sustainably protect and shape our shared future.” “Responsible and proactive water stewardship is central to everything we do,” the company said. “We’re proud of the work we’ve done and continue to do in Strawberry Canyon, studying, reporting, and managing our operations to help protect the land and natural resources. We will continue to operate in compliance with all state and federal laws.” The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is evaluating the activists’ petition.

The rest of the clip largely features highlights from the club’s 2023-24 season, with a motivational track being played underneath.

        "content": "The NFL’s Sunday Ticket feature has raised antitrust issues since its inception 30 years ago. In only nine days, the NFL will defend the product at trial. As recently noted by Ben Fischer of , the landmark litigation comes to a head starting on June 5. The basic argument is that the NFL’s broadcast antitrust exemption doesn’t allow it to bundle all rights to out-of-market games and sell them as one unit. Damages could exceed $6 billion. Almost as problematic for the league is that multiple NFL movers and shakers will have to climb into a witness box and resist the temptation to give the judge . Fischer notes that a settlement is unlikely, because the two sides are too far apart. There’s still time for the divide to be bridged. Plenty of cases settle figuratively, if not literally, on the courthouse steps. The NFL could be banking on finding a silver bullet in the increasingly pro-business federal court system, culminating with the Supreme Court. As Fischer explains, the case presents the question of whether the broadcast antitrust exemption applies to other formats, like satellite. That same issue is lingering for the pivot to streaming, . The entire Sunday Ticket experiment involves layers and levels of antitrust issues, from the league’s sale of the rights to the customers’ purchase of the product. Even though it’s marketed as a way for, for instance, Saints fans in Pittsburgh to see all games of their favorite team, the only option is to buy every week for every team for the entire year. Why not let a fan buy the games for one team? Or one week at a time? Or one game at a time? Someone, somewhere has decided that the league will make more money this way. Maybe it does. And maybe the trial starting next week commences the process of shaking up the way Sunday Ticket is distributed and sold.",

        "description": "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and comedian and TV broadcaster Patrick Kielty are scheduled to receive honorary doctorates from Ulster University.",
        "content": "This year's cohort, which includes Samantha Barry from US Glamour and artist Oliver Jeffers, is honoured to serve as an inspiration to the university's graduates. It occurs amid a year of festivities honouring the university's 175-year history as the Belfast School of Art. Mr. Jeffers expressed his pride at having the opportunity to return to Belfast School of Art this summer. An institution that is “intrinsic to the city's artistic and cultural heritage” is the Belfast School of Art, where he formerly studied design for visual communication. “Now dividing my time between Belfast and New York, this award strengthens my connection with the place where I grew up and I am grateful to Ulster University for the honour,” he stated. “However, I do hope I'm never on a flight when they ask if there's a doctor on board,” he said. Ms. Barry, who is originally from County Cork and is currently residing in New York City as Glamour's global editorial director for the Americas, is being honoured for her accomplishments in journalism. She changed the publication's yearly Women of the Year awards to support diversity. “I am delighted to have been recognised by Ulster University for my work and so excited to be visiting this summer to join the occasion with thousands of graduates as they celebrate after years of hard work and prepare to embark on their careers,” she stated. Betty Carlisle will be honoured for her work advancing shared education and empowering women from underprivileged and deprived areas; Eamonn Mallie will be recognised for his significant contribution to journalism and broadcasting; and Sister Nuala Kelly will be honoured for her outstanding service to the community following her transformation of St. Louisa's College in west Belfast. Professor Paul Bartholomew, vice-chancellor of Ulster University, stated that the institution wants to honour remarkable locals who are having an international influence. “Graduation is a special time of year as we celebrate our outstanding graduates as they come together with friends and family to mark their wonderful achievements,” he stated. According to Professor Bartholomew, “We are dedicated to fostering the next generation of leaders who will, in the years that follow their time at Ulster University, go on to make a significant impact in their communities and respective professions.” “With that future in mind, it is a joy to celebrate the work of those inspirational and acclaimed local faces already making a global impact, and we are thrilled to bestow these honorary doctorates.” He went on to say, “these individuals are leaders in their fields and demonstrate great talent, creativity and integrity.” According to Professor Bartholomew, the institution is hoping that “they will be an inspiration to the whole Ulster University community.” The summer graduation ceremonies in Belfast, Coleraine, and Derry, which take place from July 1 to July 9, will award the honorary doctorates.",

        "content": "The fire broke out because of a short circuit and a probe into the fire incident is under way. The education department and district administration will submit a report regarding the blaze. New Delhi : It was a close shave for around 1,400 girl students who luckily escaped a blaze that swept through their school building in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Monday. According to rescue officials, the fire ripped through the Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Haripur district’s Sirikot village when students were studying inside the building. The fire brigades took some time to reach the site as they had to make their way through a treacherous mountainous terrain. Faraz Jalal, Haripur’s rescue 1122 spokesperson, said that all the students were safe after they were evacuated from the school building in time. Jalal added that there was massive damage to the entire school due to the blaze. The school building was built partially with wood. Fortunately, no loss of life was reported following the incident. Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry, Chief Secretary Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said that the fire broke out because of a short circuit. A probe into the fire incident is under way. Chaudhry said the school would be made functional soon. Timely evacuation Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur pointed out that timely action by rescue officials in evacuating the students averted a huge tragedy. He added that the education department and district administration will submit a report regarding the fire. Gandapur said a review of all educational institutions would be undertaken to prevent such fire incidents in the future. The provincial government will compensate for the losses caused by the blaze, he added. School buildings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have often faced attacks by militants. On May 8 night, unidentified militants blew up a private girls’ school in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. The militants tortured the watchman and later blew up two rooms of the school, the police said. In May last year, two government schools for girls in Mirali had been destroyed by the militants. Luckily, there were no casualties in the incidents.",

JERUSALEM – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his nation’s military on Monday flatly refuted claims that the country’s air force aimed to harm civilians in its strike that eliminated two senior Hamas terrorist leaders on Sunday, the same day Hamas launched its most recent barrage of missiles into densely populated areas of Israel. There are mixed reports about the number of civilians killed in the Rafah strike. The Hamas-run health ministry claimed at least 45 people died, and other outlets have quoted up to 50 deaths. According to Reuters in a speech to the Israeli parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said, \"In Rafah, we already evacuated about one million non-combatants residents and despite our upmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong. We are investigating the incident and will reach conclusions because this is our policy.\" EGYPTIANS, IDF EXCHANGE GUNFIRE AT RAFAH BORDER CROSSING: REPORTS Fire rages following an Israeli strike that killed Hamas terrorists. A fire broke out killing nearby civilians. This still picture was taken from a video, May 26, 2024. (Reuters/Reuters TV TPX Images of the Day) A statement released by a spokesman for the Biden administration's National Security Council on Monday said, \"The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking.\" The statement continued, \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened, and understand that the IDF is conducting an investigation.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Rafah fire that reportedly killed 45 Palestinians was a \"tragic mistake\" during an address to Israel's Knesset. (Knesset Channel/Reuters) Hamas does not differentiate between civilians and terrorists. Fox News Digital reported in March that an Ivy League statistician argued that Hamas’ death toll numbers are not trustworthy . \"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, the deployment of precise munitions by the IAF, and additional intelligence information. Based on these measures, it was assessed that there would be no expected harm to uninvolved civilians,\" said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) statement, which added, \"In addition, the strike did not occur in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF has encouraged civilians to evacuate.\" ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE ON RAFAH KILLS 2 TOP HAMAS COMMANDERS, DOZENS OF CIVILIANS The IDF says its \"troops are continuing operations against terror targets in the area of Rafah.\" (IDF Spokesman's Office) The IDF's statement continued, \"The incident is under the investigation of the General Staff's Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism, which is an independent body responsible for examining exceptional incidents in combat. The General Staff's Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism is investigating the circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians during combat.\" The military advocate general, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, directed the General Staff’s Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism to investigate the strike carried out in Rafah, noted the IDF statement. Hamas said in a statement that the terrorist organization sought to hit Israel’s Mediterranean metropolis: \"We fired a large salvo at Tel Aviv in response to the Zionist massacres of civilians.\" The EU and U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hamas has for over a decade launched rockets at civilians in Israel, triggering a series of mini-wars with the Jewish state. PRESIDENT OF UN'S TOP COURT HAS LONG HISTORY OF ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS: ‘CONFLICT OF INTEREST’ Displaced Palestinians arrive in central Gaza after fleeing from Rafah on May 9. (AP/Abdel Kareem Hana) According to the IDF, \"Yesterday, IAF aircraft conducted an intelligence-based strike in the area of Rafah against significant terror targets, including senior terrorists in Hamas’ Judea and Samaria Wing who directed terror attacks in Judea and Samaria and carried out murderous attacks against Israeli civilians.\" The IDF added, \"The strike was carried out based on prior intelligence information regarding the presence of the senior Hamas terrorists at the site of the strike.\" The two Hamas leaders killed were Yassin Rabia, the commander of Hamas’ leadership in Judea and Samaria (the biblical name for the West Bank), and Khaled Nagar, a senior official in Hamas who oversaw the Judea and Samaria wing. The IDF statement, with a possible view toward alleged Hamas propaganda, also said, \"Claims that the strike was conducted using seven munitions weighing a ton are false. The strike was conducted using two munitions with a reduced warhead aimed specifically for a strike of these types of targets.\" Tor Wennesland, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, condemned the strike in a statement issued Monday. \"I condemn last night’s Israeli airstrikes which hit tents for displaced people in the southern Gaza city of Rafah and have tragically led to the reported loss of more than 35 Palestinian lives, including women and children, and dozens of injuries.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He continued, \"While the IDF said it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants in the strikes, I am deeply troubled by the deaths of so many women and children in an area where people have sought shelter.\" IDF spokesman Peter Lerner took to X to debunk a Hamas source who appeared in media reports to inflate the number of casualties and claimed the strike unfolded in the humanitarian area. Lerner wrote, \"Muhammad Abu Hani, quoted is a Hamas official. He appears to be the source of the widely reported claim that the IAF targeted the humanitarian zone. Is he also the source of the reports from the same ‘civil defense’ of 50 people killed in the strike? A number published by many of the world media. Fact: The strike never took place in the designated humanitarian zone.\" Reuters contributed to this report. Benjamin Weinthal reports on Israel , Iran , Syria , Turkey and Europe.

        "description": "A fast-growing, resource-efficient, and versatile grass.",
        "content": "Surprisingly, bamboo is a grass, and there are many varieties that can be ‘clumpers ‘or ‘runners’ – all to do with their root growth and structure. Once fully grown, some of the larger species resemble trees with a thick trunk. Much more sustainable than hardwood trees, they are also one of the fastest-growing plants in the world, growing up to 90cm or more a day. Despite bamboo not being native to a lot of countries, Europe’s growing interest in bamboo has paved the way for a new generation of farmers, ecologists, and landscape designers who are introducing bamboo into their plans, and there are at least 5 European countries that are currently growing bamboo – starting with here in Portugal at Bambu Parque, plus La Bambouseraie en Cévennes, France - Labirinto della Masone - Italy, Oprins Nursery - Belgium, and lastly of all unlikely places, Scottish Bamboo in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. In less developed countries, unemployment has often resulted in conflicts and social unrest, but the production and manufacturing of bamboo products can contribute to a more socially and economically stable environment by creating job opportunities. Bamboo is an easy-to-grow crop that provides annual income to some of the poorest rural communities in tropical and subtropical regions, and its rapid establishment and growth allows for frequent harvesting that can be converted into an increasingly wide variety of products for sale, providing a year-round source of income. Strength It is incredibly strong, and an amazing number of things are made from bamboo, from flooring to furniture and worktops, kitchen equipment, and even sports equipment, plus reusable items such as coffee cups, drinking straws, plates, and bowels. Even clothing such as t-shirts, underwear, and socks can all be made with bamboo, and the companies who make them are proud to produce these sustainable products. Eco-friendly? Compared to wood from trees, bamboo wood is more stable, and because it is nearly always laminated or compressed, it has a higher density than most wood types, plus the bonus of being more fire resistant. Processing certainly creates work for those that need it, where the culms (the hollow part of the stem) are split lengthwise into strips and the outer bark is removed. The material is planed and treated (bleached or caramelised) before drying. The strips are then glued and stacked and pressed to form a laminated material. For manufacturing a bamboo fabric, leaves, and shoots are cooked in strong chemical solvents such as sodium hydroxide and carbon disulphide, both being highly toxic and risky for human health. Once cooked, the resulting liquid is pushed through tiny holes directly into a chemical bath of sulfuric acid (dangerous again) where it hardens into fine strands. But are any of the processing procedures so eco-friendly? Credits: envato elements; Bamboo Torture Less talked about is its more gruesome use during WW2. ‘Bamboo torture’ was apparently used on prisoners-of-war, where multiple sharpened shoots of this innocent ‘grass’ were placed beneath the back of a horizontal prisoner, like a bed of nails, and these would start piercing through the body and growing through, causing a slow and painful death. Despite this theory having never been confirmed, there is a huge possibility that it may have really been used. Panda Food I have always associated bamboo with pandas in an adorable way. I mean come on, look at them. Cuteness overload or what? Despite conservation projects, there are still less than 2,000 on our planet. A panda's daily diet consists almost entirely of the leaves, stems, and shoots of bamboo, and because it contains very little nutritional value, pandas must eat 12-38 kg every day to meet their energy needs. They lack the digestive enzymes necessary to break down other plants, thus making bamboo their only food source, and they have adapted bamboo into their diet over time due to its abundance in their mountain forest habitats. This adaptation has been aided by the evolution of specialized jaw muscles that allow them to easily chew through tough stalks of bamboo. They say they’re living proof that you can eat just vegetables and still be fat, so don’t start thinking being a vegetarian is all good!

        "content": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National President JP Nadda on Monday lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing improvement in the lives of weavers in India and called him the “best ambassador of artists, weavers, and craftsmen of India.” JP Nadda also asserted that the weavers and artisans have witnessed a change in their lives under the leadership of PM Modi. “The change that has come in the lives of weavers after 2014 has been possible due to the strong leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 10 years ago, people thought that nothing was going to change in this country, such a mentality had developed. People had become indifferent.” He added, “But under PM Modi, the hopes and aspirations of the people have changed... Today, they feel that a leader can change the country. PM Modi has worked to encourage the weaver community in every way.” JP Nadda also said that PM Modi tried to infuse new energy in every sector, take it forward and fulfill even its smallest needs. “The weaver community has also not remained untouched by these efforts of Modiji. Many works have been done for their encouragement too,” he said. The remarks of the BJP National President came while he addressed the Bunkar Karigar Sammelan organised in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Addressing the conference, Nadda said, “PM Modi is the best ambassador of artists, weavers, and craftsmen in India. Whenever he meets any head of state, he presents art, craft or clothing made in any state of our country with its full explanation. During the G20 also, the commodities prepared by the weavers and artisans of India were given to the delegates.” Nadda also took a jibe at Congress and slammed it for forgetting Khadi. He said, “The slogan of Khadi was given by Mahatma Gandhi but in the last 70 years, the Congress had forgotten Khadi! In the last 10 years, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, many works have been done to empower the traditional skilled people like weavers, artisans, craftsmen etc.” Praising the ‘One District-One Product’ programme, Nadda said, “The ‘One District-One Product’ programme has given encouragement to this sector and has provided it with a global market. PM Modi’s efforts have brought positive changes in the lives of our people who are preserving our skills. Today, this society which is preserving our traditional art and culture is with the BJP.” The BJP National President also talked about Vocal for Local and called it the mantra of India’s economy. “I can say that Vocal for Local isn’t just a slogan or line, this is a mantra of India’s economy. It is the soul for making India ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat.’ And that is why, PM Modi worked to promote Vocal for Local,” Nadda said. JP Nadda in his address also asserted that the PM has taken care of every area of the country and as a result, those states which were considered as backward in the country are today among the leading states. “On June 4, PM Modi is going to become the Prime Minister for the third time and this will be a big news for the world... Nobody can stop India from moving ahead now,” he said",

        "description": "Suzi Walsh says using puppies in yoga classes raises concerns about consent, exploitation and animal welfare.",
        "content": "PUPPY YOGA CLASSES are increasingly popular around the world, enticing people with the allure of puppies as a unique attraction. Although new to Ireland, the experience around these classes and the welfare of puppies has in other jurisdictions. You can see why people might think it a good idea to go along, what’s not to love about a nice yoga class, complete with the cutest, softest and playful puppies? No harm, right? Well, maybe we should all stop here and ask ourselves: Are the puppies there because it’s good for them? What are they getting from it? Do they have a choice? What about their welfare? Am I satisfied they’ve made their way here today because this is ultimately for their good, or is this just for my entertainment? Let’s look at what exactly puppy yoga is and why it should be avoided... Puppy yoga is worryingly emerging as a new fitness trend where members of the public engage in yoga while interacting with puppies. Much of the time, in various locations around the world, organisers can be found claiming there are benefits to both the participants and the puppies. Some providers of this global craze contend that interaction with animals reduces stress and anxiety while helping with well-being (presumably for the yoga participants). While this holds true in theory, the reality is that all of this relies on the animals themselves being relaxed, calm and content. Additionally, the idea that there are benefits for the puppies here, that it allows them to strengthen their confidence and learn to behave out in the world really doesn’t stack up. My view is that socialising puppies in this manner is likely to have the opposite effect. Using puppies in yoga classes raises concerns about consent, exploitation and animal welfare. Exposing young, often untrained puppies to unfamiliar environments and handling by numerous strangers can be stressful and potentially harmful to their physical and emotional health. Puppy yoga has been designed to entice the public into booking expensive spots in what is essentially a standard yoga class. An investigation recently uncovered some disturbing truths about puppy yoga classes in the UK. The growing trend comes on the back of the rise of social media, where posts to Instagram and TikTok help raise the profile of many influencers. When the investigative reporter questioned if the puppies had access to water during classes, the response was that it would only cause the pups to urinate more. Dogs should never have restricted access to water, they have the inability to sweat or store water in the way that humans do and therefore they can overheat fast leading to potentially fatal consequences. During this investigation, it was discovered that some pups were as young as six and a half weeks old, barely weaned and unvaccinated. It found that some users would pay up to £40 British pounds for a session. In a commercial environment, dog yoga classes should adhere to the same standards as other enterprises involving animals. They should require a welfare officer or veterinary specialist to be on-site at all times. This is a standard practice in the TV & film industry, and yoga classes should be no different. The welfare of the pups should be a priority but that cannot be the case if the participants’ needs are prioritised over that of the puppies. In my opinion, such investigations demonstrate that yoga class is not an appropriate setting for young puppies. In my long experience as a dog behaviourist and trainer, socialisation is about introducing a young animal to something in a way which is gradual and calm, they must have the freedom to choose to move away. At such a young age, it is crucial for their confidence development to experience the world at their own pace without being overwhelmed. Negative experiences during the can impact their behavioural development. Introducing new experiences — such as meeting people, encountering other dogs, and exposure to various noises and objects — should be gradual, controlled and occur when the puppy is relaxed. While we often discuss the lack of socialisation for dogs, but I have learned in my many years of this work that overexposure or flooding a puppy with stimuli for their well-being. A poorly socialised puppy may become fearful of new people, animals, environments and experiences. This can result in chronic anxiety and stress. For example, some have criticised the practice of repeatedly handling a pup over the course of a yoga class, and having the puppy passed from one person to the next. This is likely to create an aversion to people as well as an avoidance of handling. There’s a significant distinction between a puppy genuinely enjoying being handled and one that is merely tolerating it. Fear and insecurity can manifest as aggression towards people, or unfamiliar situations. Without proper and gentle socialisation, a puppy may struggle to cope with changes or unexpected events, leading to overreaction or avoidance behaviours. Other criticisms include concerns that a yoga class is long for a puppy. They have short attention spans and need lots of rest. Puppies need plenty of food and lots of undisturbed sleep. This is very difficult to achieve if they are participating in several classes in addition to being transported to and from a venue. So where do the pups come from for this yoga? Certainly, the UK investigation that the craze can be ‘a sort of marketing tool for puppy sales’ and lead to ‘irresponsible puppy sales’. The obvious fear is that unscrupulous breeders will step in. Responsible and compassionate breeders should never subject their young puppies to these environments if they aim for them to grow into confident and content adult dogs. I should make it clear, however, that puppy yoga is new to Ireland and there is no evidence of the involvement of any puppy farm animals. Regrettably, there are always irresponsible breeders who prioritise profit over the welfare of dogs, leading to numerous victims of illegal puppy farming each year. Last year, there was a record number of surrender requests, highlighting the urgency to stop supporting the unnecessary breeding of dogs. Puppy yoga only makes the breeding of pups that bit more attractive to those looking to make a quick buck. The answer is, “we don’t.” Instead, I would encourage anyone seeking positive interactions with puppies and dogs to volunteer with their local rescue centre, where teams work tirelessly to help animals in Ireland. There, you can walk a dog, transport a puppy, or simply lend a hand, knowing you’re aiding dogs rather than supporting puppy farmers and backyard breeders. While puppy yoga may appear harmless and enjoyable on the surface, a closer examination, particularly of experiences abroad, reveals numerous ethical, environmental and societal concerns. Yoga is a massively beneficial class to take in its own right, and there are some terrific studios offering amazing classes all around Ireland. I encourage you to do it for yourself without the need for an additional gimmick.",

Addressing an election rally in Kangra, Priyanka Gandhi said, “The BJP tries to topple the elected government with its money power. MLAs were being lured with Rs 100 crore offers each. The Prime Minister of the country has the responsibility of maintaining democracy and building morality. PM Modi asks for votes in the name of Gods and Goddesses.” She further said that government is working to reduce the import tax on the apples being imported from America but here taxes are being increased on the fruit. “Adani is deciding the prices of apples. Taxes are being reduced for the apples coming from America but here it is being increased. BJP government only wants to remain in power in the name of religion for the last 10 years and is using money power extensively to stay in power,” Priyanka Gandhi said. Regarding the Lok Sabha elections, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that in 2022, the people of Himachal Pradesh have elected a true and honest government. “Similarly, they should bring an honest government at the Center also”. Polling in all four seats in Himachal is scheduled for June 1. It will not only pit candidates vying for Lok Sabha membership from four seats but also elect members for six assembly seats that fell vacant following the resignation and switchover of dissident Congress lawmakers",

The strike took place in the Tal al-Sultan camp in western Rafah, where thousands of people were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground invasion of eastern Rafah three weeks ago. Residents say Israel told them they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas, although the IDF said the camp is outside the so-called humanitarian zone it declared earlier this month.

        "description": "Using some of the same technology found in America's Cup winning sailing vessels, marine tech company Vessev has launched a premium tourism electric hydrofoil ferry.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Vessev VS-9 electric hydrofoil. The 10-seater vessel is being tested and will go into commercial ... [+] service later this year through Fullers360 in New Zealand. Once an engineering program lead for the original Apple Watch, Eric Laakmann has morphed into a sort of ferry godfather, as CEO of marine tech company Vessev . With Laakman at the helm, The New Zealand-based company unveiled the VS-9, what it terms the “world’s first premium tourism electric hydrofoiling vessel,” on Monday. After an initial test period going on now out of Aukland, once certified later this year, Vessev expects the VS-9 to go into commercial service through Fullers360 , New Zealand’s largest ferry operator. “It’s our intention for Fullers360 to be 100% electric or hydrogen operated by 2040 and foiling is absolutely a part of that vision for us,” said Mike Horne, Fullers360 CEO, in a statement. The 29-foot long VS-9 can carry up to 10 passengers plus a skipper at a top speed of about 30 knots, or 34.5 miles per hour, with a cruising range of between 40-50 nautical miles, or 46-57 miles.

Unlike a conventional vessel floating on the water’s surface, a hydrofoil hovers just above the surface, typically providing a more comfortable ride since it’s not affected as much by pounding waves. In the case of the VS-9, the company touts construction of the actual foils as a key differentiator enhancing control and passenger comfort even further while improving energy consumption. The VS-9 uses what Vessev describes as ultra-high authority hydrofoil systems, where the foils change shape using high precision flaps under the water to optimize efficiency, based in part, on technology used in America’s Cup sailing vessels. Vessev worked with Fullers360 and the ferry operator’s “decarbonization” partner NetZeroMaritime to develop the VS-9. Eric Laakmann, CEO, marine technology company Vessev. “The ability to remove the foils from the water completely is a design element we’re particularly proud of. We were told it would be impractical, but we’ve delivered a system which makes it easy for operators to maintain pristine foils for maximum efficiency. To our knowledge, the VS 9 will be the only certified passenger electric hydrofoil in the world capable of this,” said Laakmann in a statement. The Vessev VS-9 is not the first electric hydrofoil to be used as a ferry. Tech startup Navier launched a hydrofoil transit program with financial platform company Stripe in ... [+] the San Francisco Bay Area to transport Stripe employees from Marin County to company headquarters in South San Francisco. This past March, San Francisco, Calif.-based startup Navier began providing a water taxi service using one of its high-speed electric, six-passenger, N30 hydrofoil boats to ferry employees of financial infrastructure platform company Stripe to and from Larkspur in Marin County to Oyster Point near the company’s South San Franciso headquarters, about 22 miles each way. The N30, however, is largely being marketed as a recreational vessel for private use. Acknowledging the fact there are what he termed a “handful” of recreational hydrofoiling electric vessels in the marketplace, Laakmann maintains in email responses to our questions, “there are no vessels of this type which have passed survey for use in commercial passenger applications. Laakmann bases Vassev’s claim to be the “first hydrofoiling tourism vessel to operate in the world” on both the VS-9’s features and the arrangement with Fullers360, explaining, “We will be the first in the world to certify a vessel of this type for passenger use in commercial applications (tourism and point to point marine services). The VS—9 will be the first electric hydrofoiling vessel to be operated in commercial service by a private operator (Fullers360).” Laakmann points out the VS-9 contains additional attributes for commercial use that include: · Full battery structural fire protection and safety systems. · Designs reviewed and approved by regulators (load cases, structural design, electric system, etc) · DNV-GL design standards. “Far more significant safety systems.” Several VS-9 have already been sold with a starting price of $620,000, according to Laakmann, declaring, “We are calling it the \"Rivian of the Sea,” referring to the U.S. brand of electric pickup trucks and SUVs. Vessev is now developing the 100-passenger capacity VS-18. Indeed, just as the auto industry is moving more towards electric vehicles to improve the environment and reduce fossil fuel consumption, the marine sector is following suit for certain boating segments, in particular, electric hydrofoils. “There are 33 million vessels in the world today with sustainable vessels representing the smallest fraction,” said Laakmann. “Through significant enhancements in efficiency, hydrofoiling will play a key role in this once-in-a-generation shift.” Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "content": "Expressing concerns over his weight loss, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that he filed a petition in the Supreme Court for the extension of his interim bail for seven more days as he might be facing some serious medical condition for which he needs time to get the medical tests done. The Supreme Court has granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal until June 1. Addressing a press conference in Bathinda, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “My weight has fallen a lot. If a person’s weight falls by 7 kg in a month without any reason, then it is a very serious problem. So the doctors have prescribed several tests. I have asked for 7 days so that I can get all my tests done within a week. There could be some serious disease going on inside. The doctors said that if all the tests are done, then at least we will know whether some serious disease is going on inside or not.” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking an extension on medical grounds of his interim bail by seven days in connection with the alleged liquor policy, the Aam Aadmi Party said on Monday. Kejriwal was released from Delhi’s Tihar Jail on May 10, 50 days after he was jailed on corruption charges linked to the alleged liquor policy scam and hours after the Supreme Court granted him bail until June 1. According to the party, the Delhi Chief Minister has lost 7 kilograms weight after his arrest and his ketone level is high which could signal some serious disease.The party further informed that the doctors had advised the AAP convenor to undergo a Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scan and some other medical tests due to which Kejriwal has sought the extension of his interim bail. After being released from jail, Kejriwal has been engaged in campaigning for the INDIA bloc for the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. Kejriwal was arrested by the Directorate of Enforcement in an excise policy case on March 21, days after the election schedule for the general elections was announced. The bail is applicable until June 1 and Kejriwal has to surrender to authorities on June 2. Arvind Kejriwal also accused Union Home Minister Amit Shah of threatening to topple the AAP government in Punjab after the Lok Sabha polls. “People of Punjab want to ask Amit Shah, what are your plans? We have 92 MLAs out of 117 whereas you have only 3. Will you send ED and CBI and try to bribe the people of Punjab? I want to tell the people of Punjab that if you want to receive free electricity then give all 13 seats to AAP,” he said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday targeted the Aam Aadmi Party for not living up to the promises assured to Punjab and criticised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for making the state a hub of corruption. Slamming the government of AAP, Amit Shah claimed that AAP is a government that is known for breaking promises. “This is the government of the AAP party, it is a government which breaks promises. Rs 1000 were not given to every mother and sister, Punjab was not made drug-free in a month, and 16 medical colleges were not opened up in the state,” Shah said. Punjab is witnessing a four-corner fight in the state. In Punjab, voting for its 13 seats will take place in a single phase, with the seventh and final phase on June 1 seeing voting in Gurudaspur, Amritsar, Khadoor Sahib, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Nandpur Sahib, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Faridkot, Firozpur, Bathinda, Sangrur, and Patiala constituencies",

        "description": "The Super Bowl champ showed off his buff physique while enjoying some holiday fun with two of his kids.",
        "content": "Tom Brady is ready to kick off summer. On Monday, the retired NFL star shared a video on Instagram featuring him enjoying some splashy good times with two of his kids, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11 , whom he shares with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. “You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!☀️🇺🇸🏄‍♂️,” he captioned the clip, which was overlapped with Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s “I Had Some Help.” In it, the 46-year-old showed off his buff physique while driving a speedboat, jet-skiing and wakeboarding. His kids also joined in on the fun as they went tubing. The outing comes on the heels of Brady’s Netflix roast that poked fun at his personal life. The Super Bowl champ — who also has a son, Jack, 16 , with ex-Bridget Moynahan — admitted he “didn’t like” how his kids were “affected” by jokes made about his exes. “I loved when the jokes were about me,” he shared on “The Pivot” podcast. “I thought they were so fun. I didn’t like the way that affected my kids.” Brady shared that he initially signed up for the roast because he didn’t mind jokes being made at his expense but confessed he hadn’t thought the decision through. “It’s the hardest part about like, the bittersweet aspect of when you do something that you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize, ‘I wouldn’t do that again,’ because of the way that affected actually the people that I care about the most in the world,” he explained. “So it makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you’re naive you don’t know or you get a little like, ‘Oh s–t!’” During the roast, comedian Nikki Glaser made fun of Brady for breaking up with Moynihan while she was pregnant with their son. And Kevin Hart teased the Patriots player about his ex-wife, Bündchen, and her new romance with her jiu-jitsu trainer, Joaquim Valente. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Page Six exclusively reported that the Brazilian model, 43, felt hurt because Brady “once again put football before his family” during his comedy roast. And, Moynahan, 53, shared cryptic messages on social media about being “kind” and “loyal.” Glaser then clapped back at Brady’s comments , saying it’s “impossible” he didn’t know what would happen during the roast. “I also think Tom Brady does not do anything without doing his research and knowing exactly what he’s getting into,” Glaser, 39, claimed on the “Today” show. Following the drama, Brady paid tribute to the “Blue Bloods” actress, Bündchen and his mom in a sweet Mother’s Day post . “Happy Mothers Day to these kind, caring, compassionate and POWERFUL moms that I’m lucky to have in my life. None of this would be possible without your love ❤️❤️❤️,” he captioned the post.",

        "content": "LAGU Garuda Pancasila merupakan salah satu lagu yang dikumandangkan dalam perayaan Hari Lahir yang jatuh pada 1 Juni. Selain itu, lagu Garuda Pancasila sering kali dinyanyikan di upacara pengibaran bendera. Garuda Pancasila diciptakan oleh Prohar Sudharnoto yang saat itu merupakan kepala seksi musik di RRI pada 1956. Sebelumnya lagu itu diberi judul Mars Pancasila lalu diganti dengan Garuda Pancasila untuk menggambarkan lambang Pancasila, yaitu burung garuda. Lagu Garuda Pancasila diciptakan untuk menggambarkan Pancasila dalam bentuk seni dengan menumbuhkan rasa cinta Tanah Air dan semangat persatuan melalui lagu. Ini karena lagu merupakan bahasa universal, bahasa rakyat. Saat itu masyarakat tidak akan bisa menyatakan Pancasila dengan terang terangan pada saat upacara. Kehadiran lagu Garuda Pancasila bisa menanamkan dasar negara di hati rakyat dengan media yang disukai oleh seluruh orang. (OL-14)",
