        "content": "Connection K-drama Actor Ji-Sung on Facing a Health Scare During Filming By SBS’s upcoming K-drama Connection aired on May 24, 2024. The crime thriller, which stars Ji Sung, Jeon Mi-Do, and others in the lead, was highly anticipated. There’s buzz regarding his complicated character, and now, at the production presentation for SBS, the actor talked about it. The drama’s storyline revolves around an ace detective, Jae Jang-Kyung, of the Narcotics team. However, after being kidnapped, he starts to take drugs and becomes an addict himself. On the other hand, Jeon Mi-Do plays an upright reporter. Every character in the drama has a connection to each other. What happens when one of their friends dies, leaving 5 billion won in insurance money? How the characters make their way to solve the case while maintaining their friendships is what makes the rest of the narrative. Connection K-drama star Ji-Sung faced a health scare while filming On May 24, 2024, the production presentation of Connection was held at SBS Hall in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul. There, Ji Sung opened up how he prepared for his drug-addicted character. He said, as reported in , “It was difficult to predict before filming. While filming, I felt that I was more mature and had a different energy. You will be able to see it on the screen.” He further explained how he almost faced a health scare while filming as he lost a few kgs to shoot this drama. He said, “I gained up to 85kg while raising children. I lost 15kg and started filming at 70kg.” Ji Sung further continued, “Although I lost a lot of stamina and suffered severe aftereffects, I tried to sublimate it through acting. As I was acting, I had to do another act. I was mind-controlled. He added, “I acted out the confusing battle between me trying to overcome drugs and me trying to enjoy my drug addiction. I tried to breathe in rather than out. At times, I hyperventilated and felt like I was going to collapse for a moment, but no one noticed.” Ji Sung then explained that he then decided to act slowly. He said, “It was dangerous to act while using my body like this, so I thought, ‘Let’s do it in moderation.’” You can watch Connection on .

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had a close call on Monday when a portion of the stage for one of his election rallies in Bihar collapsed. Gandhi was in Paliganj, on the outskirts of the state capital, to campaign for RJD president Lalu Prasad's daughter Misa Bharti, a candidate for the Patliputra Lok Sabha seat. Bharti was guiding Gandhi to his seat when he was observed battling with balance as a section of the makeshift stage fell. An alert Bharti instantly grabbed Gandhi's hand and helped him regain his balance, and they smiled as they assured frightened security staff who ran to help that the Congress leader was alright. VIDEO | A portion of the stage set for Rahul Gandhi's rally in Bihar's Paliganj collapsed as the Congress MP arrived with other party leaders. #LSPolls2024WithPTI #LokSabhaElections2024 pic.twitter.com/lDeQjTUnq6 — Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) May 27, 2024 Here's What Rahul Said In Back-To-Back Rallies In Bihar Rahul Gandhi said on Monday that if elected, the INDIA alliance would end the Agnipath plan for recruitment in the defence services and deposit Rs 8,500 in women's accounts each month. Addressing back-to-back election rallies in Bakhtiyarpur (Patna Lok Sabha seat), Paliganj (Patliputra Lok Sabha seat), and Jagdishpur (Arrah) in Bihar, he claimed that Narendra Modi will be unable to become prime minister again due to a \"storm\" in favour of the INDIA bloc across the country. \"There is a definite storm (toofan) in favour of the INDIA bloc throughout the country, including Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Narendra Modi will not be India's prime minister after June 4, he declared. \"When the INDIA bloc forms the government, the Agnipath scheme will be withdrawn,\" Gandhi stated at the Bakhtiyarpur rally. The initiative, proposed by the Narendra Modi government in 2022, envisages recruiting young troops, known as 'Agniveers' after appointment, on a contractual basis for four years and retiring 75% of them without the advantages enjoyed by those who were not engaged under this programme. \"If elected, the INDIA coalition will abandon the Agnipath proposal. Modi ji has converted soldiers into workers. The Centre has divided the Army into two categories: Agniveer and Others. If an Agniveer is harmed or martyred, he will not receive martyr status or compensation. \"Why is this discrimination?\" Gandhi spoke. The policy, launched by the Narendra Modi government in 2022, envisions recruiting young troops, known as 'Agniveers' after appointment, on a contractual basis for four years and retiring 75% of them without certain advantages enjoyed by those not hired under this programme. \"If the INDIA alliance wins power, the Agnipath scheme would be abandoned. Modi ji has transformed soldiers into labourers. The Centre has divided the Army into two categories: Agniveer and others. If an Agniveer is harmed or martyred, he will not receive either martyr status or compensation. Why is there discrimination? Gandhi stated. \"He (Modi) calls him a true patriot but he insulted jawans by implementing the Agnipath scheme,\" claimed Gandhi. Taking a shot at the prime minister's'sent by God' remark, the Congress leader said, \"After June 4, if ED asks Modi about corruption, he will say I don't know anything... I was told by God to do this.\" This is why he invented this story: he claims to be a divine messenger rather than a biological being. Did God send him to serve the billionaires?\" \"He (the Prime Minister) has devised tactics to deflect people's attention away from serious issues. Gandhi stated, \"Sometimes he talks about crocodile attacks, and sometimes he starts walking on the Ganga.\" Gandhi saidthat Modi had generated 22 billionaires, whereas the INDIA bloc government will generate crores of 'lakhpatis'. While Congress leader Anshul Avijit is running for Patna Sahib Lok Sabha, RJD leader Misa Bharti is the Mahagathbandhan nominee for Pataliputra parliamentary constituency. Sudama Prasad, the sitting CPI (M-L) Liberation MLA from Tararai, is the Mahagathbandhan's nominee for the Arrah Lok Sabha seat. On June 1, the final phase of voting will be held in the Lok Sabha constituencies of Sasaram, Nalanda, Patna Sahib, Pataliputra, Arrah, Buxar, Karakat, and Jehanabad.",

New Delhi: A heat wave will sweep across most of the states in the country in June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast on Monday. \"Above-normal monthly maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country in June, except many parts of the southern peninsular India, where normal to below-normal temperatures are most likely,\" the IMD said. Above-normal heat wave days are likely over most parts of northwest India and adjoining areas of central India during the next month, the IMD forecast states. Above-normal monthly minimum temperatures are also likely across most parts of the country in June, except for the extreme northern parts of northwest India and a few pockets of east and northeast India, where normal to below-normal minimum temperatures are most likely, the IMD said. The IMD has also warned that during heat waves, vulnerable populations, like the elderly and those with health conditions, face risks of heat-related illnesses. Prolonged extreme heat strains infrastructure and leads to dehydration. Authorities must act proactively by opening cooling centres, issuing advisories, and reducing urban heat islands. These steps are crucial for protecting public health during heat waves. One has to stay hydrated, remain in an optimally cool environment, and avoid strenuous activities during peak heat hours to stay safe during heat waves.",

        "content": "Wireless technology is all the rage these days, with many newer smartphones not even coming with an audio jack, so companies are putting a lot of time and effort into perfecting their headphone and earphone range. The latest addition to the award-winning Sony 1000X range are the WF-1000XM5 earphones, which boast the best noise cancelling and immersive sound as well as the best ever call quality. After using the earphones for a few weeks which have included some plane journeys, we put the XM5s to the test to see if these qualities are in fact accurate. In addition to the wireless trend, noise cancelling is a much sought-after feature in sound technology these days, with distraction-free listening being high on many consumers’ lists. What impressed us most about the earphones wasn’t how much it blocked out, but rather how much clear sound it could let in when required. One of the frustrating things about noise-cancelling earphones and headphones is that you do need to actually listen to what’s going on around you, and often can be fiddly to change. With the 1000XM5, a simple tap of the left earbud would turn the noise cancelling off and the sound coming through the real-time audio processors and mics was as clear as if you didn’t have them in your ear at all. This is in part thanks to the fact they have three mics on each earbud, including dual feedback mics, and hence, the sound being fed through the buds is more accurate. Also, if you’re in the habit of removing an earbud to hear what someone is saying to you, the noise cancelling shuts off automatically, ensuring that you can hear what you’re trying to listen to without the music still playing in the background. This is also in place when placing the earbuds in your ears to begin with, with the noise cancelling not activating until the second one has been placed. As for the noise cancelling itself, it is truly remarkable. Having travelled on a propellor plane recently, it was expected that some sound would still sneak through, but surprisingly, they were perfectly capable of filtering out the sound, even on low(ish) volume. The impressive nature of the earphones isn’t just limited to their ability to listen to music or videos on your phone, but also when making calls or sending voice notes. While some mics in earbuds don’t pick up what you are saying as well as a directional mic would, WF-1000XM5 is an exception as they can pick up what you’re saying as clearly as if you were holding the phone up to your mouth. According to the technical specs of the earphones, this is thanks to the AI-based noise reduction algorithm based on Deep Neutral Network (DNN) which processes bone conduction sensors. This means your voice will come through more naturally, even in a noisy environment or if outdoors, the wind noise reduction structure minimises any wind noise as well. As for some of the other factors you look at when buying a pair of new earphones, the Sony WF-1000XM5s are comfortable to wear, with different-sized earbuds to ensure they fit you, are easy to use and are nicely designed. They also have up to eight hours of battery life, utilising the charging ability of the case as well as holding their own charge well, and are water resistant too, so if you’re wearing them to work out, sweat won’t affect their performance. If that wasn’t enough, the earphones are also good for the environment, with the WF-1000XM5 using recycled plastic materials, and adopting Sony’s proprietary paper Original Blended Material (an environmentally conscious paper material made from bamboo, sugarcane fibres, and post-consumer recycled paper) for the packaging.",

        "description": "KEIR STARMER has been slammed by the SNP for refusing to rule out raising university tuition fees...",
        "content": "In his first major speech of the campaign, the Labour leader sought to persuade voters that he could be trusted to deliver economic stability and protect national security. But speaking to journalists afterwards, Starmer also refused to scrap or rule out raising university tuition fees – and claimed \"there needs to be change\". Instead, Starmer said he is prioritising the NHS. READ MORE: SNP will stand 'shoulder-to-shoulder' with Waspi women, says John Swinney \"We have done the sums, we can't have both. That is the political choice Labour is offering the electorate,” he added. To note, Starmer previously supported scrapping tuition fees when running to be Labour leader. The comments come as analysis commissioned by the SNP indicates that, since the Labour Party first introduced university tuition fees in 1998, the cost of student debt in England has soared. In 2000, the average loan debt for students graduating in England was £2690 but by 2022, that had risen to £44,730 - an increase of over 16. In 2022, the average student debt in Scotland was 67% lower than in England at £14,770. The SNP's education spokesperson and candidate for Glasgow West, Carol Monaghan, said Starmer must “come clean and admit he's planning to increase university tuition fees”. \"This growing Westminster threat to students shows why it's essential to vote SNP to defend free university tuition and put the interests of Scotland first,” the MP said. \"With the Tories and Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party both saddling students with sky high debts, it's only the SNP that are standing up for young people and their families.” She added: \"It's no surprise that more and more young people are finding it impossible to buy a house or start a family when they are swimming in debt imposed on them by Westminster. \"At the general election, the SNP is the only party that will protect students and defend free education, which has left graduates in Scotland thousands of pounds better off. A vote for the SNP is a vote to always put Scotland's interests first.\" In his speech, Starmer also said that 14 years of Conservative “chaos” had led to a “crisis” in the national culture. Speaking in Tory-held Lancing, West Sussex, he said: “Elections are about more than individual changes and policies, but about values, temperament, character and a bigger question: whose side are you on? “Who do you hold in your mind’s eye when you are making decisions? “Everything I have fought for has been shaped by my life, every change I have made to this party has been about a cause, the answer to that question, the only answer: The working people of this country delivering on their aspirations, earning their respect, serving their interests.” He also acknowledged that despite Labour’s commanding opinion poll lead, many voters were not fully persuaded about his party. “I know there are countless people who haven’t decided how they’ll vote in this election. They’re fed-up with the failure, chaos and division of the Tories, but they still have questions about us: has Labour changed enough? Do I trust them with my money, our borders, our security? “My answer is yes, you can, because I have changed this party, permanently.” Starmer dismissed Rishi Sunak’s plan for a new form of compulsory national service as a “teenage Dad’s Army”. He said the policy would be “paid for by cancelling levelling-up funding and money from tax avoidance that we would use to invest in our NHS”. “All elections are a choice and this is a clear one: levelling-up and the NHS with Labour or more desperate chaos with the Tories.”",

In a country where legspinner hardly could thrive for a longer period, Rishad has already showcased his talent to be the big thing. Also his batting is a plus point for the country as he has the ability to play big shots at the death overs. The 21-year old, so far, has claimed 15 wickets in 17 T20I games at an economy rate of slightly above seven. After playing just seven T20I innings, he had already hit a half-century and possess a strike rate of over 135, which is eye-popping given the other players strike rate. Rishad, however, said that he has the self-belief that enables him to hit big sixes at will. \"Every batter wants to hit big shots and I'm no exception. It is imperative to have faith in yourself to hit sixes. I just try my best, I don't do anything special. I don't look at the bowler or anything else, I just take it ball by ball.\" EM",

        "content": "Residents of the coastal village of Chellanam have decided to protest against what they called failure of the government to keep its promise to complete the first phase of the tetrapod wall project for coastal protection. The government had sanctioned completion of around 10 km of tetrapod wall along the coast, but the work has been completed only for 7.33 km so far. Coastal residents under the aegis of Chellanm-Fort Kochi Janakiya Vedi has called for suggestions on a possible mode of protest on June 9 because, they claimed, it was exactly a year since Minister for Water Resources Roshy Augustine promised the residents that fund for the second phase of the tetrapod wall project from Puthenthode would be sanctioned, and that work would be launched in November 2023. The Minister at that time was on a visit to the coastal village, and the announcement on the completion of the tetrapod wall project was made at Puthenthode, near Kannamaly. He was on the coast to review the work done on the tetrapod wall. A spokesman for the Janakiya Vedi said the Minister had told the residents that the second phase would require ₹320 crore, and that the fund would be sanctioned by the government at the earliest. The work was to start in November 2023. The promise was repeated later in October 2023 when the authorities promised that ₹247 crore had been sanctioned for the sea protection wall, claimed the spokesperson. The group has also invited suggestions from the coastal residents to record their protest against the government failure.

        "description": "Despite its minimalistic modern logo, Dairy Queen has had a few questionable mascots over the years, including an extra spooky one that we're glad is gone.",
        "content": "Fast-food mascots are a diverse bunch that have included Chihuahuas (Taco Bell), anthropomorphic purple taste buds (McDonald's), singing rats (Chuck E. Cheese), and diminutive versions of Roman figures (Little Caesars). The pantheon of mascots also included quite a few clowns, most notably Ronald McDonald (and here's , in case you were curious). Like McDonald's, Dairy Queen also used a clown to advertise its cold treats, although it doesn't appear that the chain's Curly the Clown had as much staying power as Ronald (though Curly came first). Not much is known about this mysterious, slightly off-putting clown, other than the fact that a small number of Curly signs were installed in front of select Dairy Queens at some point during the mid-20 century. One of these relics persisted until recently, when Dairy Queen corporate requested that a Shelbyville, Indiana, location remove its Curly the Clown signage from the premises. The sign had been standing tall for over six decades, and featured Curly in all his green-haired glory. It's also claimed that this signage is the last remaining depiction of Curly at Dairy Queen locations, which are now mostly identified by signs featuring the letters DQ in white over a red background and accented by orange and blue swooshes. From cursed clown to problematic stereotype While not everyone's cup of tea, clowns are relatively harmless (unless you're one of the few people who suffer from coulrophobia, aka a fear of clowns). However, Dairy Queen's next mascot did not present the wholesome image the chain was hoping for. Dubbed \"the Eskimo girl\" or \"the Eskimo baby\" by many customers, this signage featured a smiling girl or baby in a parka enjoying a sweet treat. Unfortunately, it also presented an offensive stereotype of an Indigenous person, complete with the use of a problematic term that many find harmful. As reported by , \"Eskimo\" is derived from the Ojibwe language, but its associations with stereotypical and racist views of Indigenous people have caused the word to fall out of favor. To avoid offense, many companies that had previously used the term for marketing purposes have ceased doing so (such as Edy's Pie, which is one of many ). Despite these issues, some Dairy Queen locations, including one in West Virginia, continued to use the signage. Perhaps in an effort to avoid making people uncomfortable and potentially causing offense, Dairy Queen branding has steered away from off-putting clowns and stereotypes in recent years. There's more than meets the eye in the modern Dairy Queen logo These days, Dairy Queen relies on relatively simple signage, as compared to its previous experiments with mascots. However, the colors present in the logo actually communicate some interesting bits of information about the chain. The red background is said to replicate lips, which is exemplified by its decidedly lip-like shape. As for the colorful swooshes on the top and bottom of the signage, the orange coloring is an homage to the chain's hot menu items, while the blue swoosh pays tribute to its cool desserts such as frosty ice cream. Dairy Queen is most beloved for its sweet, creamy treats (such as ), but most locations also sell hot food. Although the chain first got its start in 1940, Dairy Queen didn't begin selling hot items until the 1950s. These days, most locations feature a good selection of food, including burgers, fries, and chicken fingers. It's all part of the evolution of Dairy Queen, as is the extended demise of a questionable clown named Curly.",

A special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai asked whether the civic body sat over the fire safety orders passed earlier on a PIL for 18 months. Also Read Prajwal Revanna says he will appear before SIT May 31 2 hours ago India’s rain-fed agri areas likely to receive above-normal monsoon rain this year 2 hours ago The HC was hearing a suo motu PIL on the TRP game zone fire tragedy which occurred on May 25. A day earlier, the HC termed the incident a prima facie “man-made disaster”. The bench asked whether the civic body had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity after its lawyer submitted that the TRP Game Zone had not asked for requisite permissions. The bench noted that all commissioners of the Rajkot municipal corporation from the time the TRP game zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) “should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred,” and directed them to furnish separate affidavits. On Monday, a counsel pointed out the state government will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps. “Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,” the bench said. To the RMC counsel’s submission that the game zone had not applied for requisite permissions, the HC asked whether the civic body was blind to such a big structure having come up under its jurisdiction. “You were blind to that...this big structure existed, you were not aware of it? What is the corporation’s explanation that the whole zone existed for the last two-and-a-half years? What fire safety did they apply for? When ticketing was done, were you aware of the entertainment tax? So we take it that you are completely turning a blind eye to the whole issue?,” the bench asked. The HC also wanted to know as to when the corporation first recognised the existence of the game zone. “Till then you were completely ignorant of such a structure in the vicinity? Were you not aware of the orders of this court for fire safety (passed) in a PIL? What were you doing then? There are media reports that your municipal commissioner went there at the time of the inauguration. We can’t take judicial notice of that fact? For 18 months, what did the corporation do? Sat over it?” the bench asked. The court noted the game zone was conceptualised in 2021 and continued to operate till May 5, 2024, for over a period of three years, admitted without a fire NOC or any other requisite permissions. On May 9, 2024, the corporation wrote to the owners to furnish fire NOC, it stated in the order. The question is “inaction of the authorities in even inspecting the site in light of the regulations,” it said and questioned why the civic body didn’t inquire about the legality of the structures for 3 years since June 2021. “On the date when the incident occurred, the game zone did not have NOCs or structural stability certificate, and it was merrily going on in front of the corporation,” the bench stated. Owners of the TRP Game Zone created a fabricated steel frame structure with the boundaries of steel patras, the HC said. It did not have a fire NOC and structural stability certificate, and was asked to provide the same in order to get the benefit of regularisation, the court noted. “The facts itself are eloquent, therefore, to indicate that the game zone at Rajkot was conceptualised, set up and continued to operate under the very nose of the corporation’s officials without the requisite permissions,” it observed in its order. We refrain at this stage from passing any orders, though we would certainly desire to, to suggest that the officers in question be suspended for dereliction of duty and non-compliance with the direction of this court. We do not do so with the hope to give them a chance, the bench added. The bench said the structures set up by the game zone operator cannot be branded as “temporary structures.” The bench stated even the police department has “a lot to answer ‘ for allowing the game zone to operate in the vicinity of a local police station with fire NOC permission and directed the Rajkot Police Commissioner to file an affidavit. The bench noted that the AMC, SMC, and VMC swung into action “in a typical knee-jerk reaction” after the Rajkot incident and inspected such entertainment zones. “It was most unfortunate that they acted only after the death of innocent children and young ones,” the bench stated. The HC asked whether the SIT formed by the state will “sufficiently assuage the sentiments of the families who have repeatedly lost their kith and kin in these tragedies which have obviously been man-made.” PTI Tags: Fire accident Gujarat Gujarat HC Rajkot Share Tweet Send Share Suggest A Correction Enter your email to get our daily news in your inbox.

        "content": "David Ormandy, who has died aged 78, was responsible as much as anyone for the adoption 20 years ago of the housing health and safety rating system (HHSRS), a legal method of assessing housing conditions in England and Wales. Co-designed by Ormandy and introduced by the 2004 Housing Act, it shifted the assessment of fitness away from the condition of the property itself and more on to the effects of poor housing on residents’ health – which costs the NHS £1.4bn a year. It puts a duty on local authorities to deal with dangerous and unhealthy housing conditions including damp and condensation. Its use has reaped significant health benefits for tenants. In Liverpool, for example, since the legislation came in, 6,000 HHSRS inspections have led to the removal of more than 4,400 serious hazards, yielding more than £5m in investment by private landlords and benefitting more than 47,000 tenants. Starting out as a public health inspector in Leicester , Ormandy later developed the HHSRS with others, including Professor Roger Burridge, at Warwick University. Since 2004 HHSRS has won attention overseas: the US has adopted it, and Ormandy later helped develop housing-health indicators for the World Health Organisation, while also advising the French and New Zealand governments. Born in York, David was the son of Molly (nee Sowray) and Arthur Ormandy, a lighthouse lens maker. He lived his early years, fittingly, in New Earswick, the model village on the edge of the city built as a response to slum housing by the Quaker philanthropist Joseph Rowntree. When the family moved to Kent he attended the farm school attached to Wilmington Hall school in Dartford. From there he joined Leicester city council as a pupil public health inspector, qualifying in October 1966. He moved to east London in 1969 to work for the London borough of Newham. Bearded, long-haired and plugged into the 1970s counterculture, he was an early adopter of the single earring for men, favoured blue prison-issue shirts, smoked Gauloises Blue, lived on a narrowboat and drove a series of high-powered sports cars. He knitted Guernsey sweaters on noisy wooden needles – once during a Shelter National Housing Aid Trust board meeting to express his disapproval of a speaker’s contribution. When told by his Newham boss he was improperly dressed for his work, he turned up the next day wearing a bowler hat and bow tie. He resigned from his post there in 1974, frustrated that he was unable to take action over damp and unfit housing owned by the council itself. With a grant from Shelter, Ormandy set up the Public Health Advisory Service (PHAS) in the same year to take action against local authorities (and other landlords) on behalf of tenants living in unfit and unhealthy conditions. His first successful legal case was against Salford metropolitan district council in 1975, when he convinced a court that an obscure power in the 1936 Public Health Act, designed to stop the playing of bugles at 3am and other nuisances prejudicial to health, could be applied to poor housing conditions. In London he worked closely with the North Kensington Law Centre solicitor Hilary Fassnidge, who later became an in-house solicitor for PHAS. Together they persuaded magistrates to legally declare houses as unfit for human occupation – thus putting the onus on the local authorities to re-house the tenants. PHAS also supported community groups and tenants’ associations through a wall chart, a series of practice notes and a booklet, How to Inspect a House, all written by Ormandy. Tenants often used these in court, along with independent public health inspectors providing professional evidence to support solicitors. During this time Ormandy also advised the activist Erin Pizzey on housing standards in the first women’s refuge in England, and supported a group of hippies, the Tipi People, when a local authority tried to shut down their camp in the Black Mountains of Wales on public health grounds. He also gave legal help to the Ruff Tuff Cream Puff “squatting estate agency”, which helped homeless people to occupy the thousands of London homes that stood empty during the 70s. After PHAS closed through lack of funding in 1977, Ormandy worked at the Newham Rights Centre with Burridge and Fassnidge. Between them they addressed a multitude of housing problems in east London through campaigning and casework, with a number of key decisions entering legal casebooks as a result of their work. He later teamed up again with Burridge, by now a professor in the Warwick University law school, to undertake a series of housing research projects funded by the Department of the Environment and the Nuffield Foundation, work that eventually led to the adoption of the HHSRS. He joined the law school full time in 1996, becoming a visiting professor in 2021. Shortly before his death he produced a highly critical review of proposals for Awaab’s law , drawn up in response to the death in 2020 of two-year-old Awaab Ishah in Rochdale as the result of exposure to mould in his home. The proposals, he argued, seemed more concerned with examining a social landlord’s complaints procedure than with dealing with hazardous conditions, “thus confirming the general contempt for tenants” that he had fought against all his working life. He is survived by his partner, Penny Wiles, a son and a daughter, two grandchildren, and his brother John. David Ormandy, public health inspector, born 15 September 1945; died 11 April 2024",

        "content": "Ella Toone has revealed she was once on the receiving end of some lighthearted Sir Alex Ferguson hairdryer treatment. The childhood Manchester United fan-turned Red Devils midfielder grew up being in awe of the legendary Scot, who managed the club's men's team from 1986 to 2013. She's got to meet the club's most successful boss a number of times during her career, being left starstruck every single time. Now, Toone has opened up on just how special it is to meet him, revealing a hilarious interaction between them that shows Ferguson hasn't changed one bit from his managerial days. \"I’ve met Alex Ferguson now a few times,\" she said on The Tooney and Russo Show that she stars on with Lionesses teammate, Alessia Russo . \"Every time I speak to him, I’m just in awe. \"I grew up watching his Manchester United team. He won everything and was just what made my fall in love with Manchester United as a club. \"To now have times where I’ve sat next to him at games, I’ve spoken to him a few times, and I’m just like ‘wow, you are an amazing man’. \"He actually came in and spoke to us before we played Arsenal at the Emirates. We were all sat there like this (mouth open).\" Ferguson was known for his 'hairdryer treatment' during his days at Old Trafford, with him angrily reprimanding his players in the dressing room on plenty of occasions. And one time Toone sat in the stands with Fergie, he jokingly told her off too. \"Then I went to one of the games and actually was sat in front of him,\" she said. \"He was talking to me and then I came back out for the second-half and I was a couple of minutes late and he was like ‘you’re late Mrs Toone!’ \"I was like ‘I’m sorry!’ He’s such a nice person and someone who every time he speaks, you just want to listen to every word that he has to say.\" As well as winning Euro 2022 and reaching the 2023 World Cup final with England, Toone has also won the FA Cup, with Marc Skinner's side seeing off Tottenham 4-0 earlier this month. She spent seven years with the Reds’ youth teams before returning, via spells at Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City , in 2018 following the creation of the women's team.",

        "content": "Naruto Shippuden: What is Kotoamatsukami? By The great Dojutsu of the Uchiha Clan, , ascends to a higher level called the . An individual can only acquire these sets of eyes when subjected to intense emotions. The Mangekyou Sharingan bestows every user with a unique set of abilities. Its powers are beyond normal comprehension, as they’re complex and devastating. One of the most dangerous abilities of the Mangekyou Sharingan belonged to Shisui Uchiha, Kotoamatsukami. What was Shisui Uchiha’s Kotoamatsukami in Naruto Shippuden? Shisui Uchiha’s Mangekyou Sharingan possessed an extremely powerful ability called the Kotoamatsukami. This Genjutsu differs from others in that the user doesn’t need to look in the eyes of their target to manipulate them. Kotoamatsukami activates as soon as the user can see the target. This power was first demonstrated in Chapter 524 of the manga and Episode 266 of Naruto Shippuden. Danzo used this to overwhelm Mifune despite his eyes being bandaged. This ability allows the user to manipulate every action of their target. These include voluntary and involuntary actions, which makes this ability terrifying. How powerful was Kotoamatsukami? Shisui Uchihas MS • Kotoamatsukami [Right Eye] Places opponent under a suggestive genjutsu, making them think their thoughts are their own. Nigh imperceptible because of this. Usable once a day with Hashirama cells,Cooldown may vary with shisui himself. The basic anatomy of Kotoamatsukami differs from that of other Genjutsu, which is why it is undeniably one of the most influential Genjutsu in . Other Genjutsu allow the user to trap their target but don’t grant control over their free will and thoughts. This makes Kotoamatsukami a flexible technique that can wreak havoc if used with malicious intent. This technique can control the target’s mind and make them give up on their thinking ability. Kotoamatsukami can be used for several purposes, such as creating an enemy to sabotage their plans or assassinating someone through self-harm. This ability is so potent that Shisui Uchiha planned to use it against Fugaku Uchiha during the Uchiha Clan coup d’état. This would have resulted in Fugaku giving up on the rebellion. The fact that Kotoamatsukami could be cast upon one of the strongest Uchiha ‌speaks volumes about the power level of this ability. This technique also helped Itachi to break free from Kabuto’s Edo Tensei. Despite holding a degree in Chemistry Majors, Archak found himself as a Journalist. His love for anime and choccy milk is unmatched! When not writing, Archak can be found indulging with motorcycles. After all, four wheels move the body but two wheels move the soul!

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough the name is not official yet, here are three possible Melinda French Gates Foundation stock picks.The post 3 Stocks the Melinda French Gates Foundation Should Buy in June appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "If you do an internet search for “Melinda French Gates Foundation stock picks,” you won’t find anything besides results about the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. That’s likely to change in the months ahead. A couple of weeks ago, Melinda French Gates announced that she was leaving the foundation she and her now ex-husband started in 2000. Now that they’ve gone their separate ways, the foundation will be known as the Gates Foundation. “Ms. French Gates will get $12.5 billion in resources to direct toward her philanthropic work. In a statement, she said she would use the money she was leaving with to ‘commit to my work on behalf of women and families,’” the New York Times reported. That’s a good amount to invest to generate future income for her yet-unnamed foundation or philanthropic entity. However, she does have Pivotal Ventures in Kirkland, Washington, a limited liability company “that can make grants to nonprofits as well as for-profit investments and engage in advocacy work,” the Times reported. One of Pivotal’s main focuses is investing in funds run by women. Assuming a Melinda French Gates Foundation comes to fruition, here are three publicly traded entrepreneurial companies run or started by women that might be attractive to such a foundation. BlackLine (BL) BlackLine (NASDAQ: BL ) is the largest of the three companies on my list with a market capitalization of $3.2 billion. The company was founded in 2001 by Therese Tucker, who remains co-CEO and one of its largest shareholders, with 7.73% of Blackline’s shares. Tucker took the company public in October 2016, selling 8.6 million shares at $17. “We have created a comprehensive cloud-based software platform designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable platform supports critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliation, intercompany accounting and controls assurance,” stated its IPO prospectus. When it went public in 2016, it had over 1,500 customers in 120 countries, and over 147,000 finance professionals used its software. Today, it has approximately 4,411 customers with 387,050 individual users, a 163% increase over eight years. The stock could use some love from the analysts. Of the 15 covering it, only three rate it a “buy,” with a target price that’s 22% higher than its current price. In 2024, it expects revenues of $645.5 million and a net income of $163 million. It will continue to deliver profitable growth. Figs (FIGS) Figs (NYSE: FIGS ) is the second-largest company on my list, with a market cap of $882 million. “FIGS, Inc. is a founder-led, direct-to-consumer healthcare apparel and lifestyle brand that seeks to celebrate, empower and serve current and future generations of healthcare professionals,” states the company’s investor relations page. The company was founded by two women, Heather Hasson , its executive chair, and Catherine Spear, its CEO, in 2013 . They noticed that 85% of healthcare workers were responsible for buying their scrubs. The worst part was that traditional retailers sold them in locations far from the hospitals where the healthcare workers plied their trade. “FIGS took the strategies of direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands and applied them to medical apparel, selling $48 uniform pants and $38 shirts. Now, the company says it has ‘de-commoditized a previously commoditized product,’ Fortune wrote in May 2021 when it went public. In 2023, it generated $546 million in revenue (doubled from 2020), $85 million in free cash flow, and a healthy 15.6% margin. Although the stock has lost 76% of its value since going public at $22 , it continues to generate double-digit revenue growth. It’s a diamond in the rough. Urban One (UONE) Urban One (NASDAQ: UONE ) is the smallest of the three companies, with a market cap of $83 million. It’s also the oldest, founded in 1980 by Cathy Hughes. Hughes served as the company’s CEO until 1997 when she became the chairperson of the board. She controls nearly 23% of the votes. The company is a radio broadcaster targeting Black listeners. It does this through 55 FM or AM stations , nine HD stations, and two low-power television stations. While the business is vital to American culture, it struggles to keep its head above water. On April 12, the company reported receiving a letter from Nasdaq stating that it didn’t comply with the stock exchange’s rules. Specifically, it hadn’t filed its 10-K promptly. To stay onside with the exchange, Urban One must submit a plan to regain compliance by June 7. If Nasdaq approves, it will have until Sept. 11 to do so. The company notified investors on May 10 that the delay was caused by “material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.” It is working to solve these weaknesses and file the 10-K. The latest 10-Q to be relied upon is Q3 2023 . The 10-Q says it had revenue of $357.3 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30, with an operating loss of $38.3 million. The loss is due to the impairment of its radio broadcasting licenses in 10 markets. Without the $124 million in non-cash impairment charges, it would have had an operating profit of $86 million through Q3. It could use a risk-tolerant investor like Melinda French Gates. On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com’s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.

Hundreds upon hundreds of bikes of all kinds, from choppers and trikes to sports bikes, vintage and exquisite custom jobs filled every square inch of the Quay that wasn’t already filled with people. **** All pictures courtesy of Graham Hobbs Photography **** There was a huge amount to see and do, with plenty of trade stands and food stalls plus a wide variety of live music, entertainment, stunt riding displays and activities in nearby Victoria Park. Above: Credit Graham Hobbs Organisers had previously announced the bike show – which has so far raised more than £55,000 for local and national charities – would see its 10th anniversary year being the final instalment. They said the difficult decision had been taken due to ever-increasing costs and ‘red tape’, which would have meant spending more money on hosting the show and giving less to charity. The show was founded in 2014 by motorcycle enthusiasts Lisa Elston and Michael Elston with Terry King and Marco Oliveira, to raise money for charity but also to promote local business and tourism in Bideford. Above: Bideford Bike Show founding members Marco Oliveira, Mike Elston, Lisa Elston and Terry King at the final show. Credit: Graham Hobbs In an emotional farewell, Lisa took to Facebook to thank everyone who had attended the event over the past 10 years and made it such a success. She thanked all the businesses of Bideford and beyond who had supported and sponsored the show, as well as Bideford Town Council for its support, plus all the hard work by the many marshals and volunteers who made it all happen. Lisa also thanked the many businesses and suppliers that had devoted their time and expertise, as well as the performers and entertainers who had been a part of the final show. She added: “A very big thank you to my committee, who all do an amazing job with the planning of the event and all the past members over the years who have all played a part in the success of the show. “To think all those years ago, when this was just an idea and expecting we hoped around 300 bikes - we were amazed how many turned out, there were bikes parked anywhere and everywhere we could fit them in. “The money we have raised has been astonishing for all the very worthy charities. It takes a lot of work and months of planning to put this event on and to know everyone enjoys the day and has come back year on year shows we are doing something right!” For more about the last show, visit the Bideford Bike Show Facebook page . *** See all the Bideford Bike Show pictures courtesy of Graham Hobbs in our online gallery above!",

        "content": "Lawyer and author Petina Gappah has withdrawn defamatory statements she made against Fadzayi Mahere concluding a legal battle that had dragged on for years. In 2018, Gappah alleged that Mahere got into the University of Zimbabwe through the help of her father in 2004 because she did not qualify and had attempted to snatch her lover. Gappah also claimed she helped Mahere get into Cambridge by editing her application essay in October 2009, among other allegations prompting a US$1 million lawsuit against her. Several of her attempts to block a trial failed. “In order to bring a conclusive end to the legal action, I hereby fully and unequivocally retract all the statements that I made about her, both on Twitter and in subsequent legal pleadings, and tender a full, public and unreserved apology to Advocate Mahere for any pain, hurt or distress that were caused by my statements. “I wish Advocate Mahere continued success in her political career, her career as a civil society activist and her career as an advocate. “As a demonstration of my good faith, sincerity and regret, I undertake to make a donation in Advocate Mahere’s name to the charity of her choice. “It is my sincere hope that this full retraction and apology brings finality and closure to this matter,” reads Gappah’s retraction. She also pledged to donate to a charity of Mahere’s choice. During her court appearances, Gappah had told the High Court that she was ready to defend her statements and had witnesses to this effect.",

        "description": "Pokemon Crystal was the first game to introduce gender options for the player character, but that made it a touch tricky to localise.The first question you're faced with in Pokemon Crystal is potentially a simple one: \"Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?\" Granted, that isn't exactly the easiest question for everyone, but Pokemon Crystal only gives you the two options, so the process is still simple overall. It's not something you'd think about much these days, but was a pretty big deal for video games back in the day. However, the original localiser behind the Pokemon games right from the original Red and Blue right through to Platinum, Nob Ogasawara, has shared a neat little behind the scenes look into the process of localising such a choice, which turned out to be a bit more difficult than you might first expect.Upon seeing the option, Ogasawara initially thought \"'Hot dang, this is progress. It opens up gaming to girls.' (Yeah, naive. I'm glad they've gotten better.)\" However, as he notes, \"reality sank in. There's no gender-specific text. No options for, 'What's [v1] doing here?' v1 = he, she.\" What Ogasawara means by that, is that because Japanese isn't a gendered language in the way English is, and doesn't have specific pronouns that change depending on gender, there wasn't anything programmed to make the player character's pronouns change automatically based on whether they choose boy or girl, because that wouldn't be the case in Japanese.

The landslide in Enga province , the government said earlier on Monday, as treacherous terrain impeded aid and lowered hopes of finding survivors. The Porgera mine is an underground gold mine jointly run by Barrick Gold, China’s Zijin Mining Group and stake holders from Papua New Guinea, according to Barrick website. The mine was re-started earlier this year after being in dispute for four years. Barrick in its statement said the Porgera gold mine is providing support to the survivors of the mountainside collapse, which happened 30 kilometres (18.64 miles) from its gold mine. Shares of Barrick Gold were trading up by 1 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday morning.",

        "description": "Catchphrase host Stephen Mulhern has opened up on his childhood growing up in London, where he would help his market trader father sell goods on the streets of the capital",
        "content": "Stephen Mulhern has revealed that he spent his childhood \"looking out for the police\" for his market trader father. The 47-year-old 'Catchphrase' host shared that he and his brothers would keep an eye out for the authorities while their dad sold goods on the streets of London, drawing a comparison between themselves and the characters from 'Only Fools and Horses', Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter and his younger brother Rodney. Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: \"My dad was a flypitcher on Petticoat Lane in east London. If you're not sure what a flypitcher is, my dad was Del Boy from 'Only Fools and Horses' and I was Rodney. We'd be up at the crack of dawn, with dad selling novelty toys or those slice-and-dice vegetable choppers me and my brothers looking out for the police.\" \"Dad would let me have a go on the stall, and that's where I learnt how to perform in front of the hardest kind of audience: real people.\" At the age of 11, Stephen developed a fascination with magic, which led him to become a Redcoat entertainer at Butlin's when he was 17. The 'Deal or No Deal' host emphasised that he \"didn't get into magic to be cool\", but rather because of his passion for it. He continued: \"Magic is still a huge part of my life. I do a season at Butlin's every summer, honing my magic skills. Even if I'm going shopping, I'll have a pack of cards in my pocket. And if someone stops for a chat or a selfie I'll try out a new trick.\" \"What with your David Blaines and your Dynamos, magic has acquired a certain amount of cool. But I didn't get into magic to be cool, I did it because I loved it.\" \"Other kids watched 'Match of the Day' and got into football, I watched Paul Daniels and decided to learn magic. And it was the magic that led me to be a Redcoat at Butlin's. It gave me a career.\"",

        "description": "With farmers rushing to buy agricultural inputs in anticipation of good rainfall, errant traders have been issued a warning",
        "content": "With farmers rushing to buy seeds and fertilisers in anticipation of good rainfall and reports about traders trying to create artificial shortage, Dharwad Deputy Commissioner Divya Prabhu G.R.J. has warned traders of cancelling their licence and filing criminal cases in such cases. In a press release here, she ruled out scarcity of seeds and fertilisers for the kharif season as the district administration has already taken the necessary steps to ensure stock. “Licence will be cancelled on the spot and criminal cases will be filed against shops owners for creating artificial shortage and indulging in black marketing,” she has warned. The Agriculture Department has set up 31 outlets (Raitha Sampark Kendras) to distribute sowing seeds and fertilisers to farmers and apart from this, there are around 500 traders selling seeds. However, if traders try to put riders on farmers for purchasing seeds and fertilsiers, they will be dealt with strictly, she has said. The average rainfall for the district during April and May is 91.9 mm. However, the district has recorded 120 mm rainfall till May 25. Compared to April, May has received a good rainfall of 71.1 mm against the normal rainfall of 50.5 mm. Consequently, the Agriculture Department has been directed to set up an additional 17 outlets to distribute seeds and fertilisers at subsidised rates. These outlets will function even on holidays. The Deputy Commissioner has said that if required, more centres will be set up. She has appealed to farmers not to pay heed to rumours of shortage of seeds and fertilisers. They can always approach the department if they find difficulties in getting the required quantity of seeds and fertilisers, she said. In order to check sale of spurious seeds and fertilisers, the department has collected 650 samples of seeds and 120 samples of fertilisers for quality checks. This apart, officials have been asked to visit the Raitha Sampark Kendras and monitor the seed and fertiliser distribution process. Sowing target The Department of Agriculture has set a target of 2.7 lakh hectares for kharif sowing. As per the department, there is a demand for 20,681 quintal of seeds and it has already procured 23,779 quintal seeds and distributed 2,399 quintals of seeds. While the demand for the season is 56,243 tonnes of fertilisers, so far, 14,321 tonnes of fertilisers have been sold. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

        "content": "President Javier Milei will travel to San Francisco this week before attending the inauguration of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in San Salvador on June 1. There, he will meet with SpaceX and Twitter CEO Elon Musk, along with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. It will be Milei’s fourth trip to the United States since assuming office and his second encounter with Musk this month. A presidential committee will depart for California on Tuesday night. Milei aims to draw investment from Silicon Valley and further the development of artificial intelligence in Argentina. The Argentine president also plans to meet with representatives from Open AI, Apple, and Google Alphabet, among other industry representatives. Milei previously signaled that he would be making the trip when he endorsed a tweet from a popular libertarian account confirming separate sitdowns with Zuckerberg and Musk. He is not currently scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden or officials from his administration. In April, Milei met with Musk at the latter’s Tesla factory in Austin, Texas, where the pair agreed to organize a “large event” in Argentina to “promote the ideas of liberty.” A date for the event has not been set. Milei thanked Musk for “everything he’s doing in the world,” and the latter called for investment in Argentina on X following a global investors conference in Los Angeles from May 5 to 8. Musk praised Milei after the libertarian firebrand defeated then-Economy Minister Sergio Massa in November’s runoff election, claiming “prosperity is ahead for Argentina.” According to Milei, Musk has also expressed interest in mining the country’s lithium reserves. Bukele, who was reelected as president of El Salvador in February with 85% of the vote, was not present for Milei’s inauguration in December, instead sending his minister of justice and public security, Héctor Villatoro. Milei has signaled a desire to create a massive private prison system similar to the Central American nation’s. Both presidents attended this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference — an annual gathering of right-wing leaders in Washington, D.C. From June 13 to 15, Milei will travel to Borgo Egnazia, Italy, to attend a summit of G-7 nations: Germany, Japan, Canada, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. He will subsequently journey to Madrid, where the Juan de Mariana Institute will honor him as part of the institution’s Freedom Week, and then to Hamburg, where he will receive a Hayek medal named for Nobel Prize winner Frederick von Hayek. That ceremony will take place on June 22.",

        "content": "Shortly after the announcement of the general election, I noted over in Scotland that both the SNP and Alba (Alex Salmond’s hardline pro-independence breakaway) were straight out of the blocks, seeking a mandate for Scottish independence. SNP leader John Swinney characterised polling day, July 4th, as “Independence Day”. In a press release which mentions the word “independence” seven times, he said : Alex Salmond : Meanwhile, back home, neither of the nationalist parties have made any kind of reference to Irish unity in their first comments on the election. Sinn Féin’s release emphasised a domestic message : Similarly, the SDLP talked of a “ mission to remove the Tories from power ” : Compare with the Alliance messaging : Setting aside my concern about a lack of differentiation between three major parties, there is one thing I find puzzling. In between elections, the same parties criticise Alliance for not taking a position on Irish unity – that is their right, of course. They insist that other people make preparations and join debates to deal with the topic. Yet, come polling day, somehow this topic goes on the back burner, relegated to a bullet point buried on a list on an election address. I’m not personally in favour of advancing constitutional change at this stage. But if I was, I’d want a political party actively and continuously seeking a mandate to make it happen. The Secretary of State has not, and will not, set out the criteria for calling a border poll. But a pro-unity majority mandate would be impossible to ignore on either side of the Irish Sea. Why is it that, at election time, the SDLP and SF seem to be scared of talking about their ambition for Irish unity ? Why can’t they do what the SNP are doing and seek a mandate for it ? There is a clear way to prevent there ever being a Tory government in NI ever again – why aren’t they highlighting it ? Irish unity as an idea is securing interest across the whole community; aren’t these new votes that they can win ? Is it because they’re afraid they’d lose ?",

        "description": "Plans to build two homes adjacent to a Grade II listed house in Haxey were rejected by councillors last summer, but the decision has now been overturned",
        "content": "Two proposed homes linked to the restoration of an empty Grade II-listed building that was in \"very poor condition\" have been allowed on appeal. Last summer, North Lincolnshire Council 's planning committee rejected plans for two homes in the garden space of 14 Greenhill Road, Haxey, on a split vote. Applicant Karen Robinson appealed and a planning inspector has overturned their decision. The homes will be four bed each, and five parking spaces will be created. During the original application, it was stated finance for the restoration works on Grade II-listed 14 Greenhill Road, which have taken place, was linked to the new homes being built. The listed building had been empty for five years.

Axholme South Ward Cllr Judy Kennedy also made representations against. The parish council argued it would have an \"unacceptable negative impact\" on residential amenity and neighbours' privacy. Cllr Kennedy called it \"backyard development\" at a planning meeting. Deferred for a site visit, it was refused in July on grounds of highway safety and the effect on the preservation of the listed building's setting, with a view it was overdevelopment within the space. Planning inspector L N Hughes has now issued their appeal decision and allowed it. The proposal would reduce the site's openness, impact rear views of the listed building, and use of garden land would create \"some harm to the historical understanding of the building and its setting\". But this harm was limited, the two homes \"would not appear cramped\" and privacy concerns were dismissed. The proposal was also not viewed as causing harm to highway safety or the road network. Concerns had been made over parking and access visibility to Greenhill Road from the private road. The inspector found there is no visibility on one side until close range, but expected car speeds to be low and drivers would have enough time to react. A condition was still placed, though, for detailed design of the junction of the private road to Greenhill Road. Inspector Hughes put \"great weight\" on the linkage of the homes to financing for the Grade II building's restoration. It would not directly enable the works on the 18th Century homes as this had already been done under separate planning permission. However, evidence given offered \"no reason to disbelieve\" that the new homes profit would contribute to the listed building works. \"Those works were identified as having a financial deficit, which the proposal would bring to a break-even point,\" Inspector Hughes states in their decision. The listed building was at \"real risk of being lost due to its very poor condition\" and had no prospective owners for many years. \"As such, its preservation and enhancement for future generations is a clear public benefit,\" the inspector stated. Applicant Karen Robinson said in reaction to the appeal decision: \"This project of restoring one of the oldest properties in Haxey has been very challenging. However, I have had incredible support by the residents of Haxey, which has been inspirational and through those many difficult times a kind word of support and approval has kept me going. All the work on the property has been by local tradesman who have been my rock, with their expert advice and expertise, quality of workmanship and guidance so far.\" She commended the council's planning department and conservation officer for supporting it. Cllr Kennedy had not been in contact before or since the initial refusal, Ms Robinson said, nor seen \"first hand the enormous task\" she had to restore the Grade II building. \"It is such a shame that the restoration of a historical building is side-lined in favour of local political antics and I am thankful that the appeals procedure ruled completely in my favour,\" she added.",

        "description": "Donald Trump was booed by the crowd at the Libertarian Party National Convention on Saturday, with a body language expert saying the former president's confidence took a hit",
        "content": "took a nosedive as he faced a chorus of jeers while speaking at the Libertarian Party National Convention on Saturday, with a body language expert The ex-POTUS, who thrives on the adulation of his die-hard supporters, found himself in unfamiliar territory amid the . The Libertarians, fierce proponents of limited government and individual freedoms, have always eyed Trump with suspicion, and his presence at their gathering stirred up a hornet's nest within the ranks. Attempting to win over the attendees, cracked a joke about his legal woes, stating: \"If I wasn't a Libertarian before, I sure as hell am a Libertarian now.\" Body language expert Judi James suggests that being on the receiving end of boos, as Trump was, can elicit revealing reactions such as anger or fear. Speaking to The Mirror Judi noted that initially, Trump didn't exhibit any signs of a bruised ego, presenting himself as \"surprisingly indignant\" with eyebrows arched and lips \"clamped and pulled down hard at the sides\". Yet, his demeanor shifted as he avoided eye contact, and his trademark \"Lightning Smile\" seemed to flash a \"warning signal\", according to Judi. During his fiery address, Trump lauded the \"fierce champions of freedom in this room\" and slammed US President Joe Biden as a \"tyrant\" and the \"worst president in the history of the United States,\" which led to some audience members retorting: \"That's you.\" As the verbal jabs flew, Trump shot back with \"you don't want to win\" and insinuated that some Libertarians are content with \"keep getting your 3% every four years\". Body language expert Judi shared her insights with The Mirror, noting: \"Being booed as Trump is here can bring out telling response displays. It can create visual flickers of the kind of distress that suggests someone is secretly agreeing with the boos, suggesting low self-esteem that is normally being masked, or it can prompt a state of anger and aggressive arousal or even fear.\" She further observed: \"In this clip, Trump initially shows no signs of low self-esteem. Instead, his body language makes him look surprisingly indignant, which plays slightly against his 'man of the people' appeal. His brows raise as he performs a superior stare at the audience. His lips are clamped and pulled down hard at the sides. When he speaks he reverts to a sarcastic voice for part of his message which seems to be knocking the detractors.\" But Judi said there was a change of attitude in the former president, explaining: \"There is a hint of lowered confidence as his eye contact drops though. He stops staring them out in challenging behavior and the dropping of the eyes looks a little like a 'who blinked first' contest that he just lost. \"His Lightning Smile that flashes across his face is not a display of happiness or good humor, more a baring of his teeth which in the animal kingdom would be sent out as a warning signal.

        "content": "South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space centre in the north east at 10.44pm local time on Monday. The joint chiefs of staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula’s west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and US intelligence authorities were analysing whether the launch was successful. Earlier on Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket” during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Japanese officials lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing US-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed lift-offs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after lift-off. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The UN bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Mr Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor US and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia.",

        "description": "Neanderthals could talk, but they likely couldn't use or understand metaphors, which compare two unlike things, research suggests.",
        "content": "The Neanderthals ( ) fascinate researchers and the general public alike. They remain central to debates about the nature of the genus (the broad biological classification that humans and their relatives fall into). Neanderthals are also vital for understanding the uniqueness or otherwise of our species, . We shared an ancestor with the Neanderthals around 600,000 years ago. They evolved in Europe while we did so in Africa, before dispersing multiple times into Eurasia. The Neanderthals became extinct around 40,000 years ago. We populated the world and continue to flourish. Whether that different outcome is a consequence of differences in language and thought has been long debated. But the evidence points to key differences in the brains of our species and those of Neanderthals that allowed modern humans ( ) to come up with abstract and complex ideas through metaphor – the ability to compare two unrelated things. For this to happen, our species had to diverge from the Neanderthals in our brain architecture. Some experts interpret the skeletal and archaeological evidence as indicating profound differences. Others believe there were none. And some . Disagreement is not surprising when trying to infer such intangibles from material remains such as bones and artefacts. The evidence is piecemeal and ambiguous, providing us with a complex puzzle for how, when and why language evolved. Fortunately, recent discoveries in archaeology and other disciplines have added several new pieces to this language puzzle, enabling a viable picture of the Neanderthal mind to emerge. New anatomical evidence indicates the Neanderthals had vocal tracts and auditory pathways not significantly different to our own, indicating that, from an anatomical perspective, they were as capable as us at . The discovery of Neanderthal genes in our own species of interbreeding, which implies effective inter-species communication and social relationships. The discovery of Neanderthal wooden spears, and the use of resins for making tools from separate components, have also enhanced our views of . and the likely use of are claimed as examples of symbolism, along with . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The most striking claim is that Neanderthals made art, . But several of these cave art claims remain problematic. The evidence for Neanderthal cave art is and is unlikely to be correct, in my view. Rapidly accumulating evidence for the of modern humans challenges the idea that Neanderthals made these geometric designs, or at least that they did so prior to the influence of the symbol-using modern humans. However well-crafted, a wooden spear is little more than a pointed stick, and evidence of technological progress is absent throughout the entirety of Neanderthal existence. While the archaeological evidence remains contested, that from neuroscience and genetics provides a compelling case for linguistic and cognitive differences between and . A 3D digital reconstruction of the Neanderthal brain, created by deforming that of and fitting it into a cast of the brain (endocast) from a Neanderthal, . The Neanderthals had a relatively large occipital lobe, devoting more brain matter to visual processing and making less available for other tasks such as language. They also had a relatively small and differently shaped cerebellum. This sub-cortical structure, which is packed with neurons, contributes to many tasks including . The uniquely spherical shape of the after the first had appeared at 300,000 years ago. Some of the genetic mutations associated with that development are associated with neuronal development and how neurons are connected in the brain. The authors of a known to be unique to (as of 2019) concluded that “modifications of a complex network in cognition or learning took place in modern human evolution”. While such evidence has been accumulating, our understanding of language has also changed. Three developments are of particular significance. First is the 2016 discovery via brain scanning that we store words, or rather the concepts we associate with words, , or semantic groups, of similar concepts in the brain. This is significant because, as we’ll see, the way these clusters of ideas are connected – or not – was probably different between and Neanderthals. Second is the recognition that iconic sounds – those that provide a sensory impression of the thing they represent – had between ape-like calls of our common ancestor of 6 million years ago and the – though we’re not sure which species that was. Iconic words , capturing aspects of the sound, size, movement and texture of the concept the word represents. This contrasts with words that are only arbitrarily related to the thing they refer to. For example, a canine can equally be called a dog, chien or hund – none of which provide a sensory impression of the animal. Third, computer simulation models of language transmission between generations have shown that syntax – consistent rules for how words are ordered to generate meaning – . This shift of emphasis from genetic encoding of syntax to spontaneous emergence suggests that both and Neanderthal language contained these rules. While it may be possible to join the puzzle pieces in several different ways, my long wrestle with the multi-disciplinary evidence has found only one solution. This begins with iconic words being spoken by the ancient human species around 1.6 million years ago. As these types of words were transmitted from generation to generation, arbitrary words and rules of syntax emerged, providing the early Neanderthals and with equivalent linguistic and cognitive capacities. Read more: — — — But these diverged as both species continued to evolve. The brain developed its spherical form with neural networks connecting what had been isolated semantic clusters of words. These remained isolated in the Neanderthal brain. So, while and Neanderthals had equivalent capacity for iconic words and syntax, they appear to have differed with respect to storing ideas in semantic clusters in the brain. By linking up different clusters in the brain that are responsible for storing groups of concepts, our species gained the capacity to think and communicate using metaphor. This allowed modern humans to draw a line between widely different concepts and ideas. This was arguably the most important of our cognitive tools, . While iconic words and syntax were shared between and Neanderthals, metaphor transformed the language, thought and culture of our species, creating a deep divide with the Neanderthals. They went extinct, while we populated the world and continue to flourish. .",

        "content": "Rathke/iStock Editorial via Getty Images The Boeing Company ( NYSE: BA ) had a tough start to the year, as its shares depreciated by over 30% YTD due to regulatory scrutiny. While the company certainly faces some challenges that already had a negative monetary effect on its financials and resulted in the weaker performance of its business in recent months, there are reasons to believe that the company remains a solid investment as it's too big to fail. Too Big To Fail In January, I wrote a bullish article on Boeing in which I said that the ongoing crisis is unlikely to result in the full grounding of the company's planes, as was the case in 2019 during the 737 MAX crisis . Since that time, Boeing's shares have depreciated by ~20%, and while the momentum is not on the company's side, I still believe that Boeing is a BUY, especially at the current price. There are several reasons why I remain optimistic about Boeing's future. Firstly, it's safe to assume that the 2019 scenario has been avoided so far and my initial thinking was correct. Shortly after the door plug issue was addressed, the FAA approved the path for Boeing's newest planes to return to operations. At the same time, the company has been working with the regulator to create a plan that would fix the systemic quality control issues, which is expected to be revealed in the following days. As such, it's safe to say that the company has a decent chance of dealing with the ongoing regulatory scrutiny without facing severe monetary damages like it was in 2019. In addition to that, Boeing was still able to report a relatively decent Q1 earnings report last month despite the ongoing challenges. Despite having some of its newest planes grounded for a couple of weeks in January, Boeing's revenues in Q1 decreased by only 7.5% Y/Y to $16.6 billion. At the same time, its non-GAAP EPS of -$1.13 in Q1 was above the estimates by $0.30. What's more, is that it appears that Boeing has more than enough growth opportunities to mitigate the downside of the ongoing risks and challenges. One of the biggest things that Boeing has going for it is the full recovery of the air travel market to above the pre-pandemic levels. There are reasons to believe that the annual air travel this year will surpass the 2019 levels as the demand is expected to continue to grow in the following months. At the same time, the growth of the Chinese market and the expansion of routes from China also indicate that the full recovery is indeed underway. Given that Boeing's backlog in Q1 grew to $529 billion, it's safe to assume that the latest crisis shouldn't significantly affect the company's performance in the long run, and the worst-case scenario has likely been avoided. In addition to all of that, Boeing continues to be an important defense contractor, which has been greatly benefitting from the higher federal defense spending that's aimed at tackling the rising geopolitical challenges. In Q1, Boeing's defense division managed to increase its revenues by 6% Y/Y to $6.95 billion as the company continues to win new awards for military aircraft from the United States and its allies. Given the importance of Boeing to American interests, it's unlikely that the ongoing regulatory scrutiny will significantly undermine the company's business as it's too big to fail. Given all of those developments, there are reasons to be optimistic about Boeing's future. Despite the ongoing challenges and the weaker top-line performance in Q1, the street continues to believe that Boeing will be able to improve its Y/Y top-line and bottom-line performance in FY24 and beyond. As such, I decided to create a DCF model to see whether Boeing's stock is an attractive investment at the current price after the latest depreciation. The revenue growth assumptions in the model correlate closely with the street's updated estimates. The earnings in the model are expected to gradually grow in the following months thanks to various growth catalysts that should help the company minimize the negative effects caused by the latest developments. The tax rate in the model stands at 21%. The assumptions for all the other metrics correlate closely with Boeing's historical performance. The terminal growth rate in the model is 3%, while the WACC is 9%. Boeing's DCF Model (Historical data: Seeking Alpha, Assumptions: Author) My DCF model shows that Boeing's enterprise value is $162.2 billion, while its fair value is $200.41 per share, which indicates that the company's stock represents a decent upside of ~15% at the current price. Boeing's DCF Model (Historical data: Seeking Alpha, Assumptions: Author) The street currently believes that Boeing is undervalued as well and has a consensus price target of ~$222 per share. Considering this, I decided to stick with my BUY rating for now. Boeing's Consensus Price Target (Seeking Alpha) Major Risks To Consider There's no doubt that Boeing faces a major PR crisis that has already affected its business and the performance of its shares. Countless stories that question the safety of its planes are certainly negatively affecting the trustworthiness of the company. Even though thousands of planes that are built by Boeing are safely transporting thousands of passengers every day, and the company itself appears to be taking all the safety concerns seriously, the brand name has already taken a serious reputational hit that could minimize the upside of the overall business in the future. The Chinese Comac manufacturer has been aggressively expanding the production capacity of its C919 narrow-body airliner in recent months to take a portion of Boeing's market share in China. At the same time, the European manufacturer Airbus SE ( OTCPK:EADSY ) has been receiving major orders this year from international clients, who now take Boeing's reputation into account when deciding who to work with. Therefore, while Boeing is likely to successfully weather the ongoing reputational storm and improve its overall performance in the following quarters, there's a risk that it could start receiving fewer international orders due to the rising global competition. This could make the company overexposed to the American market, which carries its own sets of risks. The Bottom Line Boeing is too big to fail. Even though the latest troubles have certainly led to monetary damages and resulted in the underperformance of its business, there are reasons to believe that the 2019-type scenario under which all of its 737 MAX 9 planes were grounded across the globe for years will likely be avoided. While the company might continue to underperform in the next couple of months due to regulatory scrutiny, I believe that the long-term picture remains solid for now. That's why I'm sticking with my BUY rating, especially since Boeing appears to be a decent investment at the current price.

        "content": ": Tribal ayurveda practitioner and Padma Shri award winner Hemchand Majhi, a resident of Abujhmad in Bastar in Chhattisgarh, has threatened to return the honour unless he gets ‘adequate’ security after finding him in the ‘hit list’ of Maoists. Seventy two-year-old 'Vaidyaraj' Mr Majhi, famous in the region as a traditional medicine practitioner, faced threat to his life from the Naxals for not opposing mining activities in the area. Maoists have issued threats at least half-a-dozen times to eliminate him unless he voices against the mining operations in the area, leading the local police to shift him to district headquarters of Narayanpur from his village of Chhote Dongar in the district. Chhote Dongar is considered the gateway to Abhujhmad, a Naxal stronghold. “He has been shifted to district headquarters six months ago following threats to him by Maoists and provided Y plus category security”, Narayanpur district superintendent of police Prabhat Kumar told this newspaper on Monday. According to the police officer, Mr Majhi has been given three personal security officers (PSOs) for his security. Besides, a company of district reserve guard (DRG) comprising 40 security personnel escorts him whenever he goes to his villager or outside the district. Mr Kumar however described the threat to Mr Majhi as mere propaganda by Maoists for publicity. According to him, a mine in the nearby area is going to be opened and Maoists have given a call to the people to oppose it. “The Maoists have issued threats to 15 eminent persons in the area including Mr Majhi who are not connected to the issue. This is Maoist propaganda (to gain publicity)”, he added.Mr Kumar said that all these 15 persons have been shifted to district headquarters and provided necessary security. Mr Majhi however wanted to return to his village to resume treatment to his patients. Mr Majhi has gained expertise on the medicinal plants found in the forests of Abujhmad and has been doing traditional medicine practice for the last 50 years.",

        "content": "Lululemon Murder: Who Is Brittany Norwood and What Did She Do? By The infamous involved the disturbing death of a 30-year-old woman named Jayna Troxel Murray. The individual responsible for this ordeal was the then-29-year-old According to , Murray was a student at Johns Hopkins University and worked in a Lululemon Athletica store in Washington, D.C. While working there, she met Norwood. The two women reportedly didn’t have animosity. However, everything changed on March 11, 2011. Per the Baltimore Sun, Murray caught Norwood stealing leggings from the store on the fateful night. The former informed a store manager of the latter’s actions, and the pair left the place at 9:45 p.m. A few minutes later, the 30-year-old received a call from Norwood and learned her co-worker had left her wallet at their place of work. The pair returned to the Lululemon Athletica store at 10:05 p.m. Moments later, neighboring Apple store employees heard a ruckus. Apple employee Jana Svrzo heard a woman say, “Don’t do this. Talk to me. What’s going on?” and then ten minutes of grunting and yelling. Eventually, the same voice said, “God help me, please help me.” The next day, in the store, manager Rachel Oertli discovered Murray’s lifeless body, and Norwood tied to the bathroom. Brittany Norwood claimed that on the previous night, two masked assailants followed the pair into the store and raped them. They supposedly killed Murray but let Norwood live because they had more fun assaulting her. Eventually, authorities learned that the 29-year-old’s narration of the incident was untrue and it was she who committed the . The brutal Lululemon murder case was explored in detail in a 2012 episode of . Where is Brittany Norwood now? Per , for the first-degree murder of Jayna Troxel Murray, Brittany Norwood received a life imprisonment sentence without the possibility of parole. The Maryland Correctional Institute for Women in Jessup, MD, is currently her place of stay. Authorities initially treated Norwood as a victim, but they soon began noticing inconsistencies in her story. Detective Dimitry Ruvin, who interrogated her several times, stated that she had an intuition that the survivor was lying about the ordeal mentioned above. She said, “It’s just this little voice in the back of my head. Something’s just not right. The way Brittany’s describing these two guys — they’re racist, they’re rapists, they’re robbers, they’re murderers — it’s like the worst human being that you could possibly describe, right?” During Brittany Norwood’s trial, the truth came to light. The 29-year-old reportedly attacked and murdered Jayna Troxel Murray using tools such as a merchandise peg, a rope, a hammer, a knife, and a box cutter from the store’s tool kit. She then left the store, parked the deceased’s car in a nearby parking lot, and devised a plan to cover her tracks. 90 minutes later, she returned to the crime scene and strategically made it look like whatever she told the police was true. Murray’s body had more than 331 injuries. The condition of her corpse was so gruesome that her family could not have an open casket at her funeral. Debangshu watched a couple of Scorsese, Tarantino and Coppola films in seventh grade and developed an unhealthy obsession with criminals, psychopaths and serial killers. Fueled by his passion for Death, Thrash and Black Metal, he finds solace in writing about some of the most deranged people and incidents in human history. Thank God for cats. Share article Related",

        "content": "The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index is at an all-time high, as corporate earnings come in stronger-than-expected and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassures markets that further interest rate hikes are unlikely. The Nasdaq is approaching the 17,000 level after another blockbuster earnings report from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The market moving print has reignited investor confidence in the artificial intelligence trade. Year-to-date, the Nasdaq Composite has risen 15%. The index is up 30% over the last 12 months, leading the overall market higher. As has been the case for the past 18 months, the rally is being powered largely by a handful of names that are enjoying exponential growth and delivering outsized returns to their shareholders. This trend looks likely to continue , which is why we’re looking at three tech superstars destined for stratospheric returns. Nvidia (NVDA) We can’t talk about tech superstars without acknowledging the elephant in the room that is chipmaker Nvidia. Currently, NVDA stock is up 3% after the company issued blowout quarterly financial results , raised its dividend by 150% and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. The company is already providing stratospheric returns to shareholders with its share price having risen 165% over the last 12 months and more than 3,000% in the past five years. Nvidia’s first-quarter print was epic. The company’s revenue rose 268% year-over-year to $26.04 billion. Profits increased more than 600% from a year earlier to $6.12 per share. The top and bottom line figures crushed Wall Street’s lofty forecasts. Management attributed the meteoric sales growth to its data center unit , which includes its AI microchips, which rose 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. Demand shows no signs of slowing, especially with the launch of Nvidia’s new Blackwell series of AI chips. The 10-for-1 stock split will occur on June 7, with holders of common stock receiving nine additional shares. Trading of the stock on a split-adjusted basis will begin on June 10. The quarterly dividend has been raised to 10 cents a share on a pre-split basis from 4 cents previously. After the stock split, the dividend will be one penny per share. Dell Technologies (DELL) Dell Technologies ‘ (NYSE: DELL ) stock continues to run hot, as it too benefits from the AI boom. The company best-known for its laptop computers has seen its share price more than double — up 114% — so far in 2024. Over the last 12 months, DELL stock has risen 238%. The company is growing not only from strong earnings and a recovery in computer sales, but also from rising demand for the servers it makes that run AI applications. It’s the same narrative that has driven the stock of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI ). DELL stock rose 5% the day after Nvidia’s latest earnings print, as investors expect demand for the company’s servers to grow alongside AI chips and semiconductors. The stock also surged nearly 30% higher on March 1 after its earnings report showed that it is starting to benefit from the AI boom. More recently, analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) raised their price target on Dell’s shares and named the company a “top pick.” Dell next reports earnings on May 30. Netflix (NFLX) Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) looks likely to dominate the streaming sector for the foreseeable future. With most of its competitors in disarray, the streaming crown looks like it’s Netflix’s to lose. The company also has a catalyst forming, as it pushes further into live sporting events. NFLX stock is up 65% over the last 12 months, including a 38% gain year-to-date. Netflix remains a tech stock with high return potential. While some controversy came with Netflix’s plan to no longer report quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per member, the company continues to post strong results. For the year’s first quarter, Netflix reported EPS of $5.28, versus the $4.52 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $9.37 billion, compared to $9.28 billion that was the consensus estimate of analysts. Subscribers at Netflix totaled 269.6 million in Q1, up 16% from a year ago and ahead of expectations for 264.2 million subscribers. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .",

        "content": "look ‘set to part’ with manager Erik ten Hag, despite their FA Cup final victory over rivals Manchester City last weekend, according to the Daily Mail. Speculation surrounding the Dutchman’s future has spiralled over the last week as , regardless of the outcome of the FA Cup final. As it so happened, ten Hag guided the Red Devils to a momentous 2-1 victory at Wembley on Saturday. Goals from Manchester United’s next generation Alejandro Garnacho and sealed the win in the capital, despite a late comeback from Manchester City sparked by a goal from Jeremy Doku. The FA Cup triumph is Ten Hag’s second piece of silverware since taking charge following their Carabao Cup final win over Newcastle United last year. It appears Saturday’s victory over Pep Guardiola’s side has not been enough to save Ten Hag’s job as the Daily Mail suggest the club are following an end of season review. Ten Hag addressed his future after the FA Cup final on Saturday, and sent the club a clear message. Prior to kick-off, he admitted to the BBC he was unsure if he was going to be sacked, and his full focus was on preparing the team for the biggest game of their season. He then said : \"Two trophies in two years is not bad, three finals in two years is not bad. If they don't want me, then I’ll go somewhere else to win trophies because that is what I do.\" Ipswich Town’s Kieran McKenna is a wanted man this summer as the managerial merry-go-round gets into full swing. Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea have recently been linked with the 38-year-old, but the Daily Mail also reported . Elsewhere, The Telegraph claim are also names being explored by the club as they weigh up their options. McKenna, though, already has ties to the club as he managed the under-18s and was later promoted to the first-team’s coaching staff in 2018, and worked as an assistant to Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer during their respective spells in charge of Manchester United. He took charge of Ipswich in December 2021 as a relatively unknown manager, but he quickly proved doubters wrong as they secured promotion from League One in 2023. Twelve months later, he guided the club back into the Premier League for the first time in 22 years.",

Illegal Season 3’s official synopsis reads, “What do you do when justice itself is out of order?

        "description": "A Finnish study reveals that consuming more fruits and vegetables is linked to better sleep duration, emphasizing the importance of diet for overall health.",
        "content": "Having trouble getting enough sleep? A recent study by a team from Finland's University of Helsinki, the National Institute for Health and Welfare, and Turku University of Applied Sciences found a strong link between sleep duration and fruit and vegetable consumption. How a Plant-based Diet Affects Sleep Duration The , published in Frontiers in Nutrition, draws on data from the National FinHealth 2017 Study, involving 5,043 Finnish adults aged 18 and above. Participants provided detailed information about their usual sleep duration and dietary habits through a comprehensive questionnaire. The researchers considered various factors, including age, gender, income, and chronotype (whether a person is a morning or evening type), to ensure accurate results. They also excluded individuals who reported extremely low energy intake to maintain data integrity. Participants were divided into three sleep duration groups: short sleepers (less than 7 hours per night), normal sleepers (7-9 hours per night), and long sleepers (more than 9 hours per night). The study discovered that short sleepers consumed 37 grams fewer fruits and vegetables per day than normal sleepers. Meanwhile, long sleepers ate 73 g less per day than normal sleepers. Even after adjusting for various factors, the negative association remained clear: both short and long sleepers ate fewer fruits and vegetables compared to those with normal sleep durations. The link between sleep duration and fruit and vegetable consumption became even more evident when excluding participants who underreported their energy intake. Good Nutrition's Effect on Sleep Good nutrition and adequate sleep are crucial for maintaining overall health. As the study points out, insufficient or excessive sleep is associated with lower fruit and vegetable intake, which can negatively impact health. This study emphasizes the importance of eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables for better and longer sleep. Other have shown that sleep deprivation is linked to cardiovascular disease, diminished cognitive abilities, and increased mortality. Therefore, understanding and addressing the dietary habits related to sleep patterns is essential. Sleep Experts Recommend These Food Groups for Better Sleep The recommends consuming at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily. Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin C, and potassium, which can help reduce the risk of serious health problems like heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Experts from US nonprofit stress that certain foods and drinks can promote better sleep by providing essential nutrients. Foods such as kiwi, cherries, milk, fatty fish, nuts, and rice can aid in relaxation and sleep. Conversely, avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and heavy meals before bedtime can contribute to healthier sleep patterns. Stay posted here at Tech Times.",

The First Lady said the partnership had enabled Ghana to build healthcare capacity, transform patient care, break infertility stigma and support girl education. Mrs Akufo-Addo was speaking at the Merck Foundation Ghana Alumni Summit and Awards Ceremony 2024 in Accra. The programme was to recognise journalists, doctors, musicians, fashion designers and filmmakers for expanding awareness on key health and social issues in Ghana, under the community awareness programme sponsored by the Merck Foundation. The First Lady, who is also the Ambassador for the “More Than a Mother” campaign, said Ghana could now boast of more specialists in very critical areas of medicine due to the sponsorship and the substantial contribution to enhancing access to quality healthcare solutions in many deserved specialties. “Merck Foundation has allowed us to access new resources, knowledge, and networks. “In the short period of nearly six years, Merck Foundation has provided 143 scholarships for local Ghanaian doctors in about 40 diverse disciplines,” Mrs Akufo-Addo said. She said infertility had always been a taboo topic in the African context, saying with the Merck Foundation’s ‘More Than a Mother’ Ambassador Programme, Ghanaians were now being more open with infertility, seeking help and reducing stigma. She acknowledged and thanked the Foundation on the partnership for girls’ education, citing the ‘Educating Linda’ and “Because I want to be” television mentoring programmes. “Together, we are ensuring girls are heard, seen and empowered for a great future,” she stated. Mrs Akufo-Addo said under the partnership, there had been several training courses for the media to help break the silence and be the voice of the voiceless on issues such as infertility and other sensitive social and health issues. “As a lover of the arts, I am encouraged by Merck Foundation’s ‘More Than a mother’ and ‘Promoting Healthy Lifestyle’ awards for musicians, fashion designers, filmmakers, students, and potential talents in these fields. “These awards have promoted the discussion of critical social issues and given young people the opportunity to showcase their talents,” she stated. Mrs Akufo-Addo congratulated the Foundation for winning the “Best Health Sector Philanthropy of the Year 2023” award, at the Ghana Philanthropy Awards. “There is no doubt about the amazing achievements of Merck Foundation, which had remarkably improved the lives of people in Ghana, all over Africa and Asia.” Senator Dr Rasha Kelej, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Merck Foundation and President of the “More Than a Mother” campaign, commended the First Lady for her active and strong partnership over the years. “More Than a mother campaign is actually important for African women and for me as the CEO of the Merck Foundation, because through that we empower women to have access to education and information as well as change of mindset, while ensuring economic empowerment.” The CEO said when a woman is educated and economically empowered, she could grow to become more than just a mother. Women should not be blamed alone for infertility as the problem could be from men as well, adding that some 85 per cent of the situation could be prevented since most of the situation could be due to untreated infectious diseases, Female Genital Mutilation, child-marriage, unsafe abortion, and unsafe child delivery, among others. The awards ceremony saw a total of 146 Medical Doctors in 42 Specialties receiving awards, as well as journalists who were also awarded under the Merck Foundation’s Media Recognition Awards. Ms Muniratu Akweley Issah, of the Ghana News Agency (GNA), picked two medals and certificates under the Media Recognition Awards for the year 2022 and 2023, online category. 20 other journalists, fashion designers, film makers and song writers also picked awards for various categories.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek began her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean on Monday, stretching her winning streak to 13 matches. Swiatek, who has been ranked No. 1 for nearly every week since April 2022, put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier in the 1-hour, 1-minute match: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Three of her four Grand Slam trophies came in Paris — in 2020, 2022 and 2023. The last woman to win the championship at the clay-court major three straight times was Justine Henin in 2005-07. “It feels like home here,” said Swiatek, who will meet four-time major champ and former No. 1 Naomi Osaka next. “I’m really happy to be back. Just feel like I can play really good tennis, so hopefully I’m going to be here as long as possible.” Her match was going to be followed by one involving someone even more comfortable on the red clay: Rafael Nadal , the 14-time champion at Roland Garros. He was scheduled to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round — in what might end up being Nadal’s last French Open match. “For sure, I’ll be watching Rafa’s match,” Swiatek said. “Comparing me to him? I don’t think I’m at that level yet. He’s a great person and a great athlete ... I will try to take lessons from him.” In other early action Monday, reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner improved to 8-0 in Grand Slam play in 2024 by defeating Chris Eubanks 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova eliminated Rebeka Masarova 6-1, 6-3 and two-time major finalist Ons Jabeur beat Sachia Vickery of the U.S. 6-3, 6-2. Sinner, who missed the Italian Open this month with an injured hip, moved well and his strokes seemed just fine. He limited the big-serving Eubanks to four aces, converted 5 of 10 break points and was broken only once himself. Not suprisingly, the clean-striking Sinner won 10 of the 14 points that lasted nine strokes or more. “The hip is good. I’m very happy. I’m glad that my team and myself worked very hard to be back on court as soon as possible,” Sinner said. “For sure, (my) general shape is not at 100% yet, so we try to build every day.” The encounter lasted only a little more than two hours and, truth be told, Sinner was not really tested all that much. “I’m obviously happy by what I have achieved in the last months. But our goal is to improve every day. That for me is more important. I know I have to improve some things,” said Sinner, who now faces French veteran Richard Gasquet. “Let’s see what I can achieve in the future.” ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese are the best blue-chip fintech stocks to buy today thanks to their incredible growth potential as banking innovation grows.The post Fintech’s Blue-Chip Vanguard: 3 Stocks Shaping the Future of Finance appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Fintech is a compound word for financial technology. It refers to innovation in what is traditionally a very slow-to-adapt sector. Today, the sector comprises several blue-chip stocks representing companies that produce everything. Products and services range from back-end technology that makes banks operate more smoothly to consumer apps that facilitate the transfer of funds. However it may manifest, fintech is a market that is predicted to grow rapidly moving forward. It is currently predicted that its compound annual growth rate between 2024 and 2032 will average 16.5% . Those growth rates are bound to produce stocks that appreciate dramatically. The face of finance continues to change rapidly, meaning now is the time to invest. Capital deployed wisely today has the potential to grow into something much bigger in the future. Visa (V) Visa (NYSE: V ) is one of the pioneers among fintech stocks . Today, it’s one of the leading blue-chip companies in the world and represents a strong investment overall. You have to rewind to 1958 to find its origins. It was that year that the company began issuing the first consumer credit cards. In 1976, Visa expanded card issuance internationally with the company growing into its current form. Visa’s dominance in the fintech space is one reason I consider it one of the best fintech stocks to buy. Its dominance is reflected in its earnings. Most recently, the company’s top line grew by 10% while GAAP earnings increased by 12% . There’s a strong case to be made for investing in the stock from a fundamental perspective. Furthermore, the company continues to show innovation with its recent announcement of its new generative AI tool for preventing enumeration attacks . These attacks involve the use of complex scripts and bots, resulting in more than $1.1 billion in fraud losses annually. Nu Holdings (NU) Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU ) proves just how valuable the global opportunity in fintech stocks has become. A lot of that narrative centers around innovation bringing formerly unbanked customers into the banking sector. The company added 19.3 million clients throughout 2023, bringing its total to 93.9 million at the end of 2023. Nu Holdings then surpassed 100 million customers on May 8 , making it the first digital banking platform outside of Asia to reach that milestone. This has resulted in staggering growth across important metrics including net income with figures rising to $378.8 million for its first fiscal quarter of 2024 , up from $141.8 in Q1 of 2023. Latin America continues to receive a lot of attention concerning fintech because the region brings many new customers to the banking sector. Nu Holdings has done a particularly good job at this thanks to its efforts in Brazil, where it now counts 92 million of its clients, thus making it one of the better fintech stocks to buy. MercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI ) is part Latin American e-commerce giant, and part Latin American fintech giant. It is the latter that we will be discussing concerning its strength as a blue-chip fintech stock worth consideration. Both income and revenues increased by 36% in the first quarter of 2024. The overall fundamental picture for MercadoLibre remains strong. That picture includes its e-commerce segment and its fintech segment, the latter of which we are focusing on here. That segment largely comprises Mercado Pago which reached 49 million active users during the period. Those user base numbers represented an increase of 38% during the quarter on a year-over-year basis. That growth is substantially higher than the 32% growth The firm reported a year prior. MercadoLibre’s management attributes that increase to strengthening retention rates and a greater number of fintech products on its platform. The company issued more than 1.5 million credit cards in Brazil and Mexico during the first quarter. Investors can find multiple other metrics all pointing to continued hypergrowth for MercadoLibre.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — They traveled from all over — from Europe and Oceania, from North America and South America — to be at Roland Garros on Monday, intent on watching Rafael Nadal play what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. Nadal, who has won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam trophies in Paris , was scheduled to play on Day 2 of the tournament in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev , and tennis fans wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete , of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. “He’s my favorite tennis player. Maybe when he retires, I will find someone new. But I don’t know if I will give that much love to the next one,” said Fiona Li, a 35-year-old who works in luxury fashion in the Netherlands. “His power is that he never gives up. He encourages me when I am really down. He fights until the last minute. That’s what we need in daily life. When you’re sad or something, you watch him play, and everything is solved.” Li, who said she's been a Nadal fan since 2005, the year he won his first title at Roland Garros as a teenager, made sure to stop by the 3-meter-tall (about 10-feet-tall) statue of Nadal that was unveiled in 2021 and stands between one of the tournament's main entrances and the 15,000-seat Chatrier stadium. Wearing a makeshift tiara fashioned from four yellow tennis balls — each with a letter to spell out “Rafa” — Li posed for photos in front of the statue with three pals, one from Australia and two from China. Each member of the quartet wore a red T-shirt with a capital yellow letter from his first name. One held a red-and-yellow Spanish flag with “King of Roland Garros” stamped on it. “Vamos, Rafa!” they shouted in unison. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and had indicated, amid a series of injuries to his hip and an abdominal muscle, that he would be retiring at some point in 2024. When told by a reporter on Saturday that most folks are assuming this will be his French Open adieu, he smiled and said: “Don't assume.” So who knows what the future holds? The whole thing has a bit of the same vibe as at the 2022 U.S. Open, when the world was well aware that Serena Williams was participating in what would be her last event, and she was feted by enthusiastic crowds. Similarly, plenty of people yearned to soak up the atmosphere and get as close as possible to Nadal, or even just symbols of Nadal — whether by visiting that larger-than-life steel monument to him or catching a peek of a practice or buying merchandise. The main on-site store has a special section of its main floor with Nadal-branded items, including an array of hats that come in six colors and go for 35 euros each (about $38). Even Julio Parada, a 49-year-old Bolivian in banking, wanted a photo at the statue — while wearing a green hat with “RF” on it, representing Roger Federer. “I like both. Actually, I prefer Roger, but Rafa was the most difficult rival he ever faced,” said Parada, attending his first Grand Slam tournament with his wife, Karina, and son, Julio, who is a student in Germany. “We made the effort to see Nadal, because we are aware that this is maybe his last French Open.” Also holding tickets for Nadal vs. Zverev were Barbra Chambati, 49, and her daughter, Crystal, 25. Mom wore a salmon-colored top with Nadal's bull horns logo. Crystal had on a white T-shirt — bought two days ago on the Champs-Élysées avenue — showing a photo of Nadal pumping his fist. They tried to watch a training session at Court 3 a few hours before Monday's match, but could not get in because it was too crowded. Still, it was a thrill simply to see him walk past afterward. “He has a lot of money, but you wouldn't know it because of his humility. He relates to anyone,” said Barbra Chambati, a food factory manager who said she is originally from Zimbabwe and has lived in New Zealand for two decades. “We are so grateful that, for so many years, he has given his all for our enjoyment.” Their trip included a 17-hour flight from Auckland to Dubai, a stopover, and a 7-hour flight from Dubai to Paris. “A bit long, but worth it,” Barbra Chambati said. “We wouldn’t change it for anything.” They were part of a tennis tour group that included Cathy Davis, a 75-year-old retiree from Toronto, who was wearing a purple hat with the bull logo. She proclaimed herself a “Rafa supreme fan.” Why? “He’s a shot-maker. I love the overhead smash; he’s the king of that. His down-the-line forehand. Cross-court backhand. And now he comes to the net,\" Davis said. \"On the court, intensity-plus. Off it, very humble. Kind. He’s one thing on the court and someone a little bit different off.” As with Williams a little less than two years ago in New York, no one knows for sure how long Nadal will remain in the draw over these two weeks. Li, for one, was prepared. She said she purchased tickets for the full event. “No matter how far he goes,\" she said, \"I will be there.” ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

PARIS (AP) — They traveled from all over — from Europe and Oceania, from North America and South America — to be at Roland Garros on Monday, intent on watching Rafael Nadal play what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. Nadal, who has won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam trophies in Paris, was scheduled to play on Day 2 of the tournament in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev, and tennis fans wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. “He’s my favorite tennis player. Maybe when he retires, I will find someone new. But I don’t know if I will give that much love to the next one,” said Fiona Li, a 35-year-old who works in luxury fashion in the Netherlands. “His power is that he never gives up. He encourages me when I am really down. He fights until the last minute. That’s what we need in daily life. When you’re sad or something, you watch him play, and everything is solved.” Li, who said she’s been a Nadal fan since 2005, the year he won his first title at Roland Garros as a teenager, made sure to stop by the 3-meter-tall (about 10-feet-tall) statue of Nadal that was unveiled in 2021 and stands between one of the tournament’s main entrances and the 15,000-seat Chatrier stadium. Wearing a makeshift tiara fashioned from four yellow tennis balls — each with a letter to spell out “Rafa” — Li posed for photos in front of the statue with three pals, one from Australia and two from China. Each member of the quartet wore a red T-shirt with a capital yellow letter from his first name. One held a red-and-yellow Spanish flag with “King of Roland Garros” stamped on it. “Vamos, Rafa!” they shouted in unison. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and had indicated, amid a series of injuries to his hip and an abdominal muscle, that he would be retiring at some point in 2024. When told by a reporter on Saturday that most folks are assuming this will be his French Open adieu, he smiled and said: “Don’t assume.” So who knows what the future holds? The whole thing has a bit of the same vibe as at the 2022 U.S. Open, when the world was well aware that Serena Williams was participating in what would be her last event, and she was feted by enthusiastic crowds. Similarly, plenty of people yearned to soak up the atmosphere and get as close as possible to Nadal, or even just symbols of Nadal — whether by visiting that larger-than-life steel monument to him or catching a peek of a practice or buying merchandise.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — They traveled from all over — from Europe and Oceania, from North America and South America — to be at Roland Garros on Monday, intent on watching Rafael Nadal play what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. Nadal, who has won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam trophies in Paris , was scheduled to play on Day 2 of the tournament in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev , and tennis fans wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete , of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. “He’s my favorite tennis player. Maybe when he retires, I will find someone new. But I don’t know if I will give that much love to the next one,” said Fiona Li, a 35-year-old who works in luxury fashion in the Netherlands. “His power is that he never gives up. He encourages me when I am really down. He fights until the last minute. That’s what we need in daily life. When you’re sad or something, you watch him play, and everything is solved.” Li, who said she's been a Nadal fan since 2005, the year he won his first title at Roland Garros as a teenager, made sure to stop by the 3-meter-tall (about 10-feet-tall) statue of Nadal that was unveiled in 2021 and stands between one of the tournament's main entrances and the 15,000-seat Chatrier stadium. Wearing a makeshift tiara fashioned from four yellow tennis balls — each with a letter to spell out “Rafa” — Li posed for photos in front of the statue with three pals, one from Australia and two from China. Each member of the quartet wore a red T-shirt with a capital yellow letter from his first name. One held a red-and-yellow Spanish flag with “King of Roland Garros” stamped on it. “Vamos, Rafa!” they shouted in unison. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and had indicated, amid a series of injuries to his hip and an abdominal muscle, that he would be retiring at some point in 2024. When told by a reporter on Saturday that most folks are assuming this will be his French Open adieu, he smiled and said: “Don't assume.” So who knows what the future holds? The whole thing has a bit of the same vibe as at the 2022 U.S. Open, when the world was well aware that Serena Williams was participating in what would be her last event, and she was feted by enthusiastic crowds. Similarly, plenty of people yearned to soak up the atmosphere and get as close as possible to Nadal, or even just symbols of Nadal — whether by visiting that larger-than-life steel monument to him or catching a peek of a practice or buying merchandise. The main on-site store has a special section of its main floor with Nadal-branded items, including an array of hats that come in six colors and go for 35 euros each (about $38). Even Julio Parada, a 49-year-old Bolivian in banking, wanted a photo at the statue — while wearing a green hat with “RF” on it, representing Roger Federer. “I like both. Actually, I prefer Roger, but Rafa was the most difficult rival he ever faced,” said Parada, attending his first Grand Slam tournament with his wife, Karina, and son, Julio, who is a student in Germany. “We made the effort to see Nadal, because we are aware that this is maybe his last French Open.” Also holding tickets for Nadal vs. Zverev were Barbra Chambati, 49, and her daughter, Crystal, 25. Mom wore a salmon-colored top with Nadal's bull horns logo. Crystal had on a white T-shirt — bought two days ago on the Champs-Élysées avenue — showing a photo of Nadal pumping his fist. They tried to watch a training session at Court 3 a few hours before Monday's match, but could not get in because it was too crowded. Still, it was a thrill simply to see him walk past afterward. “He has a lot of money, but you wouldn't know it because of his humility. He relates to anyone,” said Barbra Chambati, a food factory manager who said she is originally from Zimbabwe and has lived in New Zealand for two decades. “We are so grateful that, for so many years, he has given his all for our enjoyment.” Their trip included a 17-hour flight from Auckland to Dubai, a stopover, and a 7-hour flight from Dubai to Paris. “A bit long, but worth it,” Barbra Chambati said. “We wouldn’t change it for anything.” They were part of a tennis tour group that included Cathy Davis, a 75-year-old retiree from Toronto, who was wearing a purple hat with the bull logo. She proclaimed herself a “Rafa supreme fan.” Why? “He’s a shot-maker. I love the overhead smash; he’s the king of that. His down-the-line forehand. Cross-court backhand. And now he comes to the net,\" Davis said. \"On the court, intensity-plus. Off it, very humble. Kind. He’s one thing on the court and someone a little bit different off.” As with Williams a little less than two years ago in New York, no one knows for sure how long Nadal will remain in the draw over these two weeks. Li, for one, was prepared. She said she purchased tickets for the full event. “No matter how far he goes,\" she said, \"I will be there.” ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

She said she purchased tickets for the full event. “No matter how far he goes,\" she said, \"I will be there.” ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

The motorcyclist was believed to have been thrown into the air before landing on a road kerb, reported Shin Min Daily News . When a Shin Min reporter arrived at the scene, a red motorcycle was found next to the grass patch where a police blue tent covering the deceased's body was erected. The motorcycle's box and left sideview mirror had fallen off, and police officers were examining the vehicle. Blood was also found on a road kerb near the accident site, along with some debris. A male police officer was later seen clearing the blood stains with a plastic container filled with water. Another officer also retrieved a red helmet for investigation. The Singapore Police Force confirmed with Mothership that they were alerted to the accident on Monday morning. The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene by a Singapore Civil Defence Force paramedic, added the police. Police investigations are ongoing. Top image via Shin Min Daily News",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday secured from Spain a pledge of additional air defense missiles to help fight the about 3,000 bombs that he says Russia launches every month at Ukraine in the third year of the war.",
        "content": "MADRID — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday secured from Spain a pledge of additional air defense missiles to help fight the about 3,000 bombs that he says Russia launches every month at Ukraine in the third year of the war. However, Ukraine still urgently needs another seven U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction, Zelenskyy said. ''If we had these modern Patriot systems, (Russian) airplanes wouldn't be able to fly close enough to drop the (glide) bombs on the civilian population and the military,'' Zelenskyy told a news conference in the Spanish capital. Glide bombs are heavy Soviet-era bombs fitted with precision guidance systems and launched from aircraft flying out of range of air defenses. The bombs weigh more than a ton and blast targets to smithereens, leaving a huge crater. Two Patriot systems are needed to protect the northeastern Kharkiv region, where the Kremlin's forces launched a cross-border offensive on May 10 that left Ukrainian troops reeling, Zelenskyy said. The death toll from a glide bomb attack on a Kharkiv shopping mall Saturday rose to 18, regional Gov Oleh Syniehubov said Monday, with five people still missing. The Kharkiv push has further strained Ukraine's already depleted army, which in recent months has been fighting Russia's intense drive deeper into the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the Kremlin's army is mustering at another point in Russia, farther north but close to the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, aiming to stretch Ukraine's depleted army thinner and crack its resistance in the area. Zelenskyy and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez signed a bilateral security agreement that allocates 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. More Leopard tanks and artillery ammunition also feature in the package. ''After more than two years (of war), Russia's aggression continues, and that's why it is more necessary than ever to redouble our support,'' Sánchez told the joint news conference. The Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system that was first deployed in the 1980s and can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles. It is expensive but is effective and sought after by armies around the world. European countries have hesitated to send Patriot systems to Ukraine, fearing they may need them. Spain's King Felipe VI earlier welcomed Zelenskyy at the capital's Barajas airport. Zelenskyy was due in neighboring Portugal on Tuesday. He had been due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia's response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. A Ukrainian long-range drone set a new distance record by attacking overnight an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Ukrainian officials claimed. The operation was conducted by Ukraine's military intelligence, GUR, an intelligence official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to comment publicly. Ukraine's previous long-range attack record was at 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) when a drone struck an oil refinery in Russia's Bashkortostan on May 9. It was not immediately possible to verify either claim. Meanwhile, a Western intelligence assessment suggested that Russia's Kharkiv offensive has subsided. ''The northern Kharkiv front has likely stabilized with Russian territorial control fragmented and not joined up,'' the U.K. Defense Ministry said Sunday. ''Russia's gains in this axis will be limited in the coming week, as Russia's initial momentum has been contained by Ukrainian resistance.'' That is in line with Zelenskyy's claim last Friday that Ukrainian forces have secured ''combat control'' of areas where Russian troops entered the Kharkiv region. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine's biggest military test since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia's bigger army and air force. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "content": "GUWAHATI: Authorities in Dhubri, Assam, have initiated stringent safety measures following a cyclone alert for Cyclone Remal issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The alert predicts squally winds ranging from 40-50 kmph, with gusts reaching up to 60 kmph, set to affect South Assam and Meghalaya on May 27th. Additionally, heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected across Assam on May 27th and 28th. In preparation, the Dhubri district administration has issued comprehensive directives to protect lives and property. Santana Bora, ACS, the Additional District Commissioner of Dhubri, exercising authority under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and in her capacity as Chief Executive Officer of the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), Dhubri, has ordered the immediate suspension of all ferry services operated by both government and private entities from May 27th to May 28th. Essential services, relief and rescue operations, and boats involved in the Dhubri-Phulbari bridge project, specifically transporting construction workers for L&T Ltd, are exempted from this order. Furthermore, all fishing activities in the River Brahmaputra and its tributaries are strictly prohibited during this period. This measure is aimed at preventing potential loss of life and damage to property that could arise due to the hazardous weather conditions. The proactive approach by the district authorities underscores their commitment to ensuring public safety during this period of heightened risk. To ensure compliance with these orders, the Assistant Executive Engineer of Inland Water Transport, Dhubri, has been assigned the responsibility of monitoring the situation. The engineer is required to provide daily reports to the CEO of DDMA, Dhubri, to ensure that all directives are being followed and to swiftly address any emerging issues. Residents of Dhubri are urged to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions as the district braces for the impact of Cyclone Remal. Local authorities remain on high alert, ready to respond promptly to any emergencies that may arise, ensuring that the district is well-prepared to handle the challenges posed by the cyclone. The collective efforts of the district administration aim to minimize risks and safeguard the well-being of Dhubri's residents during this critical period. ALSO READ: ALSO WATCH:",

PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek began her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean on Monday, stretching her winning streak to 13 matches. Swiatek, who has been ranked No. 1 for nearly every week since April 2022, put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier in the 1-hour, 1-minute match: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Three of her four Grand Slam trophies came in Paris — in 2020, 2022 and 2023. The last woman to win the championship at the clay-court major three straight times was Justine Henin in 2005-07. “It feels like home here,” said Swiatek, who will meet four-time major champ and former No. 1 Naomi Osaka next. “I’m really happy to be back. Just feel like I can play really good tennis, so hopefully I’m going to be here as long as possible.” Her match was going to be followed by one involving someone even more comfortable on the red clay: Rafael Nadal, the 14-time champion at Roland Garros. He was scheduled to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round — in what might end up being Nadal’s last French Open match. “For sure, I’ll be watching Rafa’s match,” Swiatek said. “Comparing me to him? I don’t think I’m at that level yet. He’s a great person and a great athlete ... I will try to take lessons from him.” In other early action Monday, reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner improved to 8-0 in Grand Slam play in 2024 by defeating Chris Eubanks 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova eliminated Rebeka Masarova 6-1, 6-3 and two-time major finalist Ons Jabeur beat Sachia Vickery of the U.S. 6-3, 6-2. Sinner, who missed the Italian Open this month with an injured hip, moved well and his strokes seemed just fine. He limited the big-serving Eubanks to four aces, converted 5 of 10 break points and was broken only once himself. Not suprisingly, the clean-striking Sinner won 10 of the 14 points that lasted nine strokes or more. “The hip is good. I’m very happy. I’m glad that my team and myself worked very hard to be back on court as soon as possible,” Sinner said. “For sure, (my) general shape is not at 100% yet, so we try to build every day.” The encounter lasted only a little more than two hours and, truth be told, Sinner was not really tested all that much. “I’m obviously happy by what I have achieved in the last months. But our goal is to improve every day. That for me is more important. I know I have to improve some things,” said Sinner, who now faces French veteran Richard Gasquet. “Let’s see what I can achieve in the future.” ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

I will try to take lessons from him.” In other early action Monday, reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner improved to 8-0 in Grand Slam play in 2024 by defeating Chris Eubanks 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova eliminated Rebeka Masarova 6-1, 6-3 and two-time major finalist Ons Jabeur beat Sachia Vickery of the U.S. 6-3, 6-2. Sinner, who missed the Italian Open this month with an injured hip, moved well and his strokes seemed just fine. He limited the big-serving Eubanks to four aces, converted 5 of 10 break points and was broken only once himself. Not suprisingly, the clean-striking Sinner won 10 of the 14 points that lasted nine strokes or more. “The hip is good. I'm very happy. I'm glad that my team and myself worked very hard to be back on court as soon as possible,” Sinner said. “For sure, (my) general shape is not at 100% yet, so we try to build every day.” The encounter lasted only a little more than two hours and, truth be told, Sinner was not really tested all that much. “I'm obviously happy by what I have achieved in the last months. But our goal is to improve every day. That for me is more important. I know I have to improve some things,” said Sinner, who now faces French veteran Richard Gasquet. “Let's see what I can achieve in the future.” ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek began her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean on Monday, stretching her winning streak to 13 matches. Swiatek, who has been ranked No. 1 for nearly every week since April 2022, put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier in the 1-hour, 1-minute match: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Three of her four Grand Slam trophies came in Paris — in 2020, 2022 and 2023. The last woman to win the championship at the clay-court major three straight times was Justine Henin in 2005-07. “It feels like home here,” said Swiatek, who will meet four-time major champ and former No. 1 Naomi Osaka next. “I'm really happy to be back. Just feel like I can play really good tennis, so hopefully I'm going to be here as long as possible.” Her match was going to be followed by one involving someone even more comfortable on the red clay: Rafael Nadal , the 14-time champion at Roland Garros. He was scheduled to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round — in what might end up being Nadal's last French Open match. “For sure, I'll be watching Rafa’s match,” Swiatek said. “Comparing me to him?

        "content": "One of the biggest beauty struggles faced every summer is hair in humidity. Some people simply accept their frizzy fate, but those in the know have found a solution that will give you perfectly sleek hair all summer long. This is the priced at £32 for 200ml of product. Hailed by celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton (who's also the global creative director of the brand), the product is seen in action on clients such as Jlo, Kim Kardashian, and Kylie Jenner. This \"extreme\" version follows the success of the which was also highly praised by users. According to the website, is described as an \"ultra-light haircare spray\" featuring \"powerful waterproof, anti-frizz technology\". To apply, simply spray the product onto towel dried strands in sections, comb through and blow-dry the hair with tension. The results should be \"silky smooth\" and \"frizz-free\" hair with a \"glassy shine\" and these promised effects will last in the hair for around three to four washes. An excellent feature about this product is that it has an in-built heat protection so there is no need to use anything else. It also comes in a smaller if you want to try it out before committing to the larger size and is perfect for travel. is flooded with five star reviews, one happy buyer said: \"I have the full-size version, but bought in miniature just to be sure I had it for any trips! This speaks for itself. My hair is heavily processed and is going through a bit of damage control right now – but this spray gives it shine, lustre and somehow thickens my hair? Magic.\" Another added: \"Color Wow Dream Coat has made a reputation as a game-changer in the world of hair care, and after trying it myself, I can see why. This product promises to transform frizzy, unruly hair into sleek, glossy, and humidity-resistant locks, and it delivers on this promise remarkably well I recommend this product as it has made a remarkable difference to my hair routine on the daily.\" It's also highly praised by those with textured hair types, one review said: \"My dry, wavy hair is in love with this product. I was already a huge fan of Dream Coat, but this has taken things up a level. My hair goes very frizzy when humidity hits it and the original Dream Coat helped counter that to some extent. But this is even better. In fact quite a bit better. I've recently bought a second reserve bottle in case stock runs out. This is without doubt . Highly recommend.\" However, one customer didn't love the feel of the product, they said: \"This does tame your frizz however I didn’t like how it felt on my hair (but I am fussy with feeling product in my hair I like it to feel light and clean ) I have thick curly hair ( I’m mixed race ) for hair preference my mum used it and she has straight hair that frizzes and it tamed her hair well , definitely think it works different on different hair types\".

        "description": "The ruling AAP and the Congress, both INDIA bloc partners, are fighting against each other in Punjab; former alliance partners BJP and SAD are contesting on all seats separately; the BSP is also for the first time contesting alone on all the seats in the State",
        "content": "As Punjab heads for the 2024 parliamentary election, it appears embroiled in a four-cornered electoral battle between key political parties, even as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which came to power with a thumping majority in the State in 2022, faces a critical test in its popularity and appeal. The ruling AAP and the Congress, both INDIA bloc partners, are fighting against each other in Punjab. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alliance partners from 1996 to 2020, when the SAD broke away from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition, are contesting the election on all seats separately. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is also for the first time contesting alone on all the seats in the State. The Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), led by Simranjit Singh Mann, a known Sikh hardliner, has also fielded its candidates. The 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab will go to the polls on June 1 in the last phase of the General Election. In 2019, the parliamentary election was largely a triangular fight between the Congress, the SAD-BJP (as alliance partners), and the AAP, which in 2024 has become a multi-cornered contest. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Congress won eight seats, securing 41% vote share, while the AAP got one seat (7% vote share), and the BJP (9% of the vote share) and SAD (28% vote share) won two seats each. The AAP is in power in Punjab and is seeking votes on its performance and policies. The upcoming election will be a critical test to ascertain the two-and-half-year-old AAP government’s popularity in Punjab as it is halfway through its tenure and an anti-incumbency factor can’t be ruled out. The prestige and leadership skills of Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, who is leading the election campaign, are at stake. The AAP made its mark in Punjab with a thumping majority in the 2022 Assembly election, but the party faced a major setback within months as it lost the parliamentary byelection in Sangrur, hitherto its bastion. However, its win in the Jalandhar parliamentary byelection in 2023 came as a consolation to the party. As campaigning reaches its last leg, the AAP is attempting to garner people’s sympathy over the arrest of party supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as it continues to target the BJP government at the Centre, blaming it for placing democracy and the Constitution in danger. Even as it throws salvos at its opponents, the AAP is facing confrontations on the ground as farmer groups have been questioning AAP leaders on the non-fulfilment of promises, including minimum support prices on crops, which was made during the 2022 Assembly election. Opposition parties have also been cornering the AAP government in the State over various unmet promises and governance failures. Not providing a monthly pension of ₹1,000 to women in Punjab is one of the key promises for which the AAP is facing heat from the Opposition. The Congress, which is the principal Opposition in Punjab, is focusing on the anti-incumbency factor against the AAP in the State and the BJP at the Centre. The Congress’ backing of the farmers’ agitation on the Delhi border against the now repealed farm sector laws, and the latest agitation on the Punjab-Haryana borders, is a key factor on which the party pins its hopes. The Congress’ manifesto, which promises to waive the debt of farmers and ensure there will be a legal guarantee for minimum support prices (MSP), is another factor based on which it hopes to give a tough fight and surpass its 2019 performance when, under the leadership of then Congress CM Captain (retd.) Amarinder Singh, who later joined the BJP, the party had won eight seats. Punjab Lok Sabha election Over 2 crore voters to decide fate of candidates for Punjab’s 13 seats In Punjab, BSP’s ‘chronic spoilsport’ role continues to shrink, yet it may be spoilsport on handful seats The saffron push in Punjab BJP blames AAP for ‘failing to deliver on promises’ in Punjab In Punjab, AAP striving hard to secure a win in LS polls The SAD, a century-old regional party, which has been going through a rough patch following electoral drubbings in the 2017 and 2022 Assembly elections, is making desperate efforts to return to the panthic (Sikh) agenda to regain its relevance in State politics. The party in its manifesto has made a panthic and ‘pro-Punjab’ pitch, emphasising a democratic and federal structure with political and fiscal autonomy for the State, giving a twin call for ‘Panthic principles above politics, and Punjab for Punjabis’. Going solo in the battle, the BJP, which has been facing the farmers’ wrath, is attempting to make inroads into Punjab with an outreach to Sikhs and Scheduled Castes (SCs), and fresh politics of social engineering. SCs account for around 32% of the population, the highest percentage among all States in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week in his rally in Patiala highlighted that the BJP had developed five ‘Panchteerth’ holy sites dedicated to the life of B.R. Ambedkar. In Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP is in power, a temple dedicated to Sant Ravidass is being constructed, and in U.P.’s Varanasi, the site of Sant Ravidass’ birthplace is being expanded, Mr. Modi said, clearly indicating the party’s attempt at an SC outreach. Over the years, the BJP had been contesting the electoral battle in Punjab as a ‘junior partner’ in its alliance with the SAD, but after the SAD quit the alliance, the BJP has been aggressively busy with the party’s expansion in the State. During the alliance period with the SAD, the BJP contested three Lok Sabha seats — Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, and Gurdaspur — while the remaining 10 seats were with the Akali Dal. After the alliance with the SAD broke up, the BJP inducted several Sikhs into the party, including Capt. (retd.) Amarinder Singh, and former Congress leader Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, in an attempt to build its pro-Sikh image. While in alliance with the SAD, the BJP’s electoral base had largely been urban Punjab. Now, it’s attempting to reach out to rural areas, especially to the farming Jat Sikhs, who traditionally supported the Congress, and lately the AAP, which came to power in the previous Assembly election. The BJP has been persuasively conveying the message, through its public rallies and other platforms, on several decisions taken in the interest of Sikhs since 2014, when it formed the government at the Centre. The BSP, which has witnessed a gradual decrease in its vote share over the years in Punjab’s political space, is focusing on Dalits as a political plank by raising the issues faced by Scheduled Castes to garner support. The key candidates for in the ongoing parliamentary election include Congress party State president Amarinder Singh Raja Warring from the Ludhiana Lok Sabha constituency, who will be facing the BJP’s Ravneet Singh Bittu, a former Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP from Ludhiana and the grandson of the late Chief Minister Beant Singh. Congress MLA Sukhjinder Randhawa is contesting from the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat, which is currently represented by the Bollywood actor Sunny Deol of the BJP. The party has dropped Mr. Deol and fielded three-time MLA Dinesh Singh Babbu instead this time. The AAP has fielded Amansher Singh Kalsi. The AAP’s lone Lok Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Rinku, who left the party and joined the BJP, is the latter party’s candidate from Jalandhar. Former Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi has been fielded by the Congress in Jalandhar. The AAP has fielded former MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu, while Mohinder Singh Kaypee is the SAD’s candidate here. In Bathinda, the BJP has fielded former 2011 batch IAS officer Parampal Kaur Sidhu. Bathinda is currently represented by SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, wife of former Deputy CM and Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal. AAP Minister Gurmeet Singh Khuddian is also in the fray here. In Patiala, Dharamvir Gandhi is the Congress’ candidate, whereas the BJP has fielded Preneet Kaur, the former Congress leader and MP as its candidate. Ms. Kaur, a four-time MP and a former Union Minister, is the wife of Capt. (retd.) Amarinder Singh. The AAP has fielded Punjab’s Health Minister Balbir Singh as its candidate from Patiala, while the SAD has fielded N.K. Sharma, a former MLA. In Amritsar, the AAP has fielded State Cabinet Minister Kuldeep Dhaliwal against Gurjeet Aujla of the Congress.

Addressing a presser, Rana Sanaullah who is also the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) intra-party Chief Election Commissioner said that the polls are being held in a ‘transparent’ manner. He said that the aspiring PML-N members could submit nomination papers from 10 am to 12 pm on May 28 and can withdraw the same by 2 pm on the same day. “The final list of candidates of the candidates will be released by 3 pm,” he added To a question, he said that former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi can also collect and submit nomination papers, adding that his eligibility will be decided by the scrutiny committee. Rana Sanaullah said that the PML-N’s president slot was vacated after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s resignation. He said that according to the party’s constitution, the election process has started. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is likely to return unopposed as the PML-N president. According to the agenda of the PML-N general council session, it will elect the party’s president and approve amendments to the party’s constitution. Acting president of the party PM Shehbaz Sharif and newly elected president will address the session. The general council will also approve resolutions on Kashmir, Palestine and other matters during the session. The PML-N had earlier announced to hold the party’s general council meeting for the president’s election on May 11, but later decided to hold the session on the occasion Youm-e-Takbeer on May 28, the day marking the completion of 26 years since Pakistan’s nuclear tests on May 28th, 1998.",

But with a “slimmed down monarchy” in place, the royal family still appears to be stretched.

        "content": "In 2011, I sat in the Guggenheim Museum in New York and watched Rupert Murdoch announce the beginning of a “new digital renaissance” for news. The newspaper mogul was unveiling an iPad-inspired publication called The Daily. “The iPad demands that we completely reimagine our craft,” he said. The Daily shut down the following year, after burning through a reported $40 million. For as long as I have reported on internet companies, I have watched news leaders try to bend their businesses to the will of Apple, Google, Meta, and more. Chasing tech’s distribution and cash, news firms strike deals to try to ride out the next digital wave. They make concessions to platforms that attempt to take all of the audience (and trust) that great journalism attracts, without ever having to do the complicated and expensive work of the journalism itself. And it never, ever works as planned. Publishers like News Corp did it with Apple and the iPad, investing huge sums in flashy content that didn’t make them any money but helped Apple sell more hardware. They took payouts from Google to offer their journalism for free through search, only to find that it eroded their subscription businesses. They lined up to produce original video shows for Facebook and to reformat their articles to work well in its new app. Then the social-media company canceled the shows and the app. Many news organizations went out of business. The Wall Street Journal recently laid off staffers who were part of a Google-funded program to get journalists to post to YouTube channels when the funding for the program dried up. And still, just as the news business is entering a death spiral, these publishers are making all the same mistakes, and more, with AI. Adrienne LaFrance: The coming humanist renaissance Publishers are deep in negotiations with tech firms such as OpenAI to sell their journalism as training for the companies’ models. It turns out that accurate, well-written news is one of the most valuable sources for these models, which have been hoovering up humans’ intellectual output without permission. These AI platforms need timely news and facts to get consumers to trust them. And now, facing the threat of lawsuits, they are pursuing business deals to absolve them of the theft. These deals amount to settling without litigation. The publishers willing to roll over this way aren’t just failing to defend their own intellectual property—they are also trading their own hard-earned credibility for a little cash from the companies that are simultaneously undervaluing them and building products quite clearly intended to replace them. Late last year Axel Springer, the European publisher that owns Politico and Business Insider, sealed a deal with OpenAI reportedly worth tens of millions of dollars over several years. OpenAI has been offering other publishers $1 million to $5 million a year to license their content. News Corp’s new five-year deal with OpenAI is reportedly valued at as much as $250 million in cash and OpenAI credits. Conversations are heating up. As its negotiations with OpenAI failed, The New York Times sued the firm—as did Alden Global Capital, which owns the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune. They were brave moves, although I worry that they are likely to end in deals too. That media companies would rush to do these deals after being so burned by their tech deals of the past is extraordinarily distressing. And these AI partnerships are far worse for publishers. Ten years ago, it was at least plausible to believe that tech companies would become serious about distributing news to consumers. They were building actual products such as Google News. Today’s AI chatbots are so early and make mistakes often. Just this week, Google’s AI suggested you should glue cheese to pizza crust to keep it from slipping off. OpenAI and others say they are interested in building new models for distributing and crediting news, and many news executives I respect believe them. But it’s hard to see how any AI product built by a tech company would create meaningful new distribution and revenue for news. These companies are using AI to disrupt internet search—to help users find a single answer faster than browsing a few links. So why would anyone want to read a bunch of news articles when an AI could give them the answer, maybe with a tiny footnote crediting the publisher that no user will ever click on? Companies act in their interest. But OpenAI isn’t even an ordinary business. It’s a nonprofit (with a for-profit arm) that wants to promote general artificial intelligence that benefits humanity—though it can’t quite decide what that means. Even if its executives were ardent believers in the importance of news, helping journalism wouldn’t be on their long-term priority list. Ross Andersen: Does Sam Altman know what he’s creating? That’s all before we talk about how to price the news. Ask six publishers how they should be paid by these tech companies, and they will spout off six different ideas. One common idea publishers describe is getting a slice of the tech companies’ revenue based on the percentage of the total training data their publications represent. That’s impossible to track, and there’s no way tech companies would agree to it. Even if they did agree to it, there would be no way to check their calculations—the data sets used for training are vast and inscrutable. And let’s remember that these AI companies are themselves struggling to find a consumer business model. How do you negotiate for a slice of something that doesn’t yet exist? The news industry finds itself in this dangerous spot, yet again, in part because it lacks a long-term focus and strategic patience. Once-family-owned outlets, such as The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, have been sold to interested billionaires. Others, like The Wall Street Journal, are beholden to the public markets and face coming generational change among their owners. Television journalism is at the whims of the largest media conglomerates, which are now looking to slice, dice, and sell off their empires at peak market value. Many large media companies are run by executives who want to live to see another quarter, not set up their companies for the next 50 years. At the same time, the industry’s lobbying power is eroding. A recent congressional hearing on the topic of AI and news was overshadowed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson. Tech companies clearly have far more clout than media companies. Things are about to get worse. Legacy and upstart media alike are bleeding money and talent by the week. More outlets are likely to shut down, while others will end up in the hands of powerful individuals using them for their own agendas (see the former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy’s activist play for BuzzFeed). The long-term solutions are far from clear. But the answer to this moment is painfully obvious. Publishers should be patient and refrain from licensing away their content for relative pennies. They should protect the value of their work, and their archives. They should have the integrity to say no. It’s simply too early to get into bed with the companies that trained their models on professional content without permission and have no compelling case for how they will help build the news business. Instead of keeping their business-development departments busy, newsrooms should focus on what they do best: making great journalism and serving it up to their readers. Technology companies aren’t in the business of news. And they shouldn’t be. Publishers have to stop looking to them to rescue the news business. We must start saving ourselves. Publisher",

        "content": "Receipt of a kidney from a deceased donor who underwent dialysis is associated with an increased incidence of delayed graft function, according to a study published online May 23 in JAMA . Yumeng Wen, M.D., Ph.D., from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and colleagues compared outcomes of transplant recipients who received kidneys from deceased donors who underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation versus recipients of kidneys from deceased donors who did not undergo dialysis in a retrospective cohort study using data from 58 U.S. organ procurement organizations. Among the donors with kidneys transplanted, 514 underwent dialysis prior to transplantation and were matched to 514 who did not undergo dialysis. The researchers found that compared with kidney transplants from donors who did not receive dialysis, kidney transplants from donors who received dialysis prior to donation had an increased risk for delayed graft function (59.2 versus 24.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 4.17). At a median follow-up of 34.1 months, the incidence rates did not differ significantly for all-cause graft failure, death-censured graft failure, or death for transplants from donors who received dialysis prior to donation versus donors who did not receive dialysis. \"Future research should investigate whether the higher procurement and acceptance rates of kidneys from deceased donors who received dialysis are associated with shorter waiting times and better outcomes for patients,\" the authors write.

HMWS&SB managing director Sudarshan Reddy held a review with officials at “Jala Soudha” on the steps needed to be taken during the monsoons to prevent untoward incidents due to rains, water-logging and opening of manholes, among other issues. Reddy instructed officials to assign a person to each of the 120 water-logging hotspots for regular inspection, and sewage supervisors to check deep manholes. HMWS&SB has already installed safety grills to deep manholes in most of them located within the GHMC areas and will be installing the same in the peripheral areas as well. The board has decided to paint manholes by the side of the roads red and to install flags and safety boards near deep manholes. Officials have also been informed to prevent drinking water contamination in areas where drinking water pipelines are located near the nala crossings. A central safety protocol team comprising six members headed by the chief vigilance officer as its chief safety protocol officer an emergency response team, a safety protocol team, and a patrolling team will be pushed into force to effectively manage the drinking water and sanitation situation during the monsoons. Officials have been asked to prepare a monsoon management plan and prepare a daily situation report to track the works. GHMC and police personnel will be working in coordination",

        "content": "The U.S. military has released photos of the B-21 Raider in flight as the futuristic warplane moves closer to becoming the nation's next nuclear stealth bomber. The B-21 Raider began flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the Air Force said in a statement , as the plane \"continues to make progress toward becoming the backbone of the U.S. Air Force bomber fleet.\" One photograph shows the bomber soaring above the clouds while another image shows the aircraft just above the runway. A B-21 Raider conducts ground testing, taxiing and flying operations at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. United States Air Force The Air Force is planning to build 100 of the warplanes, which have a flying wing shape much like their predecessor the B-2 Spirit but will incorporate advanced materials, propulsion and stealth technology to make them more survivable in a future conflict. The plane is planned to be produced in variants with and without pilots. \"We are in the flight test program, the flight test program is proceeding well,\" Andrew Hunter , assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, said during testimony at the Senate Armed Services Committee this month. \"It is doing what flight test programs are designed to do, which is helping us learn about the unique characteristics of this platform, but in a very, very effective way.\" The B-21 Raider is the first new American bomber aircraft in more than 30 years, and almost every aspect of the program is classified. Both Northrop Grumman and the Air Force have tried to protect the program's details to prevent China from gaining access to the weapon's technology and building a similar version, as it has with other U.S. advanced weapons systems like the F-35 joint strike fighter. The Air Force said the B-21 is \"the first aircraft that is more digital than not.\" A B-21 Raider conducts ground testing, taxiing and flying operations at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. United States Air Force At the bomber's unveiling in December 2022 , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the range of the B-21 is unmatched by any other bomber. \"It won't need to be based in-theater, it won't need logistical support to hold any target at risk,\" the secretary said. Austin said it will be difficult for adversaries to detect the stealth aircraft. \"Fifty years of advances in low-observable technology have gone into this aircraft,\" he said. \"Even the most sophisticated air-defense systems will struggle to detect a B-21 in the sky.\" The B-21 Raider stealth bomber is unveiled at Northrop Grumman, Dec. 2, 2022, in Palmdale, Calif.

        "content": "In scenes grimly familiar from a war in its eighth month, Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after the strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel said initial investigations showed an attack against commanders of the Hamas militant group set off the fire. New Delhi: An Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt the assault. In scenes grimly familiar from a war in its eighth month, Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after the strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel said initial investigations showed an attack against commanders of the Hamas militant group set off the fire. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit. “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” The attack took place in the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel’s military said Sunday’s strike, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X. Outraged by the Israeli strikes that have killed many displaced persons in Rafah. These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 27, 2024 Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said. NO SAFE ZONE By daylight, the camp was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. “What have they done to deserve this? Their children have been orphaned.” Hospitals in Rafah, including the International Committee of the Red Cross field hospital, were unable to handle all the wounded, so some were moved to hospitals in Khan Younis further north in Gaza for treatment, medics said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned “the heinous massacre.” Israeli tanks continued to bombard eastern and central areas of the city in southern Gaza on Monday, killing eight, local health officials said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza’s Hamas-run interior ministry said. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. “On top of the hunger, on top of the starvation, the refusal to allow aid in sufficient volumes, what we witnessed last night is barbaric,” Ireland’s Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said. Egypt condemned the Israeli military’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. Saudi Arabiaand the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Israeli tanks have probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, since May 6 and have entered some of its eastern districts.",

        "content": "The most difficult films to watch are not thrillers and horror, but war films. However, this genre is usually adored by both critics and audiences. One of the most iconic films about the First World War is the film \"1917\" by Sam Mendes, which is released on the Netflix streaming platform on June 1, Stare Facts writes. The film has a rating of 8.2/10 on IMDb, while Rotten Tomatoes critics gave it 88% positive reviews. Why you should watch \"1917\" Unlike many war movies, \"1917\" takes viewers back to the First World War, not a few decades ago. This is what sets \"1917\" apart from many other films of this genre, giving it a unique atmosphere and shedding light on historical events. Directed and produced by Sam Mendes, the film follows two British soldiers, Will and Tom, as they try to deliver an important message to a battalion that is trapped. With not only their lives at stake, but the lives of hundreds of others, the duo must demonstrate strength and determination to get out alive. The film has been called a \"technical miracle\" because the editors were able to create the impression that the entire movie was shot in two takes by using long takes. The technical nature of the film, as well as its stunning visuals, allowed \"1917\" to win three Academy Awards. With a budget of about $100 million, the film grossed $384 million at the box office, making it a commercial success.

        "content": "Food enthusiasts and culinary experts might be taken aback, but a jar of sauce can be a lifesaver when you're pressed for time and need to whip up a tasty family meal. Many people will opt to cook a curry from scratch, but the list of ingredients can be overwhelming (and most of them end up being discarded after a few weeks). During a rushed shopping trip at this week, reporter She had around seven minutes to complete and pick up her daughter from school in very heavy rain. So, she opted for convenience and grabbed a jar of Deluxe Butter Chicken (£1.49). Her 'curry night' list also included a 1kg pack of chicken thighs (£2.85), naan breads (£0.69p for two), natural yoghurt (£0.79) and deluxe mango chutney (£1.69) for dipping. This is what Amy Fenton had to say about her Lidl chicken curry: The meal could have served four people (with any leftovers saved), making it a very reasonable £1.80 per person. The cooking instructions are incredibly straightforward. First, brown the chicken, then add the spice tub from the top of the jar, and after 30 seconds, pour in the sauce and cook until the chicken is tender. I added my own twist to this by only searing the chicken thighs for colour before adding the jar, then baking it at 160C for about 45 minutes. This method gives you a crispy skin and succulent meat. There might be culinary purists who would never consider using a jar of sauce. However, this butter chicken was one of the most delicious curries I've ever had. And believe me, I've tried quite a few. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the naan breads were simultaneously soft and crunchy, the yoghurt provided a cooling effect, and the chutney added a fruity and spicy kick to the meal. I dare anyone to make a better curry, at the same price, in such a short amount of time.",

Latest data from the WTTC suggests by the end of this year, Canada’s tourism sector will be supporting 1.84 billion jobs in the country, roughly 120,000 more than in the years before Covid. Tourism’s contribution to Canada’s national economy is set to reach a record high of nearly $182bn this year; nearly $8.1bn above its previous peak. Tourism’s economic contribution grew by 25% last year and spending by international tourists hit nearly $44bn. Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said: “Travel & Tourism is set to break all records in Canada. The government backed Tourism Growth Program, with its $108MN in federal funding, will further boost both the economy and jobs over the coming year. “The Travel & Tourism sector is very strong and creating economic value and jobs. Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal stand out as popular destinations amongst international visitors.” © ITTN.ie",

        "content": "Antihypertensive drugs are associated with an increased risk for eczematous dermatitis in older adults, and the effect sizes are largest for diuretics and calcium channel blockers, according to a study published May 22 in JAMA Dermatology . Morgan Ye, M.P.H., from the University of California in San Francisco, and colleagues examined whether antihypertensive drug use is associated with eczematous dermatitis in a longitudinal cohort study of individuals aged 60 years and older without eczematous dermatitis at baseline. The researchers found that the overall prevalence of eczematous dermatitis was 6.7% among 1,561,358 older adults during a median follow-up of six years. The incidence of eczematous dermatitis was higher among those receiving versus those not receiving antihypertensive drugs (12 versus 9 of 1,000 person-years of follow-up). Participants who received any antihypertensive drugs had a significantly increased risk for any eczematous dermatitis in adjusted analyses (hazard ratio, 1.29). When assessing each antihypertensive drug class individually, the largest effect sizes were seen for diuretics and calcium channel blockers , while the effect sizes were smallest for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers (hazard ratios, 1.21, 1.16, 1.02, and 1.04, respectively). \"Although additional research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the association of antihypertensive drug use and eczematous dermatitis, these data could be helpful to clinicians to guide clinical management when an older patient presents with eczematous dermatitis,\" the authors write.

        "content": "THE CONSTRUCTION of a new Cullivoe road is now expected to start in March 2025. An update provided to councillors also confirmed a planning application for the work was recently submitted. A new 6.8 metre two-lane road between Gutcher and Cullivoe in Yell is Shetland Islands Council’s (SIC) highest priority major road development but it has fallen behind a previous timescale. The briefing to elected members said there has been a delay in the delivery of a final environmental impact assessment, which means that a full business case will only be able to go in front of councillors in December. Last year it was revealed that the estimated cost of the new road had risen to £9.9 million. The project is still listed as an unfunded project in the SIC’s asset investment plan ahead of the final business case being approved. A few years ago, councillors approved the idea of creating a two-lane road between Gutcher and Cullivoe, but many have expressed a desire to see things move quicker. It is an important link for aquaculture and fishing traffic which runs to and from Cullivoe Pier, but the current single track road is in poor condition. The update to councillors said that in relation to land acquisition missives have been concluded on four plots with draft qualified acceptance received for two more. Confirmation as to whether de-crofting is required for one plot is also being sought. But this drew concern from North Isles councillor Robert Thomson at a meeting of the SIC’s environment and transport committee on Monday, who said it was “almost astonishing” this had not been figured out yet at this stage of the process. He also said there had been “undue delays” around the process and called for things to move forward as quickly as possible. Infrastructure director John Smith said councillors would remain updated and added that “everybody is keeping their eye on the ball”. There was a warning to councillors though that land acquisition and planning consent are “critical activities over which the roads service has no direct control, therefore there is still a risk that these activities could delay the project”. The council said the final EIA was completed on 17 May, which includes a peat management plan. Meanwhile the briefing to councillors also highlights that a suspensive condition the roads department had placed on the development of proposed caravan pitches at Cullivoe Pier has now been lifted. These pitches are part of a wider upgrade of the area around the pier led by the North Yell Development Council (NYDC), which involves a new marina and plots for businesses. Roads staff had been concerned about a potential increase in the number of caravans being towed along the existing road and the visibility for drivers, but this has been removed following a site visit. Speaking in response to the news, NYDC director Andrew Nisbet said “as soon as we get clearance from planning we will develop the park as soon as we can”. There had also previously been a restriction on new development in the Cullivoe area due to the condition of the existing road but that was lifted last year. At Monday’s meeting committee chair councillor Moraig Lyall said it was “great” news that a planning application had now been submitted.",

        "content": "The manager of Manchester City, is reportedly set to leave the Premier League giants after next season. Pep Guardiola has been in charge of Manchester City for 8 years and has made the club one of the most feared sides in the world. Premier League clubs like Liverpool and Arsenal, who have had to serve as second fiddles to Manchester City in the last seven years due to the tactical prowess of Pep Guardiola, will be excited to hear that the Spanish tactician is on his way out. Note that Pep Guardiola, who signed his first contract with Manchester City in 2016, has just 12 months left on his current contract with the side. He is reportedly not interested in extending his stay at the club beyond the 2024-2025 season. Recall that Guardiola has won virtually everything in club football in his eight years at the Etihad Stadium including six Premier League titles, one UEFA Champions League, one FIFA Club World Cup, and one Super Cup. A report by the Daily Mail claimed that Manchester City would allow Pep Guardiola who has won 15 major titles at the club to make the final decision on his future. They however want the Spanish tactician to extend his stay at the club. If Manchester City fail to convince Guardiola to stay at the club beyond next season, the Spanish giants will consider Girona’s Michel. Other football managers that are said to be on City’s radar are Germany national team coach, Julian Nagelsmann, Bayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso, and former Brighton coach Roberto De Zerbi.",

        "content": "On on Friday, Stephen A. Smith revealed some derogatory remarks on Boston Celtics player Jaylen Brown that he had heard from an \"NBA source.\" The segment has caused quite a stir on social media, becoming a huge talking point over the weekend. Smith, Kendrick Perkins, and Jay Williams debated on Friday whether Brown was the NBA's most underappreciated player. He mentioned in closing remarks that he had received a text from an NBA source. According to the unnamed insider, Brown isn't underappreciated—rather, \"he's just not liked.\" \"I wanted to read to y'all what an NBA source just sent me,\" Smith said. \"He said, 'Jaylen Brown, it's not so much that he's underrated, it's that he's just not liked because of his I-am-better-than-you attitude. He knows it. It's the same reason he is not as marketable as he should be.' That's what an NBA source just sent me.\" Smith continued by noting that while he personally liked Brown, he did question whether the source's claims were accurate. The remarks started a beef with NBA Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas, who called what Stephen A. did slander. Brown eventually responded on Twitter, quoting a video of the remarks with \"State your source.\" Now, Stephen A. Smith since he went back to X to reiterate his position. \"First off, that's not happening. It's journalism. Not revealing sources,\" wrote the Smith. \"Secondly, if you continue to watch the segment, I completely disagreed with them — as did Kendrick Perkins. The point we were actually discussing is how under appreciated you are and why that may be, which is why I read the quote. I even brought up how socially conscious you are, and how that may not be liked, knowing you're a good brother. Also, that you're a $300M man and you deserve it. But that doesn't mean naysayers don't get heard. That comes with the territory.\" In response to the original video, Kendrick Perkins expressed his frustration as well, stating that it omits their uplifting discussion about Brown's off-court activities. Ultimately, Stephen A. is sure to address this drama in today's edition of The anonymous source being able to just trash players with no consequences is nothing new. It was wild that Stephen A. even brought that quote up because it was so disparaging. Overall, the saga may continue this week. [ ]",

        "description": "In an interview with The Hindu Egyptian author and sociolinguist Reem Bassiouney talks about infusing the modern Egyptian identities in her works with echoes of the past, and more",
        "content": "Egyptian author and sociolinguist Reem Bassiouney recently won the Sheikh Zayed Book Award for Literature, for her book Al Halwani: The Fatimid Trilogy. Bassiouney heads the Linguistics Department at The American University in Cairo and is also editor of the Routledge Studies Series on Language and Identity. Apart from her work in sociolinguistics, Bassiouney is also known for her fiction, which includes her historical novel, Al-Qata’i: The Ibn Tulun Trilogy translated from the Arabic by Roger Allen, and Sons of the People: The Mamluk Trilogy, also translated by Allen and winner of the Naguib Mahfouz Award. Excerpts from an interview: Could you talk about how your work in sociolinguistics affects and informs your fiction, and vice-versa? Yes, being a sociolinguist really affects my writing because I do not just search the historical period, I also search the social history and the development of language as well as language change. For example in the Ibn Tulun trilogy I traced language death in Egypt and how Coptic was replaced eventually by Arabic. Multilingualism is also an essential part of Islamic medieval history which I emphasise. I specialise in people and identity, and I write about people and identity in my work. In your fiction, you often navigate the complexities of modern Egyptian identity — I’d love to know a little about how the process begins — does the story come first, or the subject that you’re looking to explore and examine through the story? Each work has its own story and character. Sometimes I start with a compelling idea. Sometimes a character really interests me such as Badr the Armenian in Al Halwani or Ahmed Ibn Tulun in the Tulun Trilogy . Sometimes a place or a monument affects me and moves me such as Sultan Hassan Mosque in The Mamluk trilogy. But in all my novels I am concerned with people, their actions and feelings. Initial expectations from the anglophone world — of the kind of English language literature that will come out of the countries from the Middle-East, the South Asian subcontinent and the Far east — are breaking more and more. How has the reception of your own work been in the world — do you see a shift in the gaze? I do not see one yet. I feel the Anglophone world should really try to make reading fiction from the global south a necessary part of any curriculum. Learning that people are all similar, nourishes tolerance and understanding. Also I feel the emphasis is still on the bizarre and stereotypical, not the normal and everyday existence of people. How do you navigate linguistic diversity and code-switching in your narratives, and what effect do you hope it has on readers? The medieval Islamic world is a diverse multilingual and multicultural point in the history of mankind. This needs to be highlighted and I try to do this. In cultures rich with mythology and history, literature that comes from the modern world also carries echoes of the past within it — Indian literature often has this characteristic. Would you say your work is informed by these qualities too? And if so, how do you explore them? Yes very much so. Cultures that have long histories consider history as part of their modern identity. This is true for both India and Egypt. Everything is historical in its own way. I speak about this in my academic work. For example my book Language and Identity in modern Egypt talks about historicity as an important component in identity. The same is true in my fiction, even in my fiction that is based on modern day, history is present and strong.

        "content": "DJ Akademiks is easily one of the . Overall, he is known for having some massive hot takes. Furthermore, he is controversial thanks to the way he has covered hip-hop. He is also controversial for the . Having said that, Akademiks remains a prominent guest on podcasts and shows. People want his opinion on the culture, especially when you consider what is going on with , as well as & . Recently, Akademiks was on a podcast with Lamar Odom, where they spoke on the subject of Diddy. It was here where Akademiks revealed three ways in which Diddy could change public perception. Although it may not protect him from legal scrutiny, he thinks there is a way Diddy can win people over. As he explains, coming out as either gay or trans would be one option. Moreover, he could say that his actions were the result of poor mental health and that he is now seeking therapy. Lastly, Akademiks believes if Diddy were to say he was molested as a child, it would give him an excuse for his alleged behavior. All three of these excuses are pretty outlandish and one has to wonder if Ak really believes this would work. For now, Diddy's public perception is the worst it has ever been, and it is going to take a lot for that to change. At this point, the mogul may want to hold off on hiring Ak as a strategist. Let us know what you think of these theories from DJ Akademiks, in the comments section down below. Do you believe that he is correct with these assessments? Or do you believe that what he is saying is a bit too insensitive and outlandish? Additionally, stay tuned to for the latest news and updates from around the music world.

        "content": "If you're one of the millions of Americans walking around with a new knee or hip, your odds for an infection in that joint rise if you ever have to undergo cancer chemotherapy, researchers report. \"Given the number of people of receiving total joint replacements each year, as well as the cost both physically, emotionally and financially for those who develop an infection and may need subsequent treatment, we need to understand what factors may increase the risk for postoperative infections,\" said study author Dr. Janet Conway. She's an orthopedic surgeon at the Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics, and is also head of Bone and Joint Infection at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. Her team tracked outcomes for over 17,000 patients who had undergone total knee replacement , total hip replacement or total shoulder replacement. They looked at people who'd also undergone chemotherapy within a year of their joint replacement surgery. Undergoing chemo appeared tied to a higher odds for an infection in the joint that had been replaced, the team found, compared to folks with new joints who had not undergone chemo. \"We became curious about the potential effects of postoperative chemotherapy and the risk of joint infection as we saw cases in our own joint replacement patients,\" Conway explained in a Sinai Hospital news release. \"To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively investigate the potential risk of postoperative joint infection for patients who later receive chemotherapy,\" she added. Conway believes more study is needed among people undergoing chemotherapy, to help find way to protect folks with joint replacements from unnecessary infections. Th findings were published in the May issue of Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery .

        "description": "Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency while on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles.",
        "content": "Boxing heavyweight legend Mike Tyson is \"doing great\" after suffering a medical emergency while on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, seeing paramedics rush onto the plane at LAX less than two months out from his professional return to the squared circle against Jake Paul on Netflix . Tyson began feeling nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up, his reps have confirmed. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great. He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him,\" a statement read. According to In Touch, paramedics were alerted before the plane landed on Sunday as an announcement for a doctor was issued. “Mike had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded,” an eyewitness told the outlet. “Before the paramedics arrived the flight issued an announcement asking for a doctor — the message even came on everyone’s screens.\" Once the plane landed in LA, passenger departure off American Airlines flight 1815 was delayed while paramedics attended to the former heavyweight King. \"He was in first class, but we were an exit row and the stewardess was very chatty. They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter,” the eyewitness added. “She said something like, ‘He’s a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he’s OK.’ I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words ‘Mike Tyson’ and she nodded her head yes.” The latest health scare will raise questions over Tyson's scheduled professional comeback fight against YouTube star-turned-boxer, Paul , who's three decades his junior and in his Prime. Concerns over Tyson's health were prominent at the time of the fight's announcement, with Iron Mike previously been spotted using a support cane. Sparring footage was released, though, to show the 57-year-old is still in decent shape and can pack a punch, like the old days. Tyson last fought in an exhibition against fellow retired boxing great, Roy Jones Jr., in 2020. Before that, his last sanctioned professional bout was a TKO loss to Kevin McBride in June 2005. Tyson and Paul will throw down on July 20 inside the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, if the latest health scare doesn't throw the main event out of the window. Over 90,000 fans are expected to be in attendance for the fight, which will also be streamed on Netflix, as the streaming giant looks to make its way into broadcasting live sports events. \"It's crazy to think about but as many people as can fit in the stadium, I think it's 90,000 or 93,000,\" he told TMZ Sports. \"I think it's going to be packed to the brim and the global viewership could be in the hundreds of millions. It's wild and it doesn't make any sense but the fact Netflix are part of this is the perfect piece of the puzzle. \"It makes it the perfect trifecta of Netflix's audience, my audience and Mike Tyson's audience. And to the kids at home, [it says] don't listen to the critics. Do you and don't be afraid to knock down the doors of opportunity because you truly never know where it's going to lead you.\"",

        "content": "A total of 82 nursing students who fell ill after eating food in their college hostel were hospitalised in Salem on Monday. The students were studying in a college at Kuppanur in Salem district. On Sunday afternoon, 20 students fell ill after eating the food provided to them in the hostel, and were admitted to a private hospital on Omalur Main Road that was run by the college administration. After a few hours of observation, they were sent back to the hostel. News of the incident spread on social media and, on Monday, health officials rushed to the college to check on the students, and found that a few of them were suffering from dehydration. Following this, the Health Department sent a total of 82 students to the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital (GMKMCH) for treatment. Three of them who were suffering from severe dehydration and two with moderate dehydration were admitted to the emergency ward, and later, all but one were shifted to the general ward. A total of 25 students were treated as out-patients. As a precaution, all the students were kept in the ward for 24 hours of observation, health officials said. GMKMCH dean R. Mani said that all of them were stable. Salem Collector R. Brindha Devi visited the students at the hospital. Officials of the Food Safety Department inspected the hostel and the kitchen on Monday. The Salem District Designated Officer for the Food Safety Department, Kathiravan, said that the college administration did not obtain permission from the department for running the hostel; the water used for cooking was not checked by the administration; and a medical check-up for the workers was also not conducted. The kitchen was cramped and lacked hygiene. Sewage had been mixed with the water used for cooking. The department took seven food samples and two water samples, which were sent to a laboratory for testing. A notice was issued to the college administration seeking an explanation for the shortcomings found during the inspection. The kitchen was temporarily closed, Dr. Kathiravan added. The Health Department also issued a notice to the college administration regarding the incident. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Salem",

        "content": "Sanctions on Israel should not be “off the table”, the Irish premier has said as he accused the nation’s officials of ignoring international courts. It comes after an attack on Rafah in which dozens of people were killed at a camp for displaced people. It followed a Hamas rocket attack on Tel Aviv. Last week, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah. Ireland, Norway and Spain will formally recognise Palestinian statehood on Tuesday. Speaking at a joint press conference in Brussels, Irish deputy premier Micheal Martin said the move was in search of a “fundamental paradigm shift” between a peaceful two-state solution to the conflict. He added: “Some have framed our decision to recognise the state of Palestine as a move to impose an outcome on the parties or as somehow a reward for terror. “Nothing could be further from the truth. We have recognised both the State of Israel and the state of Palestine precisely because we want to see a future of normalised relations between the two peoples.” Mr Martin said there can be no military solution to the conflict as he criticised any group using violence or terrorism to eliminate the state of Israel or Palestine. He said: “I condemn the violence of yesterday. The rockets that were struck at Tel Aviv and the heinous attack on the Rafah tent refugee camp where innocent children and civilians were killed.” He added: “What we witnessed last night is barbaric. Gaza is a very small enclave, densely populated conurbation. “One cannot bomb an area like that without shocking consequences in terms of innocent children and civilians.” Mr Martin, the Irish foreign affairs minister, called for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages. Elsewhere, Irish premier Simon Harris condemned the attack in Rafah as “absolutely unimaginable and unconscionable”. He said: “Overnight we have seen Israel attack a displaced person centre, a place where parents were told to flee with their children, and they bombed it.” Mr Harris defended Ireland’s decision to recognise Palestine as a state. He added: “We did recognition not to be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli but to be pro-peace. “You cannot have a two-state solution if you don’t recognise the existence of two states and we hope by moving with Norway and Spain to create some momentum there to keep that alive, that hope, that destination at a time when others are trying to bomb it into oblivion.” He told Ireland AM: “In relation to sanctions, I don’t think anything can be off the table when it comes to Israel, particularly with what we’re seeing currently happening in Rafah now, when we’re seeing the international community being ignored, when we’re seeing international courts being ignored.” Mr Harris said Ireland would intensify its calls for trade arrangements between Israel and the EU to be “reviewed”.",

        "content": "Memorial Day means firing up that backyard grill for the season, hopefully under warm, sunny skies. You can be sure to enjoy the day without hazards by taking a few simple precautions, said Dr. Mike Ren, an associate professor of family and community medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. If Memorial day is a scorcher, hydration is key, Ren said. \"A good rule of thumb is to drink water regularly throughout the day, aiming for 12 or more cups; when in the heat, drink one cup (eight ounces) of water roughly every 20 minutes,\" he advised. And stay away from substances that can rob your body of water. \"Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it increases urine production and can lead to fluid loss,\" Ren noted in a Baylor news release. \"On the other hand, sugary drinks can cause spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels,\" he added. \"Prioritizing water consumption is crucial for maintaining proper hydration levels. If you want to add a little flavor, low or zero-sugar electrolyte powders and supplements can be a good alternative.\" Folks may have forgotten the sun's dangers as winter and spring ebb away. Dr. John Wolf, professor of dermatology at Baylor, recommends slapping on a sunscreen with an SPF of 30, and using SPF 50 when participating in vigorous outdoor activities. Warmer weather means the return of flies, wasps, mosquitoes and other flying insects. To avoid stings, use insect repellents that include 20% to 30% DEET or picaridin and wear protective clothing with long sleeves and pants. \"Colorful clothing may attract insects,\" Wolf added. \"Avoid wearing strong perfumes in wooded areas and those with standing water that are likely to harbor mosquitoes and other insects.\" Gas grills harbor their own dangers, and every year Americans are harmed using these backyard broilers. Dr. Sara Andrabi, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Baylor, said the first order of business for grill users is to make sure the appliance is properly cleaned of the remains of last year's grilling. \"Location wise, make sure your grill is on a flat, stable surface and is away from buildings, decks or overhanging branches. Have a fire extinguisher ready, just in case,\" she said. Loose clothing and long sleeves are a no-no when working around a grill's open flame, Andrabi added. Grills are especially dangerous for kids and pets, so never leave a working grill unattended. Andrabi also had some tips about the foods you place on the grill. First off, take the time to let any frozen meat or other food thaw gently in the refrigerator, not a kitchen counter. \"When frozen food gets warmer or is at room temperature for more than a few hours, it's in the danger zone where bacteria can multiply very quickly,\" Andrabi explained. And, \"if you store raw meats in the refrigerator, store them away from other foods to prevent cross-contamination,\" she said. \"Once grilled, use a food thermometer to know that your meats have reached the appropriate temperature.\" More information: The American Red Cross has more on summer safety . © 2024 HealthDay .

        "content": "Dozens of accommodation centres for Ukrainian refugees are set to close, the Taoiseach has said. Almost 70 contracts for Ukrainian refugee accommodation will expire “shortly”, according to Simon Harris. Mr Harris said that many hotel and community facilities which were being used as refugee accommodation will made available again for local use. Speaking to Ireland AM on Virgin Media, Mr Harris said that the state needs to move “beyond this emergency response” to migration. “Firstly, we need to stop taking the only hotel in the town and there is some good news in relation to this,” he added. “In Co Kerry, for example, we’ve been able to put two hotels that had been used for migration back into use. There are 68 contracts currently being used for Ukrainian accommodation that will not be used shortly and that we’ll see many hotels and other facilities coming back into their community, that’s important for communities to see and to know. “The second thing though is, and I’ve been very honest about this, we have to stop the conversation about migration only being about accommodation. “If you do that you’re going to completely lose the people in this country, you’re going to see a breakdown in social cohesion. “I believe very strongly that Irish people are compassionate. I really believe it. Irish communities have done an incredible job. “We have taken a number of measures to show people that there’s a rules based system, that if you come here and you don’t have a right to be here, you’re going to find out about that quicker and be asked to leave, that our welfare system is there to support you, but it’s never open to abuse.” In recent months the Government has introduced tighter rules around welfare supports for asylum seekers and Ukrainians. Last week, the Government announced plans to means-test asylum seekers. Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys is currently looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, following a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than 125 euro a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of 232 euro to 38.80 euro per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in state-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year.",

        "content": "Climate change is pushing daytime summer temperatures higher for longer periods of time, and that can spell real danger for folks who work outside, like gardeners and landscapers. Protecting yourself in the heat and knowing the warning signs of heat-related illness is crucial, said Chris Enroth, horticulture educator at University of Illinois Extension. He should know: It happened to him. \"When I was working as a landscaper, we had to sod a large backyard during a day when the temperature was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit,\" Enroth said. \"We were hustling to get the sod down quickly, so it didn't burn up in the hot sun. About midway through the day, I started feeling nauseated and dizzy, and I stopped sweating. I was disoriented and could no longer push my wheelbarrow,\" he added. \"That's when I knew I was suffering from severe heat exhaustion , perhaps even heat stroke .\" Heat exhaustion and heat stroke occur when the body can no longer maintain its normal temperature. Work exacerbates the problem, since working muscles generate their own heat, Enroth explained. Here are the symptoms of heat exhaustion to look out for: If you or someone near you is experiencing at least some of these symptoms, get them to a cool place, preferably with good air movement, Enroth said. Have them lie down with their legs elevated. Get the person to drink cold water and apply cold packs and/or wet towels to their body to help them cool. If there's no positive change within 30 minutes, call for medical attention. Even more of an emergency than heat exhaustion is heat stroke, because it can quickly lead to organ failure, coma and death. Here are the signs: If you notice anyone with these symptoms, call 911 immediately. Time is crucial, Enroth said, because, \"from my experience, most people suffering from heat stroke may not be aware of their condition until it's too late.\" While waiting for emergency personnel , get the afflicted person to a cool place and remove any excessive clothing. Have them lie down, with head and shoulders a bit elevated. Use any means available—cold packs, wet towels—applying these cooling items to the back of the neck, armpits and groin area. If a cold shower or bath is available, help the person into the shower or bath to help them cool. However, keep track of their body temperature, because too much cooling can push the body into hypothermia. Once the body reaches 102 degrees F, remove cooling agents and/or remove them from the cold shower or bath. Watch for possible seizures.

        "content": "PM Modi pointed out that when the policies are in black and white, the grey areas in a system become minimal and there's no room for discrimination. \"Corruption is like termites which eats away the system and makes it completely hollow,\" he underlined. New Delhi : Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that the big fish are being caught and facing the law today because of the BJP government’s zero tolerance against corruption and its policy-driven governance. He said the Opposition parties are glorifying the corrupt. “What kind of Khan Market Gang is this, which is creating a narrative to shield certain people?,” he asked. Speaking during an exclusive interview with IANS, he pointed out that when the policies are in black and white, the grey areas in a system become minimal and there’s no room for discrimination. “Corruption is like termites which eats away the system and makes it completely hollow,” he underlined, adding that his government has focused on saturation of schemes which guarantees freedom from corruption. He also emphasised that the government has made maximum use of technology which has brought about transparency and accountability in the system and rooted out graft. On Pak backing for Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal Reacting sharply to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal getting support from a Pakistani leader, PM Modi said it was a “very serious matter” and “requires thorough investigation”. “I don’t understand why some select group of people, apparently those who are against us, get backing from Pakistan... why support comes from there, for particular individuals. This is a matter of serious concern and calls for a probe. I think I shouldn’t comment on such issues, given the position I hold, but I do understand your concern.” Recently, former Pakistani Minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain shared a video of Rahul Gandhi and praised him. His “appreciation post” raised many hackles. Last week, the ex-minister’s reaction over Arvind Kejriwal’s bail in the liquor scam case drew a flak. Talking about India’s democracy, PM Modi said, “Democracy in India is very mature. It boasts of rich and well-established electoral principles and traditions. India’s electorate doesn’t get influenced or swayed by external forces or factors.”",

        "content": "The European Central Bank (ECB) is almost certain to become the first major central bank to start cutting interest rates next week, with two key officials saying it is time to lower borrowing costs. Traders are highly confident that the ECB will lower its benchmark deposit rate by 25 basis points from a record high of four per cent at its next meeting on 6 June. Olli Rehn, an ECB governing council member and head of Finland’s central bank, said in a speech on Monday that eurozone inflation was falling in a “sustained way” and “the time is thus ripe in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates”. Inflation in the euro area came in at 2.4 per cent in April, nearing the ECB’s two per cent target. The data for May is due to be released on Friday. Eurozone inflation has remained below three per cent for the last seven months in a row, despite an uptick in December. Separately, the ECB’s chief economist Philip Lane told the Financial Times : “Barring major surprises, at this point in time there is enough in what we see to remove the top level of restriction.” However, he cautioned that the ECB needed to keep rates in a “restrictive zone” into 2025 to ensure inflation keeps falling. “The best way to frame the debate this year is that we still need to be restrictive all year long,” Lane said. “But within the zone of restrictiveness we can move down somewhat.” His comments came after ECB president Christine Lagarde said last week there was a “strong likelihood” of a June cut if inflation looked set to remain under control in the medium term. The ECB started hiking interest rates in July 2022 in a bid to tame runaway inflation, receiving criticism for being one of the last big central banks to do so. But now it is widely expected to decouple from the US Federal Reserve, which is considered a trendsetter in Western monetary policy and unlikely to cut rates before the summer. “A June rate cut by the ECB has been telegraphed for a long time now and any different outcome would be an immense surprise,” Dirk Schumacher, a former ECB economist now head of Europe macro research at French bank Natixis, told City A.M. “The ECB has also made clear, credibly so we think, that it is euro area data and the inflation outlook that will dictate any change in the policy stance of the ECB. Whether the Fed would cut or not would only matter to the extent that it would impact the exchange rate and in turn euro area inflation.” Piet Haines Christiansen, a chief analyst at Danske Bank, added: “While the economic situation has been better than anticipated since the start of the year and inflation more sticky than anticipated, the ECB is widely expected to go ahead [with a cut].” He said that after next week, his team expected the ECB to take a “pause” from cutting rates until the end of the year. “We are the most hawkish on the street it seems, so we do not expect this to impact other central banks,” Christiansen said. “When comparing central banks globally, the Bank of England and ECB stand out as seeing some similarities across the economies, while the US situation is in a much stronger position and thus risks keeping rates higher there than in the euro area and UK.” Minutes from the Fed’s most recent meeting, released last week, suggested policymakers were still wary of committing to rate cuts, with an unspecified number even saying they were open to raising rates if inflation worsens. On this side of the Atlantic, the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Hungary have already cut rates this year in response to easing inflation The Bank of England is not expected to reduce borrowing costs until the summer at the earliest. Latest data showing inflation fell to 2.3 per cent in April was key to Rishi Sunak’s decision to call a general election for 4 July. However, it came in slightly hotter than the 2.1 per cent economists had expected, with sticky services inflation remaining a worry for rate-setters on Threadneedle Street.",

        "content": "News | UK Daredevils have thrown themselves down a steep hill in the annual death-defying cheese rolling race in Gloucestershire . Brave competitors sprinted, tripped and tumbled down Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth to try and win the 8lb double Gloucester . The recent wet weather had made the racetrack soft, slippery and very muddy for the competitors who were cheered on by thousands of spectators. The winner of the first men’s downhill race was German Tom Kopke, 22, from Munich. “I am absolutely buzzing, it was an amazing experience. The unfortunate thing is I can’t really remember anything about it,” Mr Kopke, who runs his own YouTube channel, said. “I just started and went for the bottom, and that was it. Everyone said rolling is the best strategy but I just football slid downhill, just sliding, and get back on your feet as quickly as possible. “I love this event and it’s just crazy. The day before I went cliff diving and I am all for these crazy events. “I promised my grandma I am going to give it to her, so she is going to get the cheese.” Rebel cheese rollers have been staging their own unofficial event after health and safety fears caused the official competition to be cancelled in 2010. The cheese is chased 200 yards down the 1:2 gradient Cooper’s Hill at Brockworth. After a year’s hiatus, when police warned against the use of a real cheese, the imitation lightweight foam cheese was replaced with the genuine article. Long-time cheese-maker Rod Smart, who have produced cheese for the chase for more than 25 years, once again provided the wheels for this year’s event. Four cheeses weighing about 3kg each and three smaller ones, weighing about 1.5kg, are used. The unusual event has been celebrated for centuries and is thought to have its roots in a heathen festival to celebrate the return of spring. The official event was cancelled after more than 15,000 people turned up as spectators to watch the 2009 competition. Since then, it has been held unofficially with the police keeping a watchful eye. Local roads have been closed up to two-and-a-half miles around the slope. Some competitors travelled from across the world to take part in the series of madcap races, which attracted TV crews from around the world. The second men’s race was won by Dylan Twiss, 25, from Perth, Australia, who said afterwards: “I am slightly surprised. “I said I was going to win it and I managed to do it. I wasn’t quite sure if I had it or not and I knew there were a lot of people coming in pretty fast. “I might eat the cheese at some stage – I haven’t quite decided yet.” SNP has ‘ground to cover’ to catch up with Labour in polls, John Swinney says Theresa May: I should have met Grenfell Tower survivors sooner King receives first Sycamore Gap tree seedling nearly eight months after felling Why San Diego should be the start of your California road trip The women’s race was won by Abby Lampe, 23, from North Carolina , US, who picked up a double Gloucester for the second time having first won in 2022. “I just remember rolling down and my face getting beat up again,” she said. “I was thinking to myself there was only going to be a few seconds and I would get to the bottom at some point and it will be over. “I found about cheese rolling years ago on the internet and I wanted to defend my title. “I don’t know how it looks – only how it feels – but I think I just tumbled down. “I came out unscathed. My face is a little dirty but that’s about it. I’m going to ship the cheese back home to North Carolina.” The final men’s downhill race was won by Josh Shepherd, from Gloucester, who has previously won before.
