        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Catch up on the French Open with a guide that tells you everything you need to know about what happened at the clay-court Grand Slam tennis tournament, how to watch it, what the betting odds are, what the schedule is and more: Who is Playing on Monday? The match getting by far the most attention — Rafael Nadal vs. Alexander Zverev — will be third in Court Philippe Chatrier. That means it should start at around 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT; 9:30 a.m. EDT). That will be preceded by No. 8 Ons Jabeur against Sachia Vickery, which starts play in the main stadium at noon (1000 GMT; 6 a.m. EDT), and the second match there, with Iga Swiatek against Leolia Jeanjean. Another match that could generate interest will be Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who is coming off a hip injury, against Chris Eubanks, a big-serving American who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year. That starts the day in Court Suzanne Lenglen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT; 5 a.m. EDT). What Happened on Sunday? Two-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz pronounced his recently injured forearm “fully recovered,” even if it still is “feeling weird,” after overwhelming J.J. Wolf 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. “It's still in my mind, but I didn’t feel anything after the match ... which is really, really good for me.” Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka won a match at a major for the first time in more than two years by defeating Lucia Bronzetti 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to advance to what could be a second-round showdown against Swiatek. Other players moving into the second round included Caroline Garcia of France, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, No. 30 Dayana Yastremska and Donna Vekic in the women's draw, and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men's. No. 17 seed Ugo Humbert was eliminated by Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. There was a brief rain shower in the afternoon, which delayed action on several courts but allowed for the first use of the new retractable roof at Court Suzanne Lenglen. How to Watch the French Open on TV — In the U.S.: Tennis Channel, NBC, Peacock. — Other countries are listed here . Betting Guide Nadal is usually favored to win the championship at the French Open — he has 14, after all — but BetMGM Sportsbook has him as the underdog in the first round against No. 4 seed Zverev on Monday. Zverev is a -350 money-line favorite against Nadal, who is listed at +260 for that match. Nadal is just 7-4 this year and missed nearly all of last year while dealing with injuries; that is why he is unseeded and so could have been drawn to face anyone to begin the tournament. Zverev was a semifinalist in Paris each of the past three years and is coming off a clay-court title at the Italian Open this month. Swiatek is a big favorite to win the title (-155), so it makes sense that she is listed at -10000 against Jeanjean, who has +1600 money-line odds for their match.

        "content": "European shares edged higher in thin trading after a European Central Bank official signalled policymakers could consider successive rate cuts starting next month. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.4 per cent to a record high with US markets closed. Carmakers and utilities led a modest advance in the Stoxx Europe 600 index. Turnover was less than half the 20-day average for the time of day, with UK and US markets closed for holidays. American equity futures advanced and a gauge of the dollar dipped. The Australian sharemarket is set to climb, with futures at 4.51am AEST pointing to a gain of 16 points, or 0.2 per cent, at the open. The ASX added 0.8 per cent on Monday. Francois Villeroy de Galhau pushed back against fellow monetary officials who are uncomfortable at the idea of consecutive cuts. Credit: Bloomberg The ECB shouldn’t rule out lowering borrowing costs at both its June and July meetings, Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said, pushing back against fellow monetary officials who are uncomfortable at the idea of consecutive cuts. Chief Economist Philip Lane said earlier the central will have to keep policy restrictive through 2024, even after cutting interest rates next month. An ECB rate cut in June has been widely telegraphed, but subsequent steps are less clear given uncertainty over wage growth and factors like the fighting in the Middle East. Data this week may show headline inflation in the euro region ticked up in May. “European inflation is back,” though the May spike may be temporary, Credit Agricole SA strategists led by Jean-François Paren wrote in a note. “This does not call the June cut into question but adds risk of de-pricing additional cuts later.” Loading Among individual movers in Europe, EFG International AG rallied as much as 4.7 per cent following a Bloomberg news report after the market close Friday that Julius Baer Group Ltd. is exploring a potential acquisition of its rival Swiss private bank. Julius Baer slipped 0.8 per cent. The MSCI Asia Pacific index posted its biggest gain since May 16, led by stock gauges in Hong Kong, China, and Japan. A swath of inflation prints from Australia to Japan, the euro region and the US is due this week as traders finesse bets on the outlook for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s favourite measure of underlying inflation is due on Friday and is expected to show modest relief. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stressed the need for more evidence that inflation is on a path to the 2 per cent goal before easing policy. Loading John Williams, Lisa Cook, Neel Kashkari and Lorie Logan are among the US central bankers due to speak this week. Trading of cash Treasuries was closed. The “T+1” rule that has the potential to cause trouble for overseas investors will come into effect when traders return from the long weekend — making US equities settle in one day rather than two. Meanwhile, gold gained, while copper futures fell. Oil advanced after its biggest weekly loss in four, with the focus on an OPEC+ supply meeting on Sunday and US demand at the start of the summer driving season.

        "description": "The aircraft is the fifth to join the airline's fleet.",
        "content": "The gang is finally together! On Saturday, Azul Linhas Aéreas received its final Disney-liveried aircraft, an Airbus A320neo, with Goofy as the main character. In 2023, announced it would add a fifth Disney-themed aircraft to its fleet. At the time, it had already received four and had completed the “family,” or so we thought. Every one of the planes has been a new delivery from the Airbus facilities in Toulouse, France. Azul has nicknamed its Disney planes the “Magical Fleet,” playing on Disney’s marketing. Yesterday, the family was complete with the arrival of Goofy. The new aircraft is an Airbus A320neo. It began its journey from Europe on Friday and arrived on Saturday night at Aeroporto Internacional Belo Horizonte (commonly referred to as Confins because of its location near the city). There, the aircraft will go through its certification procedures to join the airline’s operations. According to Azul, the livery was designed by Walt Disney World Resort artists. The livery highlights Goofy’s special characteristics, like his iconic ears. After its assembly in Toulouse, the A320neo was painted at Airbus and delivered to the airline. “The aircraft in the ‘Most Magical Fleet In The World’ are very special to us at Azul because of the way they make customers happy and impact the customer experience. The happiness and sparkle in the eyes of adults and children when they discover they are flying on one of these planes is evident. Goofy is a classic, representing diversity and good humor, and we believe that the aircraft does just that.” Daniel Bicudo, Marketing and Business Director, Azul Linhas Aéreas In November 2021, Azul received its first Disney aircraft, ‘Mickey Mouse Nas Nuvens.’ Like Goofy, the Mickey plane is an Airbus A320neo. Registered as PR-YSH, the A320neo was the 50th of the type to join the airline’s fleet. Mickey was followed by ‘Minnie Mouse Nas Nuvens’ and ‘Pato Donald Nas Nuvens’, in February and June of 2022, respectively. The Minnie Mouse aircraft is the only one in the fleet on an A321neo, of which Azul has only six. When the Daisy aircraft joined the fleet, it was thought it would be the final one. Then, in February of 2023, the airline announced a pleasant surprise: there would be a fifth aircraft. There had been speculation for a long time that there would be a fifth plane and that it would be Goofy. And the rumors were true. Azul held a special event at its Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) hangar at Aeroporto Internacional de Viracopos, its main hub, to announce the fifth aircraft. All the characters from the first four planes made a special appearance, and two Brazilian singers gave a special performance of When You Wish Upon A Star. Azul’s CEO and Disney Destinations’ Senior Vice President were present to make the announcement.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — UCLA Chancellor Gene Block found himself in the nation’s culture wars hot seat this past week, interrogated by members of Congress about his handling of complaints of campus antisemitism, amid student protests over the Israel-Hamas war. For Republican Congress members, the hearing organized by the GOP-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce was a chance to present the University of California, Los Angeles as exhibit A in how not to deal with protests. Almost as soon as activists set up a Palestinian solidarity encampment April 25 in the heart of campus, Jewish students and faculty complained that demonstrators established checkpoints restricting access to many students, at times singling out students they identified as Zionists. After pro-Israeli counterprotesters attacked the encampment on April 30, it was dismantled May 2, with law enforcement arresting more than 200 people. “Over the course of years, decades even, universities gradually nurtured a campus culture of radicalism, in which antisemitism grew and became tolerated by administrators,” Virginia Foxx, the commitee chair, said in her opening remarks. The Republican from North Carolina assailed Block for allowing UCLA’s protests to spiral out of control. “For days, you stood by as Jews were assaulted and illegal checkpoints blocked access to campus in broad daylight,” Foxx said. “Your actions were too little, too late.” In his opening testimony, Block conceded that UCLA made errors in judgment. The encampment, he said, “disrupted normal access to some classes” and “impeded our educational mission.” “With the benefit of hindsight,” he said, “we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.” Block did not specify what UCLA should have done to prevent discrimination or violence as protests ramped up. And he did not explain why the university did not take action as students reported discrimination from protesters and outside agitators gathered on campus. Striking a mild, noncombative approach throughout, Block did not say what campus discipline had been — or would be — meted out to students who violated UCLA rules. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., criticized UCLA leaders for standing by for hours as a “mob of agitators” gathered near the encampment. Block said he rejected the premise of the question. Block said the Los Angeles Police Department was working to identify the attackers. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican, asked Block whether physically obstructing students from entering campus based on their race, ethnicity or religion is an expellable offense. ‘There is a disciplinary process,” Block said. “It could be.” Kiley played a viral video showing UCLA protesters blocking a student, Eli Tsives, from passing a checkpoint. “Were those students who formed blockade?” Kiley said. “Were they disciplined?” Block said he didn’t know, repeating that he sent out a memo April 30 instructing the campus community that blocking students’ passage was intolerable. Block, who is Jewish and has family members who died in the Holocaust, said UCLA has a problem with antisemitism. “I am fully aware that many of our Jewish students have had to confront rhetoric and images on campus that any reasonable person would find repugnant,” Block said in his opening statement. “Trust me, I understand their pain.” Asked by Rep. Kathy Manning, a Democrat from North Carolina, about emails dating to 2014 that show alumni had alerted the chancellor of growing antisemitism, Block said the university had tried to respond with training. About 90 percent of students, he said, had taken an online training course that includes discussion of antisemitism.

        "content": "In a bid to remove obstacles hindering the growth of Nigerian shipping sector, the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) is seeking for a new a act the will open up the industry to compete, while setting specific roles that will guide operation for efficiency . ALSO READ: Maritime security: House Committee seeks alternate funding for Deep Blue project Speaking at the stakeholders public hearing of the new bill on Monday before the House Committee on Shipping Services and Committee on ports and harbor in Abuja, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Barrister Puis Akutah said the proposed new regulatory framework will encourage more private sector participation in the sector. The ES explained that the bill seeks to enhance efficiency, promote ease of doing business, and create cost-effectiveness in the shipping sector while promoting seamless cargo movement within and outside African continent. “If passed into law, the bill will promote competition, ensure consumer protection, and elevate service quality standards. It mandates all stakeholders to adhere to regulations, preventing monopolistic practices, excessive pricing, and arbitrary behaviors. Regulators will be empowered to enforce rules impartially and provide necessary administrative and political support.” Akutah further stated that to maintain a level playing field and uphold fair trade practices without adding undue financial burdens, the bill proposes retaining the 1% fair standardisation fee as a funding source. He said the proposed bill, if enacted, promises to revolutionise the industry, creating a conducive environment for business growth, investment, and job creation while safeguarding consumer interests and promoting fair competition. The NSC boss notes that the legislative move aims to transform Nigeria’s shipping and ports sector into a dynamic force for economic growth, revenue generation, and employment sustainability. In his address, the Speaker of the House of Representative, Tajudeen Abbas reaffirmed that the bill will empower shippers council with the needed authority to oversee and manage the economic activities within Nigerian’s maritime sector. Represented by Sani Suli, the Speaker stated that the new legislative work seek to streamline procedures and eliminate any constraints that were present in the 2004 Ac. He explained that the reenactment of the new bill will not only ensure an economic regulatory framework for NSC for effective regulation of commercial activities in the shipping port sector, but the bill will also create friendly environment for private sector participation for the growth of the industry. “The bill lays out financial provisions, define guidelines for the allocation, management and auditing of funds, which is crucial for maintaining financial integrity and providing the council with the necessary resources to perform its duties,” he noted.",

        "content": "The internet never sleeps, giving us a never-ending news cycle. While we ought to keep you posted with all the latest happenings in the tech world, a few gems slip through the cracks. Fear not, because we’ve got you covered. Welcome to our first edition of “News You Probably Missed and Shouldn’t Have!”—the weekly roundup of stories that deserve the spotlight. So, buckle up, because while these headlines may not have made the front page, they’re definitely worthy of a glance, or maybe two—and a chuckle. Prepare to be entertained by the tech news that somehow evaded your social media feeds (we know social media is your ultimate news destination). Let’s get started! Samsung & ARM start laying the foundation for 6G Smartphone giant Samsung and processor IP maker ARM are gearing up for the next big thing in mobile data: 6G. Yes, while most of us are still trying to find a decent 5G signal or even 4G in some places, these tech titans are already plotting the future. The two firms have started laying the foundation for the next generation of wireless communication technology. Current estimates are that it will take another five or six years for 6G to be available commercially. Tell you what, there might be a pattern here—4G debuted in 2009 and 5G in 2019. Is anyone betting on a 6G launch in 2029? We aren’t. But people say AI will revolutionize the tech landscape in the years to come. Who knows the so-called faster internet will come to us faster. For now, let’s hope 6G doesn’t stand for “6th Generation of Disappointment”! Samsung appoints a new head of its semiconductor division Samsung has appointed Young Hyun Jun as the new head of its Device Solutions Division which incorporates its semiconductor business. With a career spanning over two decades across various roles within the company’s semiconductor unit, the 64-year-old Young is stepping into a key position responsible for advancing the Korean firm’s chip technology. Given the sub-par performance of its Exynos chips in the past, let’s hope he brings a secret sauce to finally spice things up. TSMC would kill itself rather than live under Chinese control TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, has contingency plans against a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan that could hand over its controls to Beijing. While the US is already scared about the implications of such an event and rightly so, the Taiwanese company itself doesn’t want to live under Chinese control. It has worked with its Dutch chip machine supplier ASML on a tech that would remotely disable the chip machines and render them useless in the event of an invasion. Imagine the chaos: Chinese invaders storming in only to find TSMC’s factory turned into a high-tech ghost town. It would be no less than a scene from a sci-fi movie where the robots revolt. But in this case, the machines pull the plug on themselves rather than attacking the attackers. TSMC’s influence in the tech industry is an example of why regulators want to break big internet companies like Google. When things go bad, it could send the world into disarray. Installing PWAs and Android apps made easy on Chrome OS Google has introduced an “Add to Chromebook” badge and “ChromeOS app URL” to make it easier for Chrome OS users to install Android apps and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). The badge takes users to the Play Store listing of an Android app. In the case of PWAs, those can be installed from anywhere . You no longer have to be inside a PWA in a browser tab to get an install button. Thanks, Google! You finally figured out that users were fumbling around, asking, “PWA (Please, Where’s the App)?” Humane is looking for humans to buy it out After a delay, Humane finally started selling its much-hyped Ai Pin last month. It was supposed to be a revolutionary AI companion to assist you with various tasks, potentially replacing your smartphone in some. However, the voice-controlled wearable device with a built-in digital assistant had poor word of mouth and never took off. Barely a month after Humane started selling its first and only product, it is now seeking buyers for itself . The AI startup hasn’t officially announced that it is looking for humans willing to buy it. However, people familiar with the matter say Humane will gleefully hand over its reigns to a new owner for anything between $750 million and $1 billion. If this sale goes through within the next few months, it might set a new record for a startup’s first product launch to a potential buyout. The AI landscape isn’t all sunshine and roses, it seems. TikTok to lay off over 1,000 employees Ahead of a potential reduction in its user base (a US ban would cut affect over 170 million users), TikTok is shrinking its workforce. The ByteDance-owned company is planning a major layoff affecting over 1,000 employees . The job cut will hit various internal teams and departments—probably not the legal department (it needs a lot of legal experts to work in tandem if it were to live on in the US beyond January 2025). So, while TikTok dances its way through the courts, some of its employees may be soon left doing the cha-cha slide out the door. Windows PowerToys unleashes advanced AI copy-paste PowerToys for Windows 11 has just added a new AI tool: Advanced Paste. It lets you convert your clipboard content on the fly, speeding up your workflow. You can copy code in one language and paste it in another. You can also run other types of conversions before pasting, including summarizing text, translating it to a different language, and rephrasing it to change its tone. Gone are the days of accidentally pasting cat memes into serious work documents—what you paste is always on point. But hey, this tool is super useful, so you have to pay us. Not us, but those who brought it to you. Available with PowerToys version 0.81 , you can enable Advanced Paste using the key combination “Windows Key + Shift + V”. But to use it to its full potential, you need to link your OpenAI account and buy OpenAI API credits. Nah, a paid ChatGPT account doesn’t give you API credits. YouTube is testing a redesigned layout, again YouTube regularly tests UI redesigns and tweaks to give users a pixel-perfect viewing experience that’s smoother than a cat’s nap. It keeps what works and discards what doesn’t. The company appears to be preparing another redesign. On the desktop version, it is moving the video title, description, comments, and other buttons to the right side. The video appears on the left , with recommendations showing up with bigger thumbnails directly under it. This redesign has been in the works for a while now but hasn’t shown up for many. We certainly don’t want it in its current state—those big thumbnails under the video are massive distractions. How come YouTube UI designers do not see that? Or they just turned a blind eye to it? Come on Google, you are better than this (or at least the world thinks you are). Xiaomi to make its own smartphone chipsets Xiaomi seems to be fed up with the lack of choices when it comes to smartphone processors. It is making its own. Codenamed “Ring,” the chipset is currently in development with the high-end segment in mind. The chip may still be far away but the Chinese firm appears determined to make a groundbreaking entry in a few years and shake the flagship SoC market currently captured by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon and MediaTek’s Dimensity chips. Samsung also makes Exynos-branded flagships SoCs, but those have always been sub-par. Wouldn’t it be amazing if Xiaomi came along and made a better chip than Samsung right away? Adaptive Audio for Google Meet Google Meet is stepping up its audio game with the introduction of Adaptive Audio . It is a game-changing feature that ensures your virtual meetings sound as clear as a bell. The new feature can detect the presence of multiple laptops in the room (and multiple people shouting at their bosses at once—just kidding, you shouldn’t shout at anyone, unless your boss is a clod) and synchronize the microphones and speakers to eliminate echoes and audio feedback. This allows you and your colleagues to participate in meetings from anywhere. Bluesky adds DMs, finally BlueSky, Twitter’s decentralized dream, is finally adding DMs . You can now send messages to your friends and families via the app. If they are on it, of course (don’t be surprised if some of them point upwards when you ask them what Bluesky is). DMs work on the app and website but only support text conversations in one-to-one chats. No group chats and media support, oh, really? The company says these features, along with end-to-end encryption, are planned for later. Snapseed gets a rare update Snapseed, the Google-owned photo editing software tool for mobile devices, recently picked up a minor update. This is the first update for the app in nearly eight months . It brings version 2.22 with no user-facing changes or functional improvements. Considering how rare updates for Snapseed are (feature updates are even rarer), Google seems to be losing interest in it. The company acquired the tool in 2012 and appears to have little incentive to support it further. We wouldn’t be surprised if the app ends up in the Google Graveyard in a few years. Help yourself to disabling Chrome’s “Help me write” AI tool Are you fed up with AI tools interrupting you unnecessarily? Some Chrome users may have been. Google recently started actively pushing a “Help me write: Powered by Google” bubble in Chrome to promote its experimental writing assistant. Thankfully, if you are annoyed by this bubble, you can disable it . To do that, go to Settings > Privacy and security > Site settings > Content > Additional content settings > Offer writing help (at the bottom). Google couldn’t have made it more difficult to disable this tool. WhatsApp is working on AI-generated profile photos AI is coming everywhere and you can’t do anything about it. You may be able to disable some AI tools (like Google’s “Help me write” for Chrome), but you will encounter more of them in other places. WhatsApp may soon introduce one. The Meta-owned messaging app is working on AI-generated profile photos (but why?). Because who needs a regular selfie when you can have an AI-generated masterpiece, right? No, we don’t need a virtual Picasso painting our profile pictures. But then again, all tech firms have to show that their products boast the latest AI tools. While AI is undeniably powerful, it feels like tech companies sometimes rely too heavily on it as a buzzword rather than focusing on meaningful advancements. It’s like promising a gourmet meal and delivering a reheated TV dinner—underwhelming and lacking that wow factor. Someone at X doesn’t like to show “likes” publicly X, the social media platform we knew as Twitter before the Elon Musk era, will soon stop showing the posts you have liked to other users. The company is making likes private because “public likes are incentivizing the wrong behavior.” People avoid liking some posts fearing retaliation from trolls. While liking posts on X may not be as nerve-racking as navigating a minefield, this move from X will certainly help people maintain a pristine online image while still enjoying the content they love. It’s like a digital self-care package. AI is coming to Amazon Alexa too, but at a price Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant is getting an AI makeover. The company is working on new generative AI capabilities for the decade-old assistant. However, unlike most other companies, it won’t make the AI features free. The e-commerce giant would charge a monthly subscription for it . Worse yet, it won’t be included in an Amazon Prime subscription. The question is, how many people would be willing to pay Amazon for AI features available free elsewhere? It’s like inviting a brainy friend to the party but having to pay a cover charge for their wit and wisdom. But hey, maybe Amazon will pave the way for an AI subscription model in the virtual assistant realm, and everyone will follow, leaving users with no other choice. Only time will tell. TikTok disrupted over a dozen covert influence campaigns this year TikTok has disrupted more than a dozen covert influence campaigns since January this year. The company has placed measures to detect such campaigns where several accounts coordinate to sway political discourse. It removes accounts engaging in these kinds of practices. It has already detected 15 influence campaigns this year, including one originating from China. These campaigns spanned 3,000 accounts that had millions of followers combined. Great job, TikTok. We don’t get many chances to say that, do we? HMD Aura is an incredibly affordable Android smartphone HMD has launched Aura, an incredibly affordable Android smartphone. Priced at AUD 180 (approx. USD 120), it offers a decent set of specs for its price. It appears to be currently limited to Australia, where potential buyers can find it on local retailer JB Hi-Fi . There is no word on its availability elsewhere. It is unclear if HMD will showcase Aura’s aura in other parts of the world. As for its specs, the phone has a 6.56-inch HD+ display, a 13MP main camera, a 5MP selfie camera, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, a Unisoc SC9863A1 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage (supports microSD cards up to 256GB), dual SIM support, a USB Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It packs a 5,000 mAh battery and supports 10W wired charging. YouTube Music lets you hum to find songs YouTube Music is bringing a musical genie to your phone. Even if you have forgotten a song’s lyrics, title, artists, and all, you can still magically find the song that’s playing in your mind. Just hum its tune, and presto—your phone magically finds the song for you . With “Hum to search,” you don’t have to make multiple Google searches with vague descriptions to find that one song. The new feature is available with version 7.02 of YouTube Music for Android, though it may take a while before this ability reaches everyone.",

        "description": "Stormy Daniels reveals death threats she has received since Donald Trump's hush money trial.",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels, the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal , the Daily Mirror has revealed. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. Trump blasted for 'disrespectful' saluting blunder - sparking huge rules debate Donald Trump named fattest US president in history due to McDonald's addiction And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar’, ‘slut’, ‘gold digger’. This time around, it’s different. “It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat’.” The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time in the UK tonight [TUES] on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” She adds that that is a ‘direct threat’. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again”. Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” She talks philosophically about what she has learnt since the story first broke. “The way this is different from 2018 is that I have more knowledge, “ she says. “The shock of it’s not the same. I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” If you or someone you know needs support now, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org",

        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma, whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party. That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until ''Jesus comes back.'' Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. ''They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,'' Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. ''He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?'' Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. ''I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,'' Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party's symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing's logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country's population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa's poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. ''I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,'' Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. ''It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,'' Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. ''uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. ''The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.'' His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK's symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

        "content": "Stormy Daniels revealed she has received death threats (Image: MySpace) President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels, the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal, the Daily Mirror has revealed. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. READ MORE: Trump snaps back at booing crowd as he's branded 'worst president in history' [LATEST] Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar’, ‘slut’, ‘gold digger’. This time around, it’s different. “It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat’.” The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump (Image: GETTY) “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time in the UK tonight [TUES] on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” She adds that that is a ‘direct threat’. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again”. Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” Stormy premieres Tuesday, May 28, Channel 5, 10pm and is also available to stream on My5.

        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

        "content": "Indian tennis star Sania Mirza, who is considered as a role model and source of inspiration by many for her talent and accomplishments, has redefined the role of women in the society. Though the women all over the world have outgrown the societal barriers and done wonders by their work in various fields, society in the South Asian countries still see females in limited roles. The 37-year-old sportswoman, who has seen the epitome of success and fame owing to her skills and brilliance as a professional tennis player, believes that the women are not just about beauty or their knack in the kitchen. Being a mother and a celebrity all at the same time, Sania is of the view that women are much more than what society wants them to be. “Women are not just supposed to look pretty and cook. They are more than that,” she told leading Indian magazine Famina in a recent interview. The quote was shared by the journal on their official Instagram and reshared by Sania on her Instagram stories. It may be noted that the Indian tennis ace is mother to six-year-old Izhaan Mirza Malik. Despite having taken retirement from professional tennis, Sania is widely followed for her charismatic personality and sparkling career.",

        "description": "His production has been trending down for a few years now and is at an especially low point this year. The 29-year-old has hit .143/.265/.229 thus far in 2024 while striking out 38.6 percent of the time.",
        "content": "The Guardians have released outfielder Ramon Laureano , according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. He’ll now head to the open market and will be free to explore opportunities with all clubs. This was the most likely outcome when the Guardians designated Laureano for assignment last week. The outfielder’s production has been trending down for a few years now and is at an especially low point this year. The 29-year-old has hit .143/.265/.229 thus far in 2024 while striking out 38.6 percent of the time. On top of his poor performance, his salary has been creeping up gradually via the arbitration process. He’s making $5.15M this year and any team acquiring him via a waiver claim or trade would have been taking on that money. It’s unsurprising that no club wanted to take that on, given how he has been playing of late. He has more than five years of service time, meaning he can reject an outright assignment while also keeping that salary in place. Now that he is a free agent, teams may be interested in a low-cost flier. Since he’s now been released, the Guardians are on the hook for what’s left of the money, meaning that any club that signs him would only be responsible for the prorated league minimum for any time spent on the roster. That amount would be subtracted from what the Guards pay. It’s been a few years now, but Laureano was once a solid regular for the Athletics. From 2018 to 2021, he stepped to the plate 1,257 times for the A’s and hit 49 home runs. His .263/.335/.465 batting line translated to a wRC+ of 119, indicating he was 19 percent above league average in that time. He also stole 34 bases and was generally given strong defensive grades, leading FanGraphs to credit him with 8.6 wins above replacement in 313 games. But towards the end of that 2021 season, he was given an 80-game PED suspension and his performance has been tailing off since then. He hit .211/.287/.376 in 2022 for a wRC+ of 95 and his offense slipped a bit farther in 2023. The A’s designated him for assignment in August of last year and the Guards put in a claim. Moving to Cleveland seemed to spur a bit of a bounceback, as Laureano slashed .243/.342/.382 for a wRC+ of 106 down the stretch. That apparently intrigued the Guards enough that they tendered him a contract, agreeing to the aforementioned $5.15M salary. But he has fallen off dramatically and now finds himself looking for his next opportunity. As mentioned, Laureano can be signed to a major league roster at essentially no cost. Perhaps some club would give him a spot and see if he can play well enough over the next two months to be flipped for a lottery ticket prospect. Or even if no club is willing to bite on that, he should at least be able to find a minor-league deal somewhere. This article first appeared on MLB Trade Rumors and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "Former South African President Jacob Zuma is the wild card in Wednesday’s election for Africa’s most advanced country. He leads a new political party that's draining support from the ruling African National Congress that he once said would rule until...",
        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "description": "Dr Ana Jeelani, from Didsbury, was sent to save children in Palestine",
        "content": "A surgeon who flew out to Gaza to save children caught up in the conflict says she didn’t write a will before she went – she only cared about who would get her match ticket if she didn’t return home. Dr Ana Jeelani, a consultant paediatric orthopaedic surgeon at Alder Hey Hospital, took on a two-week volunteer placement at Al-Aqsa hospital back in March. The 38-year-old, from Didsbury , kept the trip a secret right until she left in fear her loved ones would try and stop her from going. Join our WhatsApp Top Stories and Breaking News group by clicking this link And while the surgeon didn’t organise a will ahead of heading into the warzone, she did make arrangements for one thing – her sought-after Liverpool FC ticket. The avid fan says she wanted to ensure her ticket to see Liverpool play Wolverhampton at Anfield on Sunday (May 19) in Jürgen Klopp’s final match as manager. “People asked me if I had made a will,” she said. “The only thing I made provisions for in case I didn’t come back was my ticket to Jurgen Klopp’s final match at Anfield. I got it for about £47 in the ballot but then it was worth something like £20,000. Dr Ana Jeelani in Gaza “Only one person has access to my account apart from me – I told him ‘If I die, my ticket can’t be sold,’ and I gave him a list of true supporters who could take it. “Beyond that, I didn’t really think about whether or not I might come back from Gaza. You just don’t know – there’s no pattern to this conflict. I just thought, if my time’s come, my time’s come. I’ve done something worthwhile, and equally you could die being hit by a bus in Didsbury. “If you’re going to go, you might as well do something you’d be proud of. Wherever you stand on the conflict, 15,000 children are dead and we’re children’s doctors. We can’t ignore that.” Ana says she didn’t tell her family she was leaving right until she was set to depart – her parents begging her not to go in fear she wouldn’t come home. “I only told my parents I was going shortly before I left,” she said. “In fact, I got my sister to tell them. “They pleaded with me not to go. My mum rang me in floods of tears saying, ‘Don’t go, why are you doing this to us?’ “But they also knew that I had the resolve and I was going to go. They were frantic with worry, but they’re also very proud.” Ana Jeelani (Image: Dr Ana Jeelani) Ana says she witnessed the atrocities of what was happening in Gaza in the media and wanted to help in any way she could. Ahead of flying out with MAP, Medical Air for Palestinians, she underwent two days of security training in Egypt, learning skills including what to do if she were taken hostage and how to escape under rubble. “The hospital was chaotic,” she said. “There were 166 beds and around 800 inpatients. Families would tend to their injured, basically living in the hospital, some would bring in stoves to cook food, and all this is in the ward or the corridor, all mixed up together. “There’s no nutrition, no specialised mattresses for pressure wounds, some of the beds don’t even have mattresses. The wounds are contaminated and most of the wounds become infected.” Ana says the lights would randomly go out in the middle of operating – forcing them to use head torches they carried in their pockets. The trauma she witnessed left Ana suffering from insomnia for two weeks upon her return to the UK. “Alder Hey were really supportive of me going,” she added. “Giving me humanitarian leave to go and arranging counselling when I got back. I had very bad insomnia for about two weeks afterwards but what has really helped, as well as the counselling, is staying in touch with the team. “We had such a good team and all get on really well. We speak most days on WhatsApp. It really helps to speak to others who have been through the same thing, who have that shared experience.” Ana has suffered from poor mental health since returning home (Image: Dr Ana Jeelani) But among the horrors she saw, Ana says there were moments of joy, from waking to the sound of children laughing to the first time she was able to wash her hair. \"There were always moments of simple joy to be had. We felt like a proper family. I never felt homesick. I have left my heart there. I don’t think I can ever fully mentally recover from it until the situation is over.’ “The children are brilliant – there was this little kid who would follow me around in his wheelchair and say that the fact that I didn’t give him any money was a humanitarian issue – he didn’t know what it meant - it was just something he’d learnt. “He was so cute. His family had been killed and he was being looked after by the people in the next beds to him. They all look after each other. “And then there was a Ziko – a child of about 11 who hung around A&E and would help out when there were mass casualties, passing plaster and dunking it. “He kind of found us and latched on to us so we made him some little scrubs. He was such a good kid but seeing things he shouldn’t be seeing. We don’t know much about him – he lived in a tent and was always hanging around the hospital. “When we left, we gave them everything. We gave them our suitcases, our shoes, some gave their phones. We arrived with 52 suitcases in as a team of seven full of supplies, we left with one each. Anything we had on us, we gave.” Ana says there was no fresh food during her time in Gaza, with all produce arriving into the city going rotten before it had the chance to sell. “I heard about a colleague’s wife who queued for half an hour and paid $35 for six eggs,” she said. “When she cracked them open, they were all rotten. They’re living on canned food.” The surgeon says there’s one thing she noticed that doesn’t come across in the media – the hope that the conflict will soon come to an end. “The resilience that the Palestinian people have,” she said. “They just want to get on with their lives. It’s a beautiful place, people are so loving and lovely. “When we were leaving, a guy said that even if we hadn’t operated on a single patient, the fact that we came here and let them know that they’re not alone means more than anything. “Everything on social media depicts the horrors, but it doesn’t depict the heart.”",

        "description": "Scott Watter, a staffer in McMaster's psychology, neuroscience and behaviour department, has been 'removed' due to a 'breach of trust,' the Ontario university has said.",
        "content": "A McMaster University professor in Hamilton, Ont., acquitted of sexual assault in 2022, has lost his job with the post secondary institution. Scott Watter, who taught in the psychology, neuroscience and behaviour (PNB) department, has been “removed” from the university’s faculty, according to two McMaster executives. The institution’s president David Farrar and board chair Jane Allen in a joint statement insisted that Watter “abused” his position as a faculty member and that his conduct and pattern of behavior involving multiple students was a “breach of trust.” Farrar and Allen explained the board’s executive and governance committee decided on dismissal after receiving a recommendation from a three-member senate committee determining “there was adequate cause for his removal.” “That committee found Dr. Watter’s conduct to be unethical, inappropriate and in some instances exploitative,” the joint statement said. Story continues below advertisement “In engaging in sexual relations with a number of students, one of whom was in a vulnerable position and relying on him for support, the Hearing Committee found that Dr. Watter abused the responsibilities and authority of his position as a faculty member.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. Watter was charged by Hamilton police in June 2020 after a woman came forward with accusations of sexual assault and sexual assault causing bodily harm. The university would then reveal its own probe a month later after receiving more complaints and subsequent suspension of several faculty members, including Watter.

Watter, then-46-years-old, appeared in front of a justice in August 2021 and registered a not-guilty plea. The accuser, a former student never identified due to a publication ban, took the stand in the 2022 judge-only trial and insisted she was repeatedly assaulted without consent over several months in 2017. In December 2022, Justice Amanda Camara acquitted Watter saying the Crown failed to prove that he misused his position to persuade the student’s consent. She also rejected the accuser’s testimony saying inconsistencies in her story never proved there wasn’t consent to sexual activity. Story continues below advertisement McMaster’s executive and governance committee revealed that Watters did object to “the process and procedures” of their “removal proceedings” in mid-May. “The approach taken by the Hearing Committee was not procedurally fair, and resulted in a flawed conclusion based on a hearing that lacked the foundation of adequate particulars,” council for Watters said in a complaint. The hearing committee dismissed the submission insisting there was no proof of any “procedural error.” Related News McMaster University prof accused of sexual assault pleads ‘not guilty’",

        "content": "TORONTO — The University of Toronto turned to the courts Monday in an effort to clear an encampment of pro-Palestinian protesters from its downtown campus, as a Quebec judge imposed restrictions on a similar demonstration at the Université du Québec à Montréal. At the Toronto encampment, protesters said they were prepared to fight back with their own legal team and refused to leave the site, ignoring a deadline set in a trespass notice that had been issued last week. U of T president Meric Gertler said the school was seeking an injunction and asking a court for an expedited case conference. \"In addition to pursuing this legal avenue to return King’s College Circle to the university community, we continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment,\" he wrote in a statement early Monday. \"We held a long and productive meeting yesterday and are meeting again today. We remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement and bring the unauthorized encampment to an end.\" University officials had issued a trespass notice on Friday ordering demonstrators to remove the encampment by 8 a.m. Monday, and on Sunday officials indicated they would seek an injunction in court if protesters didn't comply. The protesters, who set up tents in a large green space at the heart of the university's downtown campus on May 2, were joined by faculty and labour groups for a rally outside the nearby Convocation Hall as the trespass deadline passed. Demonstrators held up flags and huddled under umbrellas as a drizzle turned to heavier rain during the rally. Sara Rasikh, one of the spokespeople for the encampment, told the crowd that protesters tried for months to get the university to listen to their demands, but only received acknowledgment after setting up the encampment. \"The reason for this is because the people's strength is threatening to them. It is threatening to the legitimacy of this institution,\" she said. \"U of T continues to propose committees but we want commitments. We want divestment. We want disclosure. And we want it now.\" On Sunday, Rasikh had said the group had its own team of lawyers prepared to respond to an application from the university for an injunction. \"The fact that (university administrators) want the police to come in and clear us out after they told us that they want to end things peacefully, it just doesn't make sense,\" she said. \"It does not change the fact that we will continue to remain steadfast in our demands.” Demonstrators and university administrators met Sunday afternoon, during which protesters presented what they described as a counter-offer calling on the school to disclose public investments in companies profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza. They're also asking the school to establish and let them be part of a joint working group examining private investments, as well as cut ties with two specific Israeli academic institutions. On Thursday last week, the university had made an offer to the protesters – with 24 hours to respond – that said the school would form a working group to consider options for the disclosure of the school's investments, but it would not end any partnerships with Israeli universities. On divestment, the university said it would strike an advisory committee to review the students' request under existing school policies. Natalie Rothman, a history professor at the university and a member of the Jewish Faculty Network, said she was \"outraged\" when the school issued the trespass notice. \"This is a peaceful protest. We've been here from day one, it's been nothing but a model of what the university should be like in terms of real learning, real solidarity, real community,\" Rothman said at Monday's rally. \"And the fact that the university would threaten students and staff and faculty with disciplinary actions for a peaceful protest in accordance with our Charter rights, with the university's own mission statement, is absolutely outrageous.\" Ontario Minister of Colleges and Universities Jill Dunlop said Monday she supported clearing the encampment at the University of Toronto. \"We want to ensure this is cleaned up and dealt with right away,\" Dunlop said. \"Convocation is coming up and this is a safety issue. We want to ensure that families feel safe going on campus and not intimidated to attend the services.\" Other universities have also taken legal action to end pro-Palestinian protest encampments that have cropped up on their campuses. On Monday, a Quebec court granted the Université du Québec à Montréal a partial injunction against protesters who set up an encampment on its downtown campus earlier this month. Superior Court Justice Louis J. Gouin ruled safety measures need to be put in place at the site, including prohibiting protesters from setting up tents and other material within two metres of campus buildings and ensuring doors, windows and walls are clear of obstructions. The judge said the measures won't infringe on the encampment members' right to protest. Separately, two judges denied provisional injunction requests to dismantle an encampment set up in late April at McGill University. McGill is now seeking an interlocutory injunction, which focuses less on urgency and more on legal rights at the heart of the dispute. Meanwhile, protesters at McMaster University in Hamilton decided to put an end to their encampment after reaching a deal with the university last week. A statement issued by the group does not specify the terms of the agreement, but called it a \"significant step forward\" even though its demands were not all met.

        "content": "The Ulsterman notched up his 25th win at the 2023 event , putting him one away from the all-time record of 26 set by his late uncle Joey Dunlop, which has stood since 2000 as the benchmark. He led the timesheets outright with a 129.59mph lap aboard his Hawk Racing-run Honda Superbike and headed Davey Todd, embarking on his first TT as a BMW rider following a switch from Padgetts Racing to TAS Racing for 2024. Outright lap record holder Peter Hickman completed the top three overall on his Superstock BMW run by FHO Racing. The opening day of practice had been delayed due to the 37.75-mile being hit by rain overnight, with roads not closing until 2pm for the untimed practices in the afternoon. The first timed qualifying of TT 2024 got underway at just after 6pm local time, with the first laps being set by the Supersport and Supertwin class. Todd led the way in the Supersport class after putting in two laps on his V2 Ducati Panigale, with his best effort a 125.601mph. That put him ahead of James Hillier, who has reunited with Bournemouth Kawasaki in the Supersport class, on a 125.483mph lap. Michael Dunlop completed the top three in class on his MD Racing-run Triumph 675. Dunlop, who won both Supersport races at TT 2023, switches from Honda machinery for 2024 for those contests. In Supertwin, Hickman led the way with a118.011mph lap aboard his Swan-liveried Yamaha R7, on which he was able to win at the North West 200 earlier this month having also won in class at the TT in 2023. He completed just one lap on his Supertwin and Triumph Supersport bike, with Todd second on his Dafabet Racing Kawasaki. Dunlop didn’t set a time on his Paton, and appeared to have some issues with it in the untimed session earlier in the day. Dunlop had no such issues on his Honda Fireblade in the Superbike class that concluded the solo running on Monday, with Todd and Hickman completing the top three. John McGuinness was fourth on the works Honda in class ahead of team-mate Dean Harrison. After apparent logistical and supply issues led to Harrison – who has switch to Honda from DAO Racing Kawasaki for 2024 – and McGuinness only having their Superstock bikes available at the North West 200, Honda has a full compliment of machinery at the TT. Hickman led the Superstock class at 129.032mph from Dunlop and Dominic Herbertson. The Sidecar class concluded Monday’s practice action, with the Ryan Crowe/Callum Crowe outfit leading the way with a best lap of 116.699mph. The headlines were stolen by outright Sidecar TT lap record holder and 14-time winner Ben Birchall, as he kicked off his 2024 TT campaign with a new passenger. Kevin Rousseau takes over from Ben’s brother Tom Birchall, who announced his retirement from the TT earlier this year . Birchall/Rousseau went second fastest on their second flying lap at 115.882mph, while Peter Founds and Jevan Walmsley completed the top three.",

        "content": "Valeri Fridman, 60, of Dimona, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Sderot on October 7. Valeri was one of 13 people taking part in an organized trip for older Israelis, mostly immigrants from the former Soviet Union, to the Dead Sea that morning, when their minibus got a flat tire near Sderot and stopped next to a bus stop in the city to try and fix it. While the group was standing there, rocket sirens rang out, and the bus stop bomb shelter — which was supposed to automatically open during a siren — remained electronically locked. Moments later, a pick-up truck of terrorists drove by and shot dead all 13 travelers. Only the driver emerged alive. Images of the group of pensioners lying dead at the bus stop were among the first to circulate on the morning of the Hamas onslaught, shocking Israelis and the world with the brutality of the assault. Valeri was buried in Dimona on October 12. He is survived by his three sons, Gadi, Alon and Steve, and two grandchildren. The Dimona municipality said he worked in a factory in Sderot. Family and friends remembered Valeri as a devoted fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv and a dedicated family man, who came to Israel 30 years ago from the former Soviet Union to establish a life in Israel. A family friend, Galit Glikin, eulogized Valeri on Facebook as “the person with the most golden heart. My father’s closest friend, and an uncle to us from a young age when I still lived in Dimona. A beloved man, with a huge heart.” Steve, Valeri’s son, visited the site where his father and so many others were gunned down, a month after the attack, and told Channel 12 news that the family “still haven’t accepted that this happened — we feel that Dad is coming home any minute.” Valeri’s son, Alon, told Ynet that his father was looking forward to the day trip to the Dead Sea, “to disconnect a little bit from work.” “Dad was probably the funniest person ever,” said Alon. “He got along with everyone and he had a big heart, we never saw him argue or fight with anyone, or say ‘no’ to anybody who asked him for anything. He was a special guy, he was always there for his grandchildren and for everyone.” Read more Those We Have Lost stories here.",

        "content": "Georgie Palmer reacts to being kicked off flight over daughter's nut allergy A BBC weather presenter whose family was kicked off a flight has said the ordeal was \"humiliating\". Georgie Palmer, 49, her husband Nick Sollom, 48, and daughters Rosie, 12, and Annie, 14, were ordered off the plane after they told the crew Rosie was allergic to peanuts. Staff on the flight from Gatwick Airport to Dalaman in Turkey refused to make an announcement to tell passengers not to eat peanuts, according to Ms Palmer. The forecaster said she gently asked fellow passengers sitting around her not to eat peanuts and to pass the message on. But Ms Palmer claimed the \"angry\" captain of the jet insisted they get off the plane before it would take off. She told Good Morning Britain the experience was \"absolutely humiliating\" for her daughter. Ms Palmer added: \"When he (the captain) found out I had spoken to the other passengers he was screaming at me from the cockpit. He was so angry.

It is really beautiful how every passenger on that plane was so wonderful, but nobody working on that plane showed one ounce of compassion.\" Ms Palmer added: \"Rosie is in a terrible state about this. It has ruined her holiday. We don't go away all the time. We maybe fly once a year and have never had problems with other airlines. \"If we had known that policy, we would never have booked with them. We have been through the website with a fine-tooth comb and there is nothing.\" She said there was no way to inform the airline beforehand and wondered how many people with peanut allergies would fly on SunExpress this summer not knowing the policy.

Read our Privacy Policy Ms Palmer said even if her daughter didn't come into direct contact with a peanut, if someone ate one on board, then she could die. The presenter said three days after what happened the family still hadn't heard from SunExpress and the family's insurance says the captain has the discretion to remove people for no reason. A spokesman for SunExpress said: \"We take the safety of our passengers very seriously. Shortly after boarding our flight from London Gatwick, the passenger raised a concern about one of his family group having a serious peanut allergy and requested an announcement to other passengers. \"We refrain from making these kinds of announcements as, like many other airlines, we cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment on our flights, nor prevent other passengers from bringing food items containing allergens on board.\" The spokesman said due to the \"insistent behaviour\" of the passenger to others on board that they should not consume nuts, the captain decided it would be safest if the family did not travel on the flight. Trending The family was told to get off the plane at London Gatwick (Image: Getty) He added: \"When this was explained to the passenger, he did exhibit aggressive behaviour towards our crew members and tried to gain access to the cockpit. \"To ensure the safety of our crew and our passengers on board, we cannot tolerate aggressive and unruly behaviour on our flights. \"Additionally, our website states passengers must notify us 48 hours in advance of any special care required due to a medical condition and no such notification was received from the passengers in this instance.\" The spokesman said the airline is fully aware this was an upsetting situation for the family and is taking the incident as an opportunity to conduct a review of the information provided during the booking process to ensure \"more effective solutions\" for passengers with allergies. Mr Sollom denied behaving aggressively, but admitted to feeling irked by the decision. He said he knocked on the cockpit door in a bid to speak to the captain after being told the family's bags were being removed from the plane.

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: An international team of scientists from Finland, Canada, the US, and New Zealand has discovered a specific brain network hub that plays a key role in stuttering, an advance that can lead to new treatment options. The research, published in the Brain journal, examines two different types of stuttering — developmental and acquired. While both types are traditionally known to be separate, the study showed that besides “similarities at the behavioural level, there are also similarities at the neural level”. “Stuttering affects approximately 1 per cent of adults and can result in significant communication problems and social anxiety, yet the cause of stuttering is still unknown,” said lead author Catherine Theys, Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. The professor said that while stuttering is a developmental disorder, it can also be caused by focal brain damage after a stroke or other neurological conditions. For the study, the team used two datasets and lesion network mapping to test whether lesions causing acquired stuttering map to a common brain network. They also used a third dataset to test whether this lesion-based network was relevant to developmental stuttering. Analysing each dataset, the team located a common stuttering network — a specific part of the left putamen, which is responsible for lip and face movements and timing and sequencing of speech. They also identified two additional areas of interest for speech imaging and stuttering research — the claustrum and amygdalostriatal transition area. “These are tiny areas of the brain — only a few mm wide — which is why they may typically not have been identified in previous studies. This shows a plausible network for stuttering,” they said, adding that the findings have relevance for treatment.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

        "content": "In her May 27 , Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili called for “full mobilization” of Georgians living abroad for the October parliamentary elections, a crucial vote that she recently dubbed a “referendum” on the country’s future. “Our future is in your hands, your vote will be very important, and I am waiting for you in Georgia or in the country where you live to show us, to tell us what kind of future you want for Georgia,” Zurabishvili told “over a million” of Georgian emigrants. According to the President, her address comes on a “Diaspora Day” which, contrary to custom and for reasons unknown to her, was not marked this year. Referring to the vision for the upcoming elections [Georgian Charter] that during the Independence Day celebrations on May 26, the President said that the diaspora is of “great importance” in the “plan.” “When the [foreign policy] course, the orientation, the future of our country is at stake: will it be a European country in close, tight relations with our partners or an isolated, some kind of Neo-Russian country – your role and your involvement in this decision is very important,” Zurabishvili said. Over the past few months, the President, along with opposition parties and civil society organizations, for a more active engagement of the diaspora in the October elections, where the votes of Georgians living abroad could be decisive. However, calls for the Georgian government to do more to facilitate the exercise of voting rights for Georgian emigres have largely gone unanswered.",

        "description": "Police say spectacles found near military barracks hours after soldier snatched them during tour of first premier's desert abode; pilferer interrogated, put on remandThe post Ben-Gurion’s stolen glasses returned to Sde Boker museum appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "Glasses belonging to David Ben-Gurion were returned on Sunday to the founding prime minister’s hut-turned-commemorative museum in the southern kibbutz of Sde Boker, after a soldier stole them during a tour of the site, police said. The spectacles, which hold “historical and national significance,” were found near a military barracks in southern Israel, where the soldier who filched them had apparently tucked them away, police said in a statement. The soldier was put on remand after police investigated him, according to the statement. Gil Schneider, the museum’s manager, told Kan public radio that a staff member had alerted her Sunday morning that the glasses were missing. “First we had to check, maybe someone took them for treatment, because the items here are treated individually,” said Schneider of the museum’s copious collection, which includes Ben-Gurion’s 5,000-book library. Perusing hours of security camera footage, Schneider said, she discovered that a person in uniform — apparently a soldier — had seized a moment when his tour guide was not looking to cross the ropes cordoning off the exhibit and slip the glasses into his pocket. Soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces are often made to participate in “Culture Sunday” trips, during which they are taken to national landmarks before returning to their bases after weekends at home. It was unclear whether Ben-Gurion’s glasses were pilfered during such a tour. The museum lodged an online complaint to the police, which the Dimona police station responded to within less than an hour, Schneider said. Later that evening, police informed her that the glasses had been located, and would be returned the following day. Ben-Gurion, who as head of the Jewish Agency assumed the office of prime minister after proclaiming the founding of Israel in 1948, moved with his wife Paula to the Negev Desert’s Kibbuz Sde Boker after resigning the premiership five years later (he returned in 1955 for another eight-year stint). In moving south, the founding father famously called on Israel to “make the desert bloom” and tap into the unrealized potential of the Negev, which made up about two-thirds of the new state’s territory. Upon his death in 1973, Ben-Gurion’s hut was turned into a museum in his memory. Sde Boker also houses the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, which develop methods for food production in arid areas, and are affiliated with the Beersheba university that carries Ben-Gurion’s name.",

The UN human rights chief voiced “horror” at the Israeli air strike that killed 45 people in a displacement camp in Rafah and demanded “accountability”. “The images from the camp are horrific and point to no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by Israel that have already led to so many civilian deaths,” Volker Turk said in a statement, also calling on Palestinian armed groups to stop firing rockets and to “unconditionally release all hostages at once”.",

        "content": "PORT HARCOURT – The Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has donated 100 pieces of five seater wooden desks to the Community Secondary School, Rumuekini in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. Handing over the desks following a brief ceremony, the Rivers State representative on the Board of the NDDC, Chief Tony Okocha, said the gesture was in line with the mandate of the commission in improving the lives of the people. Daily Independent learnt that students of the benefiting school before NDDC intervention, took their classes sitting on bare floor or makeshift chairs. Okocha said, he was moved to intervene after he saw students of the school learning while sitting on the floor when he visited the school for on the spot assessment. He said after his visit, he drew the attention of the NDDC headed by Mr. Chiedu Ebie as the Chairman and Dr Samuel Ogbuku as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, adding that prompt action was taken afterwards to salvage the situation. He said, “I visited the school one morning without anyone’s knowledge and saw students sitting in an uncomfortable environment and I was imagining how they could comprehend what the teacher was teaching under such conditions. “I also discovered that if it rains, the students will be in trouble because there are no windows in the school building. I swiftly drew the attention of the NDDC Board to the plight of those students and hence these desks.” He further stated, “Each of the desks can comfortably accommodate 5 to 7 students, which means that at the minimum, we have taken about 500 to 700 students off the ground.” Chief Okocha also used the occasion to appeal to Nigerians to be patient with the Federal Government and keep to continue supporting President Bola Tinubu, assuring that the NDDC will look into other infrastructural needs of the school. Chairman of the Rumuekini Community Development Committee, CDC, Gentle Akani, who spoke on behalf of the community, thanked the NDDC, especially Chief Tony Okocha for the intervention Akani, also begged the NDDC to continue to do more for the school and his entire community. Some students who expressed their happiness over the donations, thanked Chief Tony Okocha and the leadership of the Commission for alleviating their sufferings. “We thank the NDDC for coming to our aide. Before now, we didn’t have desk to sit, so used to sit on the floor to learn and write. The teachers are complaining because our learning board is so bad. So, we feel so excited with the provision of these desks today by the NDDC. “We pray God to bless everyone that made this to happen today.”",

        "content": "Canada announced on Monday that it will grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for relatives of Canadian living in the war-torn Palestinian enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the Canadian immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. “While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,” Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister had previously said that leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program’s efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, he added. There was no immediate comment from Israel or Egypt regarding Canada’s announcement. A spokesperson for Miller said 448 Gazans had been issued a temporary visa, including 254 under a public policy, and that 41 have arrived in Canada so far. The temporary visas are valid for three years after entering the country, according to the Canadian government website. The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas’s October 7 massacre, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 252 hostages, mostly civilians, amid acts of brutality and sexual assault. Vowing to destroy Hamas’s military and governance capabilities in Gaza and bring the hostages home, Israel launched a wide-scale operation in the Strip which is ongoing. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 35,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though only some 24,000 fatalities have been identified at hospitals. The tolls, which cannot be verified, include some 15,000 terror operatives Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. An estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza’s population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. A total of 288 IDF soldiers have been killed during the ground offensive against Hamas and during operations along the Gaza border, as well as a acivilian Defense Ministry contractor.",

CCTV footage showed four persons abandoning the body at the spot. Karnataka police said it appeared that Madhu had been attacked by broken beer bottles and a rock. No complaint has been lodged with the Jeedimetla police yet, officials said. Sub-inspector D. Shailaja of the Mannaekhalli police in Karnataka told Deccan Chronicle: “We have received a call on Saturday morning about an unidentified body.” She said that preliminary investigation based on the statements of Madhu’s family members indicated that the murder could be the result of previous enmity. “CCTV footage from the area showed four persons abandoning his body in a deserted place. It shows that they might have murdered him somewhere else,” Shailaja said. According to reliable sources, on Friday afternoon Madhu's friend Renuka Prasad and two others, Nikith and P. Gopi, took Madhu from his house. Madhu informed his family members that he was going to Bidar with them for some work. Later that night, he called again to say he was on his way back home. On Saturday morning, the police informed the family about Madhu's murder. They immediately rushed to the scene. Investigations are underway to ascertain motive behind the murder, the police said.",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: India is urgently in need of stem cell donors to fight blood cancer that kills over 70,000 lives every year, said experts on Monday ahead of World Blood Cancer Day. World Blood Cancer Day is observed every year on May 28 to raise awareness about deadly cancer and other blood disorders, such as thalassemia and aplastic anaemia, which affect more than a lakh people in the country, Although conventional methods like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, a blood stem cell transplant is the only hope for survival for many blood cancer patients. The health experts noted that every 5 minutes, someone in India gets diagnosed with blood cancer. Yet, the country faces a severe shortage of blood stem cell donors. “Besides being the thalassemia capital of the world, India also has a high prevalence of blood cancers. Stem cell transplants are often the only curative option for these conditions, but finding a compatible stem cell match is difficult, especially in a country as genetically diverse as India,” Dr Rahul Bhargava, Principal Director & Chief BMT, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, told IANS. “In India, someone is diagnosed with blood cancer or a severe blood disorder every five minutes. Despite the global registry having over 41 million donors, India has only about 0.6 million registered. Thousands of patients are in dire need of matching stem cell donors to undergo life-saving transplants,” added Patrick Paul, CEO of DKMS BMST Foundation India — a non-profit.",

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – As the crisis surrounding the Kano Emirate continues, a group, Northern Professionals Forum, has asked the deposed Emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, to allow peace to reign in Kano. The call is contained in a Communiqué issued in Kano on Monday, after the group’s meeting attended by its chapters drawn from the 19 Northern states. The Communiqué, which was read to newsmen by the Director-general of the Forum, Arch.Usman Yusuf, also enjoined politicians with vested interest in the crisis to eschew bitterness and support the new law reinstating Emir Sanusi. “We admonish and call upon the Former Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, to toe the path of Honour and dignity, and allow peace to reign in Kano State. “We equally enjoin all politicians who are the author’s of balkanising the Long Historic monolithic Kano Emirate, to eschew bitterness, and embrace the new law, for the onward progress and continued coexistence of peace-loving people of Kano State. “As indigenous professionals of Northern Nigeria; from diverse fields of expertise and scholarship – we have observed with keen interest the controversy surrounding the executive assent and approval of the Kano State Emirates Council Amendment Law (Repeal Bil) 2024, passed by the State House of Assembly, approved by Kano State Executive Council and assented to; by His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Kano State. “Having inductively looked at the issues at stake, and of course, upon our legal luminary’s professional counsel and advice; as well, expert autopsy of the subject matter we hereby affirm that the actions of the Kano State House of Assembly, was done in accordance with the provisions of the law and extant rules. “Furthermore, the subsequent approval, assenting of the Bill, consequential dissolution of the embattled Emirates and Reinstatement of His Royal Highness, Muhammadu Sanusi II, as 16th Emir of Kano – were all in tandem with the rule of law and powers conferred on the Governor as enshrined in 1999 constitution (as amended). “Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II, being one of Arewa’s finest intellectual property, an internationally celebrated economic magnet, a repertoire of Islamic Ideals and Knowledge, as well an orator of high standing – is the best bait for contemporary development of Kano State, the North and Nigeria in general”, the Forum added. Abdullahi Yusuf is a seasoned journalist, communicator and was previously the Deputy Editor-In-Chief and Zonal Manager, News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, Jos, where he retired on December 15, 2021",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "One of the most shocking firings in recent professional wrestling history is the one of Scott D’Amore’s . D’Amore was the former president of TNA Wrestling, but he was surprisingly let go by parent company Anthem in February. Multiple wrestlers who had worked with him in the past had nothing but positive things to say about him. Recently, the Aerial Assassin Will Ospreay also shared his thoughts on the former TNA President. While speaking to Adrian Hernandez , Will Ospreay shared how important Scott D’Amore was to TNA Wrestling. The Aerial Assassin also wanted All Elite Wrestling to hire D’Amore in some fashion. He also wished that the promotion would hire him to look after Ring of Honor. “I remember when I was back there for the IMPACT Show where they announced that it was going to be TNA in January. I looked in the ring and I saw Scott D’Amore in there. And I can’t tell you how much respect I have for Scott D’Amore. And like, if there was anything that I want to put out there... If there is a way that AEW could hire Scott D’Amore in any type of fashion like, have that guy run Ring of Honor or something. “Because the passion that he had for TNA and just how he completely single-handedly transformed that company... I watched him say, that this is TNA and I saw Josh Alexander in there, I saw Jordynne Grace in there, I saw Gisele Shaw, I saw all of these guys, and I just looked... And I was like, ‘Yeah man! That was TNA. That is TNA.’ All the guys that they got there now, that is TNA man!” Will Ospreay said. Would you like to see Scott D’Amore sign with AEW?

        "content": "DALLAS — A year ago, Anthony Edwards sat silently at his locker after Minnesota went down 3-0 to Denver in the first-round series and stared into the mirror before eventually getting up and walking out without saying a word. Two days later, he scored 34 points on the strength of five three-pointers to lead the Timberwolves to a Game 4 victory over the Nuggets. The win, the only victory of last year’s playoffs for Minnesota, had meaning to Edwards. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t ever want to say I got swept in my career,” he said. Mike Conley sat at his locker after Minnesota’s dramatic Game 7 victory in Denver in the Western Conference semifinals, and was asked, “What’s next?” Conley secured his first career playoff sweep in Round 1 against Phoenix. He notched his first Game 7 victory in Denver. Surely, there was another box to check on the horizon. The veteran point guard’s answer: “Win a conference finals game.” ADVERTISEMENT Conley’s goals are certainly higher than that; the 36-year-old point guard yearns to win an NBA championship before he hangs up his sneakers. But it’s well documented by now that this is Conley’s second conference finals appearance – and first since 2013. And his team in 2013, the Memphis Grizzlies, was swept by San Antonio that season. An identical exit would likely cut a little deeper 11 years later. No NBA team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7 series in 154 tries — and both the Wolves and Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals find themselves in such a hole. So no, it’s not likely Minnesota will reel off four straight victories to reach the franchise’s first NBA Finals. Though, hey, who knows? But just nabbing a win Tuesday in Game 4 would mean something. It would mean no sweep of Edwards. It would mean another small career achievement for Conley. It would also mean Minnesota gets to fight another day. ADVERTISEMENT That’s the Wolves’ plan. “I just told them to keep fighting. We fight. We’ve been fighting all series, and we’re not going to stop fighting,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “We’ll look at it, we’ll build it back up and we’ll be ready to go on Tuesday, and see what happens from there.” It’s true, the Wolves have been resilient all year. Whenever a player went down, another stepped up. When a deficit grew, the Wolves responded and rallied. Lest we forget the defending NBA champions led Minnesota by 20 points on their home court in the second half of a Game 7, and the Wolves still won. ADVERTISEMENT Perhaps the team that has routinely set new franchise marks will achieve an NBA first, as well. One thing is for sure: If the Wolves go down, it will be swinging. “If (there’s) a team that can do it, I think it’s us. We’re built to do that,” Wolves forward Naz Reid said. “Everybody still got their heads up. You don’t want to go down 0-3, but it’s part of life. We’re not going to hang our head about it. We’re going to go out there and fix it.” It’s worth a try. ADVERTISEMENT “We ain’t got nothing else to do,” Edwards said. “We can’t do nothing but be positive at this point. We can’t be negative. Just try to get it one win at a time.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "Ever since the Society was cruelly canceled after the first season, fans have been crying out for it to somehow return – and our hopes could possibly get answered soon. The beloved series premiered on Netflix in May, 2019, and followed teenagers who were displaced from their hometown while on a school trip – and thrown into an identical version, without any adult supervision. They were forced to take things into their own hands and created their own community, but things quickly got out of hand and spiraled into a Lord of the Flies-style situation with an almighty cliffhanger. Viewers watched in their droves, with TV bosses initially renewing the program for a second season, but it was eventually canceled due to the global pandemic , leading to huge backlash. Five years on, fans’ calls for more episodes have not quietened , with creator Christopher Keyser touched by the huge response – teasing that those behind the camera are always trying to come up with ways to move the story on. In fact, we were almost close to getting new episodes in the form of a graphic novel before the publishing company went bust. ‘This wasn’t a normal cancellation. This wasn’t about not having the audience or we didn’t believe in it anymore. There was a global crisis that changed all of our lives in the one year we were able to make it,’ he insisted to Variety . ‘I have consistent conversations with a bunch of the writers and Marc Webb [executive producer] about how we might bring this back in some way. We don’t have an answer yet, and I wouldn’t count on it, but I don’t do that with every show that gets canceled. ‘The audience still wants to talk about it. They are still moved by it and want answers to the questions and then new questions are posed. I just don’t know whether the world is going to work in a way that aligns for us, but we’ll keep trying for a while because it’s gotten under my skin as well.’ Kathryn Newton, Gideon Adlon, Olivia DeJonge, Toby Wallace and Jacques Colimon led the cast of youngsters as they desperately tried to understand their plight, and how their lives had changed in the blink of an eye. The first series ended on a huge cliffhanger as viewers learned that the parents of the teens were still alive and well back in ‘normality’, and believed that their children had somehow died. We also had questions about where the school buses transporting the students actually went after vanishing in thin air, and whether the two timelines would ever merge again. Netflix bosses announced the decision to cancel The Society – as well as I Am Not Okay With This – in August, 2020, in the middle of the globall Covid-19 pandemic. ‘We’ve made the difficult decision not to move forward with second seasons of The Society and I Am Not Okay With This,’ they said at the time. ‘We’re disappointed to have to make these decisions due to circumstances created by Covid, and we are grateful to these creators, including: Jonathan Entwistle, Christy Hall, Shawn Levy, Dan Levine, Dan Cohen and Josh Barry at 21 Laps Entertainment for I Am Not Okay With This; Chris Keyser, Marc Webb and Pavlina Hatoupis for The Society; and all the writers, casts and crews who worked tirelessly to make these shows for our members around the world.’ Remaining coy about what could happen next – in case their plans for a revival or a graphic novel ever come to fruition, Christopher vowed that they had the storylines already mapped out. ‘It really feels like this thing that we loved and were ready for was taken away more than anything I’ve ever done,’ he added. ‘That’s true for the writers and Marc Webb, with whom I made the show. There’s a sense that it stopped in mid-animation, but we knew a lot of what was going to happen on the other side. ‘There’s also the emotional thing going on with the audience reaching out to us and consistently saying, “Tell me what happened. When is it coming back?” It was particularly poignant for us since we were closer than I think most shows get to being ready to go again.’ Right on cue, fans began dissecting his comments on social media, begging Netflix to pick up more episodes once again for some much-needed ‘closure’. Taking to Twitter, Elise begged: ‘Bring the entire cast back and continue on, we as a society will ignore the fact they’ve aged.’ Ashley agreed: ‘OH MY GOD?! please I’m begging, I’ve literally never wanted a show to return more than The Society. I need closure!!!’ ‘We were robbed,’ Kathy fumed. ‘This show was renewed then cancelled when it should have been placed on delay. We deserve another season.’ Sam and Nia share marriage update after cheating admissions in Ashley Madison documentary Outraged Netflix subscribers threaten to cancel their memberships ahead of huge change Controversial Netflix series had 'worst TV ending in history' The top critically acclaimed films you didn't realise were on Netflix now Nowwhyami_innit pleaded: ‘Even if it’s one more season FINE! Just tell us wtf happened in that town.’ As Kat Pettibone added: ‘When I say I would sell my soul for this! It would be my biggest win.’ Honestly, hard same. What I Own: My partner and I bought our own home before we were 30 — through a loophole I pay £395 a month to live in an underground doomsday bunker 'Magical' town with two castles named best place to live in the South West What I Rent: 'I pay £1,925 for a one bed flat but it revived my social life after divorce' Someone is literally renting out their garden shed – for £1,300 per month The Society is available to stream on Netflix now.

        "description": "The Orioles unveiled a new version of the hot dog race on Monday, with a human-sized version of Relish beating Mustard and Ketchup.",
        "content": "They’re normally digital condiments. On the Jumbotron in center field, three animated hot dogs representing three individual condiments — ketchup, mustard and relish — race around the bases. Not on Monday. Between the fourth and fifth innings of the Orioles’ Memorial Day game against the visiting Boston Red Sox, the trio appeared out of the fence near the out-of-town scoreboard in right field, punched the air, danced a bit, then lined up for a race as The Oriole Bird waved them on. Ketchup, donning red headphones, got the best break and held an early lead. Mustard, donning a squiggly yellow mustache, gained an advantage at the turn into the first base path. But Relish, who has green hair and once endured 34 straight winless home games in 2021 , legged out a late push for the win. The surprise race — like in Toy Story when the toys come to life — was part of a fan giveaway at the ballpark that offered fans condiment-themed T-shirts. Additionally, this real-world race will become a regular occurrence at Camden Yards this season. The next one will be on Sunday during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays with three more June races to follow. Baltimore isn’t the only ball club to have such lifelike races between innings. The Milwaukee Brewers have been sending a group of sausages racing around the ballpark since the 1990s. The Washington Nationals have the racing presidents and, like Relish, Teddy Roosevelt had a cold streak to open the season in 2006. Tampa Bay has a soda-branded race. The most terrifying of them all is likely Atlanta’s Home Depot hammer, saw, paint brush and power drill race. The Orioles are going a step further adding a “Meat” & Greet with the Camden Franks & The Oriole Bird from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday at the Weis Market in Pasadena. When the Detroit Tigers visit in late September, fans will be treated to three straight days of the mascot race. This story might be updated.",

        "description": "After the political change in the country, private schools reduced its fee by 50 percent on the basis of different reasons and there has been an increase in the number of newly enrolled students recently in these schools.",
        "content": "KABUL (Pajhwok): After the political change in the country, private schools reduced its fee by 50 percent on the basis of different reasons and there has been an increase in the number of newly enrolled students recently in these schools. Mohammad Haroon Rasouli, the Afghanistan’s Private Schools Union (APSU) director, told Pajhwok Afghan News that after the August 15, 2021 regime change, most of the private schools in the capital city of Kabul reduced the fees amount up to 50 percent because of economic problems but the number of the students’ enrollment in schools increased. Rasouli emphasized that public interest in private schools was increasing day by day due to the reduction of fee and so the quality of teaching was getting better and more standardized. However the government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) exempted only 4 percent of the private schools’ fee-duty, but the union had been experiencing more problems in paying their taxes and renewing permits prior and after the takeover by the IEA, Rasoli added. He said: “We faced more challenges during the previous government, we tried to resolve them in meetings with the officials, especially in meetings with education minister ... but unfortunately none of the problems was resolved.” He continued: “The officials of the IEA have more sympathy on us, they try to resolve the problems that we shared with them, however some of the problems are resolved while some of them still remain unsolved, we expect that the IEA will reconsider the issues of the private schools.” “We experience a lot of problems in renewing our schools’ licenses, we have to renew our licenses after every four years once, and getting a new license is easier than its renewal ... the payment of continuous and different duties is another issue.” He added. He said: “If the government makes the 4 percent tax exemption as a permanent discount in duties for private schools, it can help to some extent, the schools must also pay 20 percent of their fee-tax, if it is reduced to 5 or 10 percent that would be better too.” The private schools were also bound to get an operational license from the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA), if the renewal and issuance of schools’ licenses authority is limited to the Ministry of Education (MoE) that would be better.” However, the private schools paid 500 afs monthly tax per square meter billboard advertisement to the municipality during the previous government but the government of the IEA increased this fee to 2,000 afs, he urged authorities to reconsider the discount in this fee. According to Rasoli’s information, right now there are about 5,000 active private schools nationwide. The Etimad Milli Private School vice-principal Zahra Ibrahim Khel told Pajhwok, they reduced the fee of the school by 50 percent after the takeover by the IEA because of the increased economic problems, so the number of the new enrolled students increased. For instance, she said the schools charged each student 1,500 afs monthly fee in secondary and high school level, but now this fee is reduced to 750 afs monthly. The fee of primary level was 1,000 afs monthly which is now only half of this sum, she added. Ibrahim Khel asked the government of the IEA to pay serious attention to the reduction of duties and simplification of licenses renewal procedures. The founder of Talash Danish private school Baba Haidar Jafari said, his school had seven branches in Kabul and central Bamyan provinces and they also reduced the students’ fee up to 50 percent. Referring to the increasing number of students, he said girls above grade six were allowed to study, the number of their student can probably jump higher than this. Haidar added, with the cut in students’ fee, they also reduced the salaries of their teachers by 40 percent. Baba Haidar asked the government for cut in duties and simplification of the schools licenses’ issuance and extension procedures. Pajhwok tried to get the viewpoint of the Ministry of Finance (MoF), Kabul municipality and the AISA authority on requests for the reduction of duties and the cut in advertisement boards’ charges and the simplification of licensing procedures but no response was provided. The only official who commented on this was the Kabul municipality representative Nimatullah Barakzai, he said: “The tax on advertisements’ boards charges are paid to the government based on a legal regulation, only the shops are exceptionally exempted from paying this tax, but if they display more advertisement alongside the roads or on pathways, they would be dealt with in accordance with the laws.” Aw/nh Views: 4",

He also analysed the roadshows by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata. With a massive roadshow in Kolkata, Prime Minister Modi is expected to mount a last-ditch effort in the Bengal elections—this will be his final face-to-face meeting with Mamata Banerjee. The \"Bangalir Mone Modi\" roadshow will travel through important historical sites. Modi will travel in a hi-tech bulletproof car, showcasing a grand spectacle of Bengali culture. The theme of Modi’s roadshow, ‘Bangalir Mone Modi’, translates to ‘Modi is in the heart of Bengalis’. The Prime Minister’s 2-km roadshow will commence from Vidhan Saryan of Shyam Bazar and conclude at Swami Vivekananda’s house. This route holds historical significance as it was frequently used by Swami Vivekananda to visit his Guru, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.

Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, has been seen to strategically position her campaign events to coincide with or follow Modi’s. She will hold a rally in south Kolkata at the same time Modi is in North Kolkata and will campaign along the same route in North Kolkata the following day to counteract the Modi effect. The seventh phase of the election will decide the fate of 9 seats in Bengal, all of which were won by the TMC in 2019. The BJP is focused on winning these seats, while Mamata Banerjee’s mission is to retain them. The campaign has been charged, with both parties making strong allegations against each other.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Elsewhere in Rafah, the director of the Kuwait Hospital, one of the city’s last functioning medical centers, said it was shutting down and that staff members were relocating to a field hospital. Dr. Suhaib al-Hamas said the decision was made after a strike killed two health workers Monday at the entrance to the hospital. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he says are Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into possible violations of international law, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of property crimes and looting were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, a ruling it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "description": "As Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial is winding down, the threats for Stormy Daniels are never-ending, as the former pornstar continuously receives death wishes from Trump fans",
        "content": "Former president Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels , the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar,' ‘slut,' ‘gold digger.' This time around, it’s different. It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat.'\" READ MORE: Donald Trump's confidence takes hit as he sends 'warning signal' to crowd booing him Stormy Daniels has opened up about her experience of the Trump hush money trial in a new documentary The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” The new documentary will air as closing arguments are heard in the trial For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time on Tuesday night in the UK on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” Stormy Daniels thanked her attorney, Clark Brewster She adds that that is a ‘direct threat.' Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again.\" Trump is facing 34 counts of falsifying business records in the hush money trial ( Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” Stormy Daniels said she's 'desensitised' now She talks philosophically about what she has learnt since the story first broke. “The way this is different from 2018 is that I have more knowledge, “ she says. “The shock of it’s not the same. I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” Stormy premieres Tuesday, May 28, Channel 5, 10pm and is also available to stream on My5.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

The CEO said the measures include deployment of two-tier security around the clock, with the innermost perimeter guarded by Central Armed Paramilitary Forces (CAPF) and the outermost perimeter by state armed police; 24×7 CCTV camera coverage of the sealed doors of the strong rooms and corridors, with continuous monitoring; a single entry/exit point to the strong rooms; a double lock system and mandatory videography during the opening and closing of the strong rooms. Among others, maintenance of a logbook for recording visits of authorised officials (General Observers, DEOs, or DCPs) under videography, an operational control room adjacent to the strong rooms and no entry for any vehicles, including those of VIPs and officials, he said. The CEO also informed that agents and representatives of contesting candidates are allowed to closely monitor the security arrangements of these strong rooms through CCTV monitors.",

        "content": "Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. “It’s more nerve-racking watching than playing,” the 34-year-old centre said. “But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. Story continues below advertisement “You’re just itching to be a part of that.” Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. 1:34 Ice District regulars: Meet the stars of the Edmonton Oilers watch party Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. McLeod comes out of Edmonton’s lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers’ penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod taking a seat to the “reset” the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. Story continues below advertisement “There’s a lot to like about his game,” said the coach. “A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He’s been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn’t been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. “We’ve got a lot of players that are playing well. It’s been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.” Hintz, the Stars’ No. 1 centre, hasn’t played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Monday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. “He’s just an awesome player,” Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. “He’s one of the best players in the in the world. You can’t really replace a guy like that. “Being able to get him back, it would be huge.” The game starts shortly after 6:30 p.m. MT.",

        "content": "Dikla Arava, 51 and her son Tomer Arava Eliaz, 17, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7. Terrorists stormed into the home of Noam Elyakim, Dikla’s longtime boyfriend, whose two daughters, Dafna, 15 and Ela, 8, were also home. The terrorists cruelly forced Tomer at gunpoint to knock on the doors of their neighbors and try to convince them to come outside — all the while livestreaming their psychological and physical terror on Dikla’s Facebook page. Ultimately, the terrorists murdered Tomer, Dikla and Noam, and kidnapped Dafna and Ela to Gaza, where they were held captive for 51 days before being released as part of a truce deal on November 26. Dikla and Tomer’s bodies were only discovered and identified more than a week after the attack, outside the kibbutz grounds. They were buried side by side on October 16 in Kfar Maimon. Dikla and Tomer are survived by their two other older children/siblings, Odin and Stav, and Tomer is also survived by his father, Ma’ayan. A eulogy from the kibbutz lauded Tomer, a student in 12th grade, for “acting with bravery in the face of the murderers who took him as a captive... Tomer acted calmly and with nobility at the gunpoint of the killers.” The teenager, the kibbutz said, was “a magical boy, an angel, a golden child with a good heart, full of joy for life.” His friends and family noted his love of trance music and festivals, as well as his addiction to the gym and working out. On an Instagram memorial page set up for Tomer, his sister, Odin, wrote there are “not enough words that can describe what a wonderful person you were.” “Thank you for everything you were to me, that you always worried about me and put me first, even on that horrible Saturday when you thought about me and checked if I was OK,” she wrote. “Thank you for opening your heart before me like you never did with anyone else. Thank you for recording our conversations which are now all I have left to make me smile again. My angel — you always wanted to be taller than me, and now you are in the highest place in heaven and looking down on me from above.” Weeks after she returned from captivity, Dafna wrote on Instagram that “my Tomer, I miss you so much, it’s hard for me without you. Until 135 days ago we would go to school together every day, and now I go to school alone every day.” In April, Dafna wrote a message to Dikla, noting that it had been “196 days that I haven’t heard you, 196 days that I haven’t seen your smile in person and not in photos, 196 days that you are watching over me from above... I hope you are happy and joyful up there.” The kibbutz eulogy for Dikla noted that she ran the education system for Nahal Oz, and in later years was an educational consultant for preschools. “Dikla was full of life, loved to dance, to be happy, was a warrior mother for her children,” the eulogy noted. “Her charming smile and laughter will be missed in all of our meetings.” Maayan Zin, Noam’s ex-wife and the mother of Dafna and Ela, wrote on Facebook that Dikla “loved my daughters so much and my girls loved Dikla so much.” She said that Dafna and Dikla “connected immediately — Dafna loved her from the first minute they met, they would swap shoes, put on makeup and laugh, Dikla was so present in her life.” Ela, she said, “doesn’t know any life without Dikla. Without Dikla’s family.” “So yes, Dikla is the new girlfriend, but what Dikla gave to Dafna and Ela and Noam nobody can take away from her,” added Maayan. “I just hope she didn’t suffer in her final moments.” Shalev Zarka, who is married to Dikla’s niece, noted in a eulogy at the funeral that when he joined the family five years earlier, “I heard so many stories about you, and when we met we fell in love in a moment.” “Aunt Diki, I love you so much. You were a listening ear to me at any time of day — every phone call from you, every cigarette with you by the fish pond was an experience I will never forget,” he said. “And Tomer — ‘Tomer the king’ — that’s how you are written in my phone,” Shalev continued. “You were the king in my eyes. Determined in every task, working out like crazy, we would compete in the gym — and you at age 17 would crush me every time. I will take your determination to reach every goal and stand by it. The desire to be the best at everything you wanted to be.” “Tomer, even in your final moments, when we saw you facing the terrorists, you were such a warrior. Determined and composed. I love you so much.” Read more Those We Have Lost stories here.",

        "content": "POTTSTOWN — A threatened thunderstorm held back Monday morning long enough for the borough’s Memorial Day Parade and Services to be held. Leaving from its muster point in front of the Goodwill Firehouse at High and Bailey streets, the parade made its way west along High Street, cut a right onto Manatawny Street and headed to the Veterans Island area of Memorial Park. More than 14 fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, a sampling of classic cars, flag-bearing motorcycles, military vehicles and marching bands from Pottstown and Pottsgrove middle schools were all part of the all-American event marching down an all-American Main Street. There were almost as many American flags as there was chrome on this vintage Cadillac in Pottstown's Memorial Day Parade Monday. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The Pottsgrove Middle School Band was one of two bands that marched in Monday's Memorial Day Parade in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown Police Officers rode patrol bikes along the parade route to ensure the safety of all. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Members of the St. Nicholas Patriotic Society brought along their best classic cars for the Memorial Day Parade Monday in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Classic military vehicles joined the other classic cars that participated in Monday's Memorial Day parade in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Crowds, smaller than some years no doubt due to the ever-present threat of rain, were nonetheless enthusiastic and appreciative. At Memorial Park, the services organized by the Joint Veterans Council of Pottstown began by introducing Joseph Tursi, USMC, the 2024 Veteran of the Year, who told the crowd simply to remember what, and who, the holiday is really meant for. Echoing Tursi’s sentiment, Rabbi Cynthia Kravitz of Congregation Hesed Shel Emet, offered a prayer whose theme was “We remember them.” Montgomery County Commissioner Tom DiBello called Memorial Day “the most important holiday on the U.S. calendar.” He quoted James Garfield, former Major General, then congressman and future U.S, president, who gave the address at the first Decoration Day celebration at Arlington National Cemetery in 1868: “We do not know one promise these men made, one pledge they gave, one word they spoke; but we do know they summed up and perfected, by one supreme act, the highest virtues of men and citizens. For love of country, they accepted death, and thus resolved all doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and their virtue.” The Owen J. Roberts ROTC unit leads the Pottstown Memorial Day parade Monday by carrying the colors. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The crowd at Monday's Memorial Day services on Veterans Island stand for the playing of the national anthem. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The Korean War memorial wreath was one of 13 such wreaths placed on Veterans Island Monday during Pottstown's Memorial Day services. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown resident and Vietnam Veteran Jonathan Raden contemplates the World War II Memorial on Veterans Island Monday in Memorial Park. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown resident and Navy veteran Jonathan Raden, points to the name of his father, Army veteran Joseph Raden, on the World War II Memorial in Pottstown's Veterans Island. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) DiBello said Montgomery County provided 62,000 flags for Memorial Day and has re0-named and refocused its veterans services department to be more effective. State Rep. Paul Friel, d-26th Dist., said “when we watch the American flag fully ascend once again, our thoughts will be with our servicemembers both lost and living — including the nearly 200,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines beyond our shores as we gather here, so ably protecting us far from home. They too join us in mourning the fallen. They too join us in celebrating our strength. And like those we remember today, they too serve in a long line of patriots who fought in places like Lexington and Concord; Gettysburg and Midway; and, more recently, Fallujah and Helmand.” “There is no greater sacrifice than to give your life in the defense of this nation,” said state Rep. Joe Ciresi, D-146th Dist. The day’s speaker was Robert W. Boyce, a retired submarine commander who also taught high school and was manager for a decade of the Limerick Nuclear Generating Station. “This holiday,” said Boyce, “is not about hot dogs and hamburgers. It’s about the men and women who served this nation to their death.” The nation, Boyce said, “is facing multiple crises” at the same time its armed forces are depleted. None of the military’s branches met their recruitment goals in the last year, he said, urging young people to join and “serve your country.” As the ceremony came to a close, Marine Corps veteran Billy Worrell stood along among the trees and flowers of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and mournfully played “Taps.”",

Speaking to the Israeli parliament on Monday, Netanyahu emphasized that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had taken \"every precaution possible\" to protect civilians in Gaza. He insisted that the IDF had used their \"best efforts not to harm those uninvolved\" in the conflict, as reported by NBC News. The airstrike has drawn widespread condemnation from international organizations. The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called the strike \"horrifying,\" urging Israel to comply with a recent International Court of Justice ruling to halt strikes on Rafah. The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, criticized the attack, highlighting the lack of change in Israel's methods despite previous civilian casualties. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, the strike resulted in severe burns, fractures, and shrapnel wounds among hundreds of Palestinians. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported treating at least 180 wounded people and receiving 28 dead, including women and children. MSF condemned the strike, asserting that it showed a complete disregard for civilian lives in Gaza, as per BBC . The Palestinian Red Crescent stated that the airstrike targeted tents near a UN facility in Tal al-Sultan, approximately 2 kilometers northwest of Rafah. Graphic footage from the scene showed intense fires and severe casualties, including children. Despite Israeli claims that the strike targeted senior Hamas leaders, the presence of displaced civilians has raised significant questions about the strike's execution and intelligence basis. Netanyahu acknowledged the civilian casualties and announced an investigation to understand what went wrong. \"In Rafah, we already evacuated about one million non-combatant residents, and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,\" he said. \"We are investigating the incident and will reach conclusions because this is our policy.\" The attack has heightened tensions, with Qatar warning that it could derail cease-fire negotiations. Egypt reported a fatal incident involving its soldier at the Rafah border, further complicating the situation. The IDF acknowledged the shooting incident and confirmed ongoing discussions with Egyptian authorities. The U.S. National Security Council described the images from Rafah as \"heartbreaking,\" while affirming Israel's right to target Hamas. However, the council stressed the importance of minimizing civilian casualties. Israel © Copyright IBTimes 2024. All rights reserved.

        "content": "Richard Dreyfuss is in hot water with fans after a Q&A before a \"Jaws\" screening allegedly took a wild turn ... with many online accusing him of sexism and homophobia. The actor appeared at The Cabot Theater in Beverly, Massachusetts Saturday night for a discussion with fans of the hit 1975 film ... during which fans are saying he made comments about transgender people -- particularly transgender kids. Video of the rant itself hasn't surfaced yet ... but, a clip allegedly shot in the lead-up to the convo is floating around on YouTube -- and, it shows Dreyfuss wearing a dress and performing a dance of sorts to Taylor Swift 's \"Love Story.\" Check out the video, allegedly taken before the talk ... it's odd for sure, and though many fans are laughing, attendees online are making it clear nobody was laughing by the end of the talk with Dreyfuss who apparently said people shouldn't listen to kids who say they are transgender and want to transition. Social media users are saying Richard blasted the Academy Awards' new inclusivity rules too -- not exactly a shock 'cause he's done that quite a bit in recent months. Others are saying he said women are too passive to make big movies work, and some add he took shots at Barbra Streisand and Steven Spielberg . Again, we haven't actually heard what Richard said, and these are all claims people online are making ... but, they all tell a similar tale of Dreyfuss slamming minority groups -- and, it's not making the guy look good. I need to know what Richard Dreyfuss said at a jaws screening last night that inspired this email pic.twitter.com/qkIgrwbtqK The Cabot issued an apology for Richard's remarks Monday, stating clearly they do not endorse what the actor said in any way. We've reached out to Richard's reps ... so far, no word back.",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: The Election Commission of India (ECI) Monday complimented the electorate of Jammu and Kashmir for the 35-year high voter turnout. The ECI termed J&K witnessing its highest poll participation in the last 35 years as a massive stride for India’s electoral polity. It said that the Combined Voter Turnout (VTR) at the polling stations for the entire J&K (5 Lok Sabha seats) was 58.46 percent in the Lok Sabha polls. The ECI said that this significant participation was a testament to the robust democratic spirit and civic engagement of the people in the region. The ECI led by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar and Election Commissioners (ECs) Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu thanked the polling personnel and security officials for the peaceful conduct of elections in J&K. CEC Rajiv Kumar while conveying ECI’s compliments to the voters of J&K said, “This achievement sits on a credible weave of 25 percent increase in the number of contesting candidates since 2019, C-vigil complaints showing enhanced citizen involvement, and Suvidha Portal showing 2455 requests for rallies, reflecting the steady retaking of the election and campaign space away from hesitation and to fuller participation.” He compared this outcome of the layered depth of electoral mobilisation and participation, as reminiscent of the fame and deft of the legendary Kashmiri artisanal weave. Kumar said that this active participation was a huge positive for the assembly elections to be held soon so that the democratic process continues to thrive in J&K. The voter turnout of 50.86 percent from the three parliamentary constituencies in Kashmir echoes the faith of the people in the democratic process. The poll participation percentage witnessed 30 points jump from the last Lok Sabha polls in 2019 where it was 19.16 percent. The three parliamentary constituencies in Kashmir – Srinagar, Baramulla, and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded a voter turnout of 38.49 percent, 59.1 percent and 54.84 percent, which has been the highest in the last three decades. The other two parliamentary constituencies in J&K – Udhampur and Jammu recorded 68.27 percent and 72.22 percent voter turnout. The ECI said that the historic participation in J&K was realised by earnest efforts of the election and security officials who had worked tirelessly to empower the people of J&K, especially the youth to participate in the elections. It said that more young people had asserted their faith and embraced democracy in a big way. The ECI said that another interesting perspective is the electors in the age group of 18-59 years which forms the major part of electors in J&K. It said that the high poll percentage in Lok Sabha polls was reflective of their faith in democracy, which was a positive and heartening development. The ECI said that that commission also enabled Kashmiri migrant voters residing at various relief camps in Delhi, Jammu, and Udhampur to also have the option of voting in person at designated special polling stations or using postal ballot. It said that 21 special polling stations were established – 16 at Jammu, one at Udhampur, and four at Delhi. The ECI said that as part of awareness and outreach, a wide range of activities were organised under the SVEEP programme in J&K for Lok Sabha elections. The office of the Chief Electoral Officer, J&K, organised adventure sports events, symposiums, awareness rallies, nukkad nataks, and numerous other events to propagate the message of voting. Amongst various efforts, activities included creating igloos as a dummy polling station in Baramulla, para scooter event in Kathua, sensitisation in Beating the Retreat ceremony on Suchetgarh border, mega awareness rally in Teetwal near the Line of Control (LoC), near Dal Lake in Srinagar to Chougan in Kishtwar and playing instrumental version of ECI song on highest railway bridge. Musical programmes and activities were carried out at many places including Lal Chowk, Gulmarg, Kulgam, and Anantnag by famous singers. Every nook and corner of J&K witnessed a rejuvenation of democracy and victory of the ballot with thumping participation in polling, resulting in a record voter turnout.",

        "content": "Two women have filed a lawsuit accusing kicker Brandon McManus of sexually assaulting them on a Jaguars team flight last year. Michael DiRocco of ESPN reports that the Jaguars are by the two flight attendants for failing to supervise McManus, who now plays for the Commanders, and failing to create a safe environment for staff serving the team. They are seeking a jury trial and more than $1 million in damages. The Jaguars declined an opportunity to comment and a statement from McManus or his attorney is expected to come later on Monday. McManus is accused of trying to kiss one woman while she was seated during a turbulent period of the September flight and “grinding up against her” during one of the flight’s meal services. The second woman also accuses McManus of grinding against her and then “smirked and walked away” when confronted about it. The lawsuit also claims that McManus offered money to other flight attendants to “drink and dance inappropriately.” McManus spent nine seasons with the Broncos before joining the Jaguars last year. He signed a one-year contract with the Commanders in March.",

        "description": "After divorcing themselves from former head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, the Cleveland Cavaliers have been linked to several candidates in their subsequent search for a new locker room leader.",
        "content": "After divorcing themselves from former head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, the Cleveland Cavaliers have been linked to several candidates in their subsequent search for a new locker room leader. On the heels of Bickerstaff’s firing, Golden State Warriors assistant coach Kenny Atkinson and New Orleans Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego were revealed to be the frontrunners for the new vacancy. Days later, New York Knicks associate head coach Johnnie Bryant began gaining steam as a candidate . Now, “the prospect of hiring (former) Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts is among the scenarios Cleveland has contemplated in the initial stages of its coaching search,” per NBA insider Marc Stein. Cavs’ Coaching Search Heats Up With Terry Stotts Among the candidates that the Cavs are reportedly looking into, none has a resume that measures up to Stotts’s. The 2016 Coach of the Year runner-up, Stotts has amassed 540 wins between the regular and postseason. However, he’s ironically had similar success as another former Blazers head coach, Nate McMillan. Both won over half of their regular season games, but it was a different story in the playoffs. Stotts went 23-43, winning just 34.3 percent of his games. McMillan wasn’t much better, going 28-48 for a .368 win percentage. This ultimately led the Blazers to part ways with Stotts, who had led Portland to four First Round exits in five seasons. (McMillan was let go due to locker room disconnect, similar to Bickerstaff). When assessing Stotts as a head coach, the question is whether he’ll have more success in Cleveland. Under Stotts, the Blazers routinely had teams that excelled offensively. In his nine seasons with Portland, they had a top-10 scoring average in seven seasons. This is in large part due to their elite 3-point shooting. With the Cavs’ offense already tailored for 3-point barrages, Stotts should have a smooth transition so far as that end. Furthermore, with Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum developing into stars under him, it inspires confidence in his ability to get the best out of the Donovan Mitchell – Darius Garland pairing. This is particularly important, as Garland may be concerned about how he’s valued if he continues playing alongside Mitchell. However, Stotts’ teams were almost always poor defensively, which is where the Cavs have shined under Bickerstaff. In Bickerstaff’s four full seasons as Cleveland’s head coach, the Cavs ranked in the top-seven in opponents points per game for three consecutive seasons. Their frontcourt personnel lent itself to above-average defense with their length and shot-blocking ability. Still, Bickerstaff even motivated less impactful defenders to play with more gusto. As a result, Garland started generating turnovers at a higher rate. Mitchell played with more energy at that end than he had since his early NBA days. Perhaps that effort will carry over, even without Bickerstaff. Even if it doesn’t, players like Evan Mobley won’t suddenly forget how to play defense. Nonetheless, Cleveland’s ability to continue playing dominant defense under Stotts is a legitimate concern with regard to his potential hire. The Last Word On Terry Stotts Stotts may be the best coaching hire for the Cavs. His background, developmental abilities, and experience coaching a two-headed monster in the backcourt is enticing. Furthermore, though the defensive concerns are sobering, Cleveland’s roster is more suited to hold up at that end. This is particularly true when comparing their respective frontcourts.

The post No family member of terrorists, stone pelters to receive Govt jobs in J&K: Amit Shah appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: In a significant move, Union Home Minister Amit Shah declared that no family member of terrorists or close relatives of stone pelters will be eligible for government jobs in Jammu and Kashmir. This announcement underscores the Modi government’s firm stance on eradicating terrorism and its ecosystem in the region. In an interview with PTI, Shah detailed the government’s uncompromising strategy. “In Kashmir, we have decided that if someone joins a terrorist organization, their family members will not receive any government job,” he said. Shah extended this policy to stone pelters as well, affirming that their families too will be barred from government employment. Despite challenges from human rights activists who approached the Supreme Court, the government’s stance prevailed. However, Shah mentioned an exception: if a family member comes forward to inform authorities about a relative joining a terror outfit, relief may be provided to that family. Shah highlighted the changes in handling the funerals of terrorists. Previously, large processions were a common occurrence, but now, terrorists are buried with full religious rites in isolated locations to prevent public gatherings. “When a terrorist is surrounded by security forces, he is first given a chance to surrender. We bring in family members like his mother or wife to appeal for his surrender. If he refuses, he faces the consequences,” Shah said. The Home Minister said that there was a substantial decline in terror incidents due to the government’s dual approach of targeting terrorists and dismantling the terror ecosystem. “The National Investigation Agency has taken decisive actions against terror funding, significantly curbing it,” he said. Regarding the Popular Front of India (PFI), Shah confirmed that the government has banned its publications and propaganda under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The PFI, a group founded in Kerala, was banned in September 2022 due to its alleged terror links. Touching upon the case of Amritpal Singh, a pro-Khalistani separatist, Shah revealed, “We have incarcerated him under the NSA (National Security Act).” Singh, the leader of ‘Waris Punjab De’ was arrested in April 2023 and is currently lodged in Dibrugarh jail, Assam. Despite his incarceration, Singh has filed nomination papers to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Punjab’s Khadoor Sahib constituency. Union Home Ministry data highlights the impact of these stringent measures. Terror incidents in Jammu and Kashmir dropped from 228 in 2018 to approximately 50 in 2023. Encounters between security forces and terrorists decreased from 189 in 2018 to around 40 in 2023. Civilian casualties due to terror incidents fell from 55 in 2018 to about five in 2023, and security personnel fatalities reduced from 91 in 2018 to around 15 in 2023. The government’s firm actions have led to a notable decline in terrorism and its support systems in Jammu and Kashmir, marking a significant shift towards lasting peace and security in the region.",

        "content": "Atlante’s ultra-fast charging stations, designed by Bertone Design, equipped with solar panels and energy storage systems, will soon arrive on Italian highways to serve electric mobility Milan, Italy — Atlante, the company of NHOA Group dedicated to electric vehicles fast and ultra-fast charging network, has won the first tender in Italy for the design, construction, and management of over 90 ultra-fast charging points for electric vehicles (EV) for Autostrade per l’Italia (ASPI). The charging points will be located in 8 service areas along the highways managed by ASPI and will feature the exclusive design by the international firm Bertone Design, as well as the presence of solar panels and energy storage systems. This award represents an absolute innovation in Italy, where Atlante is the first independent operator to install its charging stations on the ASPI highway network, continuing the path towards widespread electrification on the entire Italian road infrastructure. Atlante’s charging stations, equipped with ultra-fast charging points up to 400kW, will allow electric vehicles to recharge in a few minutes and will be uniformly distributed throughout the national territory, particularly in service areas in Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany, Campania, and Apulia. All Atlante stations will be equipped with photovoltaic panels covering the charging station, combined with storage systems for better management of the solar energy produced on-site. This forward-thinking decision allows Atlante to continue providing an optimal charging experience while offering a charging experience powered by 100% renewable energy. Atlante stations will be recognizable thanks to the iconic canopy designed by Bertone Design and will integrate various technological solutions, including: a system for detecting unauthorized parking of internal combustion engine vehicles, intelligent lighting and signage, and Wi-Fi connection. There will also be digital information totems and a 24-hour video surveillance system. “Our mission is to contribute to achieving zero-emission mobility in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. This award represents a further step after the 87 fast and ultra-fast charging points on the French highways for VINCI Autoroutes and consolidates Atlante’s position as main independent operator in Southern Europe in the development and management of fast and ultra-fast charging networks on highway infrastructures,” commented Stefano Terranova, CEO of Atlante. “Increasing charging stations on Italian highways is a concrete response to concerns about the compatibility of electric vehicles with long-distance travel. Making charging simple and ultra-fast even on highways simplifies the transition to electric mobility, thus contributing to a more sustainable future. These new ultra-fast stations increase Atlante’s presence in strategic Italian infrastructures, from major airports to ring roads and major highways, allowing Atlante customers to recharge throughout the national territory without further worries,” stated Gabriele Tuccillo, CEO of Atlante Italia. Atlante’s charging stations will be accessible 24/7, even to people with reduced mobility, equipped with POS terminals for payment with bank cards, usable by all electric vehicles, and compatible with every charging standard and electric mobility service provider.

        "description": "THE LibDems can take the key third party position at Westminster from the SNP at the General Election, its leader has said ...",
        "content": "Ed Davey made clear his intention to win back the third status in the Commons during a visit to Scotland on Monday. The LibDems have not been Westminster’s third party – which guarantees a spot at Prime Minister’s Questions – since the SNP’s landslide in 2015, and in Holyrood they lost their party status after returning only four MSPs in the 2021 elections. However, speaking in Scotland on Monday, Davey said there could be “more liberals than nationalists” in the new UK parliament. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, Davey pointed to four seats north of the Border his party were targeting – all of which are currently held by SNP MPs. These include Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire – a portion of which was held by former party leader Charles Kennedy before he lost it to the retiring former SNP Westminster boss Ian Blackford – and Mid Dunbartonshire, the successor to the seat lost by former LibDem chief Jo Swinson to the SNP’s Amy Callaghan in 2019. “We are a big part of the change that’s happening,” Davey said. “I think there is a massive desire to get rid of the Conservatives in Westminster and also, actually, to get rid of the SNP. “I think we have a real chance, when we get to July 5 – the day after polling day – there will be more liberals than nationalists in the next parliament. “I think the Liberal Democrats can be the third party in UK politics again.” READ MORE: 'Beggars belief': Keir Starmer calls himself a 'progressive socialist' Seats won by the party, he said, would have “fantastic local champions”, who would “make such a difference” at Westminster and could lead to an increase to funding for the health service. The comments came as the party launched its Scottish General Election campaign, with Davey joining Scottish group leader Alex Cole-Hamilton. The launch focused on the provision of NHS dentistry – a devolved matter – with the pair set to claim the service has been neglected by the Scottish and UK governments. Speaking ahead of the event, Cole-Hamilton said: “People are resorting to DIY dentistry and buying tools off Amazon to do the job themselves because they can’t get an NHS dentist.\" The Scottish LibDems have been under fire after The National revealed that their candidate in a key target seat previously donated £25,000 to Boris Johnson's Tory Party . Dr Lucy Beattie, the SNP’s candidate for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said: “Voters in constituencies such as Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross haven’t forgotten that the LibDems worked along with the Tories to impose huge austerity cuts and cut household incomes. “We need to get rid of the Tory Government. “The way to do that in Scotland is to vote SNP, because we are the main challengers in every Tory-held seat. “Voters can only rely on the SNP to put the interests of Scotland first.”",

        "content": "Police patrols have continued to crack down on public order offences in an Isle of Wight town this bank holiday weekend. South Wight Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) arrested a 42-year-old man from Sandown on suspicion of Public Order Act offences on the High Street. The man was later released, reported for summons and dispersed from Sandown for 48 hours. On the seafront, officers found a large group of people causing ‘a significant disturbance and drinking alcohol to excess'. The behaviour was taking place in an area protected by a Public Space Protection Order, granting police the power to seize and destroy. Officers seized and destroyed the alcohol and used dispersal powers to move the group away from the area for 48 hours. Elsewhere in Sandown, police responded to a report of a female committing public order offences this morning (Monday, May 27). Officers detained a suspect nearby, and they have since been released under investigation. An address in Sandown, linked to significant crime and disorder in the last three months, has been handed an ASB Closure Warning Notice. If the warning notice is not adhered to, South Wight NPT will apply to the courts to forcibly close the address for up to three months. The Neighbourhoods team has also completed several stop searches under the Misuse of Drugs Act in various locations throughout the Bay.

        "content": "Lewis Steele reported [27 May] that Sean Dyche is “exploring” a deal to sign Harrison this summer after featuring regularly when fit in the 2023-24 season. This deal has been made easier as Leeds missed out on promotion to the Premier League at Wembley against Southampton. The Toffees are said to already be exploring getting a deal over the line. Leeds’ 1-0 defeat now means they will look to sell players this summer, which has given the Toffees confidence in signing Harrison. Harrison was a useful asset to Dyche’s squad as Everton secured yet another season of Premier League football with time to spare. The winger has got plenty of experience now in the top division which certainly makes him a positive addition to the side. With himself and Dwight McNeil firing on all cylinders with Dominic Calvert-Lewin through the middle, the Toffees have a solid front line. The 27-year-old will likely come for quite a large fee given the financial situation at Goodison Park, but he could be worth bringing in. In the Premier League last season, he scored three and assisted three but only featured from the start across 25 games [ ]. If he can maintain fitness over the course of the whole campaign, he could prove to be one of Everton’s more important players next season. The positivity behind this move depends on the fee that the Toffees pay to Leeds given the financial struggles they are likely to endure this summer. In other Everton news,",

        "content": "The project, situated next to the Dunes Mall, will consist of 424 single story two-bedroom townhouses. According to the Namibia IHS country manager Henk Snyman, the townhouses will impact people’s lives in terms of space delivery, job creation and social impacts. “The title development of this project is about N$200 million. We are hoping to put the first units on the market at roughly N$600 000 per unit. We are trying to keep affordability as low as possible. From there, [there] will be some escalation as we move on. The project will typically take three to five years to complete, depending on how quickly sales go. It took us six months to flatten the ground,” he said. The IHS Fund II Sub-Saharan Africa raised US$83,9 million from five investors and IHS as the fund manager. Project investors include: the European Investment Bank, Government Institutions Pensions Fund, KFW Development Bank, International Finance Corporation and the Women’s Development Bank. The company has already constructed over 1 700 housing units around Namibia. The total investment by the fund into the Dunes Estate project is N$117,3 million. The company was started in South Africa two decades ago and expanded to Namibia and Botswana, and more recently Kenya. The first completed units are expected by the first quarter of 2025.",

        "content": "The United Nations peacekeeping chief argued against the latest calls for international troops to deploy in Gaza, saying the post-war state of affairs was too uncertain and that any operation would require agreement from Israel, which has been highly critical of the U.N.’s work in Palestinian territories. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, undersecretary-general for peace operations, said in an interview that he’s aware of demands for sending in so-called Blue Helmets, including earlier this month by the Arab League, but cautioned it’s too early and the politics too fraught to consider the option at the moment. “Nobody really knows what the day after in Gaza would look like,” Lacroix said. “We absolutely don’t know what the state of affairs would look like but obviously the parties — and that would certainly include Israel — would have to agree to such a proposition.” Right now, the U.N. is calling “first and foremost” for a humanitarian cease-fire, releasing of hostages, access to aid — and then progress toward a two-state political solution, Lacroix said. He added that deployment was a decision that must be taken up by the 15-member Security Council. The U.N. and its operations in Gaza have come under intense scrutiny by Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack, in which some 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage. Hamas still holds scores of hostages. Israel has accused the U.N.’s main humanitarian organization in Gaza of being infiltrated by Hamas operatives — which the agency denies — and at the U.N. has dismissed criticism of its bombardment of the territory. The Arab League proposal came in the final statement of its meeting in Bahrain May 16. “We call for the deployment of United Nations international protection and peacekeeping forces in the occupied Palestinian territory until the two-state solution is implemented,” the group’s 22 members said in the Bahrain Declaration. Lacroix also addressed the challenges the war in the Gaza Strip has created for 10,500 UN peacekeepers stationed in southern Lebanon. He said the Israel-Hamas war was having a “major impact” on the mission known as Unifil, which he described as a mediator between Israeli and Lebanese forces. More broadly, Lacroix, a veteran French diplomat, said political gridlock was the biggest impediment to U.N.-led operations, beyond just peace and security. “That is really probably the biggest challenge to not only peacekeeping operations, but frankly to anything that the U.N. can do on peace and security,” Lacroix said. “We need to have member states showing unity and commitment to multilateral approaches to crisis.” He didn’t mention any countries by name but the council’s work has been largely frozen by disputes between the U.S. and Russia, two of its five permanent members.",

In a joint sting operation on May 27 with North Ayrshire Trading Standards, cops visited several shops stocking the electric cigarette-style devices. They found one store in Irvine selling unregulated counterfeits. Around 220 devices were confiscated from the location and it is unknown if cops or the trading standards authority took any further action. Police across the country have been cracking down on the sale of illegal devices that are often targeted at young people and teens. Last week the Record reported how police and trading standards seized hundreds of illegal supersized vapes in North Lanarkshire. Following today's operation, a spokesperson for Police Scotland said: \"In a continued intelligence-led partnership with North Ayrshire Trading Standards, police today attended several vape stockists in North Ayrshire. \"Vapes are regulated in the UK, and there is specific guidance which must be met. These include maximum nicotine strength, maximum liquid capacity, compliant packaging and health warnings. \"Within one Irvine store alone today, 220 counterfeit vapes were found and seized.\" Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

        "content": "Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa met European Council President Charles Michel on Sunday in Brussels as part of a visit to the heart of EU institutions. Earlier Sunday, Mustafa met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide who officially gave him recognition of the State of Palestine papers. Mr Mustafa was in Brussels to meet with international partners including EU Foreign Policy chief Josep Borrell and Norway’s Foreign minister who handed over the official papers for recognition. He says the Palestinian Authority is preparing to be the government of the future state of Palestine – including Gaza. \"The first priority is to support our people in Gaza. They need every support we can. And I think the best support we can all do for them is to speed up the ceasefire. Every day represents a major loss of human lives and properties and hope for our people,” said Mohammad Mustafa, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. He also met with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and EU High Representative, Josep Borrell. Meanwhile, the Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares says his country won’t be intimidated by Israel’s response to recognition of Palestine after Israel announced it would no longer allow Spanish NGO’s work in the West Bank. \"Our goal is to recognize the State of Palestine tomorrow and make every possible effort to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible, and ultimately, to reach that definitive peace. That is what is currently focusing our attention, what is important, and what has centered our conversation in the previous meeting and the attack mentioned, I believe that what it does is underline what the International Court of Justice has indicated,\" said José Manuel Albares Bueno, the Spanish Foreign Minister. Norway, Spain and Ireland last week agreed to recognize a Palestinian state in a move welcomed by Palestinians as an affirmation of their decades-long quest. Israel recalled its ambassadors to the three countries in protest. Several European Union countries argue a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. Additional sources • AP",

        "content": "Dividend stocks attract many investors due to their steady cash flow. Corporations with strong balance sheets tend to give out quarterly dividends and hike their payouts every year. This combination makes it feasible for investors to retire on dividend income and cash from other sources, such as Social Security. Some dividend stocks are well positioned to deliver meaningful dividend growth in the upcoming years. Investors may want to keep these rock-solid dividend stocks on their radars. Broadcom (AVGO) Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is a leading semiconductor company that is capitalizing on the AI boom. While the company’s chips generate plenty of demand, its recent acquisition of VMware continues to fuel its earnings. Revenue increased by 34% year-over-year in Q1 2024 as the company reached $11.96 billion. Broadcom anticipates generating more than $50 billion in fiscal 2024. Wall Street analysts have quickly assigned higher price targets for the “Strong Buy” stock. The stock has 21 “Buy” ratings and three “Hold” ratings. The average price target suggests a 12% gain is coming. Broadcom currently offers a 1.49% yield, which is good for a stock up by 459% over the past five years. A 30% year-to-date gain suggests momentum is still building for this long-term winner. Over the past five years, an annualized dividend growth rate of 17.49% cements the company as a top dividend stock. American Express (AXP) American Express (NYSE: AXP ) has been in business since 1850 and has become a leading fintech firm in the credit and debit card industry. Millions of people use American Express cards for purchases, and the company makes a small percentage of each transaction. As long as consumers continue to spend, American Express stands to benefit. The formula worked well for the company in Q1 2024 . During that quarter, revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income rallied by 34% year-over-year. American Express has been producing several solid quarters. Those successes have resulted in shares more than doubling over the past five years. The stock is currently up by 26% year-to-date and has a 20 P/E ratio. Furthermore, investors can get shares while they offer a 1.18% yield. American Express has had an annualized dividend growth rate of 10.51% over the past decade. The firm only has a 20.31% payout ratio, indicating plenty of room for dividend growth. Main Street Capital (MAIN) Main Street Capital (NYSE: MAIN ) doesn’t have a high annualized dividend growth rate. The company recently hiked its annual dividend 2.1% year-over-year. While that’s not impressive, the business development company currently offers a 5.93% yield. Unlike most dividend stocks, Main Street Capital also issues monthly dividend payouts instead of quarterly payouts. The stock typically stays flat but has an exceptional year. Main Street Capital has gained 22% over the past year as its diversified portfolio of lower middle market companies continues to generate returns. Total investment income increased by 9% year-over-year in Q1 2024 . The firm has 191 cumulative investments and $7.4 billion in capital under management. The management team has a cumulative 100 years of experience and prioritizes companies with revenue between $10 million and $150 million and EBITDA between $3 million and $20 million. Main Street Capital is diversified across several industries with a strong focus on internet software and services, machinery and professional services. Walmart (WMT) Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) has become a top destination for people who want affordable prices for a wide range of goods. It is the largest grocer and continues to see high demand for its inventory. Revenue increased by 6.0% year-over-year in Q1 FY25 as the company saw more demand for its e-commerce and advertising segments. Both of those components exhibited year-over-year growth rates above 20%. The stock is up 23% year-to-date and has soared by 93% over the past five years. Walmart trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.27% yield. Dividend growth has been slow, but a recent 9% dividend hike offers long-term optimism. Walmart has raised its dividend for 51 consecutive years. Revenue and dividends weren’t the only things going up for Walmart. The retailer also reported a 22.4% year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS. Walmart has $9.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, even after a $1.1 billion stock buyback during the quarter. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has exposure to numerous verticals and looks like it will continue to outperform the stock market. The tech conglomerate is currently the world’s most valuable publicly traded corporation. It has a $3.20 trillion market cap and is up by 16% year-to-date. Its 5-year gain comes to 248%. Microsoft trades at a 37 P/E ratio with a 0.70% yield. While the dividend is low, most investors won’t mind due to the high long-term returns. However, the dividend can become a notable component soon enough. Microsoft has been raising its dividend considerably over the years. The annualized dividend growth rate has stood at 10.60% over the past decade. The tech giant only has a 24.66% dividend payout ratio, so Microsoft likely maintains a double-digit growth rate for many years. However, Wall Street analysts aren’t waiting for the yield to increase. Based on the average price target, the stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” and has a projected 14% upside. Costco (COST) Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) has a 32.50% dividend payout ratio and has an annualized dividend growth rate of 12.65% over the past decade. These metrics make the 0.57% yield look more promising, but the occasional special dividend payout leads to significant value for patient investors. Costco closed out 2023 with a special $15 dividend , a big jump from the quarterly payout of $1.16 per share. The low yield shouldn’t discourage investors, thanks to the special dividend. However, that’s not the only perk of Costco stock. It’s been outperforming the market for several years. Shares are up by 24% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years. April sales results suggest that investors should expect more gains. Total company sales increased by 5.6% year-over-year over the previous 4-week period. E-commerce led the way with a 14.6% year-over-year increase. Costco also exhibited sales growth over the 35 weeks. Procter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) closes out the list of dividend dynamos with an impressive dividend streak. The consumer goods company has been paying out dividends for 134 consecutive years . That also includes 68 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Dividend growth has been at a crawl for several years, but the corporation recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.9407 to $1.0065 per share. That’s a 7% year-over-year increase. The stock is up by 61% over the past five years and is off to a good start with an 11% year-to-date gain. Shares trade at a 27 P/E ratio and offer a 2.44% yield. Procter & Gamble is currently rated as a “ Moderate Buy ” with a projected 3% upside. Only five analysts rated the stock as a “Hold,” while the other 12 rated it as a “Buy.” The company sells many essential goods that will continue to garner demand during a slower economic cycle. Procter & Gamble isn’t as vulnerable to dramatic price swings and offers a solid yield. On this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AVGO and MSFT.

        "content": "Treasury Board President Anita Anand says she wants to increase the use of artificial intelligence in Canada's public service but insists there's no question of using AI tools like ChatGPT for confidential information like cabinet documents. Speaking to reporters Monday as she launched consultations on the use of AI in the public service, Anand said the government is looking for a strategy to use AI responsibly. \"This is in the area of generative AI, in particular incorporating platforms like ChatGPT into the workplace,\" she said. \"Managers will have the discretion as to when that is able to be used, but I will say that in areas of confidentiality, cabinet confidences for example, generative AI isn't generally going to be used.\" When asked why the government doesn't plan to allow public servants to use AI tools with confidential documents, Anand said that's part of a separate consultation. \"The issues relating to confidentiality are being addressed in our review of the use of confidential information across government,\" she said. \"And so, I'm currently looking at that under a trust and transparency approach and I will have more to say on that specific issue very shortly. Not today, but shortly.\" Trudeau announces $2.4 billion for AI-related investments Federal government issues new rules for public servants using AI Ottawa will prevent AI tools from discriminating against potential hires, Anand says Ottawa unveils new AI code of conduct for Canadian companies Anand said she wants the government's strategy to avoid bias or discrimination in the use of AI. \"This is the part of the work that we're doing to ensure that the AI tools that we are incorporating are not used for unsavoury or discriminatory purposes,\" she said. \"It is part of the work that we're doing to use AI responsibly.\" Anand acknowledged the government will have to compete with the private sector for the technological talent it will need to increase its use of AI but said there are plans to retrain existing public servants. \"We will be setting up a specific division of Treasury Board to re-skill existing public servants, if they would like to do that, in the area of cyber and cyber technology,\" she said. WATCH: Open AI shows off model's capacity for conversation OpenAI demonstrates new model's capability for realistic conversation 13 days ago Duration 0:42 From giving advice and analyzing graphs to guiding someone through a math equation and even cracking a joke, the new model of ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, is touted as having real-time responses in natural human tone. Speaking to a hand-picked roundtable of experts Monday, Anand said the government has set three priorities for a national public service AI strategy: providing services to Canadians, increasing operational efficiency and driving science and research. \"The question is really going to be how can we, with this strategy, add greater efficiencies but also simplify the interactions of the Canadian population and organizations and businesses with federal services,\" Anand told the roundtable. Anand said that while it's important to help the private sector develop AI, it's also important to develop the public service's use of AI. \"As the largest employer in the country, we set an example for those employers,\" she said. Earlier, academics and experts participating in the roundtable stressed the importance of public trust in the government's use of AI, comparing it to the need for the public to trust the government's oversight of Canada's food safety system. Officials told the roundtable that the government plans to launch its public service AI strategy by March.",

        "content": "A Manitoba school division is saying comments made by a parent that were posted on social media are defamatory and untrue in a recently filed lawsuit. Beautiful Plains School Division in Neepawa, Man. said in a statement of claim filed on May 14 with the Court of King’s Bench that a parent of current and former students within the division has been making defamatory comments against the division and a number of teachers at the schools. Beautiful Plains said in the statement of claim that posts were made on Facebook on April 18, and between May 1 and May 13. Several of the posts were listed in the claim which named a number of employees in the division, and used profanity such as “f**king Nazi” “You’re a b***h” and \"toxic piece of s**t.\" The posts also accused staff of sexualizing children, abuse, misogyny and sexism, the suit said. \"The Division says that the Online Defamatory Statement are false and were made for the improper purpose of causing embarrassment and humiliation to the Division and/or its employees,\" the claim reads. The division said in the lawsuit, that the comments were meant to undermine the division and \"lower the Division in the estimation of members of society in general.\" The lawsuit also said the division's character and reputation have been \"severely injured\" and that it will \"continue to suffer significant loss and damage and irreparable harm.\" The division is calling on the parent to stop making and publishing untrue statements and to delete previous posts from their social media, the claim said. The division is also asking for general and punitive damages. CTV News Winnipeg has reached out to the parent but has not heard back. No statement of defence has been filed. The allegations have not been tested in court.",

        "description": "PM Modi said that India is a mature democracy and boasts of rich and well-established electoral principles and traditions and such “provocation” was a matter of grave concern and calls for a thorough investigation.The post External forces can’t influence mature Indian voters: PM Modi appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday expressed shock and surprise over Pakistani voices of endorsement and praise for a select few Indian counterparts (Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal) in the middle of Lok Sabha elections and asserted that Indian voters were mature enough to see through their gimmicks. In an interview with IANS at his official residence in the national capital, the PM said that India’s voters were mature in their thoughts and could not be influenced by any external factor. On questions of Pakistani politicians’ support to Congress leader and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal amid polls, he said: “I don’t understand why some select group of people, apparently those who harbour animosity against us, get endorsements from Pakistan, why voices of support emanate from there, for certain individuals.” PM Modi said that India is a mature democracy and boasts of rich and well-established electoral principles and traditions and such “provocation” was a matter of grave concern and calls for a thorough investigation. He said that he understands the aspirations of the country’s youth and considers it a responsibility to provide them with a launching pad so that they can achieve their desired goals. “I understand their aspirations. Today’s youth is very different from the past. They don’t want to conform to the previous standards. They want to make a big leap in every field to reach their intended destinations, even if it means bypassing some steps. Our responsibility is to provide them with launching pads and give them a platform to fulfil their aspirations. There is a need to understand youth and their thinking pattern,” the PM said. “When I do Pariksha Pe Charcha, I get to interact with thousands of students. I come across many students who are thinking decades ahead of their time. A major gap will emerge if the government and the leadership fail to understand the aspirations of this new generation,” he said. Stating that his government turned the COVID pandemic crisis into an opportunity, PM Modi said that he completely understands the true potential of technology and how it can be harnessed effectively. “During the COVID period, I was worried about the country’s young generation. I was worried about their youthfulness confined to the four walls of the room. In my video conferencing sessions, I tried to energise them with certain tasks to lift their spirits. That is why we made data very cheap. My logic behind the move was to turn them towards the new digital world, and we succeeded in it,” he said. The PM said that the digital revolution that was being witnessed right now was a result of India successfully managing to turn around the huge COVID crisis into an opportunity. “The digital and Fintech revolution in the country owes much to the government’s focus on converting the crisis into an opportunity during that time. I fully understand the prowess of technology and the impactful changes that it can bring for generations and therefore want to harness it to full potential,” he said. PM Modi said India’s G20 presidency last year marked a significant milestone in its global leadership role. He said that this contributed massively to making India “world-ready” and the world “India-ready”. “We held G20 meetings all over the country because the world should know that India is not just only about Delhi. It is also not enough for my country’s tourism industry if people just visit the Taj Mahal. My country has massive potential which needs to be known and understood. We used the G20 as an opportunity to establish India’s image in the world,” the PM said. “We were highly successful in creating curiosity about India among the world community. More than one lakh policy-makers from the entire world attended over 200 G20 meetings and explored first-hand different places of India, most of which they had not even heard of before. They also correlated things with their own country and kept on talking about India after returning home. I am seeing that the tourist flow has increased enormously after India held the G20 Summit,” he said. Emphasising that every city and district of the country has its unique vibrancy and potential, PM Modi said he makes it a point to spread India’s culture, traditions, and heritage during his foreign visits. “India is a land of diversities and any country cannot stand tall on just one pillar. I laid strength on ‘One District, One Product’ (ODOP) because every district in India is unique and has its strength. I want to bring them to the fore. Now, when I go abroad, I don’t have to spend too much time deciding what gift to take along with me. Whether I am going to Africa or Europe, I just have a look at the ODOP catalogue and it is quite easy for me to decide what product to take along with me,” he said. “I have told the External Affairs Ministry that I will measure your success on three parameters. First, how many goods from India are brought in the country you are posted in? Second, which is the best technology in that country which India still does not have, and how can we get it here? And thirdly, how many tourists do you send to India from that country? India and ‘nation first’ is at the centre of every decision I make,” the PM said. He said that driven by digital public infrastructure (DPI) models like unified payments interface (UPI), the country was now leading the global fintech ecosystem and several countries were ready to embrace the ‘India Stack’ solutions to empower the masses. The PM said when he kicked off the ‘Digital India’ movement, opposition parties made allegations that this was being done to serve the needs of the service providers. “They could not understand how big this area is and the 21st century is technology-driven. Moreover, technology today is driven by artificial intelligence (AI),” he said. PM Modi said that UPI had played a huge role in the world of fintech and due to this, “several countries are ready to embrace UPI because this is the era of fintech and India is now leading the fintech ecosystem”. He came down heavily on those objecting to crack down on big fish of corruption rackets and said some people were scripting a fake narrative to save them from the grip of law. The PM said that, unlike earlier regimes, not the small players but big fish and perpetrators were being brought to book under his watch and this was breaking the backs of their masters. “The same people who earlier cried foul over no action on big players have started crying hoarse about it,” he said. PM Modi also expressed dismay over a recent trend, which he said, was the glorification of the corrupt. “Earlier, people used to stay 100 steps away from the convicted or even those with any corruption taint but today there is a tendency to support and rally behind them,” he said. The PM said how his government questioned in 2019 for going slow on the corrupt and shady practices, had ensured the prosecution of big fish and racketeers and also stated that this had triggered a wave of protests and backlash from certain sections of the Opposition. “The same people who demanded that Sonia Gandhi be put behind bars are crying hoarse over action against corruption,” PM Modi said. He said that the action against the corrupt and the dishonest was based on facts and evidence, and not on perception. “Before the 2019 elections, we were questioned over our stand and action on graft and why the government was not quick on punishing the perpetrators. Our outright response was that Independent agencies will act against them and it will be done based on facts. Officials worked hard to gather the facts and today, big players are being caught and brought to justice,” the PM said. “It is the Independent investigative agency which apprehends the accused, and it is the judiciary which decides on his conviction or trial. The Prime Minister has no role in this,” he said. PM Modi said that his government’s approach was comprehensive, integrated, and holistic. “Nation’s fundamental issues can’t be ignored. If people in villages and remote locations are facing issues, they call for immediate redressal. They too are important constituents of India’s growth story and can’t be looked down upon,” he said. “I have also briefed the Foreign Department about measuring their scale of success on three counts. First is how much Indian produce is bought by the country where you reside, second is which modern technology can be brought in India and third is how many citizens of that country visit India every year, for tourism,” PM Modi said. He said that their government had transferred about Rs 38 lakh crore directly into accounts of beneficiaries via Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), so far. “If we talk about times of Rajiv Gandhi government (when out of Rs 1, only 15 paise reached the intended beneficiaries), about Rs 25-30 lakh crore could have been gobbled up by the middlemen,” the PM said. Stressing the thrust of technology in his governance, he said that it made records transparent and administration more efficient. PM Modi elucidated how two factors — policy-driven governance and saturation of schemes — worked wonders in containing corruption to a large extent. “When the policy is laid out in black and white, the grey area is brought down to minimal levels, this reduces the scope for any discrimination. We have focussed on policy-driven governance,” he said. The PM said that saturation of schemes gives a guarantee for corruption-free governance and gives a guarantee of social security. “We have focused on 100 percent delivery of schemes to targeted beneficiaries. If people are convinced that they are bound to get benefits sooner or later, this leaves no room for corruption. Some mischievous elements may still try to spoil the system but can’t befool the beneficiaries for long,” he said. PM Modi said that the government would ensure the country’s leadership in the world of gaming in years to come. He said that there was a huge gaming market waiting for India. “The irony is that Indians are investing large sums of money while others are making huge profits in the gaming industry. I called young gamers recently to understand their problems. After the interaction, I told my government that I want to cement India’s leadership in the global gaming market,” the PM said. “There is such a big future market. Gaming has come to the Olympics now and I want Indian youth to participate in it.”",

        "content": "The naira, on Monday appreciated significantly on the official foreign exchange (FX) market despite a decline in the dollar supplied by market players. After trading on Monday, the naira gained 10.71 percent of its value as the dollar was quoted at N1,339.33, stronger than N1,482.81 quoted on Friday at the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (NAFEM), according to the data by the FMDQ Securities Exchange Limited. Dollar supplied by willing buyers and willing sellers declined by 67.49 percent to $180.80 million on Monday from $556.25 million recorded on Friday. Read also: Naira opens at N1,520 on black market The naira appreciation was attributed to regulatory measures by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). These measures discourage banks from holding excessive foreign currency positions, thereby increasing the availability of dollars in the market. According to the FX trading market summary released on Monday by the FMDQ, the intraday high closed at N1,501 per dollar, stronger than N1,519/1 closed on Friday. The intraday low strengthened to N1,310 per dollar on Monday as against N1,400 on Friday. The local currency on Monday weakened against the dollar on the parallel market, also known as black market, exchanging at the rate of N1,520. This represents 1.32 percent depreciation over the level of N1,500 exchanged on Friday on the parallel market. Read also: Naira closes flat as dollar supply surges two-months high of $556.25m The Nigerian Naira showed a positive trend in the foreign exchange market last week, as the exchange rate at the NAFEM window appreciated by 0.98 percent against the US Dollar, closing at N1,482.81/US$1. In contrast, the parallel market rate remained steady at N1,510.00/US$1. This divergence has widened the gap between the official and parallel market rates to 1.83 percent, according to a report by Coronation Research. The CBN also reported an uptick in the country’s foreign exchange reserves, which rose by 0.22 percent to reach US$32.74 billion. Additionally, foreign exchange inflows saw a remarkable increase of 136 percent in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year, achieving a five-year high in March. “The alignment of the NAFEM and parallel market rates since February has bolstered market confidence, reflected in the rising trading volumes within the NAFEM market earlier this year. However, a decline in turnover was observed around mid-April, leading to a subsequent weakening of the Naira. “Market liquidity factors are crucial in understanding these dynamics, particularly the role of non-deliverable forwards (NDFs). An exceptionally large NDF redemption, valued at US$1.3 billion, is due this week. While the CBN is not expected to pay the full-face value in Naira, it will settle the difference based on the current spot rate. This settlement could influence market liquidity depending on the strike prices of the contracts. “In a strategic move to manage US Dollar demand, the CBN appears to be encouraging foreign portfolio investors to reinvest their Naira proceeds rather than purchasing US Dollars in the NAFEM market. This initiative follows last week’s Open Market Operations (OMO) auctions, suggesting potential significant demand for US Dollars and active CBN participation in the forex market this week,” analysts at Coronation Research said.",

        "content": "We're in the thick of some huge discounts thanks to all the Memorial Day sales happening right now. While the sales span pretty much every product category, we're impressed with some of the Memorial Day sales at Best Buy . Among those, this deal on the immense Hisense 100-inch U76N 4K TV might be the mightiest. The deal knocks a massive $2,700 off of the TV at Best Buy -- a 54% saving. That brings it down to $2,300, which is still not cheap, but it's an incredible saving for a 2024 TV of this size, plus there are some extra freebies thrown in for good measure. Before we get to the TV itself, let's discuss those free add-ons. Firstly, when you order this TV via Best Buy, you'll score free installation. That would usually be an additional $250 purchase and, I don't know about you, but I'd rather a professional handle mounting this huge TV to my wall. Just be sure to add \"Delivery + TV/Display Setup & Mounting\" to your cart during checkout. You'll see it listed under \"Professional Services.\" This TV is also eligible for Hisense's current NBA gift card promotion . We wrote about this a while ago, and even with this huge saving, you'll still be able to grab $200 in NBA Store credit at no extra cost. If that wasn't enough, you also get one month of FuboTV for free as well. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money . Onto the TV, the 100-inch Hisense U76N 4K TV has specs that rival the best TVs you can buy. Outside of the obvious draw, which is the absurd size of the screen, it offers a 4K resolution with Dolby Vision and full array local dimming for a great viewing experience. It also has the tablestakes smart TV capabilities and works with Google Assistant and Alexa. It even has a game mode. It's worth noting that you can get the same TV from Amazon at the same discounted price, but it'll take a little longer to end up with you because it's not in stock right now. The deal also doesn't include installation there, so bear that in mind. If you're looking for a TV a bit smaller, check out our compilation of the best TV deals this Memorial Day .",

        "description": "Former band director accuses Wendy Pekalski of accessing her personal medical information without permission",
        "content": "Article content Thessalon First Nation’s community health manager is being added as a defendant to a wrongful termination lawsuit brought against the band. In an amended statement of claim, Mary Jane Wardell accuses Wendy Pekalski of accessing her medical information without permission on Dec. 20, 2023, roughly a month after Wardell was removed from her position as TFN’s director of operations. Wardell claims that members of TFN’s newly elected chief and council directed Pekalski to access her private medical information, bolstering her broader argument that the band’s leadership spearheaded a “co-ordinated attack” to discredit her reputation in the community. On top of the $850,000 in damages Wardell initially sought for her wrongful termination, she is seeking an additional $200,000 for the “tortious invasion” of her private health records. “The information disclosed was inherently private given that it was the intimate and personal health records of the Plaintiff, and a reasonable person would find that this unauthorized access is highly offensive causing severe distress and anguish,” Wardell’s statement reads. Wardell was informed of this alleged privacy breach on Feb. 26 via Maamweysing North Shore Community Health Services, which is responsible for providing primary care and medical record keeping in the community. The following month, Maamweysing chief privacy officer Michelle Brisbois told The Sault Star that at least 20 TFN members had suffered a similar fate to Wardell, with their medical records being accessed without permission between October and January. The Star obtained several letters that Maamweysing sent out to TFN members informing them of this alleged privacy breach, all of which name Pekalski as the culprit. Because of this alleged mass privacy breach, Maamweysing has since relocated to the nearby Town of Thessalon, leaving many TFN members on reserve concerned about the accessibility of primary care moving forward. The TFN administration has publicly denied Maamweysing’s claims that a mass privacy breach took place under their watch, writing in an April 5 Facebook post that the health agency’s allegations “have not been proven.” The Star reached out to Pekalski for comment on the claims Wardell made in her amended statement. However, she did not respond by press time. Chief Joseph Wabigwan and TFN executive director Lesley Boulrice haven’t returned The Star’s request for comment as of Monday afternoon. Wardell claims that her wrongful termination took place immediately following the Nov. 17 election , which resulted in the appointment of Chief Wabigwan and several new members of council. The following evening, Wardell alleges that Wabigwan and newly-elected councillor Robert Simon Sr. attended her residence to deliver an envelope in person, with several other band members and OPP officers parked outside. Wardell, according to court documents, did not receive this envelope at the time, since her sister refused to wake her “given the hour and the aggressive nature of the attendance.” When Wardell reported to the band office on Nov. 22, she was given a termination letter and asked to vacate the premises. Wardell, who began working for TFN in 1991, believes her firing is completely without justification, arguing that she “did not have a history of formal disciplinary action against her” before the termination. Outside of being fired without proper justification, Wardell also claims that the current administration’s “unprofessional” conduct during this period includes a “planned” and “orchestrated” effort to sully her reputation in the community. Wardell said she believes this administration’s intentions are made clear through a private Facebook group run by Boulrice and others, which was allegedly used to post and spread false information about the former director of operations and her family. “The First Nation’s conduct has been highhanded, outrageous, oppressive, and represents a marked departure from ordinary standards of decent behaviour, justifying an award of punitive and/or aggravated damages,” the statement reads. When reached for comment back in April over the initial court filing, Chief Wabigwan told The Star via email that “Thessalon First Nation disputes her claim but does not comment on matters that are before the courts.” kdarbyson@postmedia.com The Local Journalism Initiative is made possible through funding from the federal government Share this Story : TFN community health manager added to wrongful termination lawsuit Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr",

        "content": "CORBIN Bleu fans have praised the actor for showing off his double dutch skills 17 years after Jump In! was released. On Sunday, the High School Musical actor posted a video on TikTok showing him jump roping in New York City . Corbin, 35, captioned the post, \"Still got it.\" In the video, the actor was shown jump roping double dutch in an NYC neighborhood. Corbin starred in the 2007 Disney Channel Original Movie, Jump In! In it, he played amateur boxer Izzy Daniels, who is asked to sub in as a jump rope team member for a Double Dutch tournament by his friend, and eventual love interest, Mary - played by Keke Palmer , 30. In the TikTok , Corbin sported a gray T-shirt, denim shorts, and aviator sunglasses as he skipped over the rope - performing stylish tricks as he jumped. Fans rushed to the comment section to share excitement about the \"iconic post.\" One person wrote, \"When I tell you this cured EVERYTHING about my childhood. LOVED 'jump in.'\" \"People walking by not knowing how iconic this is,\" commented another. Corbin replied, \"Why I love NY.\" \"What do you mean 17 yrs? It still feels like it only came out a couple of years ago,\" mentioned a shocked fan. The actor responded, \"2007,\" along with a mind-blown emoji. \"Ahh jump in was one of my fave disney originals back in the day!! what a throwback,\" wrote a fourth commenter. \"ICONIC POST,\" asserted another. One fan joked, \"Okay fine, I’ll go watch Jump In again.\" Corbin rose to fame as Chad Danforth, the basketball-playing best friend of Troy Bolton, played by Zac Efron , in High School Musical. After the third film wrapped, he turned his musical talents to Broadway and established himself as a fixture in American theatre. People walking by not knowing how iconic this is.\" He's trodden the boards for In The Heights, God Speed, and Holiday Inn, the New Irving Berlin Musical. Corbin has also established himself on the small screen with roles in The Beautiful Life: TBL and on the silver screen with Scary or Die among other films. He has also released two albums, Another Side (2007) and Speed of Light (2009), but only his first release charted at 36 on the US Billboard chart. In 2011, Corbin was dragged into a court battle over the failure of the racing film Free Style, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter . The lawsuit alleged that the film failed due to a mix of alleging fraud, breach of contract, and misrepresentation. The financiers, who brought the suit, also claimed that Corbin hadn't promoted the film enough. It is not clear how the claim was resolved. In 2013 he appeared on Dancing With The Stars and came second. Corbin tied the knot with long-term girlfriend Sasha Clements on July 23, 2016. Sasha Clements was born on March 14, 1990, in Toronto , Canada but moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. Her first role came in 2005 as the robber girl in the TV film The Snow Queen before she moved on to the TV series Majority Rules! In 2009. Like her husband, Sasha was a Disney actor as well. Okay fine, I’ll go watch Jump In again.\" In 2014, Sasha appeared in the Disney Channel movie How to Build a Better Boy. The Canadian actress went back to her roots and appeared in both Degrassi: The Next Generation and Degrassi Don't Look Back. Corbin met his now-wife in 2011 in the grocery aisle at a supermarket, later going on a date when he met her as she was finishing her shift. Sasha is a Disney lover who grew up enjoying the Disney theme parks which became the eventual stage for Bleu to propose. In 2014, the couple took a trip to Disney where Bleu popped the question in front of the Cinderella Castle while taking a photo. The couple stood in front of the cameras and they started rolling, Blue said he had a glass slipper prop to put on Clements’ foot. Instead, Sasha looked down to see Corbin on one knee with an engagement ring in the glass slipper. When she said yes, fireworks were timed to go off behind them and Bleu told her they would, in fact, be staying in the Cinderella Castle. Sasha reflected on their meeting and said, “I don’t know if I believe in love at first sight but I definitely believe in ‘something at first sight.’ We both remember feeling that spark of something being different.” They were engaged for two years and were married on July 23, 2016, at the Hummingbird Nest in Santa Susana, California .",

Instrumental Pancasila adalah nilai-nilai atau prinsip-prinsip yang digunakan sebagai alat atau sarana untuk mencapai tujuan atau hasil tertentu. Nilai instrumental sering kali digunakan dalam konteks etika atau filosofi dan dapat merujuk pada prinsip-prinsip moral atau etis yang digunakan sebagai panduan dalam mengambil keputusan atau bertindak dalam suatu situasi tertentu. Sedangkan dalam Pancasila, nilai instrumental adalah prinsip-prinsip atau nilai-nilai yang digunakan sebagai sarana atau alat untuk menerapkan dan mengaktualisasikan nilai-nilai Pancasila sebagai dasar negara dan pandangan hidup bangsa Indonesia. Pancasila adalah dasar negara Republik Indonesia yang terdiri dari lima nilai dasar, yaitu Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa, Kemanusiaan yang Adil dan Beradab, Persatuan Indonesia, Kerakyatan yang Dipimpin oleh Hikmat Kebijaksanaan dalam Permusyawaratan/Perwakilan, dan Keadilan Sosial bagi Seluruh Rakyat Indonesia. 1. Peraturan pemerintah. Nilai instrumental Pancasila dapat disempurnakan melalui perumusan peraturan pemerintah. Kondisi ini merupakan salah satu bukti nyata keterbukaan Pancasila, dikecualikan dari urgensi untuk menghindari konflik masyarakat. Sehubungan dengan peraturan ini, semisal Inpres dan MPR. 2. Konstitusi atau undang-undang. Adanya undang-undang, termasuk ketentuan tentang keteraturan kehidupan masyarakat, dengan jelas menekankan pentingnya nilai instrumental Pancasila. Modifikasi dapat dilakukan bahkan untuk proses pembuatan aturan ini, yakni seperti amendemen UUD 1945. Berdasarkan uraian tentang wujud nilai instrumental Pancasila di atas, kita sudah bisa memetakan contohnya yang lebih konkret. Berikut bentuk nilai- nilai instrumental yang berlaku dalam sila- sila Pancasila. Reifikasi nilai instrumental tersebut dapat ditemukan dalam undang-undang khususnya Pasal 29 yang menekankan apakah Indonesia ialah negara agama dan memberikan kebebasan kepada setiap warga negara untuk menganut legalitas agama sesuai dengan standar agama yang diinginkan. Sejauh ini, enam agama diakui di Indonesia yakni Islam, Kristen, Katolik, Hindu, Budha, dan Konghucu. Selain itu, berikut ini nilai instrumental dari sila ke-1 Pancasila. a. Pasal 28E ayat 1: Setiap orang berhak memeluk agama dan beribadat menurut agamanya, memilih pendidikan dan pengajaran, memilih pekerjaan, memilih kewarganegaraan, memilih tempat tinggal di wilayah negara dan meninggalkannya, serta berhak kembali. b. Pasal 28E ayat 2: Setiap orang bebas untuk mengikuti hati nuraninya, percaya pada keyakinannya, dan mengungkapkan pikiran dan sikapnya. Bentuk tindakan yang dapat dikatakan sebagai nilai instrumental dari sila ke-2 Pancasila ada pada Pasal 28 yang memberikan bentuk kebebasan pada masyarakatnya sebagai hak asasi manusia (HAM). Bentuk nilai ini sangat membenarkan posisi manusia pada porsi yang adil. Selain itu, berikut ini bentuk nilai instrumental dari sila ke-2 Pancasila. a. Pasal 14: Presiden dapat memberikan amnesti dari sanksi dan rehabilitasi, dengan memperhatikan pertimbangan badan eksekutif. Presiden juga memberikan amnesti dan pencabutan sembari menunggu pengawasan DPR. b. Pasal 28A: Orang berhak untuk hidup dan mempertahankan hidup dan kehidupannya. c. Pasal 28B: Setiap orang berhak mencari keluarga dan meneruskan keturunan melalui perkawinan yang sah menurut agama. Semua anak berhak untuk bertahan hidup, tumbuh, tumbuh, dan mendapatkan pinjaman dari kekerasan dan diskriminasi. Selain itu, realisasi nilai-nilai instrumental lain dalam sila ketiga Pancasila dapat ditemukan dalam Pasal 32, 35, dan 36. Semua ini sepenuhnya mencerminkan identitas nasional Indonesia, termasuk bahasa, bendera, dan ideologi. Pasal berikut memuat nilai sebagai sarana peraturan-peraturan itu. a. Pasal 25A: Suatu negara kesatuan Republik Indonesia yang wilayahnya ditentukan oleh batas-batas dan hak-haknya menurut undang-undang yang disepakati adalah negara kepulauan yang bercirikan negara kepulauan b. Pasal 35: Bendera Indonesia berwarna merah putih. c. Pasal 36: Bahasa resmi adalah bahasa Indonesia. d. Pasal 36A: Lambang negara adalah Garuda Pancasila dan semboyannya adalah Bhinneka Tunggal Ika. Contoh lain yang dapat disebut sebagai perwujudan dari amanat sila ke-4 Pancasila sehubungan dengan reifikasi tersebut terdapat dalam Pasal 1 ayat 2 ialah Indonesia yang menyatakan bahwa kekuasaan tertinggi ada di tangan rakyat. Karena dasar dari tindakan ini, rakyat memiliki tingkat kontrol yang sangat tinggi atas sistem demokrasi Indonesia. Semua kebijakan yang diajukan ke Badan Legislatif harus disetujui oleh masyarakat melalui perwakilan masing-masing daerah. Berdasarkan misi Presiden, misi MPR, dan pemberian hak kepada DPR, ketiga lembaga tersebut dapat saling mengawasi. Di bawah ini nilai-nilai Pancasila yang terkandung dalam aturan-aturan. a. Pasal 2: Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat terdiri atas anggota Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat di setiap daerah dan kelompoknya dan berbagai perwakilan yang dibentuk dengan undang-undang. Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat bersidang sedikitnya sekali setiap lima tahun di ibu kota negara. Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat diputuskan dengan suara terbanyak. b. Pasal 3: Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat telah memberlakukan konstitusi yang menggunakannya sebagai arah nasional. c. Pasal 6 ayat 2: Presiden dan Wakil Presiden dipilih oleh Dewan Nasional, yang memiliki jumlah suara terbanyak. d. Pasal 19: Anggota Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat dipilih melalui pemilihan umum. Susunan Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat diatur dengan undang-undang. Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat melakukan sidang sedikitnya setahun sekali. Reifikasi nilai instrumental dari Pancasila dapat ditemukan dalam sila kelima. Contoh yang jelas dari peraturan yang lengkap ini dapat ditemukan dalam Pasal 33. Seluruh kekayaan alam Indonesia untuk kesejahteraan warganya atas dasar dorongan ini. Pasal berikut berkaitan dengan nilai instrumental sila ini. a. Pasal 33 ayat 3: Bumi, air, dan kekayaan alam di dalamnya, dikuasai oleh negara dan sebesar-besar kemakmuran rakyat. b. Pasal 34: Fakir miskin dan anak-anak telantar dipelihara oleh negara. (Z-2)",

        "content": "DEAR MISS MANNERS: My husband and I have suffered from several years of infertility, and I am often asked why we don’t have children. As it’s none of their business, and for privacy reasons, I typically answer with, “Though it’s a desire, it has not come as easy for us as others.” Whenever someone inquires further, I would like to know how to politely tell them it’s none of their business. GENTLE READER : In polite language, “None of your business” is translated as “That is a personal matter.” DEAR MISS MANNERS: I was wondering if my daughter should have sent thank-you cards to my wife and myself when she graduated from college. My wife said she should have, but I don’t feel the same way. Could you please let me know? GENTLE READER: In the normal course of events, children take it for granted that their parents feed, clothe and educate them. In happy families, it sometimes strikes adult children how enormous an undertaking that is. That may bring on a spontaneous burst of gratitude, beyond the usual affection that children who have felt loved and cared for will presumably have been expressing. This may be prompted by special occasions, such as parental birthdays; typically, however, the full realization of the time, energy, patience and money spent occurs when the children have children of their own. Miss Manners would not have thought that college graduation would bring this on. Does your wife really want to focus on your shared contributions to your daughter’s education, however much you sacrificed, instead of on your daughter’s achievement? Isn’t this the time to tell her how proud of her you are -- not how indebted to you she is? That may come later. Miss Manners hopes it will not be merely with a paltry card. DEAR MISS MANNERS: I am a case manager at a law firm and frequently must call people at another law firm to discuss cases that we have together. Sometimes the receptionist at the other law firm will ask detailed questions as to what the call is about before transferring me to the person with whom I need to speak. I don’t mean a simple inquiry as to which case the call is about -- I mean detailed questions. In my view, it’s none of the receptionist’s business what the call is about; if the law firm wanted her to have substantive conversations about cases, she would have a different position than receptionist. On the possibility that she may be following instructions, I’ve never pushed back, but it does irritate me. Is there a polite way to convey “It’s none of your business, so please put me through to So-and-So” without actually saying that? Or does business etiquette require that I answer whatever questions the receptionist has before speaking with the person I actually called to talk to? GENTLE READER : Well, this is not a personal matter. And most likely, the receptionist is not being nosy, but rather following instructions from her employers, as you suggest. Still, you could say, “She’ll know what it is about.” Miss Manners hopes that works.",

        "description": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died.",
        "content": "By Tim Reynolds The Associated Press Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "description": "One driver told police he only needed to 'play the mental health card' after seriously injuring a man",
        "content": "Courts up and down the country get their fair share of dangerous drivers in the dock. From those who speed to those who get behind the wheel after drinking terrifying amounts of booze. It often results in dangerous police pursuits, horrific crashes and, sadly, tragic deaths. Whilst those in the driver's seat usually accept blame, there are others who do everything they can to avoid responsibility. READ MORE: Police declare section 60 order after young man seriously hurt in 'targeted' shooting These are just some of the reckless drivers who thought they were above the law - but were caught and hauled before our regions courts. Callum Carew Callum Carew This is the 'show off' drink driver who ploughed into an innocent motorcyclist, causing him to be thrown from his bike and sustain fatal injuries. Callum Carew, 34, was driving in his white BMW M2 along the A534 in Crewe at around 11.15pm on March 31, hitting speeds of around 140mph in a 60mph zone. Moments later, he ploughed into the back of a blue Direct Bikes Scooter, which was being ridden by 29-year-old Razvan Brumar. The impact of the collision caused him to be thrown from his bike and suffer catastrophic injuries. Emergency services raced to the scene, where Razvan was treated by paramedics before being rushed to hospital. He later passed away as a result of his injuries. Carew then callously tried to blame his victim when questioned by police, claiming the bike had no lights. He also told officers he had only had one pint before he failed a breath test and was arrested. Carew, of Rochester Crescent, in Crewe, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving while over the drink-drive limit. He was sentenced at Chester Crown Court on Monday (May 13) to nine years and four months behind bars. Read the full story here. Leo Meek Leo Meek was jailed (Image: Cheshire Police) Leo Meek mowed down 15-year-old Jack Jones while travelling at up to 55mph on a 30mph road in April 2021, before fleeing the scene. He later led police on a 100mph chase after he was released from prison. He was handed a 40-month sentence for death by dangerous driving in August 2021 and disqualified from driving for three years from the date of his release. But on July 19 last year, Meek was back out on the road, leading cops on a reckless pursuit through Cheshire . Driving in a stolen car, he was spotted overtaking multiple vehicles and tailgating them to force them to pull over. He picked up speeds of more than 100mph along winding narrow roads, more than double the 40mph speed limit. Having lost sight of the car due to the excess speed, the officer turned a corner to find the BMW had crashed on the bridge above the M53. The car had hit the barrier with such force it had dented it, and in doing so prevented it from falling onto the motorway below. Meek, 25, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and handling stolen goods and was jailed for 22 months. Read the full story here. Mohammed Atif Mohammed Atif (Image: Greater Manchester Police) Mohammed Atif mowed down an elderly woman as she crossed the road, before telling the police he was ‘dazzled by the sunlight’. Anne Buckley had waited for the lights at a pedestrian crossing to turn red before she began walking into the road in Moston in November 2022. She was struck by a Ford Fiesta being driven by Atif. The 79-year-old was sent hurtling into the air before landing on her head and shoulders. She was left with numerous injuries including to her neck, and now has a fear of crossing the road without help. Atif failed to stop at the scene and drove away, Manchester Crown Court heard. When police later caught up with him that day in November 2022 after he was identified through an ANPR camera, he said he had been ‘dazzled by the sunlight’ and claimed hadn’t seen Mrs Buckley, or the lights change to red. He pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was jailed for 20 months. Read the full story here. Joseph Dearden Joseph Dearden (Image: gmp) Police body-cam footage has captured the shocking moment brazen drink-driver Joseph Dearden who left another motorist severely injured told cops: \"All I have to do is play the mental health card!\" The footage shows Dearden slurring and struggling to remain upright after causing an horrific smash on a residential road in Bolton , following a boozy pub session in which he downed six pints of lager and five shots. He appears unconcerned that he had left one man, 25, with life-changing injuries, slurring to the cops who arrested him: \"All I have to do is play the mental health card!\" The sozzled driver refused to get into an ambulance. Dearden, 27, from Bolton, managed to get out of his smashed van and attempted to flee the scene only to be detained by shocked residents who came out and saw a scene of carnage. Other footage released by Greater Manchester Police revealed the speed at which he was travelling and also the wreckage he caused in the crash. He was jailed for two-and-a-half years for what police described as 'callous and cowardly' behaviour. Read the full story here. Zak Allinson The incident unfolded in Sherborne Street trading estate, Cheetham Hill (Image: Google Maps) Thug Zak Allison drove his car at a man and hit him after a road rage row. Allinson, 22, had become embroiled in a heated argument with his victim following a dispute on a trading estate in Cheetham Hill . Allinson, who said he was there to buy food from a takeaway, had blocked a lorry which was trying to drive into the yard. After the victim closed part of a gate, Allinson drove directly at the man and hit him. He was thrown onto the bonnet and fell to the ground shortly after. ‘He could have killed me,” the victim later said in a statement. Allinson was sentenced to three years and seven months in prison, after pleading guilty to attempted section 18 assault, dangerous driving, driving without a licence and driving without insurance.

        "description": "The massive new park will be nearly double the size of Vancouver's Stanley Park",
        "content": "Article content West Vancouver has unveiled plans to turn more than 780 hectares of forested municipal land into a protected park nearly double the size of Vancouver’s Stanley Park. The new park covers nearly eight square kilometres along West Vancouver’s mountainside and includes one of the remaining areas of old-growth forests on the North Shore. In comparison, Stanley Park in Vancouver’s downtown core measures about four square kilometres. “This area will help preserve sensitive ecosystems and wildlife and store carbon to fight climate change,” said West Vancouver Mayor Mark Sager in a statement on Monday. “It will also ensure that old growth trees will continue to stand in our stunning municipality, which we know is very important to our residents and people across the globe. Sager said dedicating the land to a park will ensure Metro Vancouver can enjoy the view of the mountainside above West Vancouver, which forms a backdrop to Vancouver and downtown, in perpetuity. The area is part of a larger system of protected areas including Cypress Provincial Park and the Capilano and Seymour watersheds. It also protects lands around the Old Growth Conservancy, which is managed by the District and a local non-profit. Dedicating the area to parkland has been in the works for years, with strong support by community groups and the many users of the area, including the B.C. Mountaineering Club, West Vancouver Streamkeepers, Hollyburn Ridge Association, North Shore Mountain Bike Association, and Friends of Cypress Provincial Park, said the District in a news release. To fund stewardship and maintenance of the park, B.C. Parks Foundation has launched the Cypress Hollyburn legacy fund, with a $3 million matching gift from the Wilson 5 Foundation, a private foundation by Chip and Summer Wilson focused on land conservancy and park creation in B.C.",

        "content": "Deveronvale have made a triple signing as their plans for next season gather pace. New Banffers boss Garry Wood has made his first additions by recruiting defender Kyle Dalling from Huntly, midfielder Demilade Yunus from Inverurie Locos and striker Adam Reid from Sunnybank. Dalling has been with Huntly for the last three years having previously been at Elgin City, Forfar Athletic and Aberdeen. Dalling has now returned to Princess Royal Park after joining the Banffers on loan in December. Yunus, 21, signed for Inverurie last year following a stint with Keith, but struggled for regular game at Harlaw Park. He was transfer-listed earlier this month and Deveronvale have managed to secure his signature. Meanwhile, Reid steps up to the Breedon Highland League having been a prolific goalscorer in the Juniors with Sunnybank. and helped the Aberdeen outfit win promotion to the NRJFA Premiership last year. Boss hails signings On his new recruits, Wood said: “Kyle is a big, powerful, strong defender who has been a bit unlucky with injuries. “Hopefully with a good pre-season under his belt we will get to see the best of him next season. “Kyle had plenty of other offers and turned down more lucrative ones to come and join the Vale project. “I’m delighted to get Dem over the line, he is a true athlete and competitor who will add quality to our midfield. “It’s my job to make sure I get him back to his best, Dem had other more lucrative offers on the table but decided to join the Vale project. “Adam was highly sought after, he is a proven goalscorer and I feel this is a great time for him to step up to the next level. “He has had a good background scoring goals every level he has played at and I am hoping he can continue that in his next step up at the Vale.”",

        "description": "‘Bill 20 is aimed at a bunch of boogiemen,’ political scientist Jared Wesley said, ‘from fake voters to rogue councillors to unlawful bylaws – not one shred of evidence.’The post Alberta’s Bill 20 could block 50K people from voting appeared first on rabble.ca.",
        "content": "Does Municipal Affairs Minister Ric McIver have any idea how many Albertans could be denied the right to vote in the next general election because of the United Conservative Party (UCP)’s planned changes to provincial voting rules in Bill 20, the Municipal Affairs Statutes Amendment Act, 2024? If he does – and you’d think he would – nobody’s bothered to ask him about it yet. But according to University of Alberta political Scientist Jared Wesley, the number could be anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 eligible voters – all to solve a problem that doesn’t exist by making it impossible for neighbours and co-workers with ID to vouch for people they know at a polling station. “Bill 20 is aimed at a bunch of boogiemen,” Dr. Wesley tweeted Friday . “From fake voters to rogue councillors to unlawful bylaws – not one shred of evidence. Just fear and feelings.” The bill’s targets may be boogiemen, as Professor Wesley asserts, but despite McIver’s claims that it’s just been put on the legislative agenda to make it a little easier for the government to exercise powers it already has in an emergency, the goal is understandable if not particularly palatable. It’s clearly intended to give the UCP the power to influence who gets to vote, and if municipal voters ignore their wishes anyway, to overcome the democratic will of progressive voters in Alberta’s big cities. This is right in line with the NDP Opposition’s accusation the UCP is trying “to control everything, everywhere, all at once,” which was a good line the first few of times it was used, but is not a very effective way to attack an example of genuinely undemocratic government overreach. On Thursday, in reaction to some of the features of the bill that aroused the ire of municipal councillors in the UCP’s rural heartland, McIver introduced some amendments that don’t really change the additional powers the bill will give the government. Those changes would no longer allow cabinet to fire a municipal councillor in absentia during a secret cabinet meeting – it would only be able to disrupt said councillor’s ability to get anything done by ordering a vote to remove them from office. Better, I guess, but not much. As for provisions that would allow the cabinet to veto municipal bylaws, a few vague stipulations will be added to give the impression of due process. It would still be an undemocratic decision made in secret. As the president of the Rural Municipalities of Alberta complained Friday, the amendments won’t stop the province from intruding into the legitimate authority of municipal governments. With no clear definition of the public interest or provincial policy, Paul McLaughlin told The Canadian Press , the law could be used to let the cabinet interfere with municipal decisions for any old reason or whim. Warning the government has “empowered a monster,” he argued the bill might give some future government – an NDP one, presumably – “the largest baseball bat you can imagine. Seasoned observers of Alberta politics will understand that it’s the monster that has armed itself with a big bat that we actually need to worry about. The Canadian Press also quoted Edmonton-Gold Bar NDP MLA Marlin Schmidt that as a result of the legislation, which is certain to be passed by the government majority in the House, UCP MLAs will need to brace themselves to start taking angry calls for municipal taxpayers mad about local issues like pothole complaints and cat bylaws – a possibility noted in this space back on May 7 . “This government has created 1-800-hate-my-councillor,” McLaughlin agreed. “They’re going to be inundated.” That’s not necessarily a bad thing, of course. In a Substack column published on May 7 , Dr. Wesley outlined reasons the UCP’s voter ID restrictions are a bad idea. Among them: That it could block up to 50,000 Alberta citizens who are entitled to cast a ballot from voting and, at the same time, it would not prevent non-citizens from voting. “Fact is: non-citizens qualify for most forms of photo ID, including driver’s licenses. A federally issued passport is the only form of photo ID that proves you are a citizen,” he wrote. “So voter ID won’t solve that imagined problem, either, unless you want the federal government to verify who’s eligible to vote in Alberta elections.” What’s more, Dr. Wesley said, most voters don’t support the idea. “According to the government’s own survey , only 30 per cent of Albertans favour measures like Bill 20 that would ban vouching. Forty-six percent want to keep it. This level of support is likely rooted in the fact that over 100,000 Albertans have vouched or been vouched for in previous elections.” Why would the UCP government want to do that? Well, Dr. Wesley answered that question in another Substack published on May 3 . “Voter ID laws like those included in Alberta’s Bill 20 are designed with a primary objective in mind: limiting the types of people allowed to cast ballots so the government can win elections.” In other words, so the UCP can pick who gets to vote.

        "content": "We get off to a cooler start across southern Manitoba including Winnipeg on Monday. At least, by late May standards. Temperatures should reach the low 20s for this time of year. Today, though, most regions should hit highs in the mid-teens. Conditions are also just unstable enough that there is a risk of non-severe thunderstorms later this afternoon into early this evening. In the northeast, a low near Island Lake should continue to bring on again, off again rain to the region today and likely this evening. By contrast, parts of the northwest should catch at least some sunshine. High pressure building into the province over the next day or so will bring more sunshine to the south on Tuesday, particularly by the afternoon around Winnipeg. Wednesday will be a great day to book a tee time or to just head outside with temperatures in the south expected to climb into the mid-20s in the afternoon with lots of sunshine. Showers can’t be ruled out later in the week before a warm, even hot start to meteorological summer on the weekend as we move into the month of June.",

Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau , who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits , to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. Biden said that last year the Department of Veterans Affairs delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever before. He credited the PACT Act, which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned,\" Biden said. \"Not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Control in the treasury has been increased. From today, bills above Rs 5000 will need prior approval. Till now the limit was Rs.5 lakh. This is applicable only for passing bills. Other transactions are not restricted. Treasury is in overdraft. 3500 crores will be borrowed today. While the overdraft will change when this is received, the distribution of salary, pension, social security pension etc. will start by the end of this week. The restriction is till June 15 considering this. The treasury will be reduced to virtually nominal activity. 5000 crores are needed for salary pension distribution and 900 crores for social security pension distribution. Essentials are exempted from the regulation. The Treasury has been in overdraft since the beginning of the financial year. Kerala was expecting a loan of Rs 44528 crore but instead got a loan sanction of Rs 21253 crore. 6500 crore has already been taken out of it. Only 14753 crores are remaining. There are fears that the financial crisis will intensify in the coming months.",

        "content": "Manchester United have confirmed yet another high-profile player departure after announcing that Raphael Varane's contract will not be extended. Earlier this month, the Red Devils announced that the from Old Trafford at the end of the season. A compatriot of his, Anthony Martial, will now join Varane in bidding farewell to the club, as confirmed by United today. \"Dear Manchester United fans, It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career,\" the striker announced on Instagram. \"Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. \"I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you've done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. \"I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my 9 years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. \"Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. I'm leaving to take on new challenges, I'll always be a Red Devil and I'll continue to follow the club's results with passion. Thank you again for everything, and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.\" The French forward joined the 20-time English champions in 2015 from Monaco, and amassed 317 appearances across all competitions, scoring 90 goals along the way. Injuries in recent seasons have seen Martial's importance at the Red Devils decline dramatically, with the striker having only featured 19 times this term. Upon his arrival at the club, the then-teenager was considered among the most promising players in Europe, but ultimately failed to live up to expectations. Martial, who will become a free agent at the end of June, won four trophies during his nine-year stay at United. You must be to read and post comments",

        "content": "A record number of candidates are running for Dene National Chief. The election will take place in Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., at the Dene National Assembly on July 24. Online voting will open on July 14 and run until July 24, while in-person ballots can be cast at the assembly. Six people have put their names forward for the role, which doubles as the N.W.T. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations. This includes incumbent Gerald Antoine, his predecessor Norman Yak'e ula, former Tłı̨chǫ grand chief George Mackenzie, Kátł'odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel, former Sahtu MLA Paulie Chinna and former Smith's Landing First Nation chief Gerry Cheezie. \"I think most of you would be familiar with most of these candidates,\" said Kit Spence, the returning officer, in a news conference Monday. Phil Moon Sun, the CEO of Dene Nation, said this appears to be the highest number of candidates on record to run for the role. \"Judging from our records, and we haven't done a deep dive, but yes this is the most candidates,\" he said. The election will be done using a hybrid format of in-person and electronic voting. Spence said the nominations opened April 26 and closed May 24. Seven submissions were received but only six which were accepted. He said one was rejected because candidates needed to have five nominators who are active members of the Dene Nation, including two sitting chiefs, and the one applicant didn't have any sitting chiefs on their nomination list. The Dene National Chief election is delegated, which means communities select and appoint delegates to attend the assembly and vote. Those delegates who are unable to vote in person can do so online. \"I have conducted a number of elections in British Columbia for First Nations using electronic voting and have found this is a system that is well-regarded and well-used,\" Spence said. The Dene Nation used online voting in the Dene National Chief election in 2021, in the midst of the COVID pandemic. Spence said candidates are not allowed to use the Dene Nation's administrative resources for the campaign and have to use their own resources.",

        "content": "The political campaign backroom boy turned politician turned wannabe psephologist Prashant Kishor finally had his comeuppance in Karan Thapar’s studio last week. Kishor should have known that Thapar is thorough with his homework. When asked why his prediction that the Bharatiya Janata Party would secure over 300 seats in the Lok Sabha should be believed when a couple of his earlier such predictions proved to be wrong, Kishor denied any such wrong prediction on his part. He then demanded that Thapar show a video clip to prove his charge. Thapar had newspaper clips and social media posts at hand. Kishor’s demand fell flat and exposed the biased and partisan nature of his prediction of a BJP victory. Kishor should have learnt a lesson from economist-turned-psephologist Surjit Bhalla. Bhalla has been in this business for over three decades. He has made any number of predictions on election outcomes. He was right on some and wrong on others. So, Bhalla has a simple line of defence. He quotes the famous British psephologist David Butler, a guru to many Indian psephologists including Prannoy Roy, who apparently held the view that psephologists should always forecast because sometimes they get it right and sometimes they don’t. Given the nature of the playfield, especially in a parliamentary system where converting vote percentages into number of seats is always fraught, and the element of uncertainty in an electorate as diverse as India’s, electoral outcome forecasting is a risky business. The track record of even the best psephologists are full of hits and misses. What keeps them in business is that someone or the other is happy with the forecast. Rather than confess that he got it wrong on a couple of occasions, Kishor insisted he had never got it wrong. He may have felt compelled to make the claim to remain in business. Thapar had him for breakfast. Election forecasting has been around for a long time. In India, it took off with the spread of television. Prannoy Roy was the first to make a business out of it. His original team consisted of economists and statisticians who were good at conducting sample surveys, number-crunching, constructing econometric models and making forecasts. Roy is himself an economist and his original team included Bhalla and Ashok Lahiri. The TV election forecasts brought into prominence several individuals who went on to have their own political careers, like G.V.L. Narasimha Rao and Yogendra Yadav. Given the public interest, nay curiosity, and the general human nature to want to know the future, election forecasts attract a big audience and for the media they have become money spinners. Everyone and his auntie has got into the game. One can pick and choose one’s favourite forecast and go to sleep. Big money has changed the way the media, print and electronic, report not just cricket and crime but also the Union Budget and elections. It’s all about eyeballs and TRPs and keeping the viewer from flipping TV channels. Live coverage of the Union Budget also began around the same time that televised election forecasting began, in the 1980s. With the urban middle class and upper-class audiences glued to the TV on Budget day to figure out the impact of taxes and policies on households and firms, TV coverage began attracting advertising revenues. Television coverage of the Union Budget has been continued even after the time of Budget presentation was changed from evening to morning, with entertaining discussions around the Budget televised in the evening. Advertising drives everything in the media. Not surprisingly, therefore, election coverage is increasingly less about serious issues and more about entertainment. Discussions have to become arguments. All sides have to shout at each other and if the shouting becomes too much, humour is inserted as a filler. Elections as entertainment have taken political journalists into different directions, from mixing politics with cuisine and restaurant hopping to mixing politics with cinema and song. Into this milieu and melange enter the pollsters and psephologists. They too must entertain to remain in business. In this year’s campaigning the trivialisation of politics has been taken to the extreme levels. Electoral forecasting has also become intertwined with politics with many analysts and journalists becoming overtly partisan. The manifest partisanship of some pollsters and psephologists has rendered most opinion and exit polls meaningless. Yet, the show goes on. As long as the audience is there, there’s money to be made. Most view these polls much like they view the predictions of an astrologer. Who knows he may be right, he may be wrong, but let’s find out. Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be. The future’s not ours to see. But why not check it out? Some intelligent television anchors, once bitten twice shy, protect their reputation with the caveat that there is always a margin of error in all polls and this is only a survey. Voters in India are secretive. They say one thing, and do another. So on and so forth. A dozen different caveats have been invented to explain away an error of judgment in converting survey percentages into a tally of seats. For the first time this year, we see election forecasts and opinion polls being used as an instrument of the electoral campaign and propaganda. Numbers are being put out to convince voters that one side or the other is sure to win. This is being done with two different purposes in mind. One, to deflate the enthusiasm of the supporters of one’s opponent so as to discourage them from going out to vote; or, two, to enthuse the supporters of one’s own to get them to go out and vote. Lower turnouts in the first two phases have made all sides use manufactured forecasts to influence voter behaviour. Kishor entered this field pretending to be a commentator while in fact trying to be a player. He assumed he could respond to Thapar’s straight bat knocks with spin and googly. If he had shouted down his interlocutor on any other channel he may have got away with it, given that so few journalists are used to asking follow-up questions and countering statements with facts. Karan Thapar is not one to be cowed down. He is always armed with facts. Kishor got caught out.",

        "content": "For the second time in the last four seasons, Alex Anthopoulos is faced with the nearly impossible task of replacing the reining NL MVP Ronald Acuña Jr, who suffered a torn ACL on Sunday afternoon. Of course, the last time this happened, the Braves went on to win the World Series, thanks to a series of trades that resulted in the acquisitions of Joc Pederson , Jorge Soler , and Adam Duvall . It was magical, and Anthopoulos will likely have to operate similarly in the next couple of months if the Braves want to have any chance of hoisting the Commissioner’s Trophy this October. However, making moves this far away from the trade deadline isn’t easy. There aren’t many clubs trying to sell, and even the ones that may consider it are likely to wait closer to the trade deadline to incite a bidding war amongst competitive teams. The Braves have to make do with what they have, and the plan for now is to start Adam Duvall and Jarred Kelenic everyday. The Braves are going to use Kelenic (LF) and Duvall (RF) as their every-day outfielders. — Gabe Burns (@GabeBurnsAJC) May 27, 2024 This is the most logical solution. Kelenic and Duvall are very good defensively; however, they’ve each left a bit to be desired offensively. Hopefully, getting everyday at-bats will help them find a groove, but if they continue to struggle with the stick, the Braves may need to find different answers. The recently called up J.P. Martinez could get some opportunities. Forrest Wall is also an option in Gwinnett, but one of the more intriguing options is using Marcell Ozuna in the field. He hasn’t done that in years, and it surely won’t look pretty, but it would allow for Travis d’Arnaud , Sean Murphy , and Marcell Ozuna to be in the lineup at the same time. Offensively, that’s the best case scenario, but I imagine it will be a last resort because of how abysmal Ozuna is in the field.

        "content": "The Senate Committee on Capital Market has cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of Frana Chukwuogor as Executive Commissioner (Legal and Enforcement). Mr Bola Ajomale as Executive Commissioner (Operations) and Mrs. Samiya Usman as Executive Commissioner (Corporate Services). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. His appointment as SEC DG has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1tn economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, his team was appointed by President Tinubu to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth. He said, “We are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointed by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market.” He described the capital market as the barometer of the economy, noting that the Commission would implement innovative polices and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Agama said, “You must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that.”",

        "description": "Mired in a devastating conflict, Congo is desperate for help. The only groups keen to step in are mercenaries, Russian and otherwise.",
        "content": "GOMA, Congo — In a makeshift nightclub in the hull of the overnight ferry from Goma to Bukavu, a handful of teenage boys are trying out some new moves. Some land, some don’t. When they don’t, the elderly man on the bench next to us nudges us and rolls his eyes, amused. The DJ, who has so far been playing the usual Afrobeats hits and Congolese rumba, whips out a more unexpected Communist crossover: the Russian Internationale — the pre-1944 Soviet national anthem — mixed with a Congolese beat. People immediately pack the dancefloor. Here in eastern Congo, enthusiasm is palpable for the “Russians,” a catch-all term for the roughly 1,000 Eastern European mercenaries stationed in Goma as well as actual Russian mercenaries embedded in other fragile states — and the Russian government, which it approved a tentative military cooperation agreement with Kinshasa. The reason is simple. Since 2022, this area has been mired in one of the world’s most catastrophic conflicts. , the M23 militia has raped and massacred its way through the North Kivu province and is edging nearer to the regional capital Goma — close enough that, the night before, we could hear the rumble of explosions outside the city. The conflict has displaced millions, wrecked lives and livelihoods and destroyed the modest tourist industry. Even the endangered mountain gorillas, the area’s most lucrative draw for visitors, have fled the besieged Virunga National Park to neighboring Rwanda. With international attention taken up by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, there is little interest in the crisis here and no hope of support from the West. The East African Community sent some soldiers early on, but the alliance quickly . Even the UN peacekeepers are packing up to leave. Congo is desperate for help, and the only groups keen to step in are mercenaries, Russian and otherwise, circling to see what they can gain. Increasingly, too, a complex web of military and commercial actors from Russia, China, UAE, the U.S., France, Bulgaria and Romania — the interests of which on paper should not overlap — appear to be working together to maximize this extraction. Historically, inviting in foreign militaries and especially mercenary groups has gone spectacularly badly throughout Africa. And while Russia may have pulled off an impressive PR feat by convincing Congolese citizens that it will be a genuine ally, its mercenary forces’ actions elsewhere on the continent tell a very different story. “The Wagner Group and other emerging Russia-backed forces and ‘advisers’ exploit the resources and people of African countries for their personal gain. They are a threat to stability and prosperity in countries where they are present,” a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said in an emailed statement. “These forces do not lower terrorism but rather exacerbate the threat by pursuing draconian, violent tactics. This results in dramatic increases of cyclical violence,” the spokesperson added. As Western countries sanctioned Moscow following its 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Kremlin began frantically military cooperation deals with various African nations. This included a May 2019 with Congo’s neighbor, Congo-Brazzaville/Republic of the Congo, that saw Russia send military specialists to the country and help maintain its Soviet-made equipment. The Kremlin it inked a similar agreement with Congo earlier this year. , Russia has also aggressively expanded its military presence across Africa through the Wagner Group, a collection of front companies and Russian mercenary outfits formerly owned by the late businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Once a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, Prigozhin launched the Wagner Group following the annexation of Crimea to further the Kremlin’s foreign policy goals even as sanctions piled up and the country became diplomatically isolated. The U.S. designated the Wagner Group as a transnational criminal organization in January 2023, and the Treasury connected individuals and companies. But by May last year, it was believed to have around mercenaries stationed in Africa — many of whom were former Russian soldiers and convicts. Wagner troops have been in Mali, Sudan, Central African Republic, Libya and Mozambique, and its mercenaries have been accused of torture, rape, child abduction and summary execution of civilians. Wagner-linked companies are involved in gold smuggling and illegal mineral exploitation, using Cameroon as a logistics and transport hub. The group also engaged in (through AFRIC, Prigozhin’s fake election monitoring organization) in Congo, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa. These activities tend to follow the same pattern, journalist Julia Steers said. “Get into a country that has a complex and protracted conflict that has been unsolvable by other countries by selling security personnel, services and training, and then once you are in the country you take advantage of what that country has to offer — by propaganda in the media and civil society there, by getting the political class on your side,” she says. That might be through exploitative businesses, as in the Central African Republic, she said, or straight-up resource extraction, as in Mali. But in any case, the question boils down to: “How can we take advantage of what this country has to offer once we have got our foot in the door through this security agreement?” Steers was formerly VICE News’ Nairobi bureau chief and has spent years investigating and interviewing Wagner employees across the region, gaining rare access to their operations on the ground. Wagner’s Africa strategy, Steers says, is to identify hotspots with vast mineral wealth that are beleaguered by conflict and present themselves as the solution. “In reality, what we’ve seen is that they often just prolong the conflict in a different way,” she said. The trick appears to be doing just enough to contain the worst militias that the population comes to accept abuse and exploitation as a necessary payoff. “When I was first in the Central African Republic, the sentiment was very much, ‘Russia very bad, Wagner very bad, they’re slaughtering us’,” Steers said. “But when the rebels almost took Bangui, it truly was Wagner that prevented it from falling. The perception on the ground — and the reality on the ground — was that they are doing something.” If a country is in dire enough straits, she said, the population starts to see “very, very incremental improvements” as a positive thing — “even at the cost of human rights.” Prigozhin and several Wagner commanders died when an apparent caused his private jet to crash in August 2023, two months after launching a short-lived mutiny that Putin called an act of treason. But the Wagner Group lives on in Africa and is now reportedly directly controlled by the Kremlin under the new name Africa Corps. In February, the BBC that General Andrei Averyanov, head of a Russian military intelligence unit that specializes in “targeting killings and destabilizing foreign governments,” had assumed leadership of Africa Corps and appeared to be striking deals with powerful warlords, coup leaders and military juntas in Libya, Burkina Faso, CAR, Mali and Niger to help consolidate control in return for signing away mineral rights to Russia. The Kremlin last June that the Russian state had no role Wagner/Africa Corp is hardly the first set of state-linked mercenaries to exploit security crises in African nations and gain access to valuable resources. During the 1960s, as the last of the European colonial powers were pushed out of Africa by independence movements, several scrambled for ways to cling to whatever power they could, fearing that newly independent African states would align themselves with the Communist U.S.S.R. Today, the private security contracting business in Congo is booming. The American Erik Prince, formerly of the notorious Blackwater group, was alleged by a UN report to have been MONUSCO peacekeeping services to potentially fill their role with his mercenaries. The most prominent actor currently on the ground however is Horatiu Potra, the Romanian mercenary who openly operates his armed private security firm, Asociatia RALF, in eastern Congo. The armed security operators are officially there as military instructors and to guard key infrastructure like airports. But, from on-the-ground observations, they were also taking part in active combat missions in North Kivu. The risk of foreign fighters operating inside Congo was brought to international attention this month when U.S. citizen Christian Malanga was shot dead while leading in Kinshasha. Another three U.S. citizens were detained by Congolese forces. The motivations and wider support for the group involved in this failed attempt to seize power remain unclear, but the operation stands as a reminder that, even in 2024, foreign actors are still using armed force to gain control in this mineral-rich state. Russia will capitalize on situations like this when it many Western companies, governments, militaries and certainly private security forces operating in Africa of selfishness and exploitation. The problem is that they have made it clear, at every juncture, that they will do the same. “If Africa Corps, formerly Wagner, were to arrive in the DRC, their objectives would be the same as they have been elsewhere — and even more so — which is to strengthen and extend the influence of the Russian state and show the West as feckless and self-interested, although Russia is feckless and extremist, and really acting like a neo-colonial power in Africa,” says Vanda Felbab-Brown, co-director of the Africa Security Initiative at the Brookings Institution in Washington. And while ideologically opposed countries — especially the U.S. and France on one side and Russia and China on the other — disparage each other’s predatory inclinations, behind the scenes, their most vocally patriotic mercenary leaders and mining investors appear more than happy to work together, forging dangerous alliances in spite of, rather than in support of, their respective countries’ interests. Back in Goma, outside a building that locals identify as a “Russian” base, a mercenary with an Eastern European accent smirks when we ask him if he’s Russian or Romanian. “It doesn’t matter where I’m from,” he says. “All that matters is that as long as we’re here, you’re safe.” In a sense, it’s true — no matter where these mercenaries are from, the outcome will be the same. Rebel militias might be held back, at least a little, at least for a time — and in the long term, the country will see even more of its wealth and resources slip away into foreign hands. But here in eastern Congo, where the most pressing priority is keeping the wolf from the door, it’s a risk politicians and the public appear willing to take.",

        "content": "An Egyptian soldier was killed during a clash with Israeli troops at a Gaza border crossing on Monday while an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 40 Palestinians at a camp for displaced people, further inflaming regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war. Egypt’s military confirmed that a border guard died at the Rafah border crossing on Monday, in bloodshed that threatened to escalate tensions with Israel. Separately, the airstrike at the camp northwest of the Gazan city of Rafah drew international condemnation. Israel acknowledged the death of dozens of people in the strike, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “a tragic mistake” in an address to the Knesset. Israeli leaders said they were still investigating both incidents. In the border clash, the Israel Defense Forces said “a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border,” and that discussions with Egypt were ongoing, without giving any more detail. Israel said the airstrike late Sunday at a Rafah tent community was based on “precise intelligence” and that it killed two “senior” officials from Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union. But governments across the world were quick to condemn Israel for the strike. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged,” while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified.” The White House said in a statement that images of innocent civilians killed in the strike were “heartbreaking.” “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” the National Security Council said in a statement. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Israeli troops started operations around the outskirts of Rafah, which lies in southern Gaza, early this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will attack the city because it’s the last bastion of Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group, and several thousand of its fighters are lodged there. The U.S. and other countries fear mass casualties among the Palestinian civilians in Rafah and have urged Israel to cancel or sharply curtail an assault to prevent harm to innocents. The White House said Monday it was “actively engaging” with the IDF and partners in the region to better assess what had occured. The U.S. and others have also voiced concerns about an Israeli attack on Rafah worsening ties with Egypt. The two Middle Eastern countries signed a peace deal in 1979, which is seen as crucial to Israel’s security. Egypt has been highly vocal of the war in Gaza and consistently called on Israel to agree to a cease-fire. The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. Israel’s counterattack has killed some 35,000 Gazans, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. (With assistance from Justin Sink.) ©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

Holy Name, 18-5 and Medina Highland, 13-2 Wooster’s path: Def. Canton Central Catholic, 16-1 and Copley, 18-8 Up next: Winner advances to the Division II Region 5 final to take (2) Rocky River and (7) Toledo St. John’s on May 30. Outlook: For the first time in two years, Olmsted Falls will go on the road for a regional tournament game. With a 10-1 record in the regional tournament since 2023, the Bulldogs will put its Division II state championship defense on the line, on the road. They only had one loss at home all season. Road games are a different matter, as it went 2-7. The wins were against Bay (15-5) and a 10-9 overtime victory against Walsh Jesuit. One of the seven losses was against Wooster. However, the 12-4 loss happened in mid-April. Since then, Olmsted Falls won eight of its next 11 games. The most recent was a 13-2 victory against No. 5 seed Medina Highland. Olmsted Falls appears to have a found its fighting spirit. The question is if its championship DNA is there, too. The Bulldogs are led by Jameson DeMarco, who has a total of 72 points and is committed to Cleveland State. Jake Bill, Aidan Toth, Jonathan Blevins and Bryce Gulliford round out the attack. They fired on all cylinders against Highland and caused numerous matchup problems. Tiffin recruit Jack Birch was a force for groundballs. Goalie Caden Vinci holds the program’s single-season saves record at 166. Wooster has lost two games all season to Rocky River (7-6) and Chagrin Falls (12-6). The Generals come in riding on a five-game winning streak. The offense is spearheaded by Cooper Laughlin at 90 point, 67 of which are goals. Teammates Liam Harwoo (67 points), Braylon Dawson (49) and Drew Thomas (46) have at least 40 points on the season. Logan Beery is a sophomore at the faceoff spot and has won 84.1% of them. Wooster won 80% of its faceoffs against Olmsted Falls and Dawson scored five goals in the regular season win. If Olmsted Falls can come out with a win, this would be monumental for the program. Perez’s pick: Wooster",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. \"Bill Walton,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said, \"was truly one of a kind.\" Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career, disrupted by chronic foot injuries, lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. Raptors star RJ Barrett, family mourning death of younger brother \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" 'Relentless energy' They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, \"Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. Warriors assistant coach Dejan Milojević dead at 46 after heart attack \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a \"Deadhead.\" And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the \"Conference of Champions\" and loved it all the way to the end. \"It doesn't get any better than this,\" he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Won his first 73 college games Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA's dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton's UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins' extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. \"My teammates ΓÇa made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,\" Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. \"The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.\" Legendary Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight dead at 83 More basketball coverage He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game's greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. \"Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,\" Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. \"Playing basketball with Larry Bird,\" Walton once said, \"is like singing with Jerry Garcia,\" referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke, a former NBA player and now a coach.",

Now some wit might produce a new commentary mocking our crumbling streets: “I Survived The Anchorage Trail of Craters.” — Ken Flynn Anchorage Have something on your mind?

        "description": "Estebjson Ocon collided with his Alpine teammate Pierre Gasly at the Monaco Grand Prix, and he could find himself dropped by the team.",
        "content": "An unfortunate clash between Alpine racers Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly at Portier during the F1 Monaco Grand Prix triggered team boss Bruno Famin to have a word with reserve driver Jack Doohan over potentially making the step into a driving spot. An eager attempt by Ocon to overtake his teammate led to a tire collision, launching his car into the air . Following the session's red-flagging and failed restart, Ocon joined three other drivers who saw their races end abruptly after the first corner. \"It's sad to see this kind of incident,\" lamented Famin to Canal+. \"It's exactly what we didn't want to see. Esteban's attack was totally out of circumstances. \"It was exactly what we didn't want to see and we're going to draw the consequences. We're going to make a tough decision. If we were fighting for a podium finish at the end of the race, why not, and still... But there, on the first lap, at Le Portier, frankly, it wasn't the place to make an attack, leaving zero room for his teammate.\" Ocon and Gasly will both see their contracts with Alpine expire at the close of the season. Should both Frenchmen exit, this leaves two vacant F1 seats open for new contenders, namely Mick Schumacher or Australian Jack Doohan, who Famin reportedly pulled aside for a chat in Monte Carlo, according to Sky Sports' Ted Kravitz. Follow us on X for the best and latest in sports news F1 Monaco results: Driver of the day, fastest lap and current points standing Red Bull F1 car crushed and missing three wheels in chaotic start to Monaco Grand Prix Kravitz shared his observations during Ted's Notebook post-race debrief, saying: \"I will say that I saw Famin on the roof of the Alpine pit building, he called Jack Doohan, the reserve driver, over for a chat. They had a chat. I don't know what the chat was about. And then Jack Doohan left and went down the stairs. Now, I know that's not exactly Woodward and Bernstein and Watergate, but it's all I've got.\" He speculated on potential consequences for Esteban Ocon, stating: \"Does that mean that Famin is going to penalize Esteban Ocon for doing what he told him not to do, by benching him for Canada? Maybe. Is he going to put Doohan in the car? Maybe.\" Kravitz also pondered the reaction from Ocon's camp if such a decision were made, adding: \"How will the Esteban Ocon camp feel about that if it does happen? I should think pretty bad. Will that only mean that they defer the Esteban Ocon penalty for the next race he does, which would be the one after Canada which is Spain? Yes.\" Ocon acknowledged his mistake regarding the incident, posting an apology on social media: \"Today's incident was my fault, the gap was too small in the end and I apologize to the team on this one. Hoping for a deserved points-finish for the team today,\" he expressed.",

Saleh has led one of the 10 worst offensive each of his three seasons in East Rutherford, averaging just 268 yards per contest in 2023 after Rodgers suffered a season-ending Achilles injury. \"I think Robert, to his credit, is taking a deeper role in the offense, Rodgers told reporters on Tuesday. \"As a defensive coach, he's been in that room a lot, but he's been kind of sitting over to the left of me a good amount of the offseason so far. So we appreciate his influence. He's brought some really good ideas to the table. He's added a lot of interesting stuff that you'll see throughout the OTAs and training camp, which I think would be pretty cool for us.\" As Rodgers notes, a majority of Saleh's experience as a coach came managing the defensive side of the ball. The Northern Michigan graduate found his first job nearby at Michigan State and made his first leap into the NFL with in 2005. Saleh helped build one of the league's most formidable defenses in starting in 2017 and accepted an offer to become head coach of the New York Jets ahead of the 2021 season. True to form, the Jets' defense has enjoyed a splendid turnaround under Saleh's tutelage. New York finished third last season in total defense, also ranking tied for third in interceptions, all with a young core headlined by sensational cornerback Sauce Gardner. This acclaimed defense, partnered with the acquisition of legendary quarterback Aaron Rodgers, left the Jets with the sixth-best Super Bowl odds entering the 2023 season, but Rodgers' aforementioned injury torpedoed these lofty goals and saw New York finish just 7-10. Saleh states that the goal is for the Jets to become \"injury-proof\" in a year that has become crucial for Saleh, who has two years remaining on his contract. In preparing for this season, Rodgers feels that Saleh and the Jets front office made another astute move this offseason in acquiring Malachi Corley, a wide receiver selected in the third round of the this offseason. [\"He's] my favorite receiver in the draft,\" Rodgers said on the Official Jets Podcast. \"Now, he might not have been the best on paper in the draft, but I really felt like he was going to fit in with what we're trying to do - his mindset, his ferocity.\" A first glimpse at this Saleh-imprinted offensive is now on the horizon for Jets fans. New York will begin its preseason schedule August 10 against the and opens its regular-season slate against Saleh's former team, facing off against the 49ers in San Francisco for Sunday Night Football on September 9.",

        "content": "AMN / Ahmedabad Gujarat High Court on Monday said it had no faith in the state machinery, which gets into action only when innocent lives are lost. A special bench of Justices Biren Vaishnav and Devan Desai asked the Rajkot Municipal Corporation whether it had turned a blind eye to such a big structure coming up in its vicinity, after the RMC’s lawyer submitted that the TRP gaming zone had not asked for requisite permissions. The court said the state machinery gets into action only after innocent lives are lost. The HC was hearing a suo motu PIL on the deadly fire. Earlier, it had called it a “man-made disaster”. The court also observed on Monday that all the Rajkot municipal commissioners, from the time the TRP gaming zone was set up in 2021 till the time of this incident (on May 25) “should be held accountable for the tragedy that occurred”, and directed them to furnish separate affidavits. On Monday, a counsel pointed out that the incident required immediate preventive and corrective measures, and the state will have to come forward to hold a person accountable, and this calls for drastic steps. The court then said, “Who will take such drastic steps? Honestly speaking, we do not have faith in the state machinery now. Four years after orders of this court, directing them, after their assurance, this is the sixth incident that has happened. They only want lives to be lost and then trigger the machinery,” the court observed. Meanwhile Gujarat government on Monday shunted out five officials, including Rajkot Police Commissioner Raju Bhargava and two other IPS officers, after a massive fire at a game zone facility killed 28 people, including four children. Bhargava has been replaced by IPS officer Brijesh Kumar Jha. Additional Commissioner of Police (Administration, Traffic and Crime) Vidhi Choudhary and DCP-Zone 2 Sudhirkumar J Desai have also been transferred, officials said. According to police, the gaming zone did not have the required fire safety clearance from the city’s municipal corporation at the time of the incident. While the gaming zone owners had submitted bills to the police for fire safety equipment and claimed to have installed such equipment on the premises, the process for obtaining the necessary Fire NOC (No Objection Certificate) was underway, but had not been completed. It is suspected that the fire might have started due to a short circuit, but officials said that the exact cause will be known only after a probe. The action comes a day after Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel visited the site and instructed the officials to take strict action against those responsible for the horrific incident. The police have arrested the gaming zone’s owner – Yuvraj Singh Solanki, and his manager – Nitin Jain, under various charges, including culpable homicide. “An FIR has also been registered against four other accused under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), and 114 (abettor present when offense is committed) of the Indian Penal Code,” a police official said. The six individuals against whom the case was registered by the Rajkot taluka police in the wee hours of Sunday are Dhaval Corporation proprietor Dhaval Thakkar, Raceway Enterprise partners Ashoksinh Jadeja, Kiritsinh Jadeja, Prakashchand Hiran, Yuvrajsinh Solanki and Rahul Rathod. The state has announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each deceased. The Central Government has also announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased person. Gujarat Congress has demanded that senior civic and state officials and office-bearers of the ruling BJP be named in the FIR registered in the Rajkot gaming zone fire, stressing that action against junior-level employees is meaningless.",

        "content": "NEW YORK -- While has remained one of the most productive hitters in the majors this season, he continues making progress in his recovery to getting back on the mound after Tommy John surgery. The superstar said he started throwing from 60 feet last week and reached 80 mph. \"Just progressively increasing the distance,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter Monday before the Dodgers' series opener against the was postponed. \"Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance. Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I'm not quite sure how far I'm going to go out there, but that's the progression.\" Ohtani underwent the elbow surgery last September as a member of the after going 10-5 with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts in 132 innings across 23 starts. He is limited to only hitting this season and is on pace to post the best offensive year of his major league career. Ohtani, 29, entered Monday leading the majors in batting average (.336) and total bases (131) in 53 games as the Dodgers' designated hitter. He was tops in the National League in slugging percentage (.621), OPS (1.024) and OPS+ (188). Ohtani has recently played through a hamstring contusion he suffered when he was hit by a pickoff throw last week. He has remained in the lineup, but Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters over the weekend that he was advised to not push the hamstring. Ohtani said the injury has affected his running but not his swing. \"It's getting better day by day,\" he said. \"Today is definitely a lot better than yesterday.\"",

        "description": "During a flight, an apparent \"medical scare\" led to paramedics being called to check on and treat boxing legend Mike Tyson.",
        "content": "Mike Tyson was on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles when he suffered what is being deemed a \"medical scare.\" According to confirmation from Tyson's \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great.\" \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing,\" read an email to the Post. \"He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Tyson was aboard the plane when it was delayed by two hours before takeoff. The initial thought was Tyson could have been removed from the plane at that time, but that detail was never confirmed. Later, representatives confirmed the initial delay in taking off had to do with an \"air conditioning issue\" and not with the medical issue Tyson suffered. Around 30 minutes before the flight landed in Los Angeles, an announcement came on the loudspeaker and on screens asking if there was a doctor on board the aircraft. about the medical issue, as a source told the publication, \"Mike had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded. Before the paramedics arrived the flight issued an announcement asking for a doctor — the message even came on everyone's screens.\" Paramedics apparently boarded the flight and attended to Tyson, leaving passengers on the plane for an additional 25 minutes. There are no further details about what the ulcer flare-up caused for Tyson, but it sounds like he got the right care. This is a scary situation for anyone Tyson's age (57), but even more for a man who's been gearing up to enter the boxing ring again. Tyson is set to face off against boxer and YouTube star Jake Paul on July 20 in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on . There have been multiple videos of Tyson training in preparation for his return to the boxing ring. The biggest concern for the legendary boxer is his age. Many believe Tyson could get hurt in the ring against a much younger fighter. At least his publicly available training videos have revealed that Tyson, the undisputed heavyweight champion from 1987-90, still appears to be in top shape. Still, questions remain. The airplane incident might indicate a more serious underlying medical issue that could keep Tyson from boxing. Texas' equivalent of a boxing commission The Department of Licensing and Regulation also states that \"contestants who are age 36 or older, must submit a report of favorable physical testing including, but not limited to, an EEG (electroencephalography), and an EKG (electrocardiogram).\" Monday's incident might prompt the department to look into details of what occurred, and see if it is consistent with any records Tyson has already submitted in preparation for his fight. The good news is Tyson appears to be in good health, and he was taken care of by the paramedics on the plane.

        "content": "NEW YORK – Shohei Ohtani missed a game with lower back tightness but has played through a bruised hamstring for more than a week. But he doesn’t blame that for a .211 average (8 for 38) over his past 10 games. “I don’t think so. Obviously, the leg isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” he said through his interpreter early Monday afternoon at Citi Field before news that the day’s game had been postponed. The Dodgers and Mets will play a doubleheader on Tuesday. Ohtani said his left hamstring is “getting better day by day.” His back issue caused him to miss the Dodgers’ game May 12 in San Diego but he said it feels “pretty good” now. “I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,” Ohtani said. Most of that pre-game work is done in areas off limits to the media and he almost never takes batting practice on the field with the team. So Ohtani’s most visible work is the throwing program he started in late March, six months after undergoing his second Tommy John surgery. Every other day, Ohtani throws briefly on the field. At this point, he has increased the number of throws since playing catch for the first time on March 25 but is still throwing from less than 60 feet. “Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance,” Ohtani said. “Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there, but that’s the progression. “Last week, I got to 60 feet and was able to throw 80 mph.” Even with his recent slump, Ohtani leads the majors in batting average (.336) and total bases (131) and the National League in slugging percentage (.621) and OPS (1.024). He also has stolen 13 bases, halfway to matching his career-high for a full season. It’s the best offensive start of his career but Ohtani doesn’t necessarily attribute that to being able to focus on hitting and not devoting any time or energy to also pitching. “It’s hard to say at this point,” he said. “I have to play a full season to see if I could really say that.” Ohtani could progress to throwing to hitters in simulated-game settings as soon as September but the Dodgers have said he will not pitch in games again until 2025. He does miss pitching, Ohtani acknowledged. “I think any starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game you start,” he said Monday. “In a sense, I do miss that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focusing on progressing every day and really focusing on that.” Related Articles Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers’ game in New York postponed; doubleheader on Tuesday Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers’ losing streak reaches five as Reds complete sweep Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers doing much better job of controlling running game this season Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers’ offensive slump continues as losing streak reaches four Los Angeles Dodgers | Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani dealing with hamstring injury NEW YORK Visiting New York for the first time since news of the scandal involving his former interpreter and friend Ippei Mizuhara, Ohtani was asked by the local media how he has been able to perform so well on the field while dealing with the upheaval in his personal life. “I think what affected me the most was not being able to sleep well,” he said in a familiar response. “Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities and I have every confidence in my own ability to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.”",
