        "content": "Vinayak Damodar Savarkar , also referred to as Veer Savarkar, was a revolutionary leader. He was also a social reformer and a writer. Savarkar was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent to Port Blair Cellular jail (Kala Paani) in Andaman. Savarkar was born to Damodar and Radhabai Savarkar on May 28, 1883, in Maharashtra’s Nashik. Savarkar passed away on February 26, 1966. Last year, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde declared that May 28 will be celebrated as ‘Swatantrya Veer Gaurav Din’. On his birth anniversary, here’s a look at some little-known facts about the great leader. Veer Savarkar Birth Anniversary 2024: Lesser-known Facts 1.At the age of 16, Savarkar formed the Mitra Mela. The only aim of this group was to attain freedom for the nation. It was formed in 1899. Later, Mitra Mela was known as Abhinava Bharat. 2.Did you know Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was among the first few revolutionaries who understood the importance of having international support for attaining independence? 3.He was arrested by British officers in 1910 and sent to jail at the age of 27. During his time there, Savarkar wrote a book titled — Essentials of Hindutva. As per Britannica, the epigraph of his book defines the concept as “A HINDU means a person who regards this land of BHARATVARSHA, from the Indus to the Seas as his Father-Land as well as his Holy-Land that is the cradle land of his religion.” 4.Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, in 1937, was picked as the president of Hindu Mahasabha. He held the position for five years. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’s Quotes 1.“We yield to none in our love, admiration, and respect for the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. They are all ours. Their glories are ours, and ours are their failures.” 2.“One country, one God, one caste, one mind brothers all of us without difference, without doubt.” 3.“Calmness in preparation but boldness in execution, this should be the watchword during moments of crisis.” 4.“The nation that has no consciousness of its past has no future.” 5.“Every person is a Hindu who regards and owns this Bharat Bhumi, this land from the Indus to the seas, as his Fatherland as well as Holyland, that is, the land of the origin of his religion.” 6.The practice of untouchability is a sin, a blot on humanity, and nothing can justify it.”",

        "content": "If you face trouble watching videos on YouTube, don't worry because it may be because the app's new policy about the use of ad blockers. Recently, several users faced an issue with YouTube where any video they tapped to play on their phones or tablets, skipped to the end after the first few seconds, Phone Arena reported. It simply means that you probably have an ad-blocker running on your device that needs to be turned off to watch the entire video. But why can't people use ad blockers while using YouTube? Well, last October, YouTube revealed that it was stepping up its attack against ad blockers so that users would sign up for a premium version of the app that shows no ads. This is part of Google's next move to encourage users to sign up for YouTube Premium that does not show ads. This is to make sure that the company gets paid for making all of these videos available to viewers and rewarding content creators who can monetise their work. The tech giant has emphasised that YouTube ad generated $8.09 billion for its parent company Alphabet in the first quarter. YouTube ad revenue climbed 21% annually and it contributed roughly 10% of Alphabet's total revenue during the opening three months of 2024.",

Musk, 52, reposted another post about a 12-hour new recap from last Saturday, and wrote: \"WhatsApp exports your user data every night. Some people still think it is secure.\" The X post about the news recap said that Musk had urged AI \"to prioritize truth over political correctness, warning that lies could backfire.\" A few days later, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart dismissed the tech billionaire's claim saying that it was \"not correct\". Cathcart reposted Musk's post and wrote: \"Many have said this already, but worth repeating: this is not correct.\" Cathcart revealed that the app end-to-end encrypts users' messages because it takes security of users \"seriously\". He continued: \"(Messages) don't get sent to us every night or exported to us. If you do want to backup your messages, you can use your cloud provider and you can even use end-to-end encryption for that too.\" Furthermore, Musk has not responded to Cathcart's post on X yet.",

The Chinese minister's comment came when he was addressing a press briefing for the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum on Monday, Xinhua reported. According to the state news agency, Deng said that China's ties with many Arab countries have developed from \"partnership\" to \"strategic cooperative relationship\" and later to \"strategic partnership,\" achieving massive progress. The minister also noted that the forum has made remarkable achievements since its establishment 20 years ago. The two sides, during the first China-Arab States Summit in 2022, had agreed to build a community with a shared future in the new era, and China-Arab relations entered a new era of comprehensive deepening development, the minister said. \"With the joint efforts of both sides, China-Arab strategic mutual trust has been deepened, practical cooperation has delivered tangible benefits to the two peoples, cultural and people-to-people exchanges have been further enriched, and positive progress has been made in building a China-Arab community with a shared future,\" Xinhua reported, quoting Minister Deng. The minister maintained that China and Arab nations are crucial members of the developing world and share the common mission of \"realising national rejuvenation and accelerating national development\". He stressed the importance of advancing ties between China and the Arab world to further encourage peace and development in the Middle East.",

        "content": "BEIJING: The Communist Party of China (CPC) leadership has underscored the need to mitigate financial risks to achieve high-quality development as it concerns the country's national security and overall safety of the people, Xinhua reported on Monday. During the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee meeting, meeting, presided by General Secretary Chinese President Xi Jinping, the forum mulled over trial provisions concerning accountability for failing to prevent or defuse financial risks. The development comes as President Xi, while addressing the opening of a study session at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee (National Academy of Governance) in January, had accentuated the need to defuse systematic financial risks. The trial provisions reflected Beijing's move to bolster financial oversight to prevent and alleviate financial risks and encourage development in the financial field. The huddle also called for the strict implementation of the trial provisions — also aimed at promoting the CPC's self-governance in the financial field and strengthening the centralised and unified leadership in financial work along with ensuring relevant authorities, financial institutions, industry authorities and local Party committees and governments fulfil their duties zealously — to convey a strong message that violators will duly be held accountable. Furthermore, the meeting highlighted the need for efforts for significant breakthroughs in accelerating the country's central region's development, which in fact amounts to a tenth of the nation's land and one-quarter of the total population, comprising Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei and Hunan provinces. The region, the huddle noted, holds importance in terms of grain production, modern equipment manufacturing, high-tech industry, energy and raw materials along with a comprehensive transportation hub. Calling for adhering to innovation-driven development and improving original scientific and technological research for breakthroughs, the participants also urged for efforts to develop new quality productive forces in line with local conditions, the expedited building of a modernised industrial system as well and the amplification of the development of the real economy sector with improved competitiveness. The move, the meeting noted, is also aimed at coordinating efforts to encourage the upgrading of traditional industries while simultaneously catering to emerging industries as well as those of the future. Underscoring the measures for the development of a modernised transportation infrastructure system along with the efficient, free and smooth flow of production factors, the huddle called for the push towards ecological conservation, environmental protection, green and low-carbon development along with continued efforts pursuing integrated development of urban and rural areas and advance rural revitalisation. Additionally, the forum also stressed the improvement in the country's capacity to ensure the supply of various resources such as grain, energy and others.",

The Golden Eaglets were defeated by Cote d’Ivoire’s Baby Elephants in the semi-finals, while the Black Starlets were overpowered by Burkina Faso’s Baby Etalons. With the West African Football Union yet to confirm the number of teams advancing to the 2025 Africa U17 Cup of Nations from WAFU B, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, the General Secretary of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has urged the Eaglets to treat the third-place match as a final. “We are still awaiting clarity on the number of teams that will qualify for the U17 AFCON from this tournament. Some have said three teams, others four. Therefore, it is crucial that our boys give their all to secure third place,” Sanusi stated. “The Black Starlets will not be easy opponents. They have the advantage of being the home side and will have fan support. But our boys have what it takes to win.” The third-place match will kick off at 4 PM Nigeria time at the University of Ghana Sports Stadium. The final between Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire will follow at 7 PM Nigeria time.",

The attack took place on a bus going from Kozhikode to Bangalore. Sultan Bathery native Muhammad Ashraf was attacked by a five-member gang. Earlier, one among the gang came to board the bus but was not allowed entry since the seating was full and the bus didn’t entertain standing passengers. The man got angry over the incident and left the place only to soon park his car in front of the bus and confront the driver. Ashraf intervened in the issue and asked the gang to not create a ruckus. This agitated the other members who according to Ashraf pushed him aside which later resulted in physical torture. Police led by Thamarassery SI Shaji reached the spot following a complaint by the bus staff. The police have started an investigation to catch the dark blue Swift car used by the accused. The police have received information that the accused are natives of Thamarassery, Karadi.",

Sources told IANS on Tuesday that the ED has provided details on the innovative methods that Sheikh Shahjahan used to launder his illegal money and that of other politically-influential people in West Bengal According to the sources, the leader from Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas District first parked the unaccounted proceeds in comparatively smaller accounts in multiple banks that were held by his associates, and then, in due course that money was invested in legal businesses, the returns of which were shown as legitimately accounted for money. Sources added that all these details were mentioned in the chargesheet submitted by the ED at a special court of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in Kolkata on Monday afternoon. Sources said that the majority of the illegal money was laundered through Shahjahan’s fish export business and the company was registered in the name of his daughter. In the chargesheet, the ED has accused Shahjahan of collecting Rs 261 crore through illegal land grabbing in Sandeshkhali. On Monday, the ED had informed the special court that till now it had identified 59.5 acres of illegally-grabbed land.

        "content": "There was a surge in inflation, and that has prompted central banks around the world to raise interest rates. While this is a necessary step to combat rising prices, it casts a shadow of uncertainty over the booming tech industry. Startups, the lifeblood of technological innovation, are heavily reliant on venture capital and debt financing to fuel their growth. Let’s discuss how rising interest rates could create a funding squeeze, impacting the ability of startups to thrive and potentially hindering the overall progress of the tech sector. What Is The Funding Squeeze? The rising interest rates cause two-sided damage to startups that are seeking funding options. As interest rates climb, the cost of borrowing money for startups increases significantly. This directly impacts startups that rely on debt financing to fuel expansion, such as taking out loans for equipment purchases, hiring talent, or marketing campaigns. With higher interest rates, the cost of servicing these loans becomes more burdensome, potentially eating into profits and limiting future investments. Higher loan payments can strain a startup’s already tight cash flow. This can force them to make tough decisions, such as delaying critical investments, reducing marketing spend, or even laying off employees, all of which can hinder growth and innovation. Rising interest rates don’t just affect loans; they also influence investor behavior. When interest rates rise, investors tend to become more risk-averse. This means they might be less willing to invest in high-growth startups with unproven track records and a higher risk profile. Venture capitalists might become more selective, focusing their investments on established companies with a clearer path to profitability. With a safer alternative available (investments with guaranteed returns due to higher interest rates), investors might shift their focus towards less risky ventures. This could lead to a decline in funding available for early-stage startups with innovative ideas but limited financial history. The combined effect of increased borrowing costs and investor caution creates a funding squeeze for startups, making it more challenging to secure the capital needed to achieve their growth potential. The Impact On The Growth Of A Startup The funding squeeze caused by rising interest rates can have a major ripple effect on a startup’s growth pace. You might be wondering how it is associated. With tighter access to capital, startups might have to scale back on their growth ambitions. This could lead to delays in crucial investments needed for expansion. Hiring talented people is essential for a startup’s growth. However, rising interest rates can force startups to delay or even reduce hiring plans. This can hinder their ability to develop products, scale operations, and reach new markets. Product development is a cornerstone of success for any tech startup. However, with limited funds, startups might be forced to delay product features, postpone product launches, or even shelve promising R&D projects altogether. Rising interest rates can fundamentally shift a startup’s focus. Previously, the tech industry prioritized rapid user acquisition and growth, even if it meant operating at a loss. However, with the funding squeeze, profitability becomes paramount. Startups will likely prioritize strategies that generate revenue quickly, potentially sacrificing aggressive user growth tactics. We might see changes in how startups generate revenue. Subscription models with recurring income could become more prevalent compared to freemium models that prioritize user base first and monetization later. Startups might also explore alternative pricing strategies or premium features to increase their revenue streams. To maintain financial stability, startups might have to implement cost-cutting measures. This could involve renegotiating contracts with vendors, streamlining operations, or even resorting to layoffs. While these measures can help improve cash flow, they can also impact employee morale and potentially hinder innovation in the long run. Can Tech Adapt? Or Will Tech Adapt? While rising interest rates pose a significant challenge, the tech industry is known for its resilience and resourcefulness. Tech startups are inherently innovative and adaptable. They often operate with lean structures and are adept at finding creative solutions to problems. This adaptability will be crucial in finding new methods to guarantee the security of funding and deal with the challenges of a tighter financial sector. Many tech startups address real-world problems and offer compelling value propositions. During economic downturns, companies with solutions that demonstrably improve efficiency or add significant value are likely to attract investors even in a risk-averse environment. With traditional funding avenues becoming more restrictive, startups might explore alternative sources. Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo allow startups to raise capital directly from the public. Besides, if you have extra bucks, you can diversify your investment, for example, by creating a tool like Bit sprix AI that offers real-time data feed for the investors. This option can be a good deal for startups with innovative products or passionate user communities. High-net-worth individuals looking for high-growth potential might still be interested in investing in promising startups. Collaboration with established companies can provide access to funding, resources, and market reach. Startups can explore joint ventures, licensing agreements, or revenue-sharing models with larger companies. This method involves relying on internal resources and revenue generation to fund growth. Startups might become more focused on achieving profitability earlier and utilizing their own funds for expansion. These methodologies emphasize building a minimum viable product (MVP), testing it with users, and iterating rapidly. This will further allow startups to validate their thoughts and potential market fit with limited resources. By leveraging their inherent adaptability, exploring alternative funding avenues, and embracing bootstrapping and lean methodologies, tech startups can navigate the challenges of rising interest rates and emerge stronger as a result. Final Thoughts The rise in interest rates presents a significant hurdle for startups, tightening the grip on their access to capital. Increased borrowing costs and investor caution create a funding squeeze, potentially hindering the growth trajectory of these innovative companies. However, the tech industry is not without its advantages. Startups are known for their adaptability and resourcefulness. By focusing on innovation, value creation, and efficient resource allocation, they can potentially find new ways to navigate the funding squeeze. Exploring alternative funding sources like crowdfunding, angel investors, or strategic partnerships can also provide some relief. Additionally, a return to bootstrapping and lean startup methodologies might become more common as startups prioritize building sustainable and profitable businesses. In conclusion, while rising interest rates pose undeniable challenges, the tech industry’s ability to adapt and innovate should not be underestimated. By embracing resourcefulness and exploring alternative avenues of growth, startups can emerge stronger and more efficient. The future of tech startups in a higher interest rate environment will likely be marked by a shift towards profitability, a focus on genuine value creation, and the exploration of creative solutions to overcome funding hurdles. This period of economic uncertainty could ultimately foster a more resilient and sustainable tech ecosystem in the long run.",

The inequality within the Premier League was viewed by some as a mitigating circumstance. But, in the aftermath of a 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace that would be followed up with a 2-0 home reverse to Bournemouth, Roy Keane had less sympathy for Kompany's side. \"Do you know what, they have been dreadful. They have been dreadful,\" Keane told Sky Sports. \"We talk about teams having a style of play in the Championship and trying to compare it to the Premiership, it is chalk and cheese. It is impossible. \"They look weak physically. The goals they are giving away, it is schoolboy stuff. I admire managers who have a philosophy and a style of play, but you have got to adapt. You have got to give yourself a chance of winning football matches.\" Only two teams in the Premier League made more errors leading to shots than Burnley and the contrast with the risk-free football of the Dyche era became a stick with which to beat him. Thousands more passes brought little reward, only encouraging more mistakes. It is worth noting that even in his first managerial role at Anderlecht, Kompany's methods had been questioned. The attempt to mimic Guardiola had been a concern for some in Belgium, one expressed in strong terms by the former Anderlecht manager Aad de Mos. \"In football, you do not have to copy another coach,\" said De Mos. \"Kompany wants to do the same thing as Guardiola at City and that makes me sick. City have players like Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne. Anderlecht needs to get by with more modest players.\" Bayern bosses might feasibly agree with that assessment while coming to the opposite conclusion. Perhaps they take the view that they do possess the quality of player capable of delivering this football - they just need someone who is willing and able to coach it.

Bayern's status within the Bundesliga, relative to the rest, is much more akin to the latter than the former. If Kompany struggles then Bayern will be criticised. If he thrives their imagination will be lauded. Whatever happens, Kompany has been vindicated in sticking to his principles. It raises intriguing questions about how coaches should approach their work. Dyche is an obvious contrast but for him it feels more like ideology than compromise. Other examples are more pertinent. Julen Lopetegui and Thomas Frank are two that come to mind - coaches who opted to adapt but now find that could be a mark against them. Lopetegui's appointment at West Ham was met with a lukewarm response. In part, that was because his rescue job with Wolves - lifting them from rock bottom to 13th in the table - was not achieved with the necessary swagger to excite, even if it did save them. Frank played a progressive game to help Brentford win promotion but, unlike Kompany, successfully switched to a more direct style to keep them there. Now, he finds some questioning whether those long throws make him suitable for a role at an elite club. For Kompany, the stain of relegation is more easily erased than a stain on his style. This move shows that coaches, like players, can be upwardly mobile regardless of results. And that a man questioned at Burnley can somehow be seen as the answer for Bayern.

Cardiff-born Mr Plaut, whose other roles include chairing the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama - part of the University of South Wales where is he also a board member - joins the board of the public service broadcaster as nations director for Wales.

        "content": "Former PBA import Chris McCullough will be one of the imports of Strong Group when it competes in the 43rd William Jones Cup in Taipei, Taiwan slated July 13 to 21. This as McCullough signed up to the play for the Athletics – five years since he last played for the San Miguel Beermen. He left the country with lots of fond memories as he helped the Beermen won 2019 PBA Commissioner’s Cup. He hopes to provide SGA the same passion and fire when they play in Taipei. It can be recalled that the 6-foot-9 McCullough, 29, reportedly offered his services to Gilas Pilipinas but things did not work out well. For McCullough, who once suited up for the Brooklyn Nets, it is always a pleasure to don the country’s tricolors. “After so many years, it’s truly surreal to be returning to the country (Philippines). Even though it’s just for a short while,” said McCullough. “The experience of flying back, training, and being in the Philippines again is going to be amazing,” he added. After his SMB stint, McCullough hopped from one team to another that saw him play for Anyang KGC (South Korea), Rytas Vilnius (Lithuania), Al-Ahli (Bahrain), and Gigantes de Carolina (Puerto Rico). He last played for the Formosa Dreamers in the P.League+ where he averaged 18.8 points and 12.5 rebounds and led them into the semifinals. Thanks to Chris Ross, he was reconnected to SGA head coach Chris Tiu. “I also want to give a shoutout to Chris Ross for assisting in connecting us.”",

        "content": "Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to tell business leaders that, having brought business back to Labour , the party can now “bring growth back to Britain” if she gets into No 11. In her first major campaign speech, she will tell voters Labour can be trusted with the economy and that she wants to lead the most “pro-growth Treasury in UK history”. Speaking from Derby, she will stress the need for a partnership with business and workers, saying that a Labour government will offer “a government that is pro-worker and pro-business”. Her remarks come after Labour faced a backlash over an apparent rebranding of its “ New Deal for Workers ”, with Britain’s largest trade union Unite warning that the party must “stick to its guns” on workers’ rights. It comes as the Conservative party is set to unveil a new plan for pensioners in a bid to boost their incomes with a “triple lock plus” pledge . If the Tories are elected, the deal would guarantee that the basic state pension rises by the highest rate of inflation or 2.5 per cent, whichever is the largest increase.",

        "content": "The Department of Parliamentary Services boss, Rob Stefanic, has denied having a romantic relationship with his then subordinate, telling Senate estimates he formally declared a conflict of interest only due to “gossip” and “rumour”. Senate estimates heard on Tuesday that Stefanic declared a conflict due to his personal relationship with Cate Saunders, a former deputy secretary in the department, in August 2022. The hearing was told Stefanic remained her boss for eight months until she was seconded to another agency. Saunders was on secondment at Services Australia until she accepted a $315,126 incentive payment for her retirement from the public service on 1 October 2023, the hearing was told. The exit package was approved by the Department of Parliamentary Services. Stefanic told the hearing he was not involved in its signoff. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Appearing at estimates on Tuesday, Stefanic initially declined to respond to questions about his personal life. Citing a report in The Australian, the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts asked Stefanic whether he had had a romantic relationship with Saunders. Stefanic said: “I’ll give you a simple answer, senator, and that is no.” Stefanic told the Senate the media’s reporting of the allegations amounted to a “repeated violation” of his personal life and that he had “unsuccessfully tried to communicate to members of the media that I’ve taken all reasonable steps to declare all conflicts of interest as appropriate”. Under questioning by senators, Stefanic said he made a formal declaration of conflict to the then Australian Public Service commissioner, Peter Woolcott, in regards to the personal relationship with Saunders in August 2022 but said there was no documentation of it to his knowledge. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock queried how Stefanic and Saunders continued to work together for a period of eight months after the declaration was made and before Saunders left the DPS. Stefanic told Senate estimates the process to make alternative arrangements, including to move Saunders elsewhere, “took time” and was not “a matter of simply moving someone on day two”. “So, for the eight months where you were the manager in this relationship, how did you manage the conflict of interest within that eight-month period?” Pocock asked. Stefanic responded that the working relationship between the secretary and deputy secretary was “transactional” and that his dealings with Saunders as her boss during that period were “purely administrative in nature”. Stefanic said those administrative matters were mostly to do with the approval of personal leave. Asked by the Liberal senator Jane Hume why he had made a formal conflict of interest declaration if there had been no romantic relationship, Stefanic said: “I thought it was necessary given that I anticipated that that gossip and rumour would at some point come out in this forum. “And I felt it was important procedurally that – it was probably time for me to seek some advice.” He added that there were “perceptions of a close relationship” and that rumour “morphs into fact in people’s eyes”. Hume asked: “So you were declaring that others thought that there was a relationship, but there wasn’t one?” Stefanic responded: “What there was is a close friendship.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was later made the deputy secretary in 2020 but left the DPS for a temporary secondment at Services Australia in April 2023. The DPS is exempt from freedom of information laws. According to a leaked conflicts of interest policy document for DPS employees, seen by Guardian Australia, senior officials, including the secretary and the parliamentary librarian, are required to submit written declarations to parliament’s presiding officers for assessment. “Avoiding all conflicts of interest, real or apparent, is not always feasible. Where conflicts of interest are identified, they should be handled in an open and transparent way that can be understood and defended,” the document reads. “In rare circumstances, employees may need to consider changing roles within DPS or DPS may need to reassign the employee to other duties.” Asked by Guardian Australia if all processes were followed correctly last year, the presiding officers – the Senate president, Sue Lines, and the speaker, Milton Dick – said they “have sought advice from the Australian Public Service commissioner on the matters that have been raised”. “The commissioner was satisfied that all processes were followed,” Lines and Dick said in a statement last week. A DPS spokesperson told Guardian Australia Stefanic “maintained a professional working relationship with Ms Saunders for a number of years” before her move to Services Australia. “The secretary declares all relevant relationships in the appropriate manner. No formal complaints have been made in relation to the above-referenced conflict of interest,” the spokesperson said in early May. – Additional reporting by Josh Butler",

        "description": "Its corporate plan sees these 35 store closures continuing for much of the next two years.",
        "content": "To turn around Pick n Pay and restore profitability, the group will shut 35 stores and convert another roughly 70 to the mass-market Boxer brand (in areas where this makes sense) or to PnP franchise operators. ALSO READ: SA Inc can learn from Pick n Pay’s Ackerman In total, more than 100 stores will be converted or closed. This is a sizeable chunk of its current footprint – it only has 300 company-owned PnP supermarkets in South Africa. The closures amount to approximately 10% of its owned store base. In just the coming months, it will shut at least 14 supermarkets, with another “more than 10” to be converted to Boxer. Its corporate plan sees these 35 store closures continuing for much of the next two years. However, its franchise store footprint of nearly 200 supermarkets in SA will mean that its overall number of stores – as experienced by its customers – won’t decrease as drastically. ALSO READ: Ackerman family steps back from majority control of Pick n Pay In total, it owns 982 stores in the country, but this includes Clothing and Liquor outlets. Pick n Pay rebrand QualiSave is dead and these stores are being rebranded back to Pick n Pay. The core problem is that the range of goods in these outlets was cut too severely which negatively impacted margins, which then led to them turning unprofitable. ALSO READ: Pick n Pay technically insolvent, but new strategic plan will turn the ship Some of these QualiSave stores are obvious candidates for conversion to Boxer, which operates at a structurally lower cost base in each store. He says that, in general, its franchisees have been able to get “another 10% to 15% in revenue” out of one of their stores (versus a corporate one) and that these tend to be 33% to 50% smaller than corporate supermarkets. This means far better trading densities, and profits. Summers concedes that stores that turn over between R8 million and R10 million a month are “not particularly profitable for us” but for franchise operators with their “own skin in the game” this is different. ALSO READ: Pick n Pay recalls peanut butter due to high levels of aflatoxin Pick n Pay “fell behind in keeping stores fresh and modern,” says Summers. Falling behind saw its “spirit diminished over time”. In effect, he says, this caused a breach of trust: “Pick n Pay broke its relationship with the consumer.” This is what it is determined to repair. The group will “reverse” certain decisions that have been taken in recent years and plans a renewed focus on bakery, butchery, produce and deli. Customer service Some cuts that have been made to support functions over the last five to 10 years have been very damaging, says Summers. “If you show me an unhappy store, I’ll show you poor leadership and support.” It is no secret that it has to fix service and the perceptions around customer service at its stores. It will retrain frontline staff and ensure that customer service managers have a constant presence in store. Tied to this is driving accountability across roles. ALSO READ: Pick n Pay takes another thumping from Checkers Summers says Pick n Pay has already seen a turnaround, but that it remains early days. What he and the executive team are looking for is “significant, consistent and sustainable change”. In the first 12 weeks of this financial year – from March onwards – like-for-like sales at Pick n Pay stores are up (overall, there has been a slight decline due to store closures). It describes this as a “material improvement” versus the drop in the same period last year. This turnaround will take three years, by which time Summers will depart, and a clear succession path is in place for the group’s leadership. In this financial year, it still sees the group burning R1 billion in cash (after capex), less than half the R2.4 billion rate from last year. ALSO READ: Pick n Pay reports substantial losses, declares no dividend In FY26, it is targeting breakeven on a cash flow basis (after costs related to capex and the restructuring plan), while in the year to February 2027 it is targeting Pick n Pay to deliver a trading profit. Rights issue The rights issue and the IPO of Boxer will raise between R10 billion and R12 billion. After getting rid of its R6 billion in net debt and the R1 billion in cash it will need this year, it will spend the remainder on the restructuring plan and its PnP store estate. Summers describes the competitive landscape – with the formidable and arguably ‘unstoppable’ Checkers that has consistently been taking market share – as “fast evolving”. He stresses that PnP won’t be dragged into a race to see who can have the most stores. He says the group needs “profitable, meaningful stores” that serve communities in which they operate on a sustainable basis. Currently, some areas are “horribly over-traded”.

        "content": "New Delhi: Over the past year, India has found itself at the epicentre of Western allegations, coupled with old friend camaraderie with Pakistani generals accusing Indian officials of undermining the sovereignties of nations by purportedly engaging in the termination of terrorists in Canada, the US, and Pakistan. This intimidating interest in alleged Indian clandestine security operations, raises pivotal questions about the underlying motives and the broader global dynamics at play. Concurrently, it signals India's ascendance in the realm of global security as a revitalised and influential force, unsettling the traditional West-centric world order. In an era where the global threat landscape is increasingly complex, global and interconnected, India's extraordinary criminal justice measures to neutralise terrorists over the past decade - such as the September 29, 2016 surgical strike on terror launchpads across the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and the 2019 airstrike on the Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in Balakot, Pakistan - are particularly significant. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , these operations had shed the \"outdated and reluctant\" image of Indian security agencies of the past, showcasing new India's capability and resolve. The operations were conducted with a notable degree of professionalism, responsibility and transparency, as the Indian PM informed his Pakistani counterpart before disclosing them to the world. These actions not only announced Bharat's arrival as a formidable security force, but also challenged the traditional West-centric world order. Recent Western allegations, devoid of substantive evidence as seen in opinion-heavy reporting of 'The Guardian' claiming India's role in tens of terrorist terminations in Pakistan, a covert unseen Five Eyes network intelligence report regarding the killing of Canadian terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar and subsequent local vote-bank influence as evidenced in Canada, along with the case involving the alleged attempted assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the US-based face of the proscribed terrorist entity Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), appear to be part of a broader strategy aimed at exerting collective pressure and undermining India's assertive stance against terrorism. India which has long been a victim of cross-border terrorism orchestrated by Pakistan and its extensive global terror network, which includes Canadian and American terrorists. Canadian terrorists like Talwinder Singh Parmar of Babbar Khalsa masterminded the 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182, claiming 329 innocent lives. Similarly, American terrorists like David Coleman Headley and his Canadian accomplice Tahawwur Rana played pivotal roles in the dastardly 2008 Mumbai attacks by Lashkar-e-Taiba, resulting in 175 deaths and over 300 injuries. More recent attacks, such as the 2016 Uri assault by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed, which killed 19 Indian soldiers and injured 30, and the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing by Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which took the lives of over 40 Indian police personnel, underscore the persistent threat India faces. In this context, India's measures acknowledged criminal justice measures like those listed above to protect itself are not only moral and lawful but also a national security imperative. However, the coordinated Western and Pakistani allegations involving unravelings like Nijjar's assassination in Canada, an attempted assassination of Pannun, and tens of terrorist killings in Pakistan appear more fixed on challenging the newfound capabilities of India's security apparatus under Prime Minister Modi. This stance appears discordant with traditional security superpowers that often perceive national security as their exclusive domain. Most importantly, India's strategic partnerships with various nations, including those in the West, are built on mutual respect and shared interests. These alliances are grounded in a mutual commitment to promoting global stability, economic development, and security. However, for these relationships to thrive and be truly effective, they must be free from unwarranted accusations and intimidation that can undermine trust and cooperation. Unsubstantiated allegations and politicised narratives not only strain diplomatic ties but also detract from the collaborative efforts needed to combat terrorism effectively. By fostering an environment of mutual trust and respect, Western nations and India can work together to dismantle terrorist networks, prevent radicalisation and enhance global security. In conclusion, it is imperative that Western nations avoid actions that could be perceived as coercive or dismissive of India's security concerns. Instead, they should prioritize engagement that is based on equality, respect, and a shared commitment to eradicating terrorism. By doing so, they not only reinforce their alliances with India but also bolster the collective ability to address and overcome the multifaceted challenges posed by terrorism in the 21st century. It is time for the international community to support India's efforts to create a secure and stable world, acknowledging that a strong and secure Bharat is beneficial for global peace and prosperity.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 — Two Malaysian startups, Foqcus Sdn Bhd and Qarbotech Sdn Bhd, who represented Malaysia’s delegation at the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) Congress 2024 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), have clinched the second and third positions in the AIM Startup Pitch Competition, signalling global interest in their innovative vision and groundbreaking technologies. Focqus pitched its innovation for the Pre-Seed Stage while Qarbotech competed for the Seed Stage among other startups from key international markets including the US, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Uganda, India, and the UAE. Foqcus, a recipient of Cradle’s CIP Sprint grant programme, clinched second place and received USD10,000 for its future ventures. The startup specialises in product digital identification, traceability, and data intelligence through QR code, known as SmartKood. SmartKood provides highly integrable and customisable solutions spanning various sectors, including big data analytics and consumer engagement activities. For the Seed stage category, Qarbotech, a Malaysia Venture Capital Management Berhad’s (MAVCAP) investee company, secured third place with USD5,000 at the competition after being selected by MAVCAP to participate in Malaysia’s delegation. Qarbotech specialises in developing biocompatible solutions designed to enhance the photosynthesis rate of leafy plants, accelerating crop cycles and fostering plant growth. Led by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (Mosti), alongside agencies under its purview including Cradle Fund Sdn Bhd (Cradle), Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology & Innovation (MRANTI), Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology (MIGHT), and MAVCAP, Malaysia’s delegation comprised nine (9) startups from diverse sectors. The startups are Aerodyne Ventures Sdn Bhd (DT3 - drone, data technology, and digital transformation), Umrahme (travel tech), Braintree Technologies Sdn Bhd (AI and robotics), Gobuilders Netsoft Sdn Bhd or GOLOG (logistics), MoneyMatch Sdn Bhd (FinTech), Sonicboom Sdn Bhd (FinTech), DF Automation & Robotics Automotive Sdn Bhd (IoT and robotics), Focqus (DataTech), and Qarbotech (AgTech). Norman Matthieu Vanhaecke, Group CEO of Cradle, expressed immense pride in Foqcus and Qarbotech, emphasising the boundless potential of Malaysian innovation and entrepreneurship: “We are proud of Foqcus and Qarbotech for their outstanding achievements at the AIM Congress 2024 as their triumphs reflect exceptional innovation, dedication, and Malaysia’s vibrant startup ecosystem on the global stage. With the right support and opportunities, we have no doubt that they will continue to push boundaries and shape the future of industries worldwide.” “I am honoured to stand alongside fellow entrepreneurs, who represent Malaysia globally. This victory serves as evidence not only of the exceptional talent and innovation within our country but also of the constant support we have received from the government. It is clear that this is precisely the vision our government had in mind - to showcase Malaysia’s local talent and homegrown innovation, making our nation proud on the world stage,” said Bryant Kooh, Founder of Foqcus. “Qarbotech is a testament to Malaysia’s innovative spirit and entrepreneurial culture as we focus on empowering smallholder farmers through our technological solutions. Participating in the AIM Startup Pitch Competition with other Malaysian startups is a significant milestone for us as it was an opportunity to showcase our locally developed technology to a global audience. We believe that our technology has the potential to make a meaningful impact globally, and we are excited to share it with the world,” said Chor Chee Hoe, CEO of Qarbotech. In addition to the pitching competitions, two startups funded by Cradle, MoneyMatch and GOLOG, formed collaborations with UAE-based companies as part of their business missions to AIM Congress 2024. MoneyMatch, one of Cradle’s CIP300 recipients and Cradle Seed Ventures’ Investee, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Trade Foresight to explore the integration of cross-border payment solutions through a pilot test, engaging Trade Foresight’s clientele to facilitate transactions with anticipated monthly transaction volumes ranging from RM10 million to RM15 million. Meanwhile, GOLOG, which is also one of Cradle’s CIP300 recipients, signed an MoU with Royal Eficaz General Trading LLC of the UAE to attract and secure substantial investments with a target of USD150 million. Mosti’s delegation, led by YBhg. Datuk Ts. Dr. Mohd Nor Azman Hassan, Deputy Secretary-General (Technology Development) of Mosti, also featured YBrs. Ts. Dr. Raslan Ahmad, Senior Vice President of MIGHT, who presented a session titled “Designing the Future of Cities: Innovation, Sustainability, and Community Engagement”, where he shared insights on urban planning challenges as well as the pivotal role of MIGHT and the Malaysia Smart Cities Alliance (MSCA) in advancing the field of smart cities.

        "content": "Most Manchester United fans favour the club keeping Erik ten Hag as manager, according to a new poll, as the Dutchman awaits his fate amid talks over his future. Ten Hag’s position appears to still be uncertain despite leading the Old Trafford club to FA Cup triumph at Wembley on Saturday to secure a Europa League spot next season. The former Ajax boss had endured a difficult campaign in the Premier League, though, guiding Manchester United to an eighth-placed finish. Speculation that the club may move on from Ten Hag intensified ahead of the cup final after a report claimed that he would be sacked regardless of the result. But polling from the Manchester Evening News suggests that he retains the support of the club’s fans, with 78 per cent of 10,000 respondents indicating that they would like him to stay. Only 39 per cent had wanted Ten Hag to remain in charge into the final year of a three-year contract when asked after the 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace earlier this month. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co-chairman Joel Glazer are leading a review of the club’s season with assistance from Sir Dave Brailsford, director of sport at Ineos , and Jason Wilcox, recently installed as technical director. Representatives of United have already spoken to the camps of Mauricio Pochettino , Thomas Tuchel , Kieran McKenna and Thomas Frank to prepare for the event that Ten Hag is sacked.",

        "description": "Canadian immigration authorities received 2,000 work permit applications in first four months of this year, down from over 4,200 logged for same period in 2023.",
        "content": "The number of Hongkongers applying for work permits under a bespoke Canadian migration pathway over a four-month period has dropped more than 50 per cent from a year ago, with an expert partly attributing the fall to the country’s gloomy job market. Canadian immigration figures from Tuesday also showed that 60 per cent of those applying for permanent residency (PR) under the pathway’s work and study routes were still waiting on approval as of April. The country rolled out the policy in 2021 in the wake of the Beijing-imposed national security law, with those holding an open work permit able to qualify for PR status if they work full-time for at least a year or chalk up 1,560 hours of employment. The documents allow graduates to apply without first securing a job, while their spouses and dependents can also move to Canada. The data showed immigration authorities received about 2,000 applications for work permits in the first four months of this year, down from the more than 4,200 logged over the same period in 2023. Authorities have received a total of 45,146 such applications as of April this year. Willis Fu Yiu-wai, a senior immigration consultant at Goldmax Associates, partly attributed the drop in work permit applications to Canada’s gloomy job market. “Recently, a job fair in Canada attracted lots of people to line up, with people having to wait for a ticket to enter,” he said. “Some of those with tickets could not even get in before the end of the fair.” Tuesday’s figures from the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada that showed 60 per cent of the total 18,983 applications for PR status from Hongkongers on work and study routes, or 13,387, had become stuck in the bureaucratic pipeline as of April. Some of the country’s politicians had expressed concerns that earlier the prolonged processing period for PR applications had left Hongkongers facing looming uncertainties about their work and study statuses expiring. Such concerns prompted Canada to launch a three-year special work permit on Monday that allows Hongkongers waiting on a decision for their PR cases to extend their temporary status in the country. Fu of Goldmax Associates said he believed those determined to secure PR status under the pathway had already applied, given finding a job in the country, application processing and relocating to the country could take a “very long time”. He also expected the number of PR pathway applicants would continue to decline ahead of the policy’s deadline on August 2026. “Many who decided to leave the city might have left already,” he said. “It is also not easy to find a job in Canada and they need to reserve ample time to fulfil the work requirement.”",

For the past seven years, Rockets Bryanston has offered exclusive areas tailored to discerning guests. From intimate private dining rooms ideal for small gatherings to a champagne bar and cognac lounge, there’s no shortage of opulent spaces to explore.

This gap refers to the disparity between the demand for skilled IT professionals and the supply of qualified talent available in the job market. It’s a pressing issue that affects organisations of all sizes and industries. So, how can businesses overcome this hurdle and ensure they have the expertise needed to thrive in the digital age? The answer lies in outsourcing IT support services. The Challenges of Hiring In-House IT Talent Hiring and retaining qualified IT professionals can be a daunting task for businesses. The competition for top talent is fierce, and recruiting efforts often fall short due to the specialised nature of IT roles. Moreover, once hired, IT staff turnover rates can be high, leading to disruptions in operations and increased recruitment costs. Additionally, the investment required to train and upskill in-house IT teams can be substantial, further straining budgets and resources. How Outsourcing Addresses the Skills Gap Outsourcing IT support services offers a solution to the challenges posed by the skills gap. By partnering with a reputable IT service provider, businesses gain access to a pool of specialised expertise tailored to their specific needs. You can view the top 3 IT consulting firms here. Whether it’s cybersecurity, cloud computing, or software development, outsourcing allows organisations to tap into a vast network of skilled professionals without the overhead costs associated with in-house hiring. Best Practices for Outsourcing IT Support When considering outsourcing IT support, it’s essential to follow best practices to ensure a successful partnership. Start by thoroughly researching potential service providers to find one that aligns with your business objectives and values. Once you’ve chosen a partner, establish clear communication channels and expectations to facilitate collaboration and transparency. Regularly monitor performance metrics and maintain accountability to ensure the outsourced services meet your needs and standards. Addressing Concerns and Risks While outsourcing IT support offers numerous benefits, it’s natural for businesses to have concerns about security, confidentiality, and reliability. However, these concerns can be mitigated by implementing robust security measures, such as encryption protocols and access controls, and by carefully vetting potential service providers to ensure they adhere to industry standards and regulations. Additionally, developing contingency plans for potential disruptions in outsourced services can help minimise risks and ensure business continuity. Elements You Want from a Managed IT Service Provider Are you trying to choose a managed IT service provider? This is a huge step for your business and one that can be very valuable.

Let’s take a look at what they are. 24/7 Help You never know when you’re going to run into a technology issue. But, what you do know is that it can cause havoc for your team. So, you need to ensure that the managed IT service provider will give you the support you require when you need it. Make sure you get 24/7 help from the team. Then, you know that no matter when the issue arises, it will get dealt with immediately. Affordable Prices One of the reasons why you’re looking for a managed IT service provider is that you want to run your business efficiently. You recognise the power of outsourcing and want to use it to your advantage. Well, this means that you need to find a provider that’s willing to give you an affordable price. There are some providers out there that are changing a fortune for simple services. You need to sniff out the affordable ones that don’t compromise the service they give you. Use a discovery call to discover whether they have cost-effective prices. Around-the-clock Help IT issues can happen at any time.

        "content": "The Junior Springboks’ fixtures and kick-off times for the World Rugby U20 Championship have been confirmed. The ‘Baby Boks’ are in Pool C with England, Argentina and Fiji; Pool A consists of France, Wales, New Zealand and Spain; and Ireland, runners up in 2023, Australia, Georgia and Italy are in Pool B. Bafana Nhleko’s sides fixtures are as follows: Saturday 29 June v Fiji at 7pm at Cape Town Stadium Thursday 4 July v Argentina at 7pm at Danie Craven Stadium, Stellenbosch Tuesday 9 July v England at 7pm at Athlone Stadium, Cape Town Twelve of the best U20 teams in the world will take part at the “World Cup” for juniors between 29 June and 19 July in and around Cape Town. The Junior Boks won the bronze medal at the 2023 tournament, with France the winners. SA Rugby CEO Rian Oberholzer said: “Last year’s tournament was an unforgettable experience and we’re expecting more of the same this year. With the recent U20 Rugby Championship, we saw how closely matched the four Sanzaar teams were, and it was the same in the U20 Six Nations, where England emerged victorious. “To host the next generation of superstars next month is a great privilege and we can’t wait to welcome their families, friends and fans to South Africa. “The World Rugby U20 Championship plays an important role in the global rugby picture and is key in promoting and growing the game, while we are also excited to unearth the next generation of Springboks.” The World Rugby U20 Championship 2024 will be the first international competition to feature the three new law amendments implemented to promote ball in flow and diversity of attacking options, while supporting player welfare. These are that players will no longer be put onside when an opponent catches the ball from a kick in open play and runs five metres, players must make an attempt to retreat; scrums will no longer be an option from free kicks; and the banning of the crocodile roll. A package of six law trials will also operate, including the simplified red card sanction process, approved by the World Rugby Executive Board.

        "content": "Guwahati: Torrrential rain brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's remote northeastern state of Mizoram, killing at least 10 people, while harsh weather hampers efforts to rescue those trapped, authorities said on Tuesday. Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, killing at least 16 and cutting power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Bitter weather was holding up rescue efforts in Melthum, the site of the quarry outside the state capital of Aizawl, a state disaster management official said. \"There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse,\" the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. There were no immediate details of the number trapped. The heavy rain in Mizoram, which borders Bangladesh, also unleashed landslides in the region. Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity lines in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees. It is the first of the frequent storms expected to pound the low-lying coasts of the South Asian neighbours this year as climate change drives up surface temperatures at sea.",

        "content": "Is Becky Lynch Wrapping up Her WWE Career? By , one of the greatest women’s wrestlers in WWE, appears to be wrapping up her career with the company on RAW. Lynch has been the face of the women’s division for more than half a decade. And now she faces major developments regarding her future in WWE. A few months ago, reports indicated that Becky Lynch’s contract with WWE would expire in June. However, prior to the latest edition of WWE RAW, emerged that Lynch and WWE had still not reached terms on a new contract. Both sides have been in contact, but as of now, nothing has been signed. On the latest edition of WWE RAW, Becky Lynch competed in a Women’s World Championship match. Lynch challenged Liv Morgan in a steel cage match for the title Morgan had won from her just two days prior at King and Queen of the Ring. However, reports have surfaced regarding an intriguing situation surrounding the match, which will potentially impact Becky Lynch’s future with WWE. According to , Becky Lynch’s Women’s World title match wasn’t the only element of concern. Lynch’s contract, set to expire in four days on June 1, means that if they don’t reach an agreement by then, Lynch will become a free agent. On WWE RAW, Becky Lynch lost her match against . With her loss of the title and the lack of contract renewal with WWE, it will be interesting to see what unfolds next in the situation. However, it’s also important to note that she was originally set to take a break following WrestleMania 40 due to Rhea Ripley’s injury, but Lynch returned to the screens nonetheless. Tonight is Becky Lynch’s final match on her current WWE contract. Her contract expires this Saturday June 1st. ( ) Becky Lynch teases retirement on WWE RAW During her WWE contract situation, Becky Lynch hinted at retiring on RAW. In a backstage segment with Lyra Valkyria, Becky Lynch was giving her a pep talk. Lynch mentioned that it is not always about winning; rather, it is about continually improving. Lynch then stated that one should keep winning and learning until it’s time to walk away. Becky Lynch to Lyra Valkyria: \"So Saturday didn't go our way, but it's not about winning all the time. It's about getting better every time. So we'll either win or we'll learn, we'll keep winning or keep learning. Until it's time to walk away. You got this. Consider kneepads.\"... This intriguing statement from Lynch raises the question of whether she is contemplating retirement plans or simply playing with the fans regarding her contract situation. As a devoted professional wrestling fan and writer, the sport is a vital source of joy and escape for me. Wrestling has been a consistent pillar of stability and comfort, shaping the person I am today. Growing up, it played a significant role in my life, with John Cena being a superhero figure for me.

        "description": "It is Glasgow’s only remaining castle, and as one of Scotland’s oldest buildings has a fascinating history taking in romantic royal liaisons, warring dynasties and a place in the national defence during World War II.",
        "content": "Crookston Castle may now be overshadowed by the more famous fortress in Edinburgh, but in its day it was a major draw for thousands of tourists. And as Glasgow gears up to celebrate the 850th anniversary of the city’s founding next year, friends of Crookston Castle are calling for it to be given a central role. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to GlasgowWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. The hidden gem dates back to the 12th century and is the second oldest building in the city. A 12-month programme of events to mark the occasion will be created and David McDonald, former depute leader of Glasgow City Council and interim chairperson for the Friends of Crookston Castle is hopeful the castle will feature in the programme. Speaking exclusively to the local democracy reporting service (LDRS), he said: “We would like to be involved in the council’s 850th celebration of Glasgow as a city. “This is the perfect place to launch the celebrations and it would bring more people to the castle.” Advertisement Advertisement On a recent tour, on a suitably atmospheric, misty day, the group were happy to share just some of its fascinating history. In the 1160’s Robert Croc, a vassal of Walter the High Steward was granted an estate namely Croc’s toun. And in 1180, the then Sir Robert Croc was granted permission from Paisley Abbey to build a private chapel “as a special friend of the house”. In 1330, the lands were sold to Sir Alan Stewart, cousin to the first Stewart monarch Robert II and the Tower House we recognise today was built. Under the ownership of the Stewarts, who have been described as one of the most enduring and turbulent royal dynasties in Scottish history, the earlier castle was replaced by the present stone castle in around 1400. Advertisement Advertisement In 1361 the castle passed to John Stewart of Darnley, a cousin of King James I. He served as the Constable of the Scottish Army in France, supporting Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years War. He died on the battlefield in1429 and is buried at the Cathedral in Orléans In 1572, Crookston was passed to Darnley’s younger brother, Charles, the Earl of Lennox. Charles was regent for his young nephew, King James VI and maintained Crookston’s royal connections. The Stewart’s ownership of the castle came to an end in 1703 when Charles 1st Duke of Lennox sold it to the Duke of Montrose.Crookston was sold again in 1757 by the 2nd Duke of Montrose to the Maxwells of Pollok. Advertisement Advertisement John, the latest Baronet of Pollok was the first of the Maxwells to own the castle and is also credited with the building of nearby Pollok House. But Crookston then suffered from many years of neglect. In 1817 Sir Walter Scott published his novel The Abbot. His story cemented the idea of Mary Queen of Scots and Lord Henry Darnley’s courtship at the castle in the 16th century and increased its fame as an iconic and romantic location. Legend has it that Mary had a romantic rendezvous with her future husband beneath the shade of the yew tree. In 1847, under the ownership of the 8th Baronet, Crookston underwent refurbishment to mark the royal visit by Queen Victoria to Glasgow. Advertisement Advertisement During this time the legendary Crookston yew tree, which had been stripped bare by relic hunters seeking a souvenir, was felled. In the early 1900’s the Stirling Maxwell family opened the castle to day-trippers for the first time with 6500 paying visitors recorded in 1910. But at the outbreak of WWII the castle was on a war footing for the first time in hundreds of years. The tower was used by the Home Guard as an aircraft observation post during the blitz and an army camp was set up in the woodlands nearby. After the war saw the resumption of building across the community, with new homes and schools being built through the 1950’s and 60’s including the new Crookston Castle Secondary School, now the site of Crookston Castle Primary School. Advertisement Advertisement Today the castle stands as a highly visible reminder of the past and the friends of group are focused on the future and working to celebrate the only mediaeval castle in Glasgow. Speaking about the importance of the castle and its history Mr McDonald added: “I think the phrase hidden gem is used quite a lot but this is off the tourist track as well as for the residents. “We want to encourage people to come to the castle to learn more about its history. We want families from across the city including those struggling with the cost of living crisis to come and visit as this is a free day out. “There is easy access to the castle which is not too far from other places like Pollok Park which means there is enough in the area for families to make a day of it.” Advertisement Advertisement Brian Gerrand, from Crookston, added: “This project shows just how important these areas are, especially when a couple of years ago we weren’t allowed to leave our homes because of Covid 19. “Crookston Castle has a complex history and it is good to get people engaged with it.” To join the friends of group or for more information email [email protected]",

Speaking an hour before his cabinet meets on Tuesday to formally recognise Palestine – a decision that has infuriated Israel and triggered a diplomatic crisis between the two countries – Pedro Sánchez said the decision was based on justice and international law. He said: At the meeting of the council of ministers that will be held today, the government will approve the official recognition of Palestine as a state. With this decision, Spain joins the more than 140 countries that already recognise Palestine. This is a historic decision that has a single goal: to contribute to achieving peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The recognition of the state of Palestine is not only a matter of historical justice with the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people; it is also an imperative need to achieve peace. It is the only way to recognise the solution that we all recognise as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace – that of a Palestinian state that coexists alongside the state of Israel in peace and security . The state of Palestine must be viable with the West Bank and Gaza connected by a corridor and with East Jerusalem as its capital and it must be unified under the legitimate government of the Palestinian national authority.” Sánchez said that while it was not up to Spain to define another country’s borders, its position was aligned with those of the UN security council and the EU: “Therefore we won’t recognise change in the 1967 lines other than those agreed to by the parties.” The prime minister also stressed that “the recognition of Palestine isn’t against anyone – least of all Israel, a friendly nation that Spain values and holds in high regard and with whom we aim to foster the strongest possible relationship”. He said the decision reflected Spain’s “absolute rejection” of Hamas , which opposes the two-state solution. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of 7 October ,” he said. “This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism.” Sánchez said Spain would do all in its power to make the two-state solution a reality, and renewed his calls for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza , for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza, and for all the Israeli hostages to be released. He also said Spain would work to bring about an international peace conference on the two-state solution. “The decision that Spain is solemnly adopting today is based on the respect for international law and the defence of the rules-based international order,” he said. “These are the principles that guide us always, no matter the context – both in Gaza/Palestine and in Ukraine. Spain will always defend the proposal and principles established in the UN charter.” Share 2h ago 08.21 BST Welcome and opening summary The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez , has said his cabinet will recognise a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. While dozens of countries have recognised a Palestinian state, none of the major western powers has done so. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” said Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister’s palace in Madrid, during a televised speech. The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile Canada is the latest country to react to the airstrikes on Rafah, saying it is horrified by the civilian deaths. At least 45 people were been killed after the Israeli strike caused a huge blaze at a tented area for displaced people in Rafah, according to medics. Canada’s Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a statement: We are horrified by strikes that killed Palestinian civilians in Rafah. Joly added that Canada does not support the Israeli military operation in Rafah: This level of human suffering must come to an end. We demand an immediate ceasefire. They are comments that have been echoed by other global leaders who have urged the implementation of an international court of justice order to halt Israel’s assault . The United States said on Monday that Israel must make every possible effort to avoid civilian casualties after the deadly strike in Rafah. A US national security council spokesperson said in a statement: As we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians ... We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened. But the NSC spokesperson also said that “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” before imploring more caution. The Israeli military said it had launched a probe into the strike which it said was carried out based on “precise intelligence information”. It launched the attack on Rafah hours after Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets towards the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. In other developments: Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting in Gaza despite widespread anger over Sunday’s strike in Rafah. At least 45 people were killed after an Israeli airstrike that caused a huge blaze at a tented area for displaced people in Rafah, medics have said. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said about half of the dead were women, children and older adults. The Israeli strike, one of the deadliest single incidents in the eight-month war to date, came two days after the international court of justice’s ruling ordering Israel to stop its operation in Rafah immediately. Netanyahu described the airstrike as a “tragic mishap” and said the incident occurred “despite our best efforts not to hurt them” . Israel’s top military prosecutor described the airstrike as “very grave” and said an investigation was under way. The Israeli military said its air force struck a Hamas compound and that the attack was carried out with “precise ammunition and on the basis of precise intelligence”. Hundreds of people gathered in Israeli cities on Monday after the Rafah attack to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Images of charred and dismembered children in Rafah after the Israeli strike have caused an outcry from global leaders and put ceasefire talks in jeopardy. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages, said the Rafah casualties would complicate the protracted negotiations. Israeli media reported that Hamas had decided to pull out of the latest proposed talks over what its senior leadership described as a massacre. The UN security council is set to convene an emergency meeting Tuesday over the Rafah strike . Diplomats said the council would convene for an emergency session called by Algeria to discuss the attack. Spain, Ireland and Norway will formally recognise a Palestinian state Tuesday . Israel has described the decision as a “reward” for Hamas more than seven months into the devastating Gaza war. The three European countries believe their initiative has strong symbolic impact, which could encourage others to follow suit, reports AFP. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he is “outraged” by the Israeli airstrike on Rafah. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian citizens. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he posted to X on Monday. Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, said Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel’s war. Desperately needed aid deliveries to Gaza have ground to a halt, as the Rafah border crossing, and the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing are in effect blocked by the fierce fighting. About 200 aid trucks were supposed to enter Gaza through Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing on Sunday after an agreement was reached with Egypt, but UN and Palestinian officials said on Monday that no aid supplies have been distributed. An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby , local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil, reports Associated Press. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” Egypt’s military says a border guard was killed in a shooting in the Rafah border area with Gaza on Monday, where Israeli forces are deployed, adding that a probe had been launched. “The Egyptian armed forces, through the competent authorities, are investigating a shooting incident in the Rafah border area which led to the martyrdom of a guard,” a military statement said. The Israeli military reported a “shooting incident” on the Egyptian border and said it was discussing the incident with Egypt, reports Agence France-Presse.

        "content": "Leaders of South Korea, Japan, and China reaffirmed their commitment to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula during their summit in Seoul on Monday, hours after North Korea announced a satellite launch plan. President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and Chinese Premier Li Qiang reached the agreement after North Korea notified Japan of its plan to launch a space rocket carrying a military spy satellite sometime before June 4, Yonhap news agency reported. “We reaffirmed that maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia serves our common interest and is our common responsibility,” a joint declaration of the trilateral summit said. “We reiterated positions on regional peace and stability, denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, and the abduction issue, respectively. We agree to continue to make positive efforts for the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue,” it added. During a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida emphasised the importance of denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula. However, Li did not address denuclearisation directly, instead urging relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent further escalation. This contrasts with the 2019 trilateral summit, where China also expressed support for efforts toward denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. During the session, Yoon and Kishida denounced North Korea’s satellite launch plan as a violation of the UN Security Council resolutions that ban its use of ballistic missile technology. Pyongyang said it will send three more satellites into space this year, following its first launch in November. “The international community must respond firmly,” Yoon said during a joint press briefing at the former President Cheong Wa Dae. Kishida echoed his concerns, urging Pyongyang to cease its activities. “If it proceeds, it will be a violation of UN Security Council resolutions. We strongly urge North Korea to cease this activity,” Kishida said. China’s Li called on all related countries to exercise restraint without a direct mention of North Korea. “China has consistently worked to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and is pushing for a political resolution to the peninsula issue. Relevant parties should exercise restraint and prevent the situation from worsening and becoming more complicated,” Li said during the briefing. Li, China’s No. 2 official, also called for joint efforts to foster cooperation through “mutual respect and trust”. “Korea, Japan, and should properly handle sensitive issues and conflicts, consider each other’s core interests and significant concerns, and practice genuine multilateralism to jointly safeguard stability in the Northeast Asian region,” Li said. The trilateral session discussed ways to promote cooperation in six specific areas — economy and trade, sustainable development, health issues, science and technology, disaster and safety management, and people-to-people exchanges. The leaders also agreed to institutionalise the trilateral cooperation by holding the trilateral summit and ministerial meetings regularly. Monday’s session was the first three-way meeting since December 2019 after it was suspended for a prolonged period due to Covid-19 and historical disputes among the Asian neighbours. After the meeting, they attended a trilateral business summit at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, engaging with business leaders of the three nations. During the summit, the leaders pledged to work together to promote cooperation in trade and investment, as well as supply chain resilience and export controls. “We will continue to work to ensure a global level playing field to foster a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, inclusive, and predictable trade and investment environment,” the joint declaration said.

        "content": "Richard Madeley and Nigel Farage clash in fiery debate on GMB as ex-UKIP leader faces backlash for claiming 'growing number' of young Muslims do not subscribe to British values By Rory Tingle, Home Affairs Correspondent For Mailonline Published: 09:32 BST, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 10:02 BST, 28 May 2024 e-mail 57 View comments Nigel Farage clashed with Richard Madeley today as the Good Morning Britain host challenged his controversial comments on Muslims by asking, 'What on earth were you talking about?' The Reform UK honorary president provoked a backlash on Sunday when he warned of the 'growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values' and 'loathe much of what we stand for'. He later clarified he was talking about Muslims. Mr Madeley challenged the former UKIP leader on his comments this morning by quoting the findings of a major review of the existing polling carried out in 2018 by IPSOS Mori. 'They found absolutely conclusively that Muslims in the UK attach more importance on being British than the general population,' he said. '85% feel they truly belong to Britain, 55% feel that their national identity as British is very important to them and that compares to 44% of the general population. So I'm bound to ask, what on earth were you talking about there?' Nigel Farage was challenged today on Good Morning Britain for his comments about Muslims Richard Madeley quoted a major review of the existing polling carried out in 2018 by IPSOS Mori which found 85% of British Muslims feel they truly belong to Britain In response, Mr Farage said he wanted to provide 'context' about what he said on Sunday in an interview with Trevor Phillips on Sky News . He said: 'What I said is that a growing number of young people do not subscribe to British values. In fact, despise them in many ways. 'And all of your viewers would have seen the local elections where in parts of our inner cities we saw sectarian politics - people voting purely on religious lines, councillors getting elected and screaming Allahu Akbar...' Read More Tory minister Steve Baker slams 'ignorant and offensive' Nigel Farage for claiming young British Muslims 'loathe much of what we stand for' as he accuses ex-UKIP leader of 'clear and intolerable bigotry' He then quoted recent polling by JL Partners commissioned by the Henry Jackson Society. 'It showed that 23% of 18 to 24-year-old of young Muslims living in Britain think that jihad is a good thing,' Mr Farage said. 'Now that of course is not a British value in any way at all and its a very disturbing trend that's particularly prevalent among the young.' Mr Madeley replied: 'The poll that you just quoted from has been very heavily criticised as self-selecting - people were basically drawn in through a series of clicks and by the time they were asked to register their opinion they had already made their minds up. 'You also said in the interview that you could take someone to a particular street in Oldham and there would be nobody there who speaks English. 'Well again that's just not true - the Office of National Statistics say that only 0.7% of people in Oldham don't speak English - that's less than one in a hundred.' Mr Farage said it was possible to 'argue about numbers and statistics' but it was 'undoubtedly true' that there is an increasing number of young people in Britain who ' don't only not subscribe to our values - they openly support Hamas'. Mr Farage (pictured on Sunday) has decided not to stand in the general election for his Reform party Steve Baker became the latest Tory minister to challenge Mr Farage's comments as 'ignorant and offensive'. Mr Baker said in an social media post this morning: 'It is not right that good British people should be slandered like this and I will defend them.' The Wycombe MP praised the contribution of British Muslims in his Buckinghamshire constituency, where he is seeking to defend a 4,000-vote majority at the general election.

'They are teachers and headteachers, doctors and pillars of our society. These are my colleagues, friends and supporters and I am glad. 'They deserve much better than to be the object of this clear and intolerable bigotry. This is why I have always fought Islamophobia and why I will continue to do so, supporting the creation of a practical definition.' Mr Farage, who has decided not to stand in the general election for his Reform party, mentioned Muslims while commenting on Rishi Sunak's plans to revive national service for 18-year-old's, which he called 'a joke'. Mr Farage added: 'It's totally impractical. The Army has shrunk from 100,000 to 75,000 in 14 years of conservatism. 'And most interestingly, we have a growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values. In fact, loathe much of what we stand for.' Challenged over who he was referring to, Mr Farage replied: 'Oh, I think we see them on the streets of London every Saturday.' Pressed on whether he was referring to Muslims, he added: 'We are.'

'The vast proportion of British Muslims are wonderful, peace-loving, community-minded people, certainly in the North East where I'm based, we have fantastic communities and they are a really important part of our social fabric,' Ms Trevelyan told the radio station. 'There are a very small proportion for whom they want to challenge those values that we hold dear in the UK, which are British values, and there we need to continue to work in community to bring those people to this. 'The UK has incredible values of freedom of speech, freedom of choice... these are incredibly important values, but they have to be nurtured and looked after , and where there are those who would threaten them we need to make sure that we deal with that.' She said it was not a problem specific to any religion, adding: 'There are people who do not wish to stand alongside the values and laws that we have, and we continue to have to defend those.'

        "content": "Nearly half of women in the Netherlands experience sexual harassment at work, according to a study by the trade union CNV among 3,000 workers. “This shows that despite the widespread attention to this theme in the media and all kinds of government programs, it is still a widespread problem in the workplace,” CNV chairman Piet Fortuin told the . The survey showed that 42 percent of women have been sexually harassed at work at least once. They report things like sexually suggestive comments, catcalling, and unwanted sexual pictures. 17 percent of men reported experiencing sexual harassment at work. CNV found that sexual harassment is much more common in small companies with fewer than ten employees. Employees of SMEs are more likely to be sexually harassed by their boss and least likely to know where to report it. According to Fortuin, this is because small companies often don’t have a protocol in place to deal with this problem. “Moreover, in small companies, there is often an old-boy atmosphere. Like: we’re having a good time together, you shouldn’t complain like that, it’s just a joke. Victims more often feel trapped in these companies,” Fortuin said. Although employers are required by law to have a policy to combat sexual harassment, half of organizations don’t have one, according to CNV. “The smaller the company, the less protocol or policy there is,” Fortuin said. “Developing policy demonstrably works. Larger organizations usually have this and are less likely to experience sexual harassment. For this reason, all organizations must quickly develop a protocol or policy. No matter how small they are.”",

The demonstration started on Monday evening at the American consulate on Museumplein. The group eventually moved toward Dam Square, where about 100 protesters held a pro-Israel demonstration organized by the Christian party SGP. The police surrounded part of the group of pro-Palestinian protesters on the corner of Kalverstraat and Dam Square and arrested them for disrupting public order. The police put them on a GVB bus to transport them away. Several dozen other pro-Palestine demonstrators on the other side of the police action tried to stop the bus from leaving, a police spokesperson told . “Bicycles were pulled from racks and thrown in front of the bus.” The riot police intervened, also striking the protesters. According to the police, protesters also attacked the police on the bus on the way to the cell complex. “Officers were kicked, scratched, and insulted.” The riot police also ended a pro-Palestinian rally at Radboud University in Nijmegen. A group of around 50 students occupied a building on campus, demanding that the university break its ties with Israel. After the university asked the protesters to leave, the riot police broke through the barricades and took the protesters outside one by one. The evacuation was completed at around 12:30 a.m. with no arrests, Omroep Gelderland .",

        "content": "Nowadays, we are constantly striving to stay connected and in touch with our family, friends, and relatives. Social networking sites help us to know the latest celebrity news, while messengers tell us about international news and help us to communicate with our relatives. Many applications are trying to improve and add new features, including messengers. For example, the messenger telegram created a premium subscription through which users were able to access more features. But not all users have the desire to purchase paid subscriptions. And also, not all users are fully satisfied with the premium subscription features offered. So what to do in this case? Of course, try using client apps. Today, we will tell you about seven telegram client apps with new features inside. Client applications are applications that are very similar to the main versions of applications. However, they add additional features that are often not present in the main applications. Such applications are available for installation on different operating systems, even on laptops. Such applications also have quite unusual features that help to diversify communication and simplify the process of listening to music or reading news. This is one of the best client apps. The app has unblocked chats, to learn how to use this feature, go to Nicegram Unblock Guide . Apart from unblocked chats, in the app you will be able to instantly translate messages right in the chat correspondence. Forward messages without attribution, view messages without a read mark, add tabs and folders, create up to seven accounts at a time. Also, inside you’ll find features to expand the app’s memory, view a user’s profile registration date, and a double-bottom feature to hide your accounts. Nicegram also includes artificial intelligence that allows you to correspond with your friends and prompt quick replies to messages in the form of phrases or pictures. This app helps you manage your messenger content and also organize your content exploration. Vidogram is aimed at those who like to use Telegram for entertainment. In the app you will find a built-in IPTV feature with which you can watch TV inside the messenger, the ability to listen to music from all the channels you are subscribed to. Also, within the app itself, you can play video games and create playlists of tracks you love. For correspondence, you can create folders with news feeds, send message confirmation requests, convert voice messages to text messages right in the chat and create hidden chats with a password to enter. iMe Messenger looks similar to the official Telegram app. The app also includes interesting features, such as conducting cryptocurrency transactions to buy and exchange currencies. In iMe Messenger you can take advantage of the following features: flexible customization of the application design, sorting chats by topic, adding music and saving your favorite tracks, translating a message from a foreign language right in the correspondence. There is also a bot in the app that is connected to artificial intelligence. This bot can generate automatic replies to messages. Some apps specialize in quite unusual features, such as security features. The Graph Messenger app is known for its privacy and data protection features. In the app you can get the ability to hide chats and channels, open these chats only after entering a password, create 100 active accounts simultaneously, change your voice when sending voice messages, edit images directly in the chat. For communication, the application includes the following features: download files from multiple sources simultaneously, the ability to create chats and collect them by category, chronological display of messages from channels, enable auto-replies for certain contacts right in the chat. The app also provides an alert that notifies you when a certain person comes online. In this client app, the user gets to use Telegram with constant re-release of the update and additional innovations included. This implies that your app will always remain up-to-date. This app does not have any unusual features, it is an improved version of the main Telegram app. In the app, you will find flexible app design customization features, clear and simple interface, fast app performance. This is an open-source app, so it’s secure and updated with the official Telegram. Unigram sticks to a minimalistic interface, so it won’t be difficult to master the new messenger. The app focuses on improving the messaging features. This app will be handy for those who use messenger specifically for communication, not wanting to be distracted by other features. Unigram supports multiple accounts, and each account has its own themes and settings. In this application, they did not change the interface design, but improved the application with additional features. If you are completely satisfied with the official Telegram, but you just lack a couple of features, then this app is for you. In TurboTel, the user can open chats in separate tabs, block and hide chats, and connect up to ten accounts. Also, with this app, you will be able to change your voice when sending voice messages and set the background for each individual chat. The app is interesting and minimalistic, so if you don’t want to buy the premium version of Telegram, you can use this app. To summarize, client apps are apps that are similar to the official versions of the main apps. However, these apps very often have more features and functions, unlike the official versions. With the help of such apps, you can enhance the functionality and simplify the use of messenger. Depending on the features you need, you can try out several apps to decide which suits you best. Before installing, make sure that the app is available on your operating system. Also, pay attention to the features that the messenger has so that you can be completely satisfied with your new app.",

        "content": "Tata Nexon EV: India’s best-selling electric SUV by far, the Tata Nexon EV, has democratized EVs in the country. Tata Nexon EV Pros & 2 Cons: India’s best-selling electric SUV by far, the Tata Nexon EV, has democratized EVs in the country. But should you buy one? Check out the top 5 pros and 2 cons of the Tata Nexon EV.\" Tata Nexon EV Top-5 Pros Exterior Design: It's a good-looking electric car. Tata Motors gave it a complete revamp of the exterior design with a facelift launch. The EV draws design inspiration from the Curvv concept, a forthcoming Tata SUV. The front is completely new and looks energetic, featuring an LED split-headlamp setup with DRLs on top and the main headlamp cluster lower down along with the sharper bumper carrying air curtain on the edges. At the back, an LED light bar merges into the new tail-lamps on either side, giving the fresh and new look to the revised tailgate, while the side profile is near-identical to the pre-facelift model, except the new set of alloys. Interior Design: Entering into the cabin of Nexon EV, your attention is immediately drawn to the two massive screens (instrument cluster & infotainment) and cool-looking steering. Both screens are high-resolution, offering a good touch response. The interior impresses with its quality, with textures, patterns, and colors. It sports a twin-spoke steering that features an illuminated logo in the centre. The gloss black elements used in the cabin look nice. Feature Loaded: It gets a 10.25-inch highly customizable digital instrument cluster letting you choose different layouts and a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Tata has equipped the Nexon EV with 9-speaker JBL sound system, cruise control, automatic AC, ventilated front seats, wireless phone charging, a sunroof, and what not. It also comes with V2V and V2L functionalities. It gets 6 airbags, ESC, hill hold and descent control, all-wheel disc brakes, auto-dimming IRVM, and a 360-degree camera while some of the features are reserved for higher variants only. Driving Range: It is offered with two battery pack options: 30 kWh and 40.5 kWh, delivering a claimed range of up to 325 km and 465 km, respectively. In the real world, the smaller battery pack can offer a range of approximately 270km, while the larger one can offer approximately 380km. Ride & Handling: It rides and handles in a more polished way while the ride is on the firmer side at slower speeds, making it feel tough and composed on rough terrains. The high-speed stability is good and the ride smoothens out as you go faster. Its a fun to drive electric car, and grips well around the corners. Tata Nexon EV Top-5 Cons Fit & Finish: Defiantly, the Tata motor has gone far improving the fit & finish of the Nexon EV but there are still some areas where it could have been improved particularly in the centre console around the middle armrest. DC Fast Charging Is Slow: The Tata Nexon EV Long Range model includes a 7.2kW AC charger and supports DC fast charging up to 30kW, which is relatively slow by today's EV standards.",

Murray, who signed for the Staggies in January 2023 and helped them through the play-off final against Partick Thistle last season, said: “I feel like I am in my prime. “My career has been a whirlwind and I have loved it all. I still feel hungry and, since Don Cowie has taken over, he’s given me that freedom and showed belief in me. “He knows what I’m like and he lets me do what I want to do. “I have loved this season. There have been ups and downs but we’ve had good results too, such as beating Rangers for the first time and against Hearts and Hibs. “We must build upon that. We don’t want to be in this position every year. “It’s good Ross County are still in the Premiership, but as a player we want more and hopefully we can get that. “As a squad, we were disappointed that we were down in the play-off again.” Murray started his senior career at Montrose and played Junior football with Tayport and Dundee Violet before resuming his senior career with Arbroath and a move to Dundee United saw him initially loaned back to the Gayfield Park club. The energetic attacker had a loan spell at Dundee during his time at Hibs and a move to South African club Bidvest Wits preceded his move to then League Two club Queen’s Park in September 2020. The County striker likes nothing more than to prove any sceptics wrong, saying: “In my whole career, with every club I’ve joined, I’ve had doubters, but I have always loved that because I like proving myself and working hard. “You always have people, no matter what sort of player you are, who don’t think you’re good enough. Some fans love you, some don’t. “But I’m the one on the training ground and I’ve always had the belief in myself. “When I was at Queen’s Park, Owen Coyle put the belief back into me. When I came to Ross County, I had that again. “I always had a point to prove and that gives you the hunger when you come into training every day.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "content": "Some 3,000 social welfare recipients have had their benefits cut so far this year, ministers will hear this Tuesday morning. People are now being warned that they will see their benefits reduced if they do not engage with unemployment services or make an effort to find a job. Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys will bring a memo to Government this Tuesday morning on the “Pathways to Work Strategy” which is focused on supporting those who are unemployed long-term to enter the workforce. She will say that the long-term unemployment rate in Ireland is now at 1.1% and her Department is focusing on getting persons who are Long Term Unemployed into the workforce through further education, training and work placement schemes. Read more: Social welfare payment dates to change due to June bank holiday Read more: Social welfare Ireland: New legislation to increase Jobseekers Benefit to €450 per week before Dail Some 50,000 people on the Live Register are being signed up for personal progression plans with the Department of Social Protection’s Intreo Service. They will be required to meet with advisors fortnightly. People who fail to engage or who are not making a genuine attempt to find a job will see their payments reduced. It is understood that while they will not be completely cut off, their payments will be cut on a phased basis. The Minister will inform Cabinet that already this year 3,000 people have had their social welfare payments reduced due to failure to engage with the Intreo service. Elsewhere, Justice Minister Helen McEntee will bring the yearly legislation renewing the Special Criminal Court for a further 12-month period. It is understood that the Minister will tell Cabinet that there remains a “real and persistent threat from terrorist activity”, including from so-called “dissident” republican paramilitary groups which remain active in the State. There is also a “substantial threat” from serious organised crime, particularly from criminal gangs – some with significant international links - who are engaged in the trafficking of drugs and firearms, as well as in other serious crimes and who are “prepared to commit murder.” Last June, an independent review group examining the Special Criminal Court published two reports. One report called for the retention of the non-jury court with some amendments, while two members called for its abolition in a minority report. It is understood both reports are still being considered and Minister McEntee will bring a “substantive response to the Review” to Cabinet “in due course”. “In the meantime, the need for the renewal of the existing provisions remains,” a Government source said on Monday evening. Tánaiste Micheál Martin will seek approval for the formal recognition by Ireland of the State of Palestine, as announced by the Government next week. Finance Minister Michael McGrath will ask the Government to approve the text of the Motor Insurance Insolvency Compensation Bill 2024. This will transpose EU law which makes changes to the level of motor insurance cover when driving across the EU. Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien will brief ministers on the Urban Regeneration and Development fund. Some 1,224 vacant/derelict properties have been approved under the scheme and the estimated residential yield from these properties is 5,406 homes. Integration Minister Roderic O'Gorman will update the Cabinet on the implementation of the Action Plan for Mother and Baby Home Survivor. More than 10,000 people have now received information through the Birth Information and Tracing Act. Payments have now begun to issue to survivors as part of the redress scheme.

        "content": "This news has been read 113 times! NEW DELHI, May 28: Passengers on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Varanasi were evacuated Tuesday morning following a bomb scare. The flight, carrying 176 passengers to the Hindu holy city in Uttar Pradesh, was halted just before takeoff after a pilot discovered a threatening note in the lavatory. The note, found at around 5:30 AM, read: “Bomb blast @ 30 minutes.” “There was news of a bomb on the flight going from Delhi to Varanasi at 5:35 AM today. Quick Response Teams arrived at the spot,” a Delhi fire services spokesperson told The New Indian Express. All passengers were safely deboarded through emergency exits, according to a Delhi airport spokesperson. “The flight is undergoing a detailed inspection,” the spokesperson added. “All passengers were evacuated through the emergency exits without incident.” Indigo stated that the aircraft was moved to an isolated area for a thorough search operation by security personnel. “The flight is currently undergoing inspection,” the airline confirmed. “Post completion of all security checks, the aircraft will be positioned back in the terminal area.” This is the second bomb scare incident this month. Earlier, a tissue paper with the word “bomb” was found in the lavatory of an Air India flight at Delhi airport, which also turned out to be a hoax. In recent weeks, several schools and hospitals in the national capital have received threatening emails about explosives on their premises, all of which have been false alarms according to investigators. In February last year, an Indian army personnel was booked for making a hoax bomb call to police after missing his second flight of the day. This news has been read 113 times!",

        "content": "EXCLUSIVE Eva Speakman admits she found This Morning TV gig difficult to deal with as she details lifetime of bullying By Rebecca Davison for MailOnline Published: 09:26, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 09:50, 28 May 2024 e-mail 7 View comments Eva Speakman has detailed the difficulties she faced at the hands of trolls when she and husband Nik became regular faces on This Morning. The pair, who are collectively known as The Speakmans, are life-change experts who help others with mental health problems, trauma and phobias. But speaking on the My Dirty Laundry podcast this week, Eva, 55, revealed she was attacked by cruel trolls when she appeared on the show. It was especially hurtful because Eva had suffered a lifetime of bullying before becoming a household name. She said: 'We have really had our fair share of trolling and at first, I'm not going to lie... particularly when we first started working in television, I found it quite difficult. Eva Speakman has admitted she found her This Morning TV gig difficult to deal with due to cruel trolls and has suffered from a lifetime of bullying - but husband Nik has helped her to overcome it, (stock image) Life-change experts Eva and Nik, 65, once cured former This Morning host Holly Willoughby of her fear of ghosts, as well as her fear of flying 'I was somebody that was bullied through my entire childhood, even up until I met Nik, actually. 'And so I'd gone from that and then Nik kind of came rescued me, helped me to build up my self-esteem again and self-belief. 'Then suddenly these strangers were saying really mean and horrible things. And so I did have to sit back a little bit and say, \"Does this really matter? Is this person's opinion really valid? What's my motive on being in the media?\" 'It's to help people. Am I doing that? Yes.' Eva said that with Nik's help, she quickly found a way to stop the trolling getting to her. She said: 'We just very quickly got into the habit of just blocking. And that would be what I would say to anybody. Don't even take the bait. Just block and just move on because they're not really very relevant people. 'Anybody who feels that it's appropriate to be unkind to anyone, quite honestly, isn't worth any time at all. So just block immediately.' Eva and Nik, 65, have previously used their expertise to cure former This Morning host Holly Willoughby of her fear of ghosts, as well as her fear of flying. Nik and Eva appear on the latest episode of the My Dirty Laundry podcast (pictured) They said: 'Holly was having to fly out the following week to help present I'm A Celeb so we were able to help her out with that which was nice. 'Her fear came from presenting a kids' TV show. She had to go up in a plane and the pilot who was with her - it was just a two seater - stalled the engine on purpose/ 'And she just thought the plane was going down. And then he just said, \"we do this, it's a test that we do\" and he restarted it, everything was OK. 'But in that moment and her not knowing, she just developed a fear of flying. And we worked with her for that.' The Speakmans said their treatment was so successful that Holly even sent them a picture of herself giving a thumbs up from her flight the week after they treated her. Nik and Eva met 33 years ago during a chance encounter. Eva's car had been stolen and Nik offered to help her out at a time when people didn't really own mobile phones. Eva said: 'Nik had one. It was huge. It was one of those briefcase ones, like Dom Joly had. 'When my car was stolen, I just wanted to use a telephone. So I went into this office to ask if I could use theirs. There was this dude there looking very smart in a suit with a permed mullet. Despite the fact that Nik was flying to America in a few hours and hadn't packed yet, he phoned the police for me and let my family know what had happened. Nik and Eva and their two children Olivia and Hunter have released a new podcast called Handbook To Happiness They said of the podcast: 'There's a lot of laughs. I think that's the lovely thing about a family dynamic that you can't get away with anything when your kids are there' 'He was just so lovely, When he came back from the States, I wanted to take him out for lunch to say thank you. 'I didn't fancy him at all, but just thought he was a very pleasant and very, very sweet chap. So I took him for lunch and the rest is history, as they say. 'We've been together 33 years, have two kids, five cats, two snakes, two tarantulas and three lizards.' Nik and Eva and their two children Olivia and Hunter have released a new podcast called Handbook To Happiness . Eva said: 'The podcast is literally jam packed with lots of helpful tips and information. It's a very candid and very open discussion about our own insecurities, our fears, the things that have happened in our lives, people that we've helped, how we've managed to help them. 'There's a lot of laughs as well. I think that's the lovely thing about a family dynamic that you can't get away with anything when your kids are there. 'They'll totally rat you out. And rat each other out, I hasten to add. In the best and funniest way. But the headline, obviously the concept is that, so many years we've said, would it be great if there was a handbook to life and there isn't one. Nik added: 'You know, you get your heart broken and you turn to page 25 and it tells you how to deal with it and you know, you lose someone and you turn to page 50, etcetera. 'So this is what we're trying to create with the podcast - it's like a handbook to life. 'We talk about tips and things and life, really great information on how you can be more positive, how you can gain more confidence, how you can overcome a phobia, OCD, traumas. 'And how to be more positive and a whole host of other things including like body dysmorphia, comparison, judgment, health anxiety, fear of death, all these topics.'

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off! podcast By Harry Bamforth Published: 09:46, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 09:53, 28 May 2024 e-mail View comments Arsenal stars are enjoying their time off the turf with their families following disappointment on the final day of the Premier League earlier this month. The Gunners players have jetted off to various locations around the world for some relaxation time after an intense season that saw them finish second in England's top tier. Bukayo Saka , Declan Rice , and Aaron Ramsdale are spending their downtime in England before joinng up with the England squad prior to the European Championships . Meanwhile, Thomas Partey has gotten engaged to his partner Janine Mackson, proposing on the beach, and David Raya has been vacationing in the Maldives. Others are also spending some time in the sun. Kai Havertz flew away from the UK for a quick break with captain Martin Odegaard , both being joined by their partners.

The German attacker has now joined up with the Germany squad for their home Euros, but the same can not be said for Odegaard, who will have an extended holiday as Norway failed to qualify for the competition. Saka and Rice have been seen close to home at an event seemingly organised by Arsenal themselves. The latter has not only been posing for photos at events, but he has also been doing it for professional photographers. The England midfielder was seen in a recent edition of Mens Health UK, and he shared his thoughts on England's chances in Germany, this summer. Speaking with the magazine, he said: 'With the team we’ve got, the players we have, and everyone in form playing well, you need to back yourself to win. I feel like it is our chance; it’s time. 'What excuses can you give? We have a great manager, and great staff behind the scenes and they are a good group to go away with. We can do something really special this summer.’ Declan Rice and Aaron Ramsdale have had contrasting times off before joining up with England's training squad for the Euros Rice has also been with Bukayo Saka at an event during their time off before a big summer Rice's compatriot Ramsdale has been spotted at Wembley during his time off, but not playing.

        "content": "The Department for Juveniles of the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office (VTJ) in Belgrade requested today from the Higher Court to put a 16-year-old who beat DJ.M. (40) in custody, Telegraf.rs has learned. The suspect was questioned by the prosecutor today. As our portal was told by the VJT in Belgrade, the minor will be held responsible for aggravated murder. Police are looking for another suspect. DJ.M. (40) was the brother of Vice President of the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Minister of Development and Entrepreneurship Vojin Mijatovic. As we reported yesterday, the victim came out of his apartment to defend his son from \"hooligans\" who were taking his money for days. \"They racketeered his son, stole money, pocket money, harassed him for days, he came out to defend him,\" a source told us. As we reported, they tried to set the victim on fire with a flare. \"He came out to defend the child, they jumped on him, kicked him on the head, tried to set him on fire with a flare but didn't succeed, they did everything they could to him. That man was never in a fight before. Terrible, he is survived by two children,\" a source close to the investigation told us. The police are looking through the footage from surveillance cameras which are believed to have captured the brutal attack. After the news that DJ.M. had died in the Emergency Center in Belgrade. the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Belgrade issued their statements. DJ.M. was called to come out by his son because a group of youths did not want to return a ball to him. Then, a fight broke out. DJ.M. returned to the building where he was taken ill. He died two hours later in the hospital. (Telegraf.rs)",

        "content": "Dhaka: At least four people have been killed in separate electrocution accidents in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, due to heavy rain and gusty winds caused by Cyclone Remal . Bacchu Miah, in charge of Dhaka Medical College Hospital Police outpost, confirmed the deaths on Tuesday. Rain and strong gusts of wind swept through Bangladeshi capital till Tuesday morning under the influence of the storm, which made landfall on Sunday night, Xinhua news agency reported. A firefighter was also reportedly electrocuted to death early Tuesday while removing trees uprooted during cyclone Remal in Bangladesh's Khagrachari district, nearly 259 km southeast of capital Dhaka. Bangladesh's coastlines have been battered by ferocious winds, which uprooted trees and homes, ripped roofs off buildings and caused widespread power and water outages. Flood protection embankments were reportedly washed away or damaged in parts of the country's southern and southeastern regions which were hit hard by the cyclone. At least 10 people were killed as Cyclone Remal struck Bangladesh's coastlines and weakened to a tropical depression, said the country's State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Md Mohibur Rahman on Monday.",

        "description": "For no real reason, here's a list of 10 football managers who lost their job despite winning trophies. There's a lot of PSG and Real Madrid, unsurprisingly.",
        "content": "Supposed to be a topical top 10, this, but sometimes it’s hard to find anything going on in the football news cycle to use as a hook. So for no real reason, here’s a list of 10 managers who lost their jobs despite winning a trophy just before it happened. Don’t be looking for deeper meaning here. There isn’t any. And there definitely isn’t a clue in one of these people being a Dutch former Ajax manager who lost his job at Manchester United despite a fluky run to FA Cup success . Antonio Conte, Chelsea Perhaps the most notable recent example from Our League – the one that matters – because Conte was by any sane measure enormously successful at Chelsea yet so complete was the breakdown of the relationship that there really was nothing to be done to salvage it. Won the title in imperious fashion in his very first season before the recriminations and infighting kicked in. Would he be so angry all the time if he just acknowledged his baldness? Not for us to say. But he is an angry man, and in his second season it all went wrong. Chelsea’s league form collapsed in what we now see in hindsight as the start of the Guardiola era of utter dominance and they finished only fifth, 30 points off the absurd pace set by City. But through the squabbling and unpleasantness, Conte did still manage to steer his side to the FA Cup before huffing off into the sunset. Louis van Gaal, Manchester United The most obvious warning from history for Erik Ten Hag comes from the tale of a former Ajax manager for whom FA Cup glory with Manchester United couldn’t sufficiently paper the cracks from a wretched league season which saw them fail to even muster a challenge despite it being the Leicester Season. Did win what might go down as the least impressive FA Cup of all time, concluding in a final far more famous for the antics of the losing manager than anything the winning side did. Sorry for reminding you of the Pardew Dance, but there it is. This latest Man United FA Cup run has had its mortifying moments, but they did – somehow – beat Liverpool and City along the way. In 2016, Van Gaal’s United beat Sheffield United, Derby, Shrewsbury, West Ham (after a replay), Everton and Crystal Palace. And only Shrewsbury were beaten halfway convincingly. It never felt likely to be enough, and two days later Van Gaal had gone. It’s already been three days, so Ten Hag has won that battle. Laurent Blanc, PSG One thing getting the Spanish archer after sneaking a cup win in an otherwise miserable season, quite another to find yourself out of a job after winning the league. And all the cups. Again. Blanc spent three years as Paris St-Germain manager after Carlo Ancelotti left for Madrid. He won eight of the nine domestic trophies available to him, completing his second domestic treble in his third and final season in the sure and certain knowledge that it wouldn’t be enough because they went out of the Champions League at the unacceptably early quarter-final stage. This was really the point at which PSG entered their current phrase of futility, in which no amount of domestic pots and pans – which continue to arrive in vast yet dreary numbers – could make up for the absence of a single Champions League. That remains as elusive as ever, with five more managers since Blanc charged with the apparently impossible task of ending that wait. Including... Mauricio Pochettino , PSG Poch bided his time after the collapse of everything he’d patiently and in the circumstances heroically built at Tottenham following the 2019 Champions League final defeat, eventually making as Harry Kane-esque move to a club that didn’t really seem like a fit but would at least allow him to hoover up some CV-bolstering trophies. Unlike Kane, Pochettino did at least manage that but there was never really any air of permanence or more importantly authority as Poch tried to impose his philosophy on a club where star players held and hold all the power. Arrived halfway through an unsalvageable 2020/21 season in which he couldn’t even win the league but did manage it in his first and only full season in charge of a club that had changed a lot since his days as a player there alongside Ronaldinho and Mikel Arteta in the early years of the 21 st century. Didn’t do him any good, though, and by early July he was just another victim of PSG’s Champions League obsession. Like... Christophe Galtier, PSG Quickly becomes apparent with this feature that certain clubs are absolute bankers for this particular brand of caper, and it’s no surprise that your modern-day, Champions League-obsessed and irrelevantly Ligue 1-dominating PSG are among them. It’s the by now familiar story with Galtier: won Ligue 1 – albeit by only a single point from Lens – but was already doomed by that point having finished only second in their Champions League group and being comfortably beaten in the last 16 by Bayern Munich. Maurizio Sarri, Juventus Sarri is, even by Italian standards, a well-travelled manager who rarely stays in one place for long and even more rarely stays out of work for any length of time. A chain-smoking chain-manager. Won the Europa League in his one ill-tempered season as Chelsea manager but that doesn’t quite qualify here because he was leaving of his own volition to return to Italy and take over at Juventus. But that gig does tick the box for us. Sarri won his first Serie A title in his only season at Juventus, becoming the oldest manager to do so, but it was a familiar story: failure to go beyond the last 16 of the Covid-delayed Champions League saw him out of a job. Juventus’ ninth straight league title was never going to be enough, but it’s nevertheless fun to note that they’ve not managed to win one since. Max Allegri, Juventus And Sarri himself took over from Allegri, who left Juventus after not just one Serie A title but five straight Serie A titles but, crucially, diminishing Champions League returns. Again, like Sarri’s meaningless league title, a couple of quarter-final exits don’t look too bad now given what’s followed. Allegri gets bonus points for getting sacked after trophy success not once but twice and at the same club. After returning to Juventus in 2021, Allegri hasn’t manage to restore Juve’s Serie A dominance but did this season manage to win Coppa Italia and then get immediately sacked, largely because of his antics during and after that final. Which is quite a flex. MORE ON ERIK TEN HAG AT MAN UTD FROM F365: 👉 Who will be the next Man Utd manager? 👉 Can we be Frank? Manchester United might be replacing Ten Hag with a worse fit and bigger gamble 👉 Arsenal bite back against mid-table Manchester United as Ten Hag In and Out campaigns clash Jupp Heynckes, Real Madrid PSG and Juventus have been our friends in this feature, but Real Madrid are the absolute daddies of unacceptable, manager-terminating success. Jupp Heynckes’ tale is an interesting one, because it reflects the shifting priorities. Generally, the story for these daft entitled clubs is domestic success being waved away and dismissed as a mere trifle for managers who have failed miserably to win the Champions League at the first/only time of asking and must therefore be replaced by the next poor sod. Back in the 90s, it was all arse-backwards for Heynckes, who led his Real Madrid team to victory in the 1998 Champions League final – Real’s first European crown since 1966 – but paid the price for poor domestic form. Madrid finished only fourth, behind Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad in a wild La Liga season which saw Barca crowned champions despite suffering 10 defeats and managing a mere 74 points. Vicente Del Bosque, Real Madrid After winning five La Liga titles as a player and serving a couple of caretaker stints as manager, Del Bosque finally got his big chance in the big chair in 1999 and really started the process of restoring Real Madrid to the glory days that have continued to this day. His four years in charge came at the height of the Galactico nonsense, yet Del Bosque steered a side over which he had minimal off-field input to two league titles and two Champions Leagues to kickstart their march towards their current absurd total of European titles. Not since the 50s and 60s had Madrid enjoyed such success, but the day after Real Madrid won the 2002/03 league title it was confirmed Del Bosque’s contract would not be renewed. It came just after the signing of David Beckham, not unanimously greeted with delight around the club, and appeared to confirm the long-standing rumours of a political split at the club, with captain Fernando Hierro also leaving the club that summer. Fabio Capello, Real Madrid When Capello returned for his second spell in charge of Real Madrid in 2006, they had failed to win another league title since Del Bosque’s departure. It was an unacceptable drought, clearly. Capello would put that right, but also so very many noses out of joint that such a long-awaited league title wasn’t enough to save him. The most high-profile of his fallings out came with Beckham, who was in the process of engineering a move to America, and that had a knock-on effect across the squad. But as well as the internecine feuds were the complaints at Capello’s functional, pragmatic style of play. This was anathema to a club that had just been through the sometimes-successful but always at least entertaining Galactico era. Capello’s view was that he was brought in to restore Madrid to the top rung of Spanish football. That he did that but still lost his job suggests he wasn’t entirely on top of the brief.",

In the shade of mango and silk-cotton trees, he recounts his time in the \"Senegalese tirailleurs\" -- a corps of African infantrymen who fought for France during the two world wars and various decolonisation struggles.Dieme's medal-adorned traditional boubou speaks of his service in former French Indochina and later Algeria, as he recalls those who never returned to their homeland.\"Many colleagues stayed behind. Others came back mutilated (or) are no more,\" he said, his blue cap pinned with a sergeant's rank.Dieme explained that some 20 men from his village of Badiana in the southern Casamance region served in the Senegalese Tirailleurs corps until it was disbanded in the 1960s.He added that he was one of the \"lucky\" ones.\"I'm the only survivor. It was a miracle that I was chosen,\" he recounted, surrounded by family members and crumbling buildings.Dieme has been selected as one of the torchbearers to carry the Olympic torch as it passes through the Parisian department of Seine-Saint-Denis for the opening of the Games at the end of July.Organisers accepted the bid from the department, where Dieme lived before his return to Senegal in 2023.\"The choice of Oumar Dieme contributes to the essential work of remembrance, because the Senegalese riflemen have been forgotten for too long in our collective memory,\" Stephane Troussel, president of the Seine-Saint-Denis department, told AFP.Dieme had never heard of the Olympic flame before, but agreed anyway.\"Given my age, I would like to be accompanied by my son,\" he said. - Independence - Dieme is one of thousands of soldiers born in the former French colonies in Africa to have fought in the Senegalese Tirailleurs corps, created in 1857.He enlisted on March 6, 1953, after leaving neighbouring The Gambia where his father, an imam, had sent him to study the Koran.Recruiters gave Dieme the birth date of 31 December, 1932, making him 20 at the time, but he thinks he is at least two years older. He volunteered to go to Indochina, where US-backed colonial ruler France was fighting the Chinese-backed Viet Minh independence movement. He had seen \"people come back with medals and decorations, I liked that,\" he said.Dieme recounted how he saw 22 men from his company fall in an ambush, and how the encirclement of Dien Bien Phu had prevented him and his colleagues from getting there before the decisive defeat of the French Union troops in 1954.After returning to his home country, Dieme left again in 1959, this time headed for the Algerian War. It was here that he first learned of Senegal's own independence from France in 1960.Dieme was repatriated and re-enlisted in the Senegalese army, before retiring at 36 and working as a security guard at the University of Dakar and as a bank courier until 1988. - 'Beautiful symbol' - Dieme later settled in Bondy, northeastern Paris, where he and other former riflemen faced another battle, this time with the French state.He eventually obtained French nationality, and in 2023 the government allowed the remaining tirailleurs to continue receiving the minimum pension without having to spend half the year in France.Dieme later returned to Senegal, where he splits his time between his village and the capital Dakar, where one of his two wives and the mother of many of his children lives.

Jess comes from Stockport and describes herself as a travel junkie who is 'happiest in the sun' She says she is ready for love because she wants to enjoy all of the couple activities her friendship group does. Jess explained: 'All my friends are in relationships, settled down with babies and I’m going to end up that aunt that rocks up at family parties and they say \"she's still not met someone, she’s still going to Ibiza having a midlife crisis.\" I just want to meet somebody and to be able to do all of that stuff too.' However, she admitted that she has high standards for herself and that her extrovert personality can intimidate some men. She said: 'I think I’m single because I don’t underestimate the fact that I’m hard work. I know what I want and I'm not easily pleased. 'When you’re a loud, outgoing woman, sometimes it can intimidate men - men don’t always want that. 'I think that can sometimes put people off me because I am quite loud and you can hear me before you see me. Some men love that though.' As for what she loves in a man, Jess has a strict type on paper, saying: 'I would say nice teeth, I love a set of white Turkey teeth but a good set of Turkey teeth. 'I would say personality traits, you have to be family orientated. I’m so close to my mum and I’d like my future partner to be really close with their family too. 'You have to be tall, you can’t be shorter than me, I can't be having to question whether I can wear heels around you and what height of heels I can wear. If you’re vertically challenged, it’s not for me.'

And the singletons looking for love are makeup artist Samantha Kenny, recruitment manager Munveer Jabbal, account manager Nicole Samuel, footballer Ronnie Vint, office administrator Pasty Field, surveyor Ciaran Davies, mental health nurse Mimii Ngulube, hair stylist Sam Taylor, retail manager Jess White, model Ayo Odukoya, dancer Harriett Blackmore, and sweet salesman Sean Stone. With returning host Maya Jama at the helm once again, the new batch of islanders will all be on the lookout to find their soulmate. They have all jetted off to Mallorca, with the debut episode of series 11 airing on Monday 3 June. And for the first time, ITV will launch the dating show simultaneously across ITV1, ITV2, and ITVX. LOVE ISLAND 2024: MEET THE CONTESTANTS NAME: Mimii Ngulube AGE: 24 FROM: Portsmouth OCCUPATION: Mental Health Nurse WHY LOVE ISLAND? The pool in Portsmouth is not giving. I've tried dating, speaking to people on social media and it just hasn't been successful. Applying was a spontaneous thing, I didn't expect to get here! WHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? My girls are my rocks and I'm theirs so I'll be a good friend as well as going in there to find a man. I like dressing up so I'll bring style, and I'd like to think I'm quite funny so I'll make people laugh. Bringing honesty as well - I'm good at picking up on people's personality traits and side-eyeing those who might be a liar. NAME: Sam Taylor AGE: 23 FROM: Chesterfield OCCUPATION: Hair Stylist WHY LOVE ISLAND? At this point in my life I just want the opportunity to find a real connection with someone. I've been looking for that connection for quite some time but I've never really found it, I'm hoping I find that spark in the Villa. WHAT DO YOU WANT THE ISLANDERS TO KNOW? I'd say not to judge a book by its cover because how I look compared to what I do for work might not necessarily add up. You wouldn't look at me as a tall guy covered in tattoos and think that I make girls' hair look pretty for a living. NAME: Patsy Field AGE: 29 FROM: Orpington OCCUPATION: Office Administrator WHAT DO YOU WANT THE ISLANDERS TO KNOW? I've got something very special about me which is my disability, it's a condition I was born with called Ebs Palsy. It doesn't define who I am , but it makes me a little different, although I've learnt to get on with it and it's never held me back. HOW WOULD FRIENDS/FAMILY DESCRIBE YOU? My friends would say that I'm the loudest person in the group, I'm the one who's always up for doing a dare, the life and soul of the party. My family would say that I'm bossy and that it's always my way or the highway, they'd say I rule the roost. NAME: Sean Stone AGE: 24 FROM: Hertford OCCUPATION: Sweet Salesman WHY LOVE ISLAND? I've always been one for relationships and when you have found someone you want to be with it's the best feeling. Now is the perfect time, the one thing that is missing is my soulmate. HOW WOULD FRIENDS/FAMILY DESCRIBE YOU? Very loving, caring and thoughtful. I'm the kind of guy that if you broke down on the motorway and needed your tyre changed, I'd be there at any time of night. NAME: Harriett Blackmore AGE: 24 FROM: Brighton OCCUPATION: Dancer & Personal Shopper WHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? I'll bring the entertainment for everyone in the Villa, whether that's making the girls laugh or making the boys turn their heads, I'm sure that I'll bring the drama. CLAIM T0 FAME? Being a bit of an IT girl in Brighton, I've done personal shopping for the rapper Arrdee and one of my best friends is Saffron Barker the YouTuber. NAME: Ayo Odukoya AGE : 25 FROM: Canning Town OCCUPATION: Model WHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? I think I'd bring excitement and joy. I think people would have someone to come to and talk to and feel comfortable being around or to have a laugh with. I think I'm somebody everyone would take to. WHY SHOULD SOMEBODY DATE YOU? I feel like the way I carry myself is very respectful and I think people take to that and once you show who you are to somebody you get it back tenfold. The way I am gives off a good enough energy for people to feel comfortable around me. NAME: Samantha Kenny AGE: 26 FROM: Liverpool OCCUPATION: Makeup Artist WHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? I think I will definitely bring some fire, I'm very opinionated and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm really bubbly too so I'll definitely have a laugh as well as bringing some scouse glamour. WHY ARE YOU SINGLE? I don't get out enough, I work weekends and tend to not go out in Liverpool anymore. If I want a night out I go down to London as I love the boys down south. Tall, dark and cockney is my type. NAME: Munveer Jabbal AGE: 30 FROM: Surbiton, Surrey OCCUPATION: Recruitment Manager WHY ARE YOU SINGLE? I haven't found the right girl, I'm quite picky and have high standards. Dating in London is horrible. You don't know who's single... but now you're putting me in a place where everyone's single so there's no issues around that. CLAIM T0 FAME? I'm mates with Spencer Morgan (Piers Morgan's son). We met when I moved to Fulham in 2018. NAME: Nicole Samuel AGE: 24 FROM: Aberdare, Wales OCCUPATION: Accounts Manager WHY ARE YOU SINGLE? I've been enjoying single life and the attention of different boys, it's fun. I've enjoyed being able to go on holiday with the girls and not having to worry about someone back home. All the girls are there texting in their room and I'm out till 4 in the morning living my best life. WHAT IS SOMETHING NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT YOU? I became a world champion dancer in 2011, not many people know that. I was a professional street dancer. NAME: Ronnie Vint AGE: 27 FROM: South East London OCCUPATION: Semi Professional Footballer WHAT'S YOUR TYPE ON PAPER? I want someone that's family orientated, caring and career minded. Lookwise, I like blondes with nice boobs but am partial to a brunette too. CLAIM T0 FAME? Bradley Dack is my best friend and he and Olivia are a big part of my life. I call Olivia my big little sister, she always looks out for me. NAME: Jess White AGE: 25 FROM: Stockport OCCUPATION: Retail Manager WHY ARE YOU SINGLE? I don't underestimate the fact that I'm hard work. I know what I want and I'm not easily pleased. When you're a loud, outgoing woman, sometimes it can intimidate men - men don't always want that. WHAT'S YOUR TYPE ON PAPER? I love a set of white Turkey teeth but a good set of Turkey teeth. I would say personality traits, you have to be family orientated. You have to be tall, you can't be shorter than me, I can't be having to question whether I can wear heels around you and what height of heels I can wear. If you're vertically challenged, it's not for me. NAME: Ciaran Davies AGE: 21 FROM: Pencoed, South Wales OCCUPATION: Surveyor WHAT'S YOUR TYPE ON PAPER? Obviously looks but humour is a big thing for me, I'm a bit of a wind up so I want a girl who can give it back. Loyalty is another one for me, I think that's the most important thing to look for in a relationship. CLAIM T0 FAME? When I was in Malia on a boys holiday I pretended to be Liam Reardon from series 7 to get into a club because they wouldn't let us in. It worked and we ended up getting a private booth and free drinks all night.

        "content": "A stone quarry collapse claimed the lives of as many as 10 individuals in the capital of Mizoram, Aizawl following incessant rains, said police officials. According to authorities, seven fatalities were confirmed initially by Mizoram director general of police, Anil Shukla, with subsequent reports raising the toll to ten. The incident occurred on the outskirts of Aizawl, where heavy rains triggered the collapse. In addition to the loss of lives, numerous trees and electric poles were uprooted, while several roads became impassable due to the deluge. The Mizoram DGP also said that several landslide incidents have also been reported from different parts of the state. “Police personnel are engaged in rescue operations. The water levels of rivers are also rising and many people living in the riverside areas have been evacuated,” the DGP said. Mizoram chief minister Lalduhoma has announced comprehensive relief measures to aid those affected by Cyclone Remal within the state. The department of information and public relations, government of Mizoram , revealed that affected individuals will receive assistance totalling Rs 15 crore, while relatives of the deceased will be provided ex-gratia payments of Rs 4 lakhs each. Meanwhile, some after-effects of cyclone Remal hit Mizoram which shares borders with Bangladesh prompting the state administration to issue precautionary measures. It stated that all government offices, except those essential for disaster management, health services, and public utilities, were ordered closed on May 28, 2024. The Mizoram administration said in a release, “In view of the inclement weather and the warning issued by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Cyclone Remal, the state government hereby orders closure of all Government offices today i.e., 28th May, 2024 (Tuesday) with the exception of offices rendering essential services such as disaster management and rehabilitation, district administration, health and family welfare, Mizoram police, power and electricity, public health engineering etc.” “Secretaries and heads of departments shall ensure that officers and staff of their respective departments shall ‘work from home’ on this day and be available in case of any exigencies,” the release added. Meanwhile, the IMD issued warnings of squally winds, ranging from 40-50 kmph to 35-45 kmph across different regions and said that the adverse weather conditions were anticipated to persist until the evening of May 28, 2024, underscoring the need for heightened vigilance and preparedness among residents.",

        "content": "Q*Bird exists since early 2022 and works on a Quantum Key Distribution network. The technology ensures that communications cannot be eavesdropped on because both communicators notice immediately if a message has been intercepted. Messages can only be read if they arrive encrypted. This takes security to the next level and reduces the risk of a successful cyber attack. Attacks from future quantum computers could also be repelled. Q*Bird plans The 2.5 million euro investment will allow Q*Bird to further put the technology into practice. “With the new capital, we aim to reduce its (production) costs further, reduce the size, and improve the integration into classical networks even further. We will also scale our operations and grow the team further,” CEO Ingrid Romijn told in an initial comment. Dutch quant fund QDNL Participations and U.S. Cottonwood Technology Fund led the investment round. Regional development company InnovationQuarter is also investing in Q*Bird. The Delft-based company is active in the Rotterdam port, among other places. There, it is working on a project with other tech vendors to allow cargo ships and other traffic to communicate securely. Q*Bird’s encryption technology can contribute to this. If a potential cyber attack can be repelled in this way, potentially disastrous consequences, such as shutdown, can be prevented. :",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR 28 May — Police arrested two local men believed to be involved in a methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) distribution syndicate and seized drugs worth RM33.65 million, on Sunday. Bukit Aman Narcotics Criminal Investigation Department (NCID) director Datuk Khaw Kok Chin said the suspects, aged 32 and 33, were arrested in the 3.50pm raid at a luxury condominium unit in Sentul here. “The inspection at the condominium unit found 13 jars containing purple powder believed to be MDMA-type drug as well as 499 green plastic packets containing MDMA juice powder, weighing 213.4 kilogrammes. “Drugs are believed to be marketed in the Klang Valley, especially at entertainment centres, and sold at prices ranging from RM300 to RM600 per packet. The total drug seized can be used by 700,000 addicts,” he said in a special press conference at the Kuala Lumpur contingent police headquarters here today. Khaw said the investigation found that the syndicate rented the condominium unit for RM2,000 per month to store drugs, while the two suspects involved were paid RM3,000 each to do drug-related work. Preliminary investigations also found that the two suspects each have 10 records of past offences related to drugs and crime, and they are now remanded for seven days until June 2 to assist investigations under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. Khaw said the drug trafficking syndicate was believed to be active since January this year. “We are actively investigating the mastermind as well as the source of drug supply,” he said. — Bernama",

        "description": "The state’s police commissioner has flagged an internal probe into three interactions the family of Mark Bombara had with police before his explosion of violence.",
        "content": "The daughter of double murderer Mark Bombara has bravely spoken out just days after he shot dead her mother’s best friend and her teenage daughter, trying to ensure that other victims of domestic violence get the help they need. Ariel Bombara is devastated by the killings perpetrated by a man she said she had told police was armed and dangerous. “Here I am, another woman apologising for men’s behaviour, so I am sorry to the women suffering through this abuse, who aren’t receiving the help they need,” she said. “Now is the time for Australia to come together and actually do something about this scourge of domestic violence on our society, and start listening to women and protecting them. “I don’t plan to end this fight here. Something needs to be done and I will join the fight now.” On Tuesday afternoon WA Police Commissioner Col Blanch responded to Ariel’s scathing criticism after she said she reached out to police three times for help when her father became violent, only to be ignored. Ariel Bombara revealed she and her mother raised concerns about Bombara, 63, at a Perth police station in March, but felt the officer they spoke to “did not have much care for our situation”. They called another police station hoping for more help. “Three times the police were spoken to. Five separate officers,” Ariel said. “The first officer we spoke to, in my opinion, his attitude did not indicate that he had much care for our situation; to the point where, after expressing our concerns for our safety and our lives and the guns, his response in my opinion was not adequate. So I decided to call another police station and I spoke to two separate officers there.” She said no protection was offered, nor help to navigate the system. “We’re all standing here today with the benefit of hindsight.” Police Commissioner Col Blanch Weeks later Jenny and Gretl Petelczyc were shot dead in their Floreat home by Bombara, who was looking for Ariel and her mother. Blanch confirmed the women asked the police for a temporary 72-hour restraining order to protect them from Bombara in the weeks before the murders took place, but said the idea was rejected because the circumstances “would not have met the threshold of the order”. He said a full internal investigation would be launched, which would run concurrently with a coroner’s investigation. “A police order is issued where we are concerned about an imminent threat to people,” he said. “This [request for help] happened some seven weeks earlier [than the murders]. It’s what we knew at the time. We’re all standing here today with the benefit of hindsight.” Blanch said a family violence incident report was submitted, but that where that report went and what action was taken as a result would form part of the investigation. “The investigation will determine what we knew at the time and whether those decisions were appropriate,” he said. Loading “It’s important we do this thoroughly.” The Bombara women did not have a violence restraining order on Mark and had not applied for one. Speaking generally Blanch urged anyone fearing for their safety from a gun owner should apply for a VRO. “If you are in a violent relationship with a person, a family violence restraining order, immediately will remove firearms from a person,” he said. Blanch deflected a question over whether police rejection of Ariel and her mother’s request for a 72-hour restraining order would have discouraged them from applying for a full VRO. “My job today is not to cause more grief to the family involved. The discussions that were had on that night about a range of things should form part of the investigation,” he said. “But again, I can only reinforce getting a family violence restraining order would’ve removed guns from any person.” Ariel claims officers called for backup and wore bulletproof vests while escorting her mother and herself back to the family home to get their belongings. But she said the officers did not think her father was “enough of a risk” for them to confiscate his guns. “We were failed by the system,” Ariel said. “There needs to be massive systemic changes made to protect women, to ensure this never happens again and that women feel safe in reporting abuse. “Nobody actually listened to us and our reports and we weren’t given any resources and support. Nobody explained to us the system and the laws. We were not given any assistance. “There needs to be a lot more education within the police departments so that when domestic abuse victims come in and tell their stories, we ... start listening to them.” Blanch raised the possibility of proposed gun laws to be amended to give police powers to seize weapons from gun owners in all “acrimonious” relationship breakdowns. Ariel said this should not be a conversation about guns, but about the response to domestic violence. “I don’t think gun reforms would have made any difference,” she said. “Men will kill regardless of what weapon they use. If they want to they will find a way. There needs to be bigger reforms in domestic violence management and reporting.” If you or someone you know is at risk, contact Safe Steps 1800 015 188; National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732); or Lifeline 131 114.

        "description": "Keeping our surroundings clean is the best way to protect our children from contagious diseases.",
        "content": "Monsoon is often accompanied by viral diseases, infections and many other health problems. Kids are more vulnerable as they get infected quite easily and often end up losing school days due to the same. As mosquitoes breed at this time owing to more moisture content in the atmosphere, monsoon is also a time when diseases like dengue, malaria, cholera, typhoid and dysentery spread. Such waterborne diseases may also affect children severely. Here are a few pointers that will help your children stay fit during the monsoon season: Keep surroundings clean Keeping our surroundings clean is the best way to protect our children from contagious diseases. Draining stagnant water prevents the breeding of mosquitoes that bear diseases. Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that is commonly seen during monsoon. These diseases could be prevented by draining the stagnant water. Mosquito nets Sleeping under mosquito nets saves children from mosquito bites. You could also use mosquito repellents. Making the kids wear full-sleeved clothes, pants and socks would prevent mosquito bites. Moreover, personal hygiene is important too. Parents should advise the children to wash their hands regularly and to take a bath in case they get wet in the rain. This would surely reduce the risk of infections. Ensure umbrellas, raincoats Umbrellas and raincoats should be used during monsoon. Getting wet in the rain for longer durations reduces the body’s immunity and increases the risk of falling ill. Monsoon special diet A proper diet improves immunity and fights bacterial infections. Make sure to include citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, yoghurt, mushrooms, berries and lean meat in your kids’ diet to increase immunity. Besides, it is important to drink enough water too. Immediate care In case your child shows symptoms of fever, cold and cough, then they should be kept at home and allowed to rest. This speeds up their recovery while protecting other children from getting infected.",

        "content": "Read the chilling texts controlling boyfriend sent to Maryam Hamka in the weeks before he allegedly murdered her Maryam Hamka vanished in 2021, her body later found in bushland Her ex is accused of her murder READ MORE: Daughter of Perth shooter claims warnings ignored By Cassandra Morgan For Australian Associated Press Published: 09:49, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 09:49, 28 May 2024 e-mail A Melbourne man was in a brief but violent relationship with Maryam Hamka before he murdered her and disposed of her body in bushland, sending her a series of threatening messages in the lead-up to her death, prosecutors allege. Toby Loughnane is fighting a murder charge in the Supreme Court of Victoria, after instead admitting to Ms Hamka's negligent manslaughter - a charge prosecutors say does not go far enough. His barrister Daniel Sala on Tuesday flagged he would argue Ms Hamka succumbed to a drug overdose rather than violence. He urged a jury to consider the evidence dispassionately after it heard prosecution allegations he said probably stoked hatred towards Loughnane. Prosecutor Kristie Churchill alleged Ms Hamka had been in a 'relatively brief but violent and controlling relationship' with Loughnane before he murdered her at his Brighton home in April 2021. In the months before Ms Hamka's death, Loughnane physically assaulted her and also sent messages threatening to injure and kill her, Ms Churchill said. The messages included, 'I'm going to split your skull', 'I'll go to (jail) just to see you suffer you dog', 'you're dead' and 'wait until I get my hands on you dog', the prosecutor alleged. Maryam Hamka (pictured) was allegedly murdered by her a man she had a brief and violent relationship with Loughnane also pursued Ms Hamka in a car in 2021, followed her into her family home and threatened her friends, Ms Churchill said. The last time her mother saw Ms Hamka was on April 9, 2021, when Loughnane was screaming at her to get in a car before she left with her alleged murderer, the prosecutor said. Ms Hamka was spotted next day on CCTV at a Brunswick Woolworths before she was last seen alive in a 'confronting' video filmed by Loughnane, wherein she was half-naked and he was mocking her, Ms Churchill said. A friend of Loughnane's later saw Ms Hamka dead in the foetal position in the shower of his Brighton home, the prosecutor alleged. Maryam Hamka (left and right), 36, was last seen on CCTV leaving a Woolworth's store in Albert Street, Brunswick at 5:30pm on April 10 2021 (left) Ms Churchill accused Loughnane of trying to cover up Ms Hamka's murder, alleging he sent her several messages after she died, sought a friend's help to buy a steam cleaner off Gumtree and disposed of her body in dense bushland. Police found a significant number of cleaning products at Loughnane's home days after Ms Hamka's death. Almost two years later - in May 2023 - they received information from Loughnane's lawyers about the location of Ms Hamka's body, the prosecutor said. Officers later found Ms Hamka's bones in thick bushland at Cape Schanck on the Mornington Peninsula. Ms Hamka's former boyfriend Toby Loughnane (pictured) has been charged with her murder Mr Sala said the defence would focus on three key pieces of evidence, including the final video of Ms Hamka, the observations of Loughnane's friend and the fact both his client and Ms Hamka were extensive drug users. The jury would hear evidence about the drug GHB, the barrister said. 'This is the world in which these two people occupied in April 2021,' Mr Sala said. 'It can be quite disgusting. It brings out the absolute worst in people.' The world of drug use was critical to the case and Loughnane accepted responsibility for Ms Hamka's alleged fatal overdose, the barrister said. 'What you have not heard (from the prosecution) is anyone say, 'this is how she died',' Mr Sala said.

New Delhi: Bigg Boss fame Munawar Faruqui is again in the news as he has allegedly tied the knot again. The comedian has a second wife and social media is buzzing. Munawar, the controversial king of Bigg Boss 17, reportedly married a makeup artist Mehzabeen Coatwala, and netizens cannot get over it.

The dream run for the man continues, as he has now got married to the stunning Mehzabeen Coatwala.\" A post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) Further, he added, \"Even though it all started off with speculations about his marriage with her as there was a Nikaah invitation card with the initials ‘M & M’ which was making the rounds on the internet. But, now, it has been confirmed that, both the Ms stood for Munawar Faruqui and his wife Mehzabeen Coatwala! Here’s wishing the couple a Happy Married Life!\" The rumours of the comedian’s second marriage surfaced online after his fan account put up a post claiming he has wed again secretly. A picture of the wedding invitation has also been surfacing on the internet and is claimed to be that of Munawar’s. Both Munawar and Mehzabeen have not shared any photos on their social media handles nor have they confirmed or denied the speculations. A formal confirmation from either one of them or their families is still awaited. This is Munawar’s second marriage. He was previously married and also shares a son with his ex-wife. Mehzabeen’s first marriage also ended in a divorce.",

Lepore For Dailymail.Com Published: 01:24 EDT, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 04:48 EDT, 28 May 2024 e-mail 7 shares 87 View comments Richard Dreyfuss was seen on video entering a screening and Q&A for his classic 1975 film Jaws wearing a dress before he was booed and faced walkouts from the Massachusetts crowd . Dreyfuss, 78, was appearing at The Cabot in Beverly, Massachusetts , for question and answer session followed by a screening of Jaws, the mega hit which launched his career in 1975. Tickets went for as much as $300. Some of those present said the Oscar-winner had made 'sexist and homophobic' remarks but further guests revealed the dress stunt preceded Dreyfuss' criticism of parents of transgender children. Dreyfuss walked onto the stage in the floral print blue dress and shook his hips to Taylor Swift 's 'Love Story', while wielding his cane like a baseball bat, attendees claimed. 'He said that the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds,' Diane Wolf, one of the ticket-holders, said. Richard Dreyfuss was seen on video entering a screening and Q&A for his classic 1975 film Jaws wearing a dress before he was booed and faced walkouts from the Massachusetts crowd Dreyfuss, 78, was appearing at The Cabot in Beverly, Massachusetts, for question and answer session followed by a screening of Jaws, the mega hit which launched his career in 1975. Tickets went for as much as $300 In one of the clips posted online, Dreyfuss says of trans children: 'It's not okay because when the kid's 15, she's going to say, 'I'm an octopus.'' Dreyfuss eventually put on a suit jacket and got rid of the dress but continued to offend many in the audience. The Hollywood Reporter cites others who say he made disparaging remarks about Barbra Streisand , his co-star in the 1987 movie Nuts. Dreyfuss himself has made no public comment on the event, while the theater holding it has apologize. His son Ben Dreyfuss, a journalist, did comment on the matter on social media Monday evening. 'Re: my father: well, now you know why I refused to give him the password to his own twitter account for a decade lol,' Dreyfuss posted on X. After the event, the theater issued an apology to all those who had bought tickets. 'We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity we uphold at The Cabot,' the press release began. Dreyfuss eventually put on a suit jacket and got rid of the dress but continued to offend many in the audience Dreyfuss himself has made no public comment on the event, while the theater holding it has apologize. His son Ben Dreyfuss (pictured left), a journalist, did comment on the matter on social media Monday evening We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize.' 'At The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way.' 'We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort caused.' In response to the controversy, one attendee, Rogue Mama, tweeted: 'Came here to see if Richard Dreyfuss had been cancelled tonight after appearing at #TheCabot in Beverly.' Another person tweeted an alternative title for the evening: 'An Evening of Misogyny and Homophobia With Richard Dreyfuss. Disappointing doesn't even begin to cover it.' Ironically, on May 28, three days after Dreyfuss's appearance, the theater is hosting an event titled How Discrimination Shows Up in Our Community and What We Can Do About It. On May 24, Dreyfuss appeared for a similar session at The Music Hall in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. An attendee wrote on Facebook: 'Wow. He was awful. Sexist, mean, arrogant. I walked out as did many others even before the Jaws screening. Awful.' Dreyfuss, 78, was appearing at The Cabot in Beverly, Massachusetts, for a question and answer session followed by a screening of Jaws, the mega hit which launched his career in 1975 According to some audience members, Dreyfuss made disparaging remarks about Barbra Streisand, his co-star in the 1987 movie Nuts Just 12 months ago, Dreyfuss was widely criticized for his remarks on the new diversity and inclusion requirements at the Academy Awards and said 'they make me vomit.' Dreyfuss made those remarks during an episode of PBS' Firing Line, which aired on Friday, and claimed the Academy was treating people like children by implementing the new criteria. The actor also defended Laurence Olivier's performance in the 1965 film Othello in which he played the lead character in blackface. Host Margaret Hoover asked Dreyfuss what he thought about the incoming inclusivity rules and he replied: 'They make me vomit. 'No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is. What are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people's feelings? 'You can't legislate that. You have to let life be life and I'm sorry, I don't think there is a minority or majority in the country that has to be catered to like that... This is an art form. It's also a form of commerce, and it makes money, but it's an art. 'And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.' The actor has long been outspoken about his belief in the constitution. Dreyfuss pictured with his wife, Russian-born Svetlana Erokhin in April 2023 The Cabot Cinema's management issued a full apology to customers who attended Dreyfuss's appearance In 2008, he founded The Dreyfuss Initiative, a nonprofit that promotes teaching about American democracy in classrooms nationwide. The initiative, among other things, provides teachers with videos and educational tools. In a 2014 interview with The Associated Press, calling for a 'civil strike' in support of the U.S. Constitution to encourage civic participation. 'I'm going to send you a copy of the preamble to the Constitution,' he said. 'If there's anything in it that you don't agree with, don't sign it; just send me back an explanation. You will agree with everything, because it's beautifully crafted and it's meant for all. And if I get 500,000 signatures, I'm going to call for a civil strike.

        "content": "Tianma, a major global player in the display segment recently showcased its micro-Fluidic e-paper display at the Displayweek 2024 event. The company in fact had two micro-Fluidic e-paper panels on display at the event. One is monochrome and the other color though beyond that, both have the same basic specifications. That includes a 6.7-inch panel having 960 x 1920 pixel resolution which translates to a 320 PPI pixel density. What is exciting is that the above specifications applies equally to both the monochrome and the color displays. This is unlike the Kaleido 3 display where you have a 300 PPI resolution in Black-and White mode though the same gets halved to 150 PPI switching to color. The micro-Fluidic e-paper displays from Tianma are going to be better in that they not only offer a marginally higher pixel density but the best part is they remain the same for both monochrome and color displays. The company said the display is meant for use in e-readers and e-note devices but didn’t reveal when we can expect to see the display make it to a real device. From the short video that the company uploaded on YouTube, there does not seem to be any issues with page refresh times or ghosting and such. The display is clean and fluid, to the extent that it does not resemble the E Ink e-paper displays that we have seen so far. There is no working demo of the color display though but the static image it showed is quite good. Color reproduction is par for the course and is rich and vivid. It is going to be interesting to see how the color micro-Fluidic e-paper displays perform in real life. Stay tuned. With a keen interest in tech, I make it a point to keep myself updated on the latest developments in technology and gadgets. That includes smartphones or tablet devices but stretches to even AI and self-driven automobiles, the latter being my latest fad. Besides writing, I like watching videos, reading, listening to music, or experimenting with different recipes. The motion picture is another aspect that interests me a lot, and I'll likely make a film sometime in the future.",

He penned a loving caption with his post in which he said that she was 'reunited with daddy now'. He said in full: 'My 4 amazing brothers and I said Goodbye for the last time to our beautiful Mum Josie this afternoon. She's at last reunited with Daddy now. That is our only consolation. 'We loved and will miss her so much. Every time I visited her she came to the door to bless me with Holy Water and Wave goodbye. Now sadly it is Goodbye Mummy.' Her funeral was held at St Patrick's Church in Belfast and was attended by her friends and family, however Eamonn was unable to attend her funeral due to 'health reasons'. Eamonn's father Leonard died following a heart attack over 30 years ago. Over the years, Eamonn has been incredibly open about his own crippling health conditions. In 2016, Eamonn underwent a double-hip replacement operation lasting three-and-a-quarter hours after living with acute pain for many years. Eamonn announced that his beloved mother Josie had sadly died at the age of 93 in November 2022 Eamonn broke down in tears as he paid tribute to his late father, 31 years after his untimely death Eamonn with his father Leonard and mother Josephine and two of his brothers in an old family picture Speaking about his operation at the time, Eamonn said: ' Was I nervous? No! It was just like being on television. In the build-up I was stressed — can I do this? Will I handle it?' Two years later, Eamonn detailed his battle with shingles and how he was struck with the virus on his son Declan's wedding day. During an appearance on Loose Women in September 2021, he spoke about his health battle which left him unable to work on This Morning three years ago. He also shared images of his puffy face covered in marks and scabs during his battle. Read More EXCLUSIVE Why Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford's split is about to get 'very, very tricky' - revealed by KATIE HIND Shingles is a viral rash caused by varicella zoster virus, the virus which causes chickenpox, being reactivated. In the UK, 90 per cent of adults have had chickenpox, so will have this virus lying dormant in their nervous systems. His years of chronic back pain started in spring 2021 - which came completely out of nowhere. The pain become so severe that it left Eamonn reliant on a walking stick, but soon found out the root cause. He eventually discovered it was three slipped discs that affected the movement of his right leg. In September 2022, Eamonn was forced to step away from his GB news show as he underwent vital back surgery to aid his chronic back pain. His battle with chronic back pain started after a dislocated pelvis led to three slipped discs. Following his surgery, he revealed that despite physiotherapy, he continues to find his lack of mobility stops him from doing simple things and is forced to rely on others, which he described as 'soul destroying'. His spinal surgery left him with a weakened left leg, too, and just over two weeks into his recovery from the operation, Eamonn fell backwards down 18 stairs at the Weybridge home, hitting the stone floor at the bottom. Over the years, Eamonn has been incredibly open about his own crippling health conditions He underwent spinal surgery in 2022 following years of chronic back pain and previously had a double-hip replacement in 2016 He eventually discovered it was three slipped discs that affected the movement of his right leg The horrific accident could easily have killed him. Instead, he emerged with a broken shoulder, and his legs further weakened. The former This Morning host admitted at the time that fracturing his shoulder in a fall is a 'massive setback'. A year after his spinal surgery, Eamonn underwent a spine and neck stretching procedure in September 2023 after admitting he 'couldn't walk'. Eamonn admitted he 'hadn't recovered' from his back surgery, confessing: 'I can't run, I can't walk, I can't do anything except watch TV and eat.' He explained: 'I just got problems last year in my back, which I haven't recovered from. It's not good, it's not a good recipe I have to say.' Now, Eamonn is focusing on his recovery following years of different health woes and operations. Ruth recently revealed she fears Eamonn 'might never be 100 per cent right'. He is having daily physio sessions and either uses a cane or wheelchair to get about, with the support of his wife Ruth. The Loose Women presenter said she 'lives in hope' that his mobility will improve. Speaking to Woman's Weekly, Ruth said: 'I don't know how much Eamonn's mobility will improve. We live in hope. 'He does the physio, but there might have to be some acceptance that this might never be 100% right. With any care situation - and there are millions of carers in this country - it isn't always easy. It's testing but we manage as a family.' Ruth added: 'I look at Eamonn, who's had his health and back problems, and it makes you realise how important your health is.' The former This Morning host admitted at the time that fracturing his shoulder in a fall is a 'massive setback' A year after his spinal surgery, Eamonn underwent a spine and neck stretching procedure in September 2023 after admitting he 'couldn't walk' He has ongoing daily physio sessions and either uses a cane or wheelchair to get about, with the support of his wife Ruth Earlier this year, Eamonn revealed he had to sell his beloved house in east Belfast to pay off a huge bill after a £250,000 tax battle with HMRC . The TV presenter admitted he feels 'bitter' about having to sell his house after losing two appeals against HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) which set him back 'hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees'. Speaking in an interview with his former UTV colleague Gerry Kelly, due to be screened next month, Eamonn claimed tax officials ruled he was a staff member with broadcasters rather than freelance. They allegedly asked for 10 years of retrospective tax and national insurance payments from him. He claims he never received holiday or sick pay, though he said he wasn't looking for sympathy. 'It's like they have taken away everything I ever worked for,' he tells the show on NVTV. Read More Inside Eamonn and Ruth's love story: From dating in secret to romantic wedding - A look back at their relationship as they are set to divorce In response Eamonn's tax battle, a HMRC spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We take the wellbeing of all taxpayers seriously and do everything we can for those who engage with us to get their tax affairs in order, including by offering affordable payment plans.' And now, after losing his mother, jobs and his home, Eamonn has lost his supportive wife Ruth. The TV power couple, both 64, announced their split on Saturday after work commitments had taken their lives 'in different directions'. It brings to an end one of Britain's best known TV power couples after 27 years together, 14 of which were spent in wedlock. They are parents to son Jack, 22, while Eamonn also has sons Declan, 35, Niall, 31, and daughter Rebecca, 33, from his previous marriage. Eamonn used his presenting slot on GB News's breakfast programme to break his silence over his divorce from wife Ruth on Tuesday. Eamonn had posted on Instagram about the FA Cup over the weekend following the issuing of the statement - but his comments on GB News' breakfast programme on Tuesday are his first words issued publicly on the split since. Accompanied by co-host Isabel Webster, who smiled and nodded supportively as he spoke, the TV veteran thanked viewers for the 'support' they had shown him since the weekend. He said: 'Just before we move on we'd just like to thank people for your support for Ruth and I over the last few days as to the news of our separation. 'Your support for both of us is very much appreciated.' Eamonn and Ruth hosted This Morning together for 14 years, and were a fixture on the show both on Fridays and during the school holidays (pictured in 2007) The couple tied the knot in 2010 after dating for 13 years - and say that despite their separation, they are 'determined to stay friends' (pictured together in 2022) Eamonn and Ruth said in Saturday's statement they were 'determined to stay friends' after spending most of their professional lives together. However, sources say Ruth 'orchestrated' the statement, which Eamonn refused to sign off on prior to its release. Sources told Mail+ that Eamonn is devastated about the split and that the break-up has 'very much been orchestrated by Ruth'. Eamonn reportedly told friends that he 'didn't want to get involved' and that 'Ruth can do what she wants but keep me out of it'. Fans of the pair - a familiar sight on This Morning for 15 years - have been poring over past remarks they have made on relationships, including on couples who stay friends after breaking up. During an interview on TalkTV during the Covid-19 lockdown, Eamonn explained he and Ruth were struggling with not having their own space. He said: 'Although we live together, we're not really together, we don't watch the same TV, Ruth likes her own space. When we do This Morning it's a rare time we actually interrelate.' Ruth added: 'That's why we've been together 24 years, because we aren't actually together a lot.' Elsewhere in another resurfaced clip, Eamonn and Ruth discussed staying friends with an ex. The former This Morning hosts discussed whether they could stay friends with a former partner in a discussion on the popular ITV daytime show back in a clip from 2018. They were joined by Anthea Turner and journalist Nilufer Atik. Eamonn said on the topic: 'It is easier to stay friends.' While Ruth had a different opinion, saying: 'Why would you need to stay friends, you aren't with them anymore, you don't need to be friends. 'My thing is you weren't just friends, you were married or had a relationship.' The TV couple, who friends say were 'as close to Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan as you could get', had sparked rumours of a split after not appearing on each other's Instagram accounts for months. They first met in through a mutual friend, GMTV star Sally Meen, while Eamonn was also on the show in 1997. Two years later, he had split from his first wife Gabrielle Holmes, the mother of his three eldest children. And despite the pair feeling an instant connection, he ensured it was the nation's best-kept secret, as he did not publicly confess his love for Ruth for two years. Eamonn (pictured with GB News co-host Isabel Webster) broke his silence on his separation from Ruth on Tuesday A spokesperson for the couple said: 'Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing' Eamonn even refused to hold her hand in public or attend events together for the first few years of their relationship in a bid to stay respectful to his ex of nearly 20 years. They eventually tied the knot in 2010 after 13 years together, in a lavish ceremony at the grand 19th century Hampshire hotel, The Elvetham. Among those on the guestlist were TV presenters Gloria Hunniford and Jeremy Kyle, EastEnders actress Zoe Lucker and former champion boxer Barry McGuigan. And while they had shared a lavish £3.2million mansion in Surrey, Eamonn is believed to have moved out before the break-up was announced. Their split comes just days after Ruth revealed she fears Eamonn 'might never be 100 per cent right' after undergoing back surgery due to suffering chronic back pain for almost two years. The GB News breakfast presenter is still recovering from the surgery and an injury to his shoulder, which saw him take four months off work at the end of last year. Eamonn and Ruth left the programme in 2021 after their contract lapsed and were replaced by Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond. The duo have also presented a number of other shows together including How The Other Half Lives, Do The Right Thing With Eamonn And Ruth and Eamonn And Ruth's 7 Year Itch. Holmes, who has also fronted coverage on GMTV and Sky News' Sunrise, launched Breakfast With Eamonn and Isabel on GB News in January 2022. Langsford regularly presents Loose Women, having begun on the show in the 1990s.

Image: Facebook/FAMAS Piolo Pascual confessed that he was drunk in his acceptance speech for Best Actor at the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Awards (FAMAS) awards although he managed to make it through his speech. A laughing Pascual revealed this upon accepting his Best Actor trophy for his performance in the film “Mallari” at the star-studded event last Sunday, May 25, as seen in a video recorded by one @trixie_dauz on X (formerly Twitter). “Napakabigat,” he began while referring to his trophy. “Maraming, maraming salamat po sa FAMAS. Unang-una, nais kong pasalamatan ang Panginoong Diyos sa karangalang ito because kung wala po ang Panginoong Diyos, wala po ako dito.” “And of course, my parents — Mommy Vi, Dad Bo,” he said, referring to his onscreen “parents,” Vilma Santos and Christopher de Leon, who starred with him in the film “Dekada ’70.” “They are my parents, they reared me in this business.” (The trophy is so heavy! Thank you very much to FAMAS. First of all, I want to thank the Lord for this award because if He wasn’t here, I wouldn’t be here either. And of course, my parents, Mommy Vi, and Dad Bo, they are my parents, they reared me in this business.)

However, he managed to thank the production team behind the film including director Derrick Cabrido and Mentorque Productions owner Bryan Diamante. “Marami po akong papasalamatan pero marami na rin po ako nainom tonight,” he said while laughing. Pascual then asked Diamante to go onstage while crediting the staff behind “Mallari.” “Sabi niya sa’kin I just want to make the best film of the year. And we won Best Picture. Gusto ko magpasalamat sa lahat ng bumubuo ng pelikulang ‘to. Marami pa akong gustong pasalamatan.” (I want to thank more people but I drank a lot tonight. Bryan Diamante told me he wanted to make the best film of the year. And we won Best Picture. I want to thank everyone behind the film. I want to thank more people.) A laughing Santos — who was standing at the side of the stage with de Leon — teased the drunk Pascual, saying, “Lasing ka na, anak. Lasing ka na, anak. Go ahead, anak.

Lahat po ng bumubuo ng ‘Mallari.’” “Pinaghirapan po namin ‘yung pelikulang ito at lahat po ng artista, pinaghirapan po nila ‘yung trabaho nila,” he continued. “So, maraming maraming salamat po. Hindi ko po ipagkakait sa sarili ko kasi para sa pelikulang Pilipino ito. Maraming salamat.

        "content": "Senator Joel Villanueva, a devout Christian and proud son of an evangelist, warns of the possible emergence of a “drive-thru” or express dissolution of marriage in the Philippines via the proposed divorce law. INQUIRER.net stock photo MANILA, Philippines — Senator Joel Villanueva, a devout Christian and proud son of an evangelist, warned of the possible emergence of a “drive-thru” or express dissolution of marriage in the Philippines. He raised the alarm as congressional debates and decisions on the Absolute Divorce Bill loom. “How can this affect our Filipino families? Baka ho magkaroon ng drive-thru. Lahat ng kanto dito sa Pilipinas. At ‘pag ang mag-asawa ay nagaway — ayaw lang ng bangs, ayaw lang ng shampoo, ayaw lang ng niluto ni misis — magaaway at maghihiwalay. Eh baka ho hindi tayo ready doon,” Villanueva told reporters in an ambush interview on Tuesday. (How can this affect our Filipino families? Maybe there will be a drive-thru. In every street in the Philippines. And whenever a married couple argues — just because of undesirable bangs, shampoo, or meals cooked by the wife — a fight will happen and then they’ll divorce. Maybe we are not ready for that.) READ: How House members voted on divorce bill The House of Representatives, before adjourning its second regular session on May 22, approved the contentious divorce bill. The lower chamber initially reported that 126 lawmakers voted in favor of the proposed divorce law and that 109 House members voted against while 20 members abstained from voting. “Ginagalang namin ang posisyon ng House despite the fact na napaka-questionable ng nangyaring botohan. But it’s on their turf at hindi namin pakikialaman po ‘yun,” Villanueva said. ( We respect the position of the House despite the fact that the voting that happened is very questionable. But it’s on their turf and we won’t interfere with that .) Instead, the senator asked their counterparts in the lower chamber to respect the Senate’s time to study the proposed divorce law. READ: Estrada’s survey shows tight tally on divorce bill at Senate Still, Villanueva stressed he could not see how the divorce bill would help poor Filipinos. “Parang sinasabi pa rin na kagaya ng annulment, ito ay para sa mayayaman pa rin,” he said. (It’s like saying that similar to annulment, it’s still for the rich.) “Kami po sa Senado ay willing i-scrutinize at pag-aralang mabuti kung ano ang magiging epekto nito, ano ang magiging epekto sa Family Code, anong magiging epekto nito sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino — na tayo majority ay Kristiyano,” he emphasized. (We in the Senate are willing to scrutinize and study carefully what will be the effect of this, what will be the effect on the Family Code, what will be the effect on every Filipino family — that we are mostly Christians.) To support his argument, Villanueva said majority of Filipinos believe in the holy sacrament of marriage. He even quoted the Book of Malachi in the Bible, pointing out that God made a categorical statement against divorce. “So, kung ang Diyos mo sinasabi na: ‘I hate divorce,’ ‘yung Diyos mo na author ng Word of God na sinasabi ng Constitution doon sa preamble — “that we the sovereign Filipino people, imploring the aid of almighty God,” – who is this God that we are referring to? Is this the same God who said I hate divorce and now we are passing a measure that would promote divorce?,” he asked. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) TOKYO — Shares were mixed in Asia on Tuesday after markets in the U.S. and Britain were closed for holidays. Oil prices and U.S. futures were higher. Chinese markets rose after senior leaders of the ruling Communist Party met and affirmed Beijing’s determination to contain financial risks. Hong Kong’s benchmark was buoyed by gains for technology shares. On Monday, European shares posted modest gains as markets were lifted by a rebound on Wall Street on Friday following its worst day since April. Early Tuesday, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to 38,783.27 and the Kospi in Seoul inched 0.1 percent higher, to 2,724.35. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.2 percent to 7,771.90. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1 percent higher, to 3,127.67. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.5 percent to 18,923.93. READ: Shanghai lifts home-buying curbs to boost property sector The Chinese government recently eased interest rates and down payment requirements for housing loans as part of its effort to revive the property sector after a crackdown on excessive borrowing caused defaults among many developers. The housing industry plays a huge role in driving the economy and its troubles have weighed on growth. The meetings Monday led by Chinese President Xi Jinping “noted that preventing and defusing financial risks is a major challenge that must be overcome to achieve high-quality development, as it concerns national security, overall development and the safety of the people’s property,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Efforts to strengthen oversight “should be implemented strictly to send a strong signal that any violator will be held accountable so that financial oversight will have ‘teeth and thorns’ and be sharp-pointed,” Xinhua said. On Friday, the S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by less than 0.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.1 percent to top its all-time high set earlier last week. READ: Nasdaq sets another record as Wall Street wins back earlier losses In other trading Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $1.14 to $78.86 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. “The tense geopolitical setup is supportive of further gains along with the rising U.S. demand into summer and OPEC’s restrictive tone regarding its outlook,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya of Swissquote said in a commentary. Brent crude, the international standard, added 13 cents to $83.01 per barrel. In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar slipped to 156.74 Japanese yen from 156.89 yen.

The framework, called Metro Manila Road Safety Action Plan (MMRSAP) 2024-2028, was formed after a three-day stakeholders’ meeting which was part of the celebration of Philippine Road Safety Month, the MMDA said in a statement on Tuesday. READ: DOH: 12,000 killed on roads each year It is also a component of Project 6: Traffic Safety and Education under the 5-Year Action Plan of the Comprehensive Traffic Management Plan for Metro Manila, funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. According to the agency’s Metro Manila Accident Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS), there were about 92,583 road crashes recorded annually from 2013 to 2022, with an average of 410 deaths each year. Fifty-one percent of these fatalities were drivers, 36 percent were pedestrians, and 13 percent were passengers. This prompted the MMDA and other various agencies to establish the MMRSAP 2024-2028, which focuses on the five pillars of road safety: road safety management, safer roads, safer vehicles, safer road users, and post-crash response. READ: Higher jaywalking fines overlook sensible road safety steps “Inspired by our discussions and dialogue, we are poised to forge ahead in crafting a comprehensive action plan that will pave the way for safer and more efficient road systems in Metro Manila. Together, we have the power to effect positive change and create a safer environment for motorists, pedestrians, and commuters alike,” said MMDA Assistant General Manager for Planning OIC Atty. Victor Pablo Trinidad in his speech, as quoted in the statement. Meanwhile, World Health Organization Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rui Paulo de Jesus stressed that road safety is a shared responsibility that requires multisectoral actions from concerned agencies. “The Road Safety Action Plan for Metro Manila 2024-2028 that is being developed will provide a blueprint for evidence-based interventions to save lives and prevent serious injuries from road crashes in Metro Manila,” he said. Also present at the meeting were representatives from Metro Manila’s local government units, the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Department of Health, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, the Land Transportation Office, the Philippine National Police-National Capital Region Police Office, the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, and the University of the Philippines-National Center for Transportation Studies.

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea — Children’s products sold by the Chinese-founded online shopping giant Shein contained toxic substances in amounts hundreds of times above acceptable levels, the government of South Korea’s capital Seoul said Tuesday. Shein, headquartered in Singapore, has skyrocketed in popularity around the world in recent years, offering a vast selection of trendy clothes and accessories at stunningly low prices. This explosive growth has also led to increased scrutiny of its business practices and safety standards, including in the European Union and South Korea — where Seoul authorities have been conducting weekly inspections of items sold by platforms including Shein, Temu, and AliExpress. In the latest round, they selected eight products sold by Shein, including children’s shoes, leather bags, and a belt, and found several to contain high amounts of phthalates — chemicals used to soften plastics. One pair of shoes contained 428 times the permitted levels of phthalates — the highest observed so far during the Seoul inspections — and three bags had amounts as high as 153 times the limit, the city government said. Phthalates are widely used to soften plastic and are found in thousands of products including containers, beauty products, and toys. However, they have been known for decades to cause hormone disruptions and have been linked to obesity, heart disease, some cancers, and fertility problems. READ: Online retailer Shein is latest to face strict EU digital regulations Seoul city official Park Sang-jin told AFP that they have requested a removal of these products from sale, and said that since the city began inspections in April, most platforms have complied with such requests. AFP has reached out to Shein for comment. So far, Seoul authorities said they have inspected 93 products and found that almost half of them contained toxic substances. These items include children’s watches and coloring pencils. Last month, the European Union added Shein to its list of digital firms that are big enough to come under stricter safety rules — including measures to protect customers from unsafe products, especially those that could be harmful to minors. Shein and Temu have followed Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba in challenging Amazon, especially by making inroads in the US market. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "In this file photo, a patient undergoes dialysis at a clinic. (AP) MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is studying a proposal to increase its dialysis package to P5,200 per session so that medications needed for the procedure will also be covered. Eli Dino Santos, PhilHealth executive vice president, said in an interview on Tuesday after meeting with ACT-CIS party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo that they will study the increase in per session coverage—currently at P2,600. Santos said this after Tulfo noted that hemodialysis medicines used for the procedure cost around P900 to P1,500 per vial. “So now, through the efforts of our Cong. Erwin Tulfo, PhilHealth, will study the increase (of the coverage) to P5,200. We will study this and we are given one month to study this. And then, we can cover all medicines. That’s our goal, and that’s the directive of Cong. Erwin Tulfo,” Santos told reporters at a briefing at the Batasang Pambansa complex. “Our goal is that our dialysis patients will no longer make out of pocket [...] With the specifics to the medicine, I have no data about that, but what they usually buy is erythropoietin, which patients usually buy outside of a (hemodialysis) facility. This is what usually adds up to the expense of patients,” he added. Tulfo explained that the P2,600 package supposedly includes the medicines, but these are only provided in government hospitals, which means patients have to buy these vials first before getting a hemodialysis treatment. “Little did we know that it is included in the package of PhilHealth worth P2,600, it is included there but there are hospitals, facilities, and dialysis centers without these medicines. So what will happen now is that PhilHealth will be given one month to study it, as per the instruction of the Speaker (Ferdinand Martin Romualdez),” Tulfo said. “We brought this up because there are diabetes patients who told the Office of the Speaker that they are having problems with buying medicines, that’s why they have approached congressmen, mayors, senators. So to solve this problem what PhilHealth will do is to double the P2,600 package for dialysis, it is now P5,200 so that it will be all-in,” he added. Santos meanwhile assured that PhilHealth has enough funds for a possible higher benefit provision, with total assets — excluding obligations like outstanding payments to hospitals — amounting to P589.5 billion. This includes a P463.7 billion reserve fund. Last June 2023, PhilHealth increased its hemodialysis coverage from 144 sessions to 156 sessions — or twelve more additional sessions.

MONTEGRANDE) MANILA, Philippines — The personal assistant of embattled Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC) founder Apollo Quiboloy surrendered 21 firearms in Davao City, according to the Philippine National Police. The PNP said 21 firearms belonging to Cresente Chavez Canada, also the Barangay Tamayong captain, were surrendered through a lawyer at KOJC Compound along the Phil-Japan Friendship Highway in Barangay Sasa at about 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. In April, Canada surrendered to authorities but later posted bail. He was charged with violation of Republic Act 7610 or the Anti-Child Abuse Law, specifically the provision on sexual abuse of minors and maltreatment. All surrendered firearms, many of which are high-powered, are now in the custody of Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) in Davao City for proper documentation and disposition. The PNP said CIDG Director Police Major General Leo Francisco “expressed gratitude to KOJC for their support and stressed the importance of voluntary surrenders in maintaining peace.” These guns are on top of the initial five firearms which were surrendered by Quiboloy’s camp following the order canceling his license to own and possess firearms (LTOPF) from PNP chief General Rommel Marbil. The Firearms and Explosives Office of the PNP released its recommendation to revoke the LTOPF of the self-proclaimed “appointed son of god” after Senator Risa Hontiveros insisted that the religious leader is “armed and dangerous.” Two separately-issued arrest orders for Quiboloy are in effect for sexual abuse and human trafficking charges. Apart from these cases, a warrant of arrest issued by the Senate panel on women headed by Hontiveros had also been released. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING Jimmy Kimmel revealed on Instagram on Monday that his 7-year-old son Billy had successfully undergone a third — and what the late-night host said will hopefully be his final — open-heart surgery. “We went into this experience with a lot of optimism and nearly as much fear and came out with a new valve inside a happy, healthy kid,” Kimmel captioned a photo of Billy in his hospital bed. Advertisement “Thank you to my wife Molly [McNearney] for being stronger than is reasonable for any Mom to be and Billy, you are the toughest (and funniest) 7 year-old we know,” he added. Kimmel also expressed his gratitude to the medical team at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. See the full post here: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) Billy was born in 2017 with a rare heart condition known as etralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia . He underwent emergency open-heart surgery at just three days old and then had another major operation at eight months old. Advertisement Kimmel’s emotional recollection on his “Jimmy Kimmel Live” show of his son’s first few days — which included a passionate plea to Congress to ensure universal access to health care and a condemnation of then-President Donald Trump ’s proposed health care funding cuts — went viral. “If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make,” Kimmel said at the time. “I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?” “We need to make sure that the people who are supposed to represent us ― the people who are meeting about this right now in Washington ― understand that very clearly,” he added. “Let’s stop with the nonsense. This isn’t football. There are no teams. We are the team. It’s the United States. Don’t let their partisan squabbles divide us on something every decent person wants.” Watch Kimmel’s monologue from 2017 here: Kimmel’s message drew praise from former President Barack Obama , who wrote on X-then-Twitter that it was “exactly why we fought so hard for the ACA, and why we need to protect it for kids like Billy.” Advertisement Well said, Jimmy. That's exactly why we fought so hard for the ACA, and why we need to protect it for kids like Billy.

        "content": "British travellers admit to experiencing around 2-3 hours of idle downtime when flying long haul, potentially leading to a combined 1100 hours to fill in the sky, across all passengers on a flight to Hong Kong. Premium airline, Cathay Pacific, polled the nation to find out what Brits really get up to when flying and encourage travellers to make the minutes count while in the air. Nearly half of Britons (43%) admit to preferring long-haul flights but over a third (37%) struggle to fill their time during the flight. Research released today by Cathay Pacific to encourage passengers to make the minutes count while flying long-haul in 2024. When thinking of their next trip, nearly half of Britons (43%) admit to preferring long-haul flights over short, however, 40 percent admit to not utilising their time when onboard. Some flyers prefer to not fill their time and are looking for quiet spaces (58%), lack of responsibilities (49%), and quality service (32%) to unlock their ‘me-time’ when travelling. Watching films (66%), catching up on sleep (54%), and indulging in inflight dining (50%) came out on top with the general population, whereas more women are reaching for their favourite books (55%). The Scots admit to using their time to release their creative spark with over a quarter sketching in the sky (27%). Nearly a third of Mancunians like to challenge their brains with puzzle books (27%) while over 30 percent of Yorkshire respondents love people watching (31%). The free time during long haul flights can seem overwhelming as over a third of travellers (37%) admit to feeling frustrated as to how to fill their time. Cathay Pacific is sharing tips for travellers to make the most of their long-haul journey through interesting and unusual methods: Walk this way – One-fifth (19%) prefer to get moving on the plane, and with no external factors limiting flyers they could walk the distance of the London Marathon in under 7 hours by simply walking up and down the aisles 1,169 times. Alternatively, one in five (20%) love to stretch during the flight so Inflight yoga and stretch programs are effective, and the benefits of exercise continue to pay off once you arrive. Screen queen : Watching films came out on top with more than 3 in 5 Britons (66%) enjoying the time to catch up on old classics or new releases. Film buffs could use the time to polish off the original Lord of The Rings trilogy which runs for 11.2 hours. Football fans could watch just under seven of their team’s matches on the Live Sport 24 platform. Alternatively, flyers can binge-watch over 30 episodes of the comedy series The Simpsons guilt-free on Cathay Pacific’s onboard Disney+. Page turner: Nearly half (46%) reach for a good book when on a long-haul flight. The average reader can consume up to 238 words per minute or 14,28 per hour, meaning passengers can read the first two Harry Potter books cover to cover in a single flight to Hong Kong. Woolly wonder – Just under 5 percent (3%) of flyers admitted to being keen-knitters. While up in the clouds they would have enough time to knit one-quarter of a sweater or nearly a complete pair of socks when they arrive in Hong Kong. Cleanse the skin or soul – Gen Z uses the flight time to reset in ways that suit them. For one-tenth of Gen Z, it’s face masking to cleanse and cover up the jet lag, while nearly one-fifth (18%) prefer a digital cleanse by getting rid of old pictures and deleting old contacts from their phone while up in the air. Snooze away the stress – Sometimes you just need to rest and there is nothing wrong with a 12-hour snooze. 80 percent of those surveyed prioritised comfortable seating so experience greater comfort than ever with Cathay Pacific. Ergonomically designed with cushioning and an adjustable headrest to provide maximum support. The ample legroom means passengers can stretch out during their journey. Cathay Pacific is deeply rooted in customer service and passenger satisfaction with award-winning inflight entertainment and appetising food and beverage offerings including Michelin-starred partnerships and plant-forward menus.

        "description": "The NFF has had to refute an online report that the Super Eagles players were still being owed bonuses from the last AFCON tournamentThe post NFF, Super Eagles discredit report of unpaid bonuses, allowances appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and players of the Super Eagles have lambasted a report in an online publication, which claimed that players have not been paid from monies given by the Presidency to the NFF to offset their bonuses and allowances. The Presidency had, late last year, following a process supported and followed through by the Minister of Sports Development, John Enoh, released monies to the NFF to pay outstanding bonuses and allowances of players and officials of the various national teams. However, the said online publication on Monday put together what a senior administrative official of the Super Eagles described as “tissues of lies” and challenged the writer to come forward with evidence of his claims. “The report is absolutely false, in every ramification, and we challenge the owner of the website and writer to come forward with proof of the claims. We want him to name the players who spoke to him because these are all tissues of lies. “Players and officials of the Super Eagles have been paid for all matches played at the AFCON, yet he claimed the team was paid for only three matches. His outlandish claim of the team being owed for 25 matches is the biggest lie ever concocted by any writer.” The writer also claimed that only members of the NFF Board and staff of the secretariat have been paid their outstanding allowances from government money. “This story is a shame. No player of the Super Eagles spoke to the writer. It is all pure fabrication,” a senior player told thenff.com .

        "content": "Long-life mortgage calculator: How much would stretching the term really cost you?

But while doing so will reduce their monthly payments now, it could land them more than £100,000 extra interest, as our mortgage cost calculator shows. The days of the 25-year mortgage being standard have long gone and many first-time buyers and home movers are now taking on 30, 35 and even 40-year mortgages. Extending the term helps borrowers lower monthly payments to meet affordability criteria but over the lifetime of the mortgage they will pay much more in interest. For example, a £200,000 mortgage with an average rate of 5 per cent over 25 years will cost £150,754 in interest but over 40 years it would see £262,909 in interest charges rack up. Our calculator lets you compare the true cost of rival mortgages and shows how much more interest you would pay with a 40-year mortgage than a 30-year or 25-year home loan. Compare true mortgage costs Work out mortgage costs and check what the real best deal taking into account rates and fees.

According to Xpeng's official data, as of October 7, 2023, of the orders for 15,000 2024 G9 cars in total, the MAX edition equipped with XNGP, Xpeng's advanced intelligent driving system, as a standard configuration, swept more than 80%. The following are the results of the First China Intelligent Driving Competition held by D1EV: Shenzhen Urban NOA List: first place: Xpeng G6; second place: Avatr 11; third place: ARCFOX ?S HI Edition; fourth place: AITO M5. Shenzhen Highway NOA List: champion: ARCFOX ?S; runner-up: AITO M5; third runner-up: Hyper GT. Shanghai Urban NOA List: first place: Xpeng G6; second place: Jiyue 01; third place: ARCFOX ?S HI Edition; fourth place: Avatr 11; fifth place: AITO M5. Shanghai Highway NOA List: champion: AITO M5; runner-up: Xpeng G6; third runner-up: Neta S. Guangzhou Highway NOA List: first place: Xpeng G6; second place: AITO M5; third place: Avatr 11. It can be seen that the NOA of Xpeng G6 is in a leading position in China. Xpeng is the first in China to use a 12000T ultra-large die-casting machine to realize CIB battery body integration design. Xpeng's integrated die-casting and CIB battery body integration design enhance chassis protection while saving vertical space, improving safety and riding comfort. The front and rear integrated aluminum die-casting technology has a torsional stiffness of up to 42,000Nm/deg, up 83%, and integrates 161 components, reducing the body weight by 17%. He Xiaopeng, president and CEO of Xpeng, said that Xpeng now has the world's only 12000T ultra-large die-casting machine, and will soon expand a 16000T die-casting machine to support the production of larger die-cast parts. At present, Xpeng is developing CIB + center floor integrated die-casting technology, which can increase cruising range by 5% and lower overall manufacturing cost by 10%-30%. At the Guangzhou factory, Xpeng and Guangdong Hongtu Technology adopted a new cooperation model of building 'factory in factory' to speed up the application of integrated die-cast parts in automobiles. Guangdong Hongtu Technology has received the notifications of designating integrated die-cast products from multiple customers including Xpeng and other new energy vehicle brands and conventional automakers. Xpeng has secured orders for 100 flying cars From 2013 to 2023, XPeng AeroHT, an arm of Xpeng, developed six generations of flying cars. In October 2023, Xpeng AeroHT introduced two flying cars at Xpeng 1024 Tech Day: a split configuration and an air-ground integrated configuration. Wherein, the split configuration is named \"Modular Flying Car\", consisting of two parts, air module and ground module which can automatically separate and combine. On December 1, 2023, Jiaxing Nanhu District Road-Air Cooperative Three-Dimensional Transportation Industry Research Institute signed a reservation agreement with Xpeng AeroHT, planning to order 100 Modular Flying Cars used for comprehensive management of transportation such as highways and waterways, as well as flying camp experience and site connection transport. To enhance flying car safety, Xpeng AeroHT independently developed the multi-parachute rescue system. In October 2023, this technology was installed on XPENG X2 and successfully completed a 50-meter ultra-low-altitude parachuting test, filling a gap in ultra-low-altitude rescues. In early October 2023, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Finance, and the Civil Aviation Administration jointly issued the Outline for the Development of Green Aviation Manufacturing Industry (2023-2035), specifying the development timetable of eVTOL: by 2025, electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircrafts will be piloted; by 2035, new energy aircrafts will become mainstream. In the summary of Xpeng's development history in Electrification, Connectivity, Intelligence and Sharing, it can be seen that despite a very low gross margin, Xpeng has won recognition and support from all parties by virtue of its great innovation strength and leading technologies. For example, Volkswagen invested RMB5 billion in Xpeng.

Tempo English on Sunday, May 26, 2024, compiled the top 3 news on the platform. Israeli forces killed more than 30 people in new attacks in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian medics said on Saturday. ICJ ordered Israel on Friday to halt its offensive in Rafah. Palestinians need an immediate halt to the war and they want to see action to achieve it. Simultaneous Israeli assaults on the northern and southern edges of Gaza this month have caused a new exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The Malaysian government is trying to bring home six members of its medical team who have been in Rafah, Gaza, since May 1, 2024. International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. UNRWA states that as many as 800,000 people were forced to leave Rafah since Israel attacked and invaded their homeland.",

        "content": "Garmin is pushing out a new software update that will help you find a missing phone, no matter how far away you dropped it, or put it down. Software version 19.18 is rolling out now to Garmin Forerunner 965 owners, and will hopefully be coming to even more devices in the near future. If you own a , you're probably already familiar with the basic Find My Phone feature, which helps you track down a missing handset that's relatively nearby. Provided your phone is within Bluetooth range, it will guide you towards it by indicating whether you're getting hotter or colder (moving closer or further away) and making the phone emit a loud chime. It works brilliantly if your phone is only a few meters away, but it's not going to help if your handset fell out of your pocket while you were having lunch, or you left it in the changing room at the gym. The new feature works differently, working out the last point at which your watch had a Bluetooth connection to your smartphone and plotting a route back to that point. Once there, you should (hopefully) be able to reconnect, and use the other Find My Phone tool to find exactly where it is. Unlike something like a Tile tracker or Apple AirTag, it won't let you see your phone's location if it's been moved or stolen, but provided the handset is where you left it, you should be quickly reunited. As Alex Alderson of explains, software version 19.18 also adds a bundle of other features and fixes, such as pin drop navigation (which lets you send and share locations from Apple Maps) and the ability to switch dynamically between your watch's heart rate sensor and a chest strap , depending on which is providing the most stable signal. The update also solves a problem that meant jump rope activities would sometimes fail to upload correctly, and one where activity profiles would sometimes appear in a different order on your watch face, and on the Garmin Connect mobile app. For a complete list of changes, . The software should be rolled out to your watch automatically via Garmin Connect, but you can also activate the update manually by pressing the Menu button then selecting System > Software Update > Check For Updates.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email So, you’ve decided to upgrade your home heating system to an air-to-water heat pump. Exciting times ahead! But before you dive headfirst into the installation process, there are a few important steps to take to ensure everything goes smoothly. Let’s go through the essential preparations you need to make to get your home ready for your new heat pump. Assessing Your Home’s Heating Needs First things first, let’s take a moment to assess your home’s heating requirements. Every home is unique, and understanding your specific needs is crucial for a successful installation. Consider factors like the size of your home, its insulation levels, and any existing heating infrastructure you may have. This assessment will help determine the size and capacity of the heat pump needed to keep your home comfortable throughout the year. Choosing the Right Location for the Heat Pump Now that you have a better idea of your heating needs, it’s time to decide where to place the heat pump units. For the indoor unit, look for a location with ample space, good airflow, and minimal obstructions. You’ll also want to consider noise levels, so opt for a spot away from bedrooms or living areas where quiet is appreciated. As for the outdoor unit, choose a location that’s easily accessible to HVAC technicians for maintenance but also aesthetically pleasing and out of the way. Then, you can begin your search for advanced and cost effective air source heat pumps . Ensuring Proper Insulation and Weatherproofing A well-insulated home is essential for maximising the efficiency of your air-to-water heat pump. Take some time to assess the insulation levels in your walls, floors, and attic, and make any necessary upgrades or improvements. Additionally, check for drafts and seal any gaps or cracks to prevent heat loss and ensure your home stays cosy when the temperatures drop. Upgrading Electrical Wiring and Infrastructure Next up, it’s crucial to ensure that your home’s electrical system can handle the power requirements of the heat pump. Consult with an electrician to determine if any upgrades or modifications are needed to your electrical panel or wiring. This will help prevent any issues or disruptions once the heat pump is up and running, ensuring a seamless transition to your new heating system. Addressing Ventilation and Air Quality Proper ventilation is key to maintaining good indoor air quality and ensuring the efficient operation of your heat pump.

        "content": "Three Americans and a man said to be a British citizen may face death sentences after a failed coup attempt in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) . The four, who tried to overthrow the president of the country in central Africa, were arrested and have been cooperating with investigators at a secure location. They will be \"handed to a military tribunal\" and dealt with like any other enemy of the state, a military official said. Major General Sylvain Ekenge said: \"The interrogation continues. After that they will be dealt with by and handed to a military tribunal, not the regular court. They must be judged here in Congo.\" READ MORE: Lucky man avoids taking part in failed coup after choosing to stay in with his girlfriend Coup leader Christian Malanga with Marcel inside the presidential palace The military spokesman said he did not know if the death penalty could be applied to the four men, but said it applies \"in the context of the military and those who take up arms in the rebellion.\" Marcel Malanga, Tyler Thompson, Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun and Ezangi Youssouf were involved in the failed coup attempt pushed by Christian Malanga, a self-styled opposition who lived living in Utah and was killed while resisting arrest. Malanga, his son Marcel, and their group of around 20 men are said to have tried to force their way into the government complex. Six people were killed during the failed coup attempt in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in the early hours of May 19. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . The mothers of 21-year-old Marcel and Thompson pleaded their sons' cases saying they were duped into taking part, but Ekenge said that even if they were not masterminds, they \"ended up with weapons in their hands and ammunition and wearing uniforms at the Palais de la Nation.\" Ekenge added: \"If their sons were misled, that is not our business. They were among a force led by Christian Malanga who proclaimed himself president of the republic that killed police officers, stole a car and killed the owner.\" Felix Tshisekedi was reelected as president of Congo in December in a chaotic vote amid calls for a revote from the opposition over what they said was a lack of transparency. The Central African country has witnessed similar trends of disputed elections in the past. The suspects cower in fear after their arrest The four men are being interrogated Thompson had played high school football with Marcel in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan and was the only former teammate to accept his invitation to travel to Congo, according to several other players who said they had been invited. Marcel had pitched the trip to many of his high school friends in the months leading up to the foiled coup attempt. Some said he had invited them on a family vacation, while others, including former football teammate Jaden Lalor, said he had pitched it as a service trip to build wells. Teammates recounted Marcel’s increasing desperation as friend after friend declined. Alleged Brit Ezangi Youssou took part in the failed coup \"He did call me to ask if I wanted to go to Africa for vacation, as well as a few of my other friends, but he did not offer to take more than a single one of us at a time,\" said Luke Barbee, another former teammate who lived with Marcel last year. \"He only asked so many of us because he kept getting denied until Tyler said yes to the trip.\" Youssouf, who has been described as British by Congolese authorities and reportedly lives in London, said he had been told by Malanga that the plan had \"American backing\". The gunmen live-streamed the short rebellion at the Palais de la Nation. They filmed themselves waving the flag of Zaire, the name of the DRC while former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was in power, before being overthrown in 1997.",

        "content": "Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi,on Monday, posited that State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) should be dispensed with. Speaking at a one-day discourse, Fagbemi also posited that the powers of SIECs should be transferred to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The discourse with the theme: ‘Nigeria’s Security Challenges And Good Governance At The Local Government Levels’ was organised by the House of Representatives. According to him, Governors have exploited the flaws in certain sections of the 1999 constitution, effectively rendering Local Governments powerless and irrelevant. The Justice Minister noted that these inadequacies have allowed the Governors to abuse the rights of Local Governments by using SIECs to impose leaders on them through sham elections. READ ALSO: Nigeria Air Doesn’t Benefit Us, Remains Suspended — FG He said other Governors who do not conduct sham polls appoint vassals as caretaker leaders for the local governments. Fagbemi however called for a robust constitutional amendment that will remove all hindrances to the development of local governments, and bolster their ability to fulfil constitutionally recognised mandate. “To achieve this, many experts have proposed that there is need for the scrapping of the state independent electoral commission,” he said. “Their functions and powers should be transferred to the Independent National Electoral Commission because the state independent electoral commission remains an appendage to every incumbent governor. “This is perceived as the root cause of the problem of local government administration in Nigeria.”",

        "content": "Onyx Boox completed its latest Series B funding wherein it it has raised funds to the tune of tens of millions of US dollars. The Chinese company said it intends to use the funds for R&D purposes and launch new innovative products in the future. This, it hopes, will help it expand to more markets around the world. Among the prominent investors who have pooled in funds in this round include Lenovo Capital & Incubator Group (LCIG), E Ink Holdings Inc., and Cedarview Capital Management, to name a few. The company first started operations in 2008 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, China. It was founded by a team of professionals previously attached to companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and Google. The company went on to manufacture state-of-the-art E Ink devices such as e-readers though they subsequently branched out to make e-note devices as well. Onyx Boox Palma or the Note Air 3C are among the more popular devices in their respective segments. While the company initially targeted the domestic Chinese market for the first few years, it soon started to offer products aimed at the English-speaking population as well. As of now, they have one of the most diverse range of e-paper devices that span different size categories. They have emerged to become one of the largest players in the segment at the moment and have redefined the way users have come to interact with E Ink devices over the years. “We are thrilled to be backed by such a strong group of investors. Their invaluable resources and experience will be instrumental as we scale our technology development and market reach,” said Kim Dan, founder and CEO of Onyx BOOX. “We are committed to providing more innovative, high-quality, and high-performance ePaper devices for global users to make a difference in life. This commitment aligns with our mission to promote the ePaper industry’s development and set new benchmarks for quality and innovation.” Among the various features that has helped Onyx Boox products to stand out from the rest include its proprietary BOOX Super Refresh (BSR) technology. This allows for a quick and efficient page refresh cycle which ensures faster page turns while minimizing ghosting effects to almost being negligible. Another inherent positive with Onyx Boox devices is that they run Android open systems, which enables users to install the app of their own choice. This is unlike similar devices from Amazon or Kobo that are closely tied to their respective ecosystem. It is going to be interesting to see what other E Ink devices the company comes up with in the days ahead. With a keen interest in tech, I make it a point to keep myself updated on the latest developments in technology and gadgets. That includes smartphones or tablet devices but stretches to even AI and self-driven automobiles, the latter being my latest fad. Besides writing, I like watching videos, reading, listening to music, or experimenting with different recipes. The motion picture is another aspect that interests me a lot, and I'll likely make a film sometime in the future.",

        "description": "Port of Tyne has entered talks with LS Eco Advanced Cables about a long lease for the Tyne Renewable Quay site",
        "content": "An international alliance of offshore cable companies has revealed plans to create a £923m factory on Tyneside. UK-based Global InterConnection Group (GIG) and a subsidiary of Korean firm LS Group have formed a joint venture - LS Eco Advanced Cables - in a bid to set up a high voltage cable plant at the 11.7 hectare Tyne Renewable Quay site on the south bank of the Tyne. An exclusivity agreement has been reached with the Port of Tyne which will open the door to talks about securing a long lease for the location, which has a deep water berth on the river. LS Eco Advanced Cables says it is aiming to secure planning permission by the end of the year, with hopes the facility could start production in 2027. The alliance says the plant will feed the growing green energy market, providing high voltage direct current (HVDC) cables for electricity transmission for wind and solar farms. In an announcement to investors on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange, where Global InterConnection Group is listed, it said it had progressed design specifications for the factory and had enlisted \"strong national and local government support for the project\". The joint venture needs to raise £923m to fund the factory’s construction with an offer to (GIG) shareholders on a first refusal basis. Bosses say the demand for HVDC cables will escalate in coming years thanks to growth in the renewables market, electricity consumption more widely, and emphasis on energy security in national and international policy. They cite research from Goldman Sachs which suggests $128bn of investment is needed up to 2030 to service the demand. Global InterConnection Group is the holding company of Atlantic SuperConnection (ASC)- the business which is developing a 1,794MW, 1,708km interconnector between Iceland and the UK, with a national grid connection near Hull. The cable will bring geothermal and hydroelectric electricity to the UK, and take offshore wind power to the existing Icelandic hydro dams, with pumped storage ‘refuelling’ the dams to create a 1,500 MW ‘clean battery’. ASC hopes to raise £1.2bn of equity funding towards the project, with an initial £30m investment being made to bring it to a final investment decision before construction can start. But the business will first need to raise £3.5bn, with indications it has the support of an investment bank. In a message to shareholders, Global InterConnection Group said: \"The new factory will deliver a substantial positive impact both environmentally and socially. LS Eco Advanced Cables intends to secure planning permission by the end of this year, with fully CIGRE-certified production expected in 2027. \"By providing the high-voltage cables to deliver dependable zero carbon energy, LS Eco Advanced Cables will help address the electricity supply volatility from growing dependence on wind and solar; reduce the UK’s dependence on fossil fuels for peaking power; enhance energy security and reduce energy prices for UK consumers and businesses alike. HVDC cables reduce electricity transmission losses by at least 15% over even relatively short 150km cable lengths, compared to AC power cables.\"",

        "content": "A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Media Coalition and Awareness To Halt Trafficking (MeCAHT) has unveiled a documentary film \"I Wish I Knew\" aimed at educating Nigerians on dangers of human trafficking. The film, produced in collaboration with EXIST and funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, is geared towards combating human trafficking by sharing the harrowing stories of four survivors. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, the founder and international director of MeCAHT, Anne Abok, said \"I Wish I Knew\" exposes the methods used by traffickers and highlights strategies to combat this grave crime. She noted that the film holds a special place in her heart, as she has been dedicated to anti-human trafficking efforts since 2008. Abok said that leveraging her media background, she has used film and media training to raise awareness and support vulnerable communities. She stated that a pivotal moment in the creation of the documentary came when a returnee suggested that survivors share their personal stories. She stated that the film is intended to be more impactful than fictional narratives, offering real-life experiences to raise awareness and prevent further trafficking. She stressed that human trafficking is a rampant issue in Nigeria, a country that tragically contributes a significant number of sex slaves abroad. She noted that reports indicate that 80 percent of illegal prostitutes in Europe are from Nigeria, underscoring the critical need for increased awareness and action.

She called for an intersectional approach involving various sectors such as government, NGOs, the medical sector, financial institutions, and educational bodies. Quoting Nelson Mandela, she emphasised the necessity for genuine commitment: \"To be free doesn't mean casting off your chains but living in such a way that your life will enable the freedom of others.\" \"We must mean business and stand firm in our commitment to ending human trafficking. Modern slavery is a harsh reality, but by being truthful and dedicated, we can enable the freedom of others,\" she said. On his part, the representative of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Lowhun Debok, said human trafficking remains a grave issue in Nigeria and around the world. He said that despite ongoing efforts to combat it, this illicit trade continues to expand, driven by traffickers who prey on the vulnerable with false promises of a better life. \"Organisations like IOM and our partners, including MeCAHT, are working tirelessly to raise awareness about the dangers of human trafficking. However, it is crucial to amplify the voices of survivors and victims, as they can provide the most compelling testimonies of the abuse and trauma they have endured,\" he said.

        "content": "By Arushi Mishra Comments READ LATER BSE Sensex was up by 0.07 per cent or 52.35 points to 75,442.85, while the NSE Nifty was at 22,948.60 up by 0.07 per cent or 16.15 points. A total of 3,873 stocks were actively traded, 1,231 advanced, while 2,530 declined and 112 stocks remained unchanged when 164 stocks hit a 52-week high and 34 stocks hit a 52-week low at 1.31 pm on the BSE. The grammatical error is in the phrase “when 164 stocks hit a 52-week high and 34 stocks hit a 52-week low at 1.31 pm on the BSE.” It would be more grammatically correct to say: “At 1:31 pm on the BSE, 164 stocks hit a 52-week high, and 34 stocks hit a 52-week low.” Shrey Jain, Founder & CEO SAS Online - India’s Deep Discount Broker, said, “Yesterday, Nifty tested the 23,100 level but failed to maintain its gains and ended flat. Today, we expect Nifty to consolidate around the 23,000 level, as both the 23,000 Call and Put options have substantial open interest. Specifically, the 23,000 Call strike has significant open interest of approximately 64 lakh shares, while the 23,000 Put strike holds around 71 lakh shares in open interest. For Bank Nifty, the 49,000 Put strike has notable open interest, which is expected to provide support, whereas the 49,500 level is likely to act as a resistance. The volatility index continues to rise ahead of the election results, reaching 23.61. Until June 3rd, we can expect the market to exhibit rollercoaster-like fluctuations.” Major gainers on the NSE include Divi’s Lab (2.57 per cent), HDFC Life (2.05 per cent), Dr Reddy’s Lab (1.59 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (1.55 per cent), and SBI Life (1.44 per cent). Major losers include Adani Ports (-1.75 per cent), Power Grid (-1.32 per cent), C oal India (-1.21 per cent), BPCL (-1.08 per cent), and NTPC (-0.97 per cent). BSE Smallcap was down by 0.94 per cent, while BSE Midcap was down by 0.73 per cent. Comments",

        "content": "AMANDA Holden shares a snap with her lookalike daughter Hollie, 12, in a sweet video as they twin at a friend’s wedding. The 53-year-old shared a wholesome video on Instagram showing the pair preparing for the big day. Amanda and Hollie were seen doing their hair and makeup together, before donning cute matching floral dresses. One fan commented: \"Like mum, like daughter.\" Whilst another added: \"You both look so pretty and I love both of your dresses.\" \"You all looked gorgeous,\" commented a third. Amanda recently admitted that she feared for her job on Britain's Got Talent after her daughter Hollie stormed the panel. On Sunday's episode, 12-year-old Hollie was joined by Simon Cowell's son Eric, 10, as they jumped up onto the panel and slammed the golden buzzer button. Amanda looked visibly horrified when Hollie and Eric appeared and sent Japanese double dutch dancers Haribow through to the live BGT semi-finals. Sharing the clip on Instagram, Amanda later wrote: \"I mean ... I thought I was going to get fired as it was so unexpected my #HRH & Eric x even @simoncowell was wobbled but they have the first ever audience GOLDEN BUZZER\" Amanda recently got into a heated feud with Osborne after calling the Celebrity Big Brother star \"bitter and pathetic.\" Sharon responded to Amanda, saying, \"You’ll never be in my league.\" This exchange followed Sharon, 71, and her best friend Louis Walsh , also 71, frequently gossiping about Simon during their time in the West London compound.",

        "content": "Enugu State Governor Peter Mbah has inaugurated the 8th Council of the Enugu State Traditional Rulers Council, charging the royal fathers to be in charge of the security of their communities through partnership with the government across all levels. The chairman of the council, Igwe Samuel Asadu, who is the traditional ruler of Edem-Ani Autonomous Community in Nsukka local government area, said they would key into the administration’s vision, mobilise against insecurity and ensure the success of the government. Mbah, who inaugurated the council yesterday at the House of Chiefs Chamber of the Enugu State House of Assembly Complex, Enugu, said the functions of the traditional institution go beyond being custodians of culture and tradition to fostering peace and unity as well as serving as the eyes and ears of the government. “We are also taking this opportunity to remind ourselves that beyond being the custodians of our tradition and culture, you are also the ears and eyes of the government in your various communities so that when we talk about security challenges we are having in communities, we expect to work with you in partnership to address those security challenges,” he said. The governor further enjoined the royal fathers to work closely with the government and their subjects, serving as agents of positive change in the communication process in a way that their subjects would understand and appreciate the policies and programmes of the government on education, infrastructure, healthcare, security, and their general wellbeing. Highlighting some of the impactful projects the administration was executing across communities in the state, Governor Mbah explained that the government was taking deliberate steps to ensure that no child of learning age is denied quality education through the 260 smart green schools across the 260 electoral wards, adding that education, training of youths on skills acquisition and human capacity building that the state had already embarked were serving as the greatest weapons against insecurity. He said the robust programmes of the administration would be difficult to accomplish if traditional rulers continue to live outside their communities since they are the eyes and ears of the government who have roles to play in community development. While congratulating the new council, the State Commissioner for Chieftaincy Matters, Hon. Okey Ogbodo explained that the process leading to the selection of the council was based on fidelity, integrity and commitment to the robust development programmes of the government to the people, saying the criteria was in line with section 3(1) of the state traditional rulers’ law. Reacting, Igwe Asad pledged not to disappoint the state as they would continue to ensure the success of the administration. Igwe Asadu, who described the governor as an agent of positive change whose landmark achievements cut across communities, said the first state-financed project in the history of their community was instituted by the Mbah administration.",

        "content": "Imagine entering the vibrant world of a bustling theme park or a lively food court. To streamline transactions within these enclosed ecosystems, you must often exchange your everyday cash for a specialized form of currency — tokens. These tokens, uniquely designed for and valued within that specific environment, simplify purchases ranging from snacks to rides. This method ties the experience of the park or food court to a unique economic system distinct from the external monetary systems. This concept of localized and specialized tokens provides an excellent framework for understanding Runes, an innovative tokenization project on the Bitcoin network . Runes applies a similar principle to the digital realm of Bitcoin, assigning unique identifiers to the arbitrary units of Bitcoin, thereby transforming them into fungible tokens within the blockchain. These tokens are not just digital currency; they carry unique attributes or identifiers that set them apart within the vast ledger of Bitcoin transactions. In this article, we will explore what are Bitcoin Runes, and how they leverage the inherent strengths of the Bitcoin network to create a distinct layer of tokenized assets. From their creation and significance to their potential applications, we will uncover all aspects of Runes, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of this fascinating facet of blockchain technology. The Creator The Runes Protocol was created by Casey Rodarmor, a software developer and a notable figure in the Bitcoin community, particularly known for his work related to the Ordinals Protocol . Ordinals is a tokenization project that emerged due to SegWit and Taproot upgrades to the Bitcoin Network. Ordinals leveraged these upgrades to inscribe individual satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin) with data to turn them into unique identifiers capable of carrying digital artefacts, like NFTs. Ordinals used each satoshi’s unique position in the series of Bitcoin blocks to assign them rarity levels, leading to one of the most unique collections of tokens in the cryptosphere. Community Reaction Rodarmor’s role in proposing and developing this concept has positioned him as an influential figure in exploring Bitcoin’s potential. His work encourages both developers and enthusiasts to reimagine the uses of Bitcoin’s blockchain, highlighting its robustness and adaptability. This has led to a reinvigorated discussion about scalability, utility, and the philosophical direction of Bitcoin’s development. Runes On April 19th 2024, just as the Bitcoin network successfully implemented the last halving at block number 840,000, the Runes Protocol, another tokenization project, went live on the Bitcoin network. Runes was different from other Bitcoin tokenization standards like Taproot Assets by Lightning Network and BRC-20s, some even consider it the superior token standard. What makes Runes so unique? Let’s break down Runes. What are Bitcoin Runes? Rodarmor spearheaded the tokenization frenzy on the Bitcoin network with the Ordinal Theory. While the Bitcoin NFT scene was growing in billions, creating newfound interest in the Bitcoin protocol, another class of token standards was also getting popular. Innovators were also experimenting with two groundbreaking upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol — SegWit and Taproot. Using the additional space created by SegWit and the enhanced scripting capabilities of Taproot, it was now possible to create fungible token standards on Bitcoin. Soon BRC-20s and Lightning Network’s Taproot Assets mixed on and off-chain components to issue tokens tied to the Bitcoin network. Here’s Guy explaining Bitcoin Runes. The Runes Protocol is also a new token standard on the Bitcoin Network. Rodarmor claims that Runes is superior to any other Bitcoin-based token standard because it is simpler and does not strain the network as much as others. Are these claims justified? Let’s understand Runes to find an answer. What Makes Runes Unique? You can conceptualize Runes as a lighter version of Ordinals. Runes follows a similar idea: using unique identifiers to separate units of Bitcoin and give them additional intrinsic, often subjective value. Runes are tokens on the Bitcoin network. They are not built on the Ordinals theory, are much simpler in functionality, and consume significantly less space than Ordinals. Moreover, while tokens like Ordinals, BRC-20s, and Taproot Assets may rely on newer upgrades like SegWit and Taproot, Runes works using key foundational principles of the Bitcoin network, like UTXOs. The Two Pillars of Runes To create new tokens on the Bitcoin network, Runes defines rules for a bunch of basic practices, like etch (create), mint and transfer. These codes do not consume a lot of space and are easy to include in Bitcoin transactions. Two fundamental elements of the Bitcoin block are key to understanding Runes, these are UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) and OP_RETURN opcode. UTXO (Unspent Transaction Outputs) UTXOs, or Unspent Transaction Outputs , are a fundamental concept in the Bitcoin network and form the backbone of how Bitcoin tracks ownership and facilitates transactions. Here’s a detailed explanation of UTXOs and how they function: Concept of UTXOs UTXOs can be thought of as the individual pieces of bitcoin that you own and can spend. Unlike traditional bank accounts that show a balance as a single figure, Bitcoin’s ledger does not keep track of balances. Instead, it tracks every output from every transaction that has not yet been spent — these are the UTXOs. How UTXOs Work Transaction Outputs: When a Bitcoin transaction occurs, it generates transaction outputs. Each output specifies an amount of Bitcoin and a condition under which it can be spent, typically requiring a digital signature from the appropriate private key holder. Spending UTXOs: To create a new transaction, a user must reference these UTXOs as inputs. The user proves they are allowed to spend the UTXOs by fulfilling the spending condition, usually by signing the transaction with their private key. Creating New UTXOs: Once UTXOs are used in a transaction, they are considered spent and can’t be used again. The transaction will generate new UTXOs, which will then be available for future transactions. This cycle ensures that Bitcoins are neither created nor destroyed but merely transferred from one party to another. Characteristics of UTXOs Immutable: Once UTXOs are created, they cannot be modified; they can only be spent and replaced with new UTXOs. Ownership Verification: UTXOs are tied to a specific cryptographic key. To spend the UTXOs, you must prove you hold the corresponding private key. No Identity Information: UTXOs do not contain real-world identity information. Implications of UTXO Model Transaction Fees: Every transaction has a cost, primarily driven by the data size of the transaction. Transactions that consolidate many small UTXOs can be larger and, therefore, more expensive. Transaction History: Since UTXOs are spent entirely and new ones are created with each transaction, Bitcoin does not have a simple account/balance ledger but rather a chain of ownership through UTXOs. Scalability and Performance: The need to store and update a list of all unspent outputs can affect the scalability and performance of Bitcoin. This is a significant consideration for Bitcoin’s design and future enhancements. In summary, the UTXO model is central to how transactions are processed and validated on the Bitcoin network. It ensures the integrity and tracking of Bitcoin ownership without a centralized ledger, embodying the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin. Understanding UTXOs is crucial for anyone deeply involved in Bitcoin, whether they are developers, investors or users. What is OP_RETURN? The OP_RETURN opcode in Bitcoin is a script operation used within Bitcoin’s scripting system, primarily for creating transactions that include data on the blockchain that is provably unspendable. This opcode plays a specific role in how data is handled and stored in Bitcoin transactions, serving as a means to embed arbitrary data without affecting the spendability of outputs. Here’s a detailed explanation of how OP_RETURN works and its implications: Purpose of OP_RETURN OP_RETURN is used to mark a transaction output as unspendable. When a transaction output contains an OP_RETURN opcode, it signals to the network that the output can never be used as an input in a future transaction. This is important because it ensures that outputs containing OP_RETURN do not need to be kept in the UTXO database, which helps in reducing blockchain bloat and optimizing the efficiency of the network. How OP_RETURN Works Transaction Creation: A Bitcoin transaction can contain multiple outputs, and one of these outputs can include an OP_RETURN opcode followed by the data intended to be stored on the blockchain. Script Format: The typical script for an OP_RETURN output starts with the OP_RETURN opcode, followed by a data push opcode that specifies the number of bytes of data to follow, and then the actual data bytes themselves. Data Embedding: The data embedded using OP_RETURN can be anything from plain text to hexadecimal strings representing more complex information. The maximum size of the data that can be appended after an OP_RETURN opcode has varied over time. Initially, it was limited to 40 bytes, but as of recent Bitcoin core releases, it can be up to 80 bytes. Uses of OP_RETURN Data Timestamping: Developers can use OP_RETURN to embed hash values of documents or digital files, providing a decentralized proof of existence at a specific timestamp. Marking Transactions: Certain applications use OP_RETURN to mark transactions for specific purposes, such as identifying transactions belonging to particular applications or protocols built on top of Bitcoin. Creating Provably Unspendable Outputs: This is useful for making statements or storing data without the intention of spending those outputs in the future. Implications and Considerations Non-Spendable Outputs: Outputs that use OP_RETURN are explicitly marked unspendable and do not clutter the UTXO set, which is beneficial for network efficiency. Blockchain Space Usage: While OP_RETURN outputs are pruned from the UTXO set, they still take up space in the blockchain. Therefore, there’s a trade-off between the utility of embedding data and the cost of increasing the blockchain size. Best Practices: The Bitcoin community generally encourages judicious use of OP_RETURN, considering the balance between the need for embedding data and the principles of keeping the blockchain lean and efficient. In summary, OP_RETURN provides a standardized, consensus-enforced way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain safely and efficiently, ensuring that such data does not interfere with the essential transactional functions of the network. UTXOs and OP_RETURN are the two technologies required to operate Runes. Let’s now explore how Runes leverages these elements to function. How Bitcoin Runes Work? We are familiar with the ERC-20 token standards of Ethereum . ERC-20 tokens are smart contracts deployed on Ethereum that represent the token code, including essential information like a ledger of transactions, max supply, inflation rules, and transfer rules, along with other operational logic. Smart contracts are immutable. Once deployed, the smart contract logic cannot be altered, even by the creator, which is essential to safeguard the token rules from tampering or changing later. To define immutable token standards on Ethereum, Runes works with UTXOs and OP_RETURN to create immutable conditions similar to those of Ethereum smart contracts. To achieve this configuration, Runes needs: Storage: A location to store token logic like supply and transactions. Bitcoin does not support smart contract accounts, so Runes leverages UTXOs as the location of this logic. However, UTXOs are owned by an on-chain address, so they are not immutable. Immutability: This is achieved with OP_RETURN opcodes. We know that UTXOs containing OP_RETURN data become unspendable or immutable. Therefore, Runes creates new tokens by embedding its logic in OP_RETURN of UTXOs, creating an immutable token that lives on Bitcoin and receives all its network benefits of security and decentralization. Runestones Runestones are protocol messages stored in the OP_RETURN area designated in each UTXO. A Runestone contains instructions to interact with the Runes Protocol. The instructions may include commands for creating new runes and minting or transferring existing runes. While a UTXO transaction can have only one runestone, UTXOs themselves can hold balances of any number of runes. Let us understand the nuances of creating runes, called etching, and learn how to transfer and mint runes. Etching Etching is the process of creating new runes. It is the process of writing the properties of the rune, such as name, ID, divisibility, supply and others in the OP_RETURN of a UTXO. Finalizing an Etching transaction makes the properties of that rune immutable. Even the etcher, who initially created the rune, cannot alter these properties once they are written and accepted on the Bitcoin network. Here’s a summarized list of properties defined in the etching process for Runes, based on the information provided: Name Length and Characters: Names are composed of letters A through Z, ranging from one to twenty-six letters. Spacers: Names can include spacers (represented as bullets) to improve readability (e.g., UNCOMMON•GOODS), but these do not affect the uniqueness or length count of the name. Uniqueness: The name’s uniqueness is based strictly on the sequence of letters, independent of spacers. Divisibility: Refers to how finely a rune may be divided, expressed as the number of decimal places that can be used in an amount of the rune. Divisibility of 0: Cannot be divided. Divisibility of 1: Divisible into ten sub-units. Divisibility of 2: Divisible into a hundred sub-units, etc. Symbol Currency Symbol: Each rune can have a unique currency symbol (e.g., $, ⧉, 🧿) that is displayed after quantities of that rune. Default Symbol: If no specific symbol is chosen, the generic currency sign ¤ (scarab) is used. Premine: Allows the etcher to allocate a certain number of rune units to themselves during the creation process. Terms (Related to Minting) Open Mint: A rune may have terms that allow for open minting, meaning anyone can create units of that rune under specific conditions. Conditions: Cap: Limits on the total number of times a rune may be minted. Start and End Heights: Specifies the blockchain heights between which the rune can be minted. Start and End Offsets: Adjust the minting window based on the height of the block in which the rune was originally etched. Cap: Once the cap mint limitation is reached, no further minting of the rune is possible. Minting Amounts: Each mint transaction creates a predetermined number of new units of the rune. These properties collectively define how a Rune is created, its characteristics, and the rules governing its use and distribution within the blockchain network. This structured approach ensures that once a rune’s properties are set, they are immutable, preserving the integrity and expectations associated with its use. Minting Runes After the Etching process, Runes are available for minting. A Rune’s mint may be open or closed. If it is open, it means anyone can create mint transactions that create a fixed amount of those runes tokens, as defined by the Rune rules in the etching process. The creator of a Rune may also create some amount of tokens during the minting process. Once minting is closed, no one can mint new units of that Rune. Transferring Runes Transferring Rune tokens within the Bitcoin network involves using the properties of a runestone, which is essentially a Bitcoin transaction that contains additional rules for handling these tokens. Here’s how the transfer process works: Process of Transferring Runes Transaction Inputs and Outputs: When a transaction includes inputs that contain runes, or when new runes are generated through premining or minting within the transaction, these runes are allocated to the transaction’s outputs based on specified rules. Edicts: A runestone (the transaction containing runes) can have multiple edicts. An edict specifies how runes should be allocated and consists of three parts: Rune ID: The identifier of the rune being transferred. Amount: The quantity of runes to be transferred. Output Number: The specific output within the transaction where the runes will be sent. Edicts are processed sequentially and they direct the transfer of unallocated runes from inputs to specified outputs within the transaction. Pointer: After processing all edicts, if there are any runes left unallocated, they are automatically transferred to the transaction’s first non-OP_RETURN output. However, the transaction can include a pointer—a directive that specifies a different output to receive any remaining unallocated runes. Burning Runes: Runes can also be intentionally destroyed or “burned” by directing them to an OP_RETURN output via an edict or a pointer. This permanently removes the runes from circulation, reducing the total supply. This structured approach to transferring Rune tokens allows for complex transactions where runes can be redistributed, minted, or even burned, providing flexibility in how these digital assets are managed on the blockchain. General Guidelines for Minting and Etching Runes Luminex is a highly recommended platform for minting and etching Runes due to its reliability and ease of use. It is noted for higher fees but offers a user-friendly experience. Steps to Mint Runes UTXO Preparation: Before minting, split your Bitcoin into multiple UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). This is necessary because each UTXO can only be used once per transaction, so having multiple UTXOs allows for simultaneous transactions. Choosing Minting Mode: Pre-split: If you have pre-split your UTXOs, select this mode to proceed with minting. Auto-split: If you have not split your UTXOs, choose Auto-split, which automatically handles the splitting but takes longer. Transaction Speed: Select the speed of the transaction to ensure it doesn’t get stuck or outpaced by other transactions. “Fast” is recommended to avoid delays. How to Etch Runes Creating a Rune: Go to the Etch tab on Luminex, input the specifics of your Rune—name, divisibility, symbol, and the amount for pre-mine, if applicable. Transaction Submission: After setting up your Rune’s details, choose the transaction speed and pay the associated fees. Tracking Progress: Use tools like the mempool to monitor your transaction’s status until it is confirmed. Choosing Platforms Other platforms for minting and etching include Unisat, Xverse, and Magic Runes. Compare fees and user experiences to choose the best option for your needs. Additional Tips Research and Tracking: Utilize platforms like GeniiData for in-depth data and tracking of Rune transactions. Marketplace Trading: For trading Runes, platforms like Magic Eden and Unisat offer marketplace services where you can buy or sell Runes. Ensure your wallet is compatible and connected. Fee Management: Always check the current state of the mempool to adjust your transaction fees appropriately. This ensures your minting or etching processes are completed successfully without unnecessary delays. These guidelines provide a comprehensive starting point for anyone looking to engage with Bitcoin Runes through minting or etching, offering both technical and practical advice to navigate this new digital asset landscape effectively. Runes vs Other Token Standards Runes and BRC20 tokens represent two distinct approaches, each with its unique method of leveraging Bitcoin’s blockchain technology for token creation and management. This section explores the key differences between Runes and BRC20 tokens, focusing on their creation processes, network impact, and data management strategies. 1. Creation Process: Engraving vs. Etching BRC20 Tokens: BRC20 tokens utilize the Ordinals protocol, a method termed “engraving,” which involves inscribing data into the Witness data section of a Bitcoin block via SegWit. This method allows for a large amount of data to be stored—typically around 800 bytes on average. While this provides ample space for complex operations and larger data sets, it increases the storage requirements on the network, potentially leading to blockchain bloat. Runes: Contrarily, Runes employ a process known as “etching,” which writes data into the OP_RETURN section of a UTXO. This section is limited to 80 bytes, which, while smaller than the capacity used by BRC20s, is sufficient for defining tokens without the complexities enabled by the Ordinals protocol. This method is less taxing on the network’s resources, making Runes a more streamlined option for token creation. 2. Data Dependency and Security BRC20 Tokens: The operation of BRC20 tokens relies on an off-chain indexer to manage the transfer process. This dependency on external data sources can introduce points of vulnerability and potential centralization concerns, which might compromise security and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. Runes: In contrast, Runes operates entirely within the Bitcoin network. The data for Runes is fully embedded in the blockchain via the OP_RETURN output, enhancing security and maintaining the decentralized integrity of the Bitcoin network. 3. Network Management and Resource Utilization BRC20 Tokens: Due to their use of the Witness data section and the need to handle more extensive data, BRC20 tokens require more memory and longer-term data storage within network nodes. This can lead to heavier demands on network resources, affecting overall efficiency and scalability. Runes: Runes are designed to minimize their impact on network resources. The use of OP_RETURN for storing data makes Runes immutable and eliminates the need for perpetual storage in node memory. Instead, Runes data can be retrieved from the blockchain history when needed, significantly reducing the memory requirements and easing the strain on the network. In summary, both Runes and BRC20 tokens illustrate innovative uses of the Bitcoin network for tokenization. However, they cater to different needs and preferences in terms of complexity, network load, and decentralization. Runes offer a simpler, less resource-intensive approach that might appeal to those looking for efficient and secure tokenization without the need for external data sources or significant blockchain overhead. On the other hand, BRC20 tokens provide a robust platform for more complex operations and larger data sets, at the cost of increased storage requirements and potential centralization issues. These distinctions are crucial for users and developers when choosing the appropriate technology for their specific applications on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Conclusion: The Impacts of Runes on the Bitcoin Ecosystem The introduction and evolution of Runes within the Bitcoin network stand as a striking testament to the ingenuity and creativity prevalent in the cryptosphere. This innovative use of Bitcoin’s existing technology exemplifies how “old” technology can be repurposed to serve new and unexpected functions, significantly diverging from its original purpose. By adapting the underlying capabilities of Bitcoin, Runes open up a realm of possibilities that extend far beyond the traditional boundaries of what was once considered feasible with Bitcoin’s architecture. Revitalizing the Bitcoin Network Runes not only introduce a fresh layer of functionality but also contribute to the economic vitality of the Bitcoin network. As block rewards continue to diminish with successive halvings, the additional fees generated from the transactions involving Runes provide a crucial source of revenue for miners. This ongoing economic incentive is essential for maintaining robust participation from miners, ensuring the security and continuity of the network. Enhancing Network Efficiency Furthermore, the role of Runes in optimizing the Bitcoin network’s efficiency by consolidating and utilizing small, fragmented UTXOs—often referred to as ‘dust’—should not be underestimated. By converting these underutilized fractions into something of greater value and utility, Runes help in cleaning up the blockchain while reallocating dormant assets. This process not only clears the clutter but also enhances the overall liquidity within the Bitcoin system, contributing to a healthier and more dynamic blockchain environment. Potential Beyond Digital Collectibles While Runes have so far been prominently featured in the creation of NFT-like digital collections, the potential for broader and more practical applications looms large. From tokenizing physical assets to creating unique digital identities, the scope for Runes is limited only by the imagination of its community. This flexibility could lead to significant innovations in how property, ownership, and identity are managed digitally in the future. A Catalyst for Innovation The emergence of Runes highlights an exciting phase of activity within the Bitcoin ecosystem, which is often perceived as stable and unchangeable. This surge of innovation not only challenges the traditional perceptions associated with Bitcoin but also reinforces its position as a foundational technology capable of adapting to meet evolving demands. In conclusion, Runes represent a pivotal development in the world of cryptocurrency. They not only showcase the versatility and adaptability of Bitcoin but also set the stage for future innovations that could transform the landscape of digital transactions and blockchain technology. As we continue to explore and expand the capabilities of Runes, the potential for new applications and improvements to the network holds promising prospects for the entire Bitcoin community.

        "content": "Helicopter rides, shopping sprees, wining, dining and five-star hotels — this is the life of Karen Zulu, the partner of controversial businessman Edwin Sodi. FROM PARIS WITH LOVE Earlier this month, Zulu – who is a social media influencer – jetted off to France in Europe. According to entertainment commentator Sanele Nkosi , Zulu went on holiday with her friend, Anelisa Ntlakana, who is allegedly the partner of Gauteng’s MEC for Human Settlements, Urban Planning and Infrastructure Development — Lebohang Maile. On her TikTok account, Zulu shared snippets of her European trip with her friend, giving her followers a glimpse into their opulent lifestyles. In one video, the two ladies can be seen strutting their stuff as they board a helicopter by Monacair (a helicopter company based at the Monaco Heliport in Monaco, France). In another, Zulu is seen drinking wine and “toasting to the good life” from across an illuminated Eiffel Tower. DID KAREN ZULU AND EDWIN SODI BREAK UP? In February this year, Sunday World reported that Zulu and Sodi were not seeing eye-to-eye amid investigations on the entrepreneur’s businesses and the auctioning of his assets. According to a source, the 50-year-old Blackhead Consulting boss had urged Zulu not to flaunt her lavish lifestyle on social media, but she allegedly did not listen. The source further alleged that Sodi took back the gifts he had bought for Zulu, including the designer bags she often shows off on Instagram. In addition, Zulu (whose Instagram account is private) deleted all the images she posted of her and Sodi or inside his house. These include photographs of Sodi’s lavish 50th birthday party which was hosted at his Morningside mansion in September 2023. 90 VEHICLES TO BE SEIZED? In the same month, it was reported that the corruption-accused businessman is at risk of losing over 90 vehicles following a court order by a giant insurance company, Hollard. As per the court papers, Hollard acted as a guarantor for Sodi’s company, NJR Projects, to receive millions from the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). The bank is reported to have given the company over R39 million as an advance payment. This came after NJR was awarded a R282 million tender by the Department of Public Works to upgrade and build accommodation for a correctional centre in Parys, Free State. The project was reportedly supposed to have been completed by 20 February 2022. However, the contract was allegedly terminated because the company failed to “achieve practical completion” of the project on time. Following NJR’s alleged failure to repay the loan, Hollard sought an order for the sheriff to seize the company’s movable assets. These include five Bell TLBs, a BMW X3, two Chevrolet Utility vehicles, a Ford Fiesta, 41 Ford Rangers and 10 Hino trucks. In addition, there are 15 Mazda CX3s, 4 Mercedes-Benz vehicles, 6 Nissan NP200s, three tankers, three Toyota bakkies and eight VW vehicles.",

        "content": "Audience members are said to have walked out of a Richard Dreyfuss Q&A at a screening of Jaws after the actor allegedly made sexist, transphobic comments. The actor had an event at The Cabot theater in Beverly, Massachusetts , that was billed as \"An Evening with Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening\" on Saturday, May 25, 2024. Attendees are said to have witnessed the actor go on a bigoted rant which, based on social media comments from attendees, was reportedly about trans youth, affirmation of their gender. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . Richard played Matt Hooper, a marine biologist in Jaws ( Image: Getty Images) In a Youtube video taken by an audience member, Richard entered on stage wearing a floral print dress, shaking his hips and swinging his cane like baseball bat as Love Story by Taylor Swift is in the background. Later in the clip took, he took off the dress, and moved around the stage and put on a beige blazer, There is so far not yet a transcript of the event and what exactly was said but attendees have made claims. According to Deadline, attendees stated he mentioned Barbara Streisand, his Nuts producer. He called her a \"genius\" but that women “are so passive that’s why the movie sucked.\" One audience member on The Cabot's Facebook page said: \"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred of others because of his racist homophobic misogynistic rant.\" Another said : \"He went on a rant about women, not in a good way, and made comments about the LGBTQ community. The discussion was supposed to be about the making of the movie Jaws, and then the screening of that movie.\" The venue sent out a statement to the attendees on May 27, apologizing for the recent event. “We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot,\" the statement began. \"The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.“ \"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons,\" the statement said. Richard nor his team have said anything about the event ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) It concluded: \"We are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.” The 76-year-old seemingly made similar remarks at a May 24 Jaws screenings at The Music Hall in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. “I live in Mass, but the Cabot showing was all booked so I saw him in NH on May 24,” a Facebook user commented. “He made anti-gay remarks that night too.” On PBS’ Firing Line with Margaret Hoover last year, Richard sparked controversy and backlash once more by criticising the Academy over their diversity and inclusion standards for the Oscars. \"They make me vomit,\" the Goodbye Girl actor said. \"Because this is an art form. It's also a form of commerce, and it makes money. But it's an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\" He continued by calling the standards \"patronising\" and applauded Laurence Olivier's playing Othello in blackface in 1965, saying, \"He played a Black man brilliantly.\" Richard went on to say that you can't \"legislate\" hurting people's feelings and that he doesn't \"think that there is a minority or a majority in the country that has to be catered to like that.\" Mirror has reached out to Dreyfuss' representatives for comment.",

Organisers told a number of finishers they would have to wait to receive their medal in the post after supplies ran out on Sunday. The organisers took to social media to apologise to finishers, adding that they are investigating the issues. They said that they have already taken steps to order replacement medals for those who didn’t get theirs on the day. “We know that there were a small number of finishers for whom we did not have a medal. We are so sorry about this. “Your achievement merits being presented with your amazing medal straight away, and we were not able to do this,” they wrote in a . One runner comment on the post expressing how “upset” and “fuming” they were about the situation, adding: “How could you run out when you knew how many people entered. “The whole weekend was completely disorganised and absolute shambles.” Another commenter added that they were “disgusted and so disappointed” after finishing the race to find their bag out in the rain. “I’m absolutely disgusted and so disappointed. I ran the full marathon & you ran out of medals. 26.2 miles & no medal at the end. “Also thank you for throwing my bag out in the rain. All my dry clothes were soaking wet. So unorganised,” they wrote. Other commenters criticised how the event handled the heavy rain around the tracks with one user writing: “Wasn’t really ideal meeting my friends and family in a muddy swamp afterwards. “Some ground sheeting wouldn’t have gone amiss. “‘Like the running equivalent of the Wonka Experience’ was how I saw it described by someone.” Organisers have urged those affected to check their email and assured competitors that they will get the medal to them. “If you were affected, please check your emails as you will have received an email from us reassuring you that you don’t need to do anything and that we will get your medal to you. “Please also check your junk folder for this if it is not in your inbox,” they wrote. “We apologise again, and want to thank you for your understanding and patience while we resolve this, and get your well deserved medal to you.” Edinburgh Marathon Festival has been contacted for comment.

        "description": "The business class seat, designed for the next generation of travelers, was unveiled at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) on May 28.",
        "content": "Panasonic Avionics and Collins Aerospace have collaborated to design and introduce the MAYA seat concept, which includes a 45′′ Curved OLED display, offering a fully immersive in-flight experience for passengers. The seat was introduced at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) event on May 28, 2024. Ken Sain, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Panasonic Avionics, looked back on the developments of passenger experience during his speech at AIX, saying that in the 1990s, airlines introduced motorized seats with adjustable headrests and footrests, followed by the first angled beds during the next decade. In the 2010s, carriers introduced light flatbeds and innovations in the cabin layout, including direct aisle access for all business class passengers through the first herringbone configurations, followed by the reverse herringbones, allowing for better window access. Lastly, the 2020s saw the introduction of more privacy and super suites, with airlines now also adopting OLED screens inside their cabins. Thus, Sain explained that Panasonic Avionics and Collins Aerospace began collaborating a year ago to develop the next-generation business class seat designed for millennial and Gen Z travelers, calling it the concept seat MAYA. In an interview with Simple Flying at AIX, Andrew Masson, the Vice President of Product Management, Portfolio Management, Strategy, and Marketing at Panasonic Avionics, explained that with MAYA, business class seats have gone from TVs and headrests to an immersive digital experience brought through the 45” inch 5K OLED screen. Masson pointed out that if a passenger is big into technology, it will be easy for them to get used to the new seat. Even if a traveler is not keen on the latest technological developments, it will take them minutes to get used to the new suite, with the executive adding that it is going to feel disappointing going from MAYA to a regular business class seat. However, Masson emphasized that Maya was the culmination of all the products that are in development, which includes the in-flight entertainment (IFE) screen. According to the Panasonic Avionics executive, the companies are looking for feedback from airlines in particular, with Masson teasing that multiple airline CEOs were very excited about MAYA and the products fitted inside the business class seat at AIX. Masson noted that while the introduction of Panasonic Avionics’ products depends on the seating manufacturers, the company will be ready to deliver its innovations by the end of 2026. he added. The Panasonic Avionics executive explained that MAYA was about pushing that premium class experience to the next level, enabling airlines to stand out. Masson commented that if a carrier was competing against five or so other airlines on the same route, yet the competition had a traditional business class experience, MAYA would enable the airline to According to a joint statement issued by Collins Aerospace and Panasonic Avionics, MAYA was the combination of the two companies’ respective expertise in design, technology development, and integration into a singular integrated solution. The business class seat provides exceptional ergonomics with an advanced seating architecture and integrated ARISE comfort technology, which automatically optimizes cushion pressure, regulates temperature, and reduces peak vibration during flight. MAYA also has the Astrova screen, which Panasonic Avionics launched at AIX in 2022, equipped with a headphone-less audio system, providing a cinema-like experience to its passengers and offering unprecedented immersion, customization, and personalized experiences.",

        "content": "Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge said on Tuesday that if the INDIA bloc comes to power at the Centre, they will exclude agricultural equipment from the GST ambit. Addressing a press conference here today, Kharge targeted PM Modi-led BJP government at the centre and said that when farmers tried to enter Delhi to put forward their demands, tear gas shells were fired at them. “Punjab and Haryana, despite having less land geographically, produce the most in the entire country. The country gets food from these two states. The farmers here think that their prices should be good and fair according to the MSP. Farmers agitated (2020-21) and put forward their demands before the BJP government. But still, the government did not agree. Tear gas shells were fired at them. The farmer remained sitting on the streets for the whole year,” Kharge said. “We will give legal guarantee to MSP which is one of our five Nyay (Justice),” he added. The Congress President also mentioned that their government will also provide 10 kg of free grains to the people. “Along with five Nyay, our party has also given 25 guarantees. We will give 10 kg grains free to the people. We will work to pay the crop insurance compensation amount within 30 days. We will exclude the agricultural materials from the GST ambit,” he said. Various agricultural equipment currently attracts GST at 5-12 per cent. Further, Kharge pointed out the drug problem in the state and termed it as the biggest challenge for the future of Punjab. “Today there is frustration among the youth of Punjab because the drug addiction here has become the biggest challenge for the future of the state. It is because of this, that law and order in the state is getting worse day by day. Farmers are selling their land and sending their children abroad due to the fear that they may fall into drug addiction because employment opportunities are not available here,” the Congress President said. “Demonetisation and wrong GST have caused great harm to the MSMEs of Punjab. If our government comes, we will make it very simple and whatever steps are required to run small-scale industries, we will implement them,” he added",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email This is the tough time of year: back-to-school time, and you have to buy your son proper school shoes. Even though you are busy getting ready for the new school year, make sure your child has the right shoes for comfort and durability. Since there are so many choices, knowing the best ways to choose school shoes for boys can make the process easier and more successful. In this article, you will unveil five invaluable tips to keep in mind when buying boys school shoes . 1. Fit the Foot When buying boy’s school shoes, it’s crucial to ensure that they fit the foot properly. Shoes that are too tight can cause discomfort and foot problems, while shoes that are too loose may lead to tripping hazards. Look for shoes with ample room for the toes to wiggle and with a snug fit around the heel. Test the fit by having the child walk around in the shoes and checking for any signs of discomfort or rubbing. 2. Measure Correctly Proper measurement is key to finding the right size of school shoes for boys. Children’s feet can grow rapidly, so it’s essential to measure them regularly to ensure an accurate fit. Use a foot-measuring device or a ruler to measure the length and width of the foot. Take measurements while the child is standing, as this provides a more accurate representation of their foot size. Consider consulting with a professional shoe fitter if you’re unsure about the measurements. 3. Measure for the Brand Different shoe brands may have slight variations in sizing, so it’s essential to measure for the specific brand you’re considering. Shoe sizing charts provided by manufacturers can help determine the appropriate size based on the child’s foot measurements. Keep in mind that sizes may vary between brands, so it’s essential to refer to the sizing chart for each brand separately. Additionally, consider trying on shoes in-store whenever possible to ensure the best fit before making a purchase. 4. Establish Your Cost Per Wear Before purchasing boy’s school shoes, consider the concept of cost per wear. This involves dividing the price of the shoes by the number of times they are likely to be worn. Opting for higher-quality shoes that may have a higher initial cost but last longer can result in a lower cost per wear over time. Look for shoes made from durable materials and features such as reinforced stitching and sturdy soles, as these are likely to withstand daily wear and tear better. By investing in shoes with a lower cost per wear, you can ensure better value for money in the long run. 5. Look for Design Elements that Add Durability When selecting boy’s school shoes, pay attention to design elements that contribute to durability. Features such as reinforced toe caps, double stitching, and rubber outsoles can enhance the longevity of the shoes by providing added protection against scuffs, tears, and abrasions. Additionally, consider shoes with features like padded collars and cushioned insoles for added comfort and support, as these can help prevent premature wear and tear. Choosing shoes with durable design elements ensures that they can withstand the rigors of daily use and last throughout the school year without needing frequent replacements.

        "content": "A MAN charged with a breach of a 100-year-old liquor law that could have seen him spend six months in prison if found guilty had the charge dismissed after the judge deemed a garda application to reissue the summons was outside the statute of limitations. It was not, however, plain sailing for Mark Salmon (47) of Fortbarrington, Athy at a recent sitting of Athy District Court, as he was found guilty of driving without insurance at Tonlegee on 23 February 2023. This was dealt with first and he pleaded guilty to the charge. Sgt Dave Hanrahan notified the court that Salmon had nine previous convictions, eight of which were for road traffic offences. Defending barrister Richard Wixted pleaded for leniency, telling Judge Desmond Zaidan that his client needed his car for work and the judge fined him €750, giving him three months to pay, and he moved on to the substantive matter – as to whether Salmon had been operating a shebeen. Mr Wixted told the court that his client was pleading not guilty to a breach of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1924 . “The allegation was he was running a shebeen, offering various alcoholic drinks without a licence to sell,” said the judge. Athy Courthouse Photo: Aisling Hyland Mr Wixted explained that the maximum penalty from the 100-year-old law was a fine of £50 or six months in prison and deemed the charge as “summary in nature.” The state originally alleged that on dates between 4 September 2020 and 22 October 2020, Salmon was running a shebeen at his home without a valid liquor licence. “The offence was selling liquor, not running a shebeen,” clarified Mr Wixted. In court, Insp Laura Dragoi sought to amend the dates of the alleged offence as to fall between 1-3 October 2020. “The prosecution should have dealt with the matter then and not wait four years and this is particularly unfair to my client,” said Mr Wixted. “I don’t believe the summons infringes the defendant’s rights,” said Insp Dragoi. However, Judge Zaidan then noted that the summons wasn’t issued until 28 March 2021, “which puts it outside the statute of limitations, outside six months.” “The state did not of its own free will apply for the amendment, it was brought by the defence, that is of some concern,” said the judge. “This has been before me five or six times and the state could have easily brought this case a year or a year-and-a-half ago,” he said. “A substantive part of the charge still exists, but the state widened their date but in the end isn’t exactly sure, so I’m going to dismiss the charges,” he ruled.",

        "content": "E Ink had earlier projected a brighter long-term prospect of amassing higher profits thanks to a general shift towards color e-paper displays though its immediate impact has led to it taking a 25 percent hit on its profits, reported. The company said profits for Q1 2024 declined to $40.9 million which it attributed to fewer orders placed for e-paper displays as its customers already have to deal with a stockpile of inventory. The company reported profits of $54.63 million USD for the same period a year ago. Operating profit took a 54 percent hit annually to NT$833 million from NT$1.81 billion. However, as E Ink stated, non-operating income achieved an impressive 95 percent growth to NT$879 million. Plus, there also is the foreign exchange gains amounting to NT$497 million which too added to the company’s bottom line. “Looking forward, the IoT business will return to the normal growth path in the third quarter and that growth will extend into the fourth quarter,” E Ink chairman Johnson Lee told investors during the company’s quarterly conference. “The most important thing is that we have at least ridden through the trough period,” Lee said. “The second quarter is better than the first quarter, and we believe the third quarter will be better than the second.” Walmart is all set to implement its ESL project by the end of the year which is ahead of scheduled plans. That’s a mega project wherein the retail major plans to replace all paper shelf labels with electronic shelf labels or ESLs. Similarly, demand for e-paper displays meant for e-readers continues to be robust. E Ink also stated it has expanded its capacity to produce large-sized e-paper displays meant to be used as outdoor signs or for advertising purposes in the retail sector or by government agencies around the world. With a keen interest in tech, I make it a point to keep myself updated on the latest developments in technology and gadgets. That includes smartphones or tablet devices but stretches to even AI and self-driven automobiles, the latter being my latest fad. Besides writing, I like watching videos, reading, listening to music, or experimenting with different recipes. The motion picture is another aspect that interests me a lot, and I'll likely make a film sometime in the future.",

        "content": "A drunk woman who was aggressive to staff at Letterkenny University Hospital has been fined €150. Maureen Wallace, 49, appeared at Letterkenny District Court following the incident on June 24th, 2023. Garda Anthony Marron told the court that Wallis had been lifted “at the side of the road” area by Gardai and taken for treatment to the hospital. Ms Wallace with an address at Cois Locha, Dungloe, was belligerent while speaking to paramedics. Gardai spoke to her and she agreed to have treatment. However, Gardai were called back to the hospital at 5.36pm and found Ms Wallace more aggressive to staff and despite their best efforts she was refusing medical attention. At one stage the accused woman tried to leave the hospital and said she was walking home to Dungloe. Garda Marron said he had no option at 6.05pm to arrest Ms Wallace and she was later released. She was charged that she was present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that she might endanger herself or any other person in her vicinity. The charge was Contrary to Section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act , 1994, as amended by Section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008. Garda Sergeant Jim Collins said Ms Wallace has a number of previous convictions but they are for road traffic offences and none for public order. Judge Eiteain Cunningham found the facts proven, fined Ms Wallace €150 and allowed her five months to pay.",

        "content": "China's economy has made steady progress since the beginning of 2024. So why can China still maintain its strong economic growth? And what can be learned? In this regard, China News Network talked with Doug Guthrie, Director of China Initiatives at Thunderbird School of Global Management. Guthrie noted that China's economy is much better organized than most capitalist market economies around the world right now. The Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. When global economic headwinds crest their horizon, China has the buttons to push to meet projected rates of growth.",

        "content": "Brazil has overtaken Belgium as the largest overseas destination for China-made new energy vehicles, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Data from the CPCA shows that China's exports of pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids to Brazil soared 13-fold year-on-year to 40,163 units in April, ranking first for a second straight month. The rise in NEV exports also made Brazil China's second-largest destination for all cars in April, with Russia retaining its top spot, according to the CPCA. Carmakers in China have been exploring South America, Australia and ASEAN markets for exports, as the European Union is conducting an anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EV makers and threatening to raise tariffs on their EVs, said Cui Dongshu. Spain, France, the Netherlands and Norway were among the countries that saw biggest falls in imports of China-made electric passenger vehicles from January to April, according to CPCA data. Brazil is slated to raise tariffs on EV imports as it seeks to encourage local production. Import taxes for electric vehicles had been reduced to zero since 2015 before they became subject to a 10 percent tax since January. The taxes will increase to 18 percent in July and eventually reach 35 percent in July 2026. Several Chinese automakers have already started increasing investments for local production in Brazil. BYD has started building a manufacturing complex there to begin local production by year-end or in early 2025 and Great Wall Motor has said that its Brazil plant would begin operations this month.",

        "content": "China's first domestically developed and the world's largest electric container vessel received two design and building contracts, Shanghai's Pudong New Area regional government said. It marked a milestone of China's progress toward achieving \"dual carbon\" goals in the maritime shipping sector. The electric vessel is driven by two permanent magnet propulsion motors with a capacity of 875 kilowatts, and a maximum speed of 11.5 knots. A total of ten box battery cells with total capacity of about 19,000 kilowatt-hours provide power for two motors. The electric vessel has a length of 127.8 meters and a width of 21.6 meters. It can load 740 standard containers - twenty-foot equivalent units - with total capacity of over 9,000 tons. Its unique design reduces time for freight upload and unload. The electric vessel is designed by Shanghai Merchant Ship Design & Research Institute under the China State Shipbuilding Corporation. The contract was made with Ningbo Ocean Shipping Co, with the two vessels to be built by Jiangxi Jiangxin Shipbuilding Co. The signing of the contract is being viewed as a positive sign that shipping along China's coastal regions will enter an era of zero emissions and electrification, the report noted. Guided by country's goals of achieving \"carbon emissions peak\" and \"carbon neutrality,\" China's shipping industry has ramped up green transition by deploying more new-energy vessels. A 10,000-ton-level electric container vessel developed and built by China COSCO Shipping Corporation was delivered in last December. The operation of the vessel can reduce CO2 emissions by 2,918 tons annually, equivalent for planting 160,000 trees, according to media reports. China's first hydrogen battery-powered vessel was deployed in Yichang, Central China's Hubei Province, which can save 103.16 tons of gasoline, and reduce 343.67 tons of CO2 emissions each year.",

        "content": "China's top market regulator has pledged to apply more technologies into law enforcement to increase crackdowns on counterfeits and unqualified goods in cyberspace, so that intellectual property rights can be strongly protected. The pledge was made by Tong Bo, an official from the State Administration for Market Regulation, on Tuesday while introducing its achievements against IP violations. She said that the administration has planned to take advantage of big data, cloud computing and mobile network in law enforcement, \"aiming to improve our capability of finding and identifying IP violations.\" According to her, a crackdown on fighting online IP infringements was jointly launched by the administration and several other authorities, including the Ministry of Public Security and the China National Intellectual Property Administration, in June last year. \"The aim of the crackdown was to urge internet platforms to perform their duties, as well as to regulate the market order in cyberspace and purify the online business environment,\" she said. She cited data as revealing that during the crackdown, market regulators at all levels dealt with 27,000 online cases involving IP infringement, of which, 267 were transferred to public security bureaus to further investigate. The market regulators nationwide also removed about 160,000 pieces of information regarding counterfeit goods, with the shutdown of 1,374 websites, she said. In addition, 7,390 online shops were required to stop their platform services after being found to have problems, she added. \"Similar actions are carrying on,\" she said, releasing that the top market regulator has continued, since March, to jointly strengthen IP protection online and severely combat counterfeits in cyberspace.",

        "description": "China has stepped up efforts to strengthen intellectual property protection through quicker channels to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of innovators are strongly and widely supported and protected.",
        "content": "China has stepped up efforts to strengthen intellectual property protection through quicker channels to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of innovators are strongly and widely supported and protected, a spokeswoman of the country's top IP regulator said on Tuesday. Guo Wen, the head of the China National Intellectual Property Administration's IP protection division, told a news conference that a total of 71 national-level IP protection centers have been set up nationwide, with the establishment of 41 stations to help innovators quickly solve IP disputes. Such IP protection centers have been basically covered in the country's major and developed cities, while the stations have been expanded in clusters where small commodities or fast-moving consumer goods are frequently seen, according to her. She cited data, noting that the centers and stations accepted 35,000 cases from January to April and that the average processing time was around two weeks. \"In this way, IP rights owners can be protected in a timely and convenient manner,\" she said. In the first four months, the institutes also received 85,000 patent per-review requests, and the authorization period for invention patents approved through this per-examination was kept within three months, she said. In addition, more than 150,000 government agencies and enterprises have been registered at the institutes in order to obtain quicker and more optimized IP services. She added. These institutes have played a bigger role in serving innovators by issuing 833 patent analysis reports and offering 2,142 times as much free IP training in 2023, she said. While the IP services are being facilitated, China's judicial protection of IP rights has also been enhanced. By the end of last year, 25 high people's courts, 242 intermediate courts, and 287 grassroots-level courts had been able to consolidate IP civil, administrative and criminal cases into a single adjudication tribunal for tackling, said Ding Guangyu, an official from the Supreme People's Court. \"Thanks to the 'three-in-one' platform, the quality and efficiency of IP case handling have been constantly improved,\" said the deputy chief judge of the SPC's No. 3 Civil Adjudication Tribunal. To punish harshly those who seriously infringe upon others' IP rights, punitive damages will be applied in 319 IP cases in 2023, an increase of 117 percent compared with 2022, he added.",

        "content": "(ECNS) -- Cambodia has called on its entrepreneurs to promote their products internationally through e-commerce platforms like China’s Alibaba, according to Cham Nimul, Minister of Commerce on Monday. She revealed that Cambodia will launch a national pavilion on Alibaba.com in September on the sidelines of the 21st China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Expo in Nanning, south China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In her speech at a seminar on \"Beyond borders: bringing Cambodian products to the global market through Alibaba.com”, Nimul emphasized the enormous potential of China’s e-commerce platform, pointing out that it will provide Cambodian businesses significant opportunities to showcase their products to wide range of international buyers and increase their exports. Currently, several Cambodian specialty products, such as pepper and edible bird's nests, have been put up for sale. A representative from Alibaba attending the meeting stated that the platform will open the door to the global market for Cambodian SMEs and entrepreneurs. In October 2023, the Cambodian Ministry of Commerce signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Alibaba to sell local products to China and global markets through the eWTP platform, aiming to rapidly develop the country's e-commerce industry.",

        "content": "Shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 George R.R. Martin , the visionary behind A Song of Ice and Fire , which spawned HBO’s hit series Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon , has shared a critical perspective on the prevalent trend of turning beloved books into films and TV adaptations . Speaking in a blog post , Martin voiced his concerns, suggesting that the quality of these adaptations often fails to live up to the original works. House of the Dragon During a panel discussion with Neil Gaiman in 2022, Martin reflected on the state of adaptations, remarking, “If anything, things have gotten worse,” a sentiment he reiterated in his recent blog updates. He expressed his disappointment with the creative direction of many adaptations, stating, “Very little has changed since then in regards to adaptations... It does not seem to matter whether the source material was written by Stan Lee, Charles Dickens, Ian Fleming, Roald Dahl, Ursula K. Le Guin, J.R.R. Tolkien, Mark Twain, Raymond Chandler, Jane Austen, or... well, anyone. No matter how major a writer it is, no matter how great the book, there always seems to be someone on hand who thinks he can do better, eager to take the story and ‘improve’ on it.” Highlighting the disconnect between original storytelling and Hollywood adaptations, Martin criticised the industry’s approach: “The book is the book, the film is the film,” they will tell you, as if they were saying something profound. Then they make the story their own. They never make it better, though. Nine hundred ninety-nine times out of a thousand, they make it worse. “ According to Martin, this trend is evident even in adaptations of his own work. Game of Thrones initially followed his books closely but veered away in later seasons, particularly after surpassing the narrative that Martin had written. The drop in quality was notable, with many fans and critics pointing out the discrepancies. He highlighted House of the Dragon and upcoming projects like Knight of the Seven Kingdoms and another series focusing on Aegon the Conqueror, acknowledging the challenges of maintaining quality in adaptations. FX’s Shōgun Martin did, however, praise the FX adaptation of James Clavell’s Shōgun as an exemplary model that other adaptations should aspire to emulate. “Once in a while, though, we do get a really good adaptation of a really good book, and when that happens, it deserves applause,” he observed. He elaborated on his positive reaction to Shōgun , sharing, “I was dubious when I first heard they were making another version of the Clavell novel. But the new Shōgun is superb. Better than Chamberlain’s version, you ask? Hmmm, I don’t know. I have not watched the 1980 miniseries since, well, 1980. That one was great too.” In his concluding remarks, Martin encouraged audiences to judge for themselves while hinting at the broader implications of successful adaptations, “But don’t take my word for it. Watch it yourself. Acting, directing, set design, costume... it’s all splendid here. Along with the writing. And if Shōgun is a big enough hit, maybe the same team will adapt some of Clavell’s other novels.” Martin’s observations reflect a broader discussion within the entertainment industry about the balance between creative adaptation and faithful reproduction. As adaptations continue to dominate screens large and small, Martin’s insights serve as a reminder of the complexities involved in bringing beloved books to life in film and television. Natalie Natalie is a big fan of anything related to movies, TV shows, games, and comics — you name it. When she’s not reading or geeking out about the latest shows on Netflix, she’s probably playing Honkai: Star Rail, cosplaying, or daydreaming of meeting her idols. Game of Thrones George R.R.

        "content": "Consumers try wireless mobile phone charging by riding spin bikes to generate electricity at the McDonald's zero carbon restaurant in Shougang Park in Beijing. (Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn) As we see a surging demand and a favorable business environment, industry experts said that China's young-generation consumers are expected to become a new driving force of the development of ESG (environmental, social and governance), further promoting the sustainable growth in the field. They said that in the recent two to three years, ESG has transformed from not only an operation goal for business entities, but a trendy lifestyle, or mindset, among consumers. Consumers bring their own mugs or bottles when buying coffee. LEED cafes and restaurants are becoming increasingly popular among the youth, as they pay special attention to the LEED marks on the store's window before entering them. The LEED rating system, devised by the United States Green Building Council, assesses the degree to which a building is environmentally friendly, utilizes energy-efficient equipment, and actively adopts renewable energies or other technologies that reduce the negative impacts of buildings on the environment. \"For many young people, ESG is no longer an unattainable concept but a practical and achievable one. More and more young people are choosing to purchase, use, and promote products with environmental elements and are adopting green, low-carbon lifestyles. This trend is particularly evident in sectors such as food and beverages, household goods, and fashion,\" said Wang Jing, vice-president of USGBC North Asia. \"I have stuck to the habit of bringing my coffee mug ever since 2015. As a coffee lover, I bought my first coffee container. It is very convenient ...... During my lunch break, I go to the coffee shop near the company, order a cup of coffee, and take it away with my own mug. I have kept the habit until now,\" said Mo Cha, a 30-year-old white collar in Shanghai. \"Leading a low-carbon, or environmentally-friendly life is kind of cool,\" Mo added. Wang, as an observer in ESG for over a decade, said that people began to realize the importance of ESG, and they are willing to learn more about the field. The demand for ESG-related talent is strong and continues to grow. However, the supply of matching talent is somewhat insufficient as ESG only become mainstream in the past few years. In the past years, the demand for experienced and skilled professionals within ESG has reached an all-time high, no matter in China, the United States or European countries. The demand is vastly exceeding the existing number of experienced and qualified professionals available in the booming field, said Wang Bing, committee member and deputy secretary general of the Energy Industry Brand Research and Development Branch of China Energy Research Society. Witnessing the skyrocketing demand for ESG education in the country, global consultancies, including KPMG, Deloitte, EY, and many other financial institutions, are now accelerating their ESG education efforts. \"The ESG education sector is expected to gain more accurate policy support, draw in more talents to get involved, and generate greater demand, forming a virtuous circle, Wang from China Energy Research Society added. zhengyiran@chinadaily.com.cn",

        "description": "The US Republican presidential candidate also affirmed Israel's right to continue \"its war on terror\" at a recent private fundraiser with Jewish donors",
        "content": "US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told Jewish donors earlier this month that if elected in November he would deport anti-Israel protesters and defeat the \"radical revolution\" he said the campus demonstrations were part of. According to Monday's Washington Post account of the private fundraiser held in New York on May 14, quoting anonymous participants, the former president also affirmed Israel's right to continue \"its war on terror\" while listing his achievements for Israel during his term in office. With regard to the anti-Israel demonstrations and encampments roiling US college campuses in the months since the Hamas-led attack of October 7, Trump said he would expel foreign students who participate in the protests. “One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” he reportedly said. Trump also praised the New York Police Department for clearing out the encampment at Columbia University, saying that other cities need to do the same: \"It has to be stopped now,\" he emphasized. “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,” he said, according to donors at the event. During the meeting, Trump said that he supported Israel's right to continue its war to defeat Hamas in Gaza. “But I’m one of the only people that says that now. And a lot of people don’t even know what October 7 is,” he added. The former president ticked off his accomplishments in the White House, including moving the US embassy to the capital Jerusalem and recognising the Golan Heights as part of Israel. He also warned that \"Israel is losing its power\" in Washington and specifically on Capitol Hill, calling it \"incredible\" and arguing that Israel needs his help. Trump also repeated his frustration at the fact that the majority of Jewish Americans vote for Democrats, including the current president, Joe Biden, who beat Trump in the last election. “But how can a Jewish person vote for a Democrat, and Biden in particular—but forget Biden. They always let you down,” he said. Karoline Leavitt, the campaign’s national press secretary, wrote to the Post in email that “When President Trump is back in the Oval Office, Israel will once again be protected, Iran will go back to being broke, terrorists will be hunted down, and the bloodshed will end.\"",

        "content": "Every morning, each person rolls out of bed to the soothing sound of bones and joints creaking, cracking and popping! We all walk (shuffle) stiffly to the bathroom to brush our teeth. It takes our bodies a while to stretch out, and our joints to get on board with moving freely after a night of rest. This stiffness is normal and can be attributed to the extended sedentary stay in bed, hopefully around seven to eight hours per night. The same stiffness can be felt after a long car ride, watching a movie on the couch or working at your desk for too long. This is because movement begets mobility. We are all familiar with Isaac Newton’s law, \"an object in motion stays in motion...\" That law applies to our joints and muscles, too! Where a lot of people go wrong is they think, \"Ouch, I hurt, moving more will make me hurt so I should sit still.\" In fact, it is quite the opposite. Movement brings blood flow to your muscles and delivers nutrients and oxygen, breathing new life into your muscles when you use them! Movement will also lubricate the connective tissue in your joints, making them less stiff and more mobile. Simply walking every day will greatly reduce pain by preventing the body from stiffening up, your muscles becoming hardened and your joints locking up. Think of a vehicle: If a car sits in the driveway all winter, everything gets hardened and rusty, the belts get taunt, and the fluids get sludge-like. It is no different with your musculoskeletal system. The goal is to keep everything loose, warmed up and moving freely for optimal performance in daily functioning. This can be achieved by walking daily. Another great way to keep your body agile is stretching and bending across multiple planes of movement. We tend to do activities that are right in front of us: pushing a grocery cart, typing on our keyboard, driving, reading and the list goes on. This tends to cause our shoulders to slump forward and our heads to bow, and creates a lot of posture, back pain and health problems. When is the last time you moved your body laterally? Dancing, rock climbing, tennis, ice skating and skiing are great activities for lateral movement of our trunk and extremities. Making sure we do not lose flexibility to move across different planes is critical to maintaining our health and longevity. Lateral movement doesn’t have to involve any hardcore, advanced exercises or sports. Consistently stretching, bending and breathing into different planes of movement will provide pain relief and help maintain flexibility. Movement is medicine. And the best part is, it’s free and has zero negative side effects! Movement is akin to letting your muscles breathe and eat. It is necessary for health and longevity of your vessel. \"But my back really hurts, how am I supposed to dance and rock climb?\" There is a difference between pain and discomfort. I don’t believe in the \"no pain, no gain\" mentality that the body builders of the 1980s promoted, but I do believe there is a threshold for discomfort that can be pushed. As much as exercise and movement provides undeniable health benefits, it does come with some risk. If you’re moving your body, there is a potential for injury. But guess what? Sitting on your couch causes potential risks and harm too. The potential for pain is there either way. Mara Casler Exercise shouldn’t be painful, but it should be slightly uncomfortable. Learning to push yourself past what feels comfortable is a skill that is built over time through exercise experience. There is a difference between \"redlining\" in an exercise, and exerting a big effort. Rate your discomfort of the exercise on a scale of 1 to 10. If you start to near the 8 to 10 mark, consider modifying the activity, taking a break, and hydrating. After your heart rate comes down and you catch your breath, reassess how you feel and try again! Remember: Movement begets movement. The more you move, the more you want to move and the better you’ll feel. Sitting around, waiting for the pain to go away so that you can exercise, is not the way to heal. Heal yourself through movement by pushing past the initial discomfort and learning when you need to modify. If you treat yourself like you are full of aches and pains, that’s how you will feel. If you treat your body like an athlete, that’s how you will feel. Choose to feel good — choose movement.

        "content": "The 32-strong official selection of the 58th edition of Karlovy Vary Film Festival , Central and Eastern Europe’s leading cinema fete, will feature 15 directorial debuts as well as the latest works of established filmmakers such as Mark Cousins , Oleh Sentsov , Noaz Deshe, Antonin Peretjatko, Beata Parkanova and Burak Cevik. Karel Och, artistic director of Karlovy Vary, said Tuesday that he’d identified a number of themes and genre in the selection, which included “a freshly revisionist take on the esthetical canons of a period film; a balanced, caring but also provocative look on the fate of a woman in the contemporary society in any moment of her life; and the immediate influence of political events on the life of an individual human being anywhere in the world.” The festival, which runs June 28-July 6 in the Czech Republic, has also revealed the juries of the Crystal Globe and Proxima competitions. The members of the Crystal Globe jury are producer Christine Vachon, actor Geoffrey Rush, director Gábor Reisz, poet and novelist Sjón, and actor Eliška Křenková. The films in the Proxima Competition will be judged by filmmaker Mohamed Kordofani, producer Bianca Balbuena, Daniela Michel, the founding director of the Morelia Film Festival, Wouter Jansen, the founder of the sales company Square Eyes, and Adéla Komrzý, a filmmaker. (Film descriptions, below, supplied by the festival.) Crystal Globe Competition “Ai ni ranbou” (Rude to Love) Director: Yukihiro Morigaki Japan, world premiere An unsettling drama about a marriage that is steadily losing its spark. Momoko (Noriko Eguchi) leads a respectable life as a housewife. She dresses elegantly and ensures that the apartment looks just right, down to the last detail; she attends to her husband assiduously and goes to great lengths to cook him proper Japanese food. Are these expressions of love, or rather paranoia from the emotional chasm that has opened out between them? And when does devoted care become an obsession? A psychologically precise case history of a spent relationship, in which long suppressed pain has risen to the surface. A film that examines the dark corners of human frustration and hysteria, where the desire to create something good develops into the urge to destroy. “Banzo” Director: Margarida Cardoso Portugal, France, Netherlands, international premiere In 1907, Alonso arrives on Prince’s Island, where he has been tasked with treating a group of workers plagued by a mysterious affliction called banzo, also known as slave nostalgia. Those affected feel an intense homesickness, fall into apathy, lose the strength to live, and eventually die. Alonso slowly discovers that it is not enough to treat the physical symptoms; he must understand the soul of those who have been uprooted. The oppressive atmosphere of the isolated tropical island forms the backdrop for a story from the dark colonial past in which humanity is put to the ultimate test. “Banzo” is also a reminder that there is more than one way to interpret the past, and that behind every story is a person telling the story. “Cì xīn qiè gŭ” (Pierce) Director: Nelicia Low Singapore, Taiwan, Poland, world premiere After Han is released from juvenile prison, where he served seven years for killing an opponent in a fencing match, he meets his younger brother and insists on his innocence. Jie believes him, and the torn brotherly bond begins to heal. Behind their mother’s back, Han helps Jie perfect his fencing skills so that he can qualify for the national championships. But the initially energetic clinking of sabres is slowly drowned out by silent doubts: Is Han really innocent? Low’s gripping atmospheric thriller offers a nerve-wracking duel between the ideals of brotherly love and the illusions that we project onto those close to us. “Drie dagen vis” (Three Days of Fish) Director: Peter Hoogendoorn Netherlands, Belgium, world premiere Just as he does every year, dad flies from sunny Portugal for a three-day visit to the Netherlands, the drab country of his birth. He has his usual errands to run, and he visits his doctor for his annual check-up, accompanied by his eccentric grown-up son... This intimate film offers a glimpse into the relationship between two men who have grown apart yet, as they engage in seemingly mundane activities, little by little they try to find their way back to one another. “Three Days of Fish,” the second outing by Dutch filmmaker Hoogendoorn, is a gentle drama, interlaced with the dry humor typical for the region. The director’s feature debut “Between 10 and 12” premiered at Venice. “Elskling” (Loveable) Director: Lilja Ingolfsdottir Norway, world premiere While Sigmund is always away on business, Maria juggles her career with childcare and managing the home. Like many other relationships, theirs was also all about love and harmony in the early stages, however, after years of married life, the cracks started to appear. Sigmund is ultimately the one to ask for a divorce, and Maria is forced to confront her greatest fears. While ostensibly a divorce drama, this debut by Ingolfsdottir nevertheless takes us further, delivering a multilayered character study of a woman experiencing a crisis that leads her to self-knowledge. “Loveable” isn’t a story about the quest for true love; on the contrary, it takes a fresh approach to examine contemporary ideas of romance, equality within the relationship, and the power of womanhood. “Ema a smrtihlav” (The Hungarian Dressmaker) Director: Iveta Grófová Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, world premiere It’s the 1940s. The Slovak state witnesses the rise of nationalism and it’s not an auspicious time for minorities. The turbulent social mood also impacts the widow Marika, who loses her job in an Aryanised dressmaker’s shop. Given the increasing anti-Hungarian sentiment she shuts herself away, particularly since she is harboring a little Jewish boy. Despite this she still finds herself singled out by two men: a German Nazi officer and a captain of Slovakia’s Hlinka Guard. This drama by Slovak director Grófová is an adaptation of the novella of the same name by Peter Krištúfek, which conjures up the dramatic atmosphere of wartime Slovakia. The story of a fragmented era, which forces the protagonists to confront complex dilemmas, is told not only through words, but also by way of a powerful visual language. “Mord” (Our Lovely Pig Slaughter) Director: Adam Martinec Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, world premiere The pig-killing fest on an old farm is a tradition Karel looks forward to every year. It’s the only chance for the whole family to get together, have a good time, engage in a squabble or two, and enjoy some great food. But this time things are different. The butcher hides the fact his cartridges are damp, grandpa can’t bring himself to tell Karel, recently widowed, that this slaughter will be their last, daughter Lucie is depressed after her marital breakup, and grandson Dušík runs away while his parents argue over whether he’s old enough to watch the kill. As for Karel, the pig’s blood spilling everywhere is the last straw... Martinec’s feature debut is a remarkably incisive study of the Czech temperament which, through its visceral character portrayal and searing humor, evokes the masterworks of the Czechoslovak New Wave. “Panoptikoni” (Panopticon) Director: George Sikharulidze Georgia, France, Italy, Romania, world premiere When Sandro’s father decides to devote his life to God and leaves for a monastery, the teenage introvert finds himself deprived of the fundamental certainties of life. Abandoned by his father and his mother, who is working abroad, the young man embarks on a journey of self-discovery, opening up both to a new friendship with the radical Lasha, who has ties with an ultra-right organization, and also to the chance to explore his own sexuality. Sikharulidze’s perceptive feature debut considers how fine the line is between the observer and the observed, and asks where contemporary post-Soviet Georgian society is heading as it hovers on the border between religious conservatism and nationalisation on the one hand, and the desire for independence and modernization on the other. “Proslava” (Celebration) Director: Bruno Anković Croatia, Qatar, world premiere Bruno Anković’s feature film debut is set in an impoverished Croatian village between the years 1926 and 1945. The constant deprivation, repeated changes to the regime, and war pervaded the forests and shrouded the place in a miasma that obscured all visions of a better future. Village life was also tough for Mijo: His young, innocent soul was burdened by the outside world and troubled by inhumane orders, and he then fell prey to the false sheen of right-wing ideology. This film adaptation of the successful novel of the same name by Damir Karakaš presents us with wonderful shots of the rural landscape, but it is also a testimony of commonplace brutality and demonstrates the reasons why innocent people become easy quarry for ideological crusaders. “A Sudden Glimpse to Deeper Things” Director: Mark Cousins U.K. world premiere One of the most important women in British modern art, the painter Wilhelmina Barns-Graham was a highly inspirational figure, whose work was deeply impacted by a pivotal event in her life. In May 1949, this leading representative of the modernist St. Ives group of artists climbed to the top of the Grindelwald glacier in Switzerland, an experience which was to transform the way she saw the world. She spent the rest of her life capturing its shapes and colors, indeed its very essence. In his essayistic portrait Cousins delves into complex themes of gender, climate change and creativity, while laying bare the artist’s character and vast imagination so pervasively that he creates the impression we are seeing the world through her eyes. “Světýlka” (Tiny Lights) Director: Beata Parkanová Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, world premiere Amálka is six years old. She loves her cat, her parents, and her gran and grandpa. It’s summertime and all the little girl could wish for is for the day to turn out just as it should. Except that things are different. Her parents have shut themselves in a room and she can hear raised voices through the door, which isn’t normal. Something’s going on and Amálka has no idea what it is. In a superbly creative direction from Parkanová, “Tiny Lights” follows a family break-up as perceived by a child: Through the keyhole, ear pressed to the door, everything seen at adult waist height. Each day has to end, and this one has brought Amálka to the point of no return. She feels the hurt as she drifts off to sleep, but she has also grown up a little. “Xoftex” Director: Noaz Deshe Germany, France, world premiere Xoftex is a Greek refugee camp, where Syrian and Palestinian asylum seekers anxiously wait for news of their refugee status. To pass the time between interviews with the immigration office, Nasser and his friends film satirical sketches and make preparations for a zombie horror flick. Except that the reality of the camp could be taken for a horror scenario itself. The tension between its inhabitants gains momentum and every conflict removes one more brick from the wall which divides reality from dream – or, indeed, nightmare. Fragments of real life, humor, and the unimaginable suffering of people risking their lives to escape their own country, merge into an explosive, at times, surreal spectacle which invites the viewers to immerse themselves in the story and the lives of immigrants in a way they will never have experienced before. Proxima Competition “Bezvetrije” (Windless) Director: Pavel G. Vesnakov Bulgaria, Italy, world premiere After years away Kaloyan returns to his native Bulgaria in order to sell his late father’s flat. What at first seems like a routine task devoid of emotion gradually develops into a journey to the depths of his being, where he is confronted with distant traumas, yet he also strikes a new path toward self-discovery. While childhood is filled with sensations and the rustling wind, adulthood is a state of fragile windless and fading memories of those closest to us. Vesnakov delivers colorful existential reflections on the nature of family bonds and personal identity over the course of time. Yet he also muses on modern-day Bulgaria, where the cemeteries of its original inhabitants are being replaced by shady casinos, and where cultural memory is waning in a country deceived by an illusory vision of economic prosperity. “Cabo Negro” Director: Abdellah Taïa France, Morocco, world premiere Two young people, Soundouss and Jaâfar, arrive at a luxury villa in the resort of Cabo Negro rented by Jaâfar’s lover, who is supposed to join them later. But something is wrong – he still hasn’t turned up, and they can’t reach him on his phone. Left on their own, they decide, despite their uncertain financial and personal situation, to enjoy their holiday as much as their minds and bodies will allow. On vacation, with time seemingly non-existent, they take the opportunity to reflect on their relationships back home – and on the future, which feels so distant here on the sun-drenched beach. Taïa presents a queer ode to the seemingly carefree time of youth. “Clorofilla” (Chlorophyll) Director: Ivana Gloria Italy, international premiere Green-haired Maia is tired of city life and, driven by a desire to be among nature, she decides to spend the summer picking oranges. In the orchards she is greeted by the gardener, an eccentric loner called Teo, who notices that Maia isn’t like everyone else. In the same way he tends his plants, he devotes his time and energy to her, too, and the young woman starts to blossom. Their burgeoning friendship, however, is unsettled by the arrival of Teo’s father and older brother Arturo, who are planning a celebration in a neighboring village... In her richly colored story, which shows it’s sometimes difficult to find someone who could help us to discover our true selves, Gloria awakens within us senses that we didn’t even know we had. “Fără suflet” (The Alienated) Director: Anja Kreis Germany, Moldova, France, world premiere Varvara, a professor of philosophy, is discussing the concept of God’s death with her students. She is visited by her sister Angelina, an eminent gynaecologist who has been recalled from Moscow and sent to another city, where she is to reduce the number of abortions. Not long afterwards a girl comes to see her at the hospital, asking her to perform an abortion, claiming that she is carrying the Antichrist in her womb. After a heated dispute with a student, Varvara ponders the presence of evil in human nature, while Angelina carries out an illegal abortion on the girl and takes the embryo home with her... This mystical film is beguiling for its ominous atmosphere and raises uncomfortable questions about human conscience, morality and faith, although it declines to provide definitive answers. “Hiçbir şey yerinde değil” (Nothing in its Place) Director: Burak Çevik Turkey, Germany, South Korea, international premiere One evening, one apartment, five leftist students, and one vision of a non-violent socialist revolution. When this gathering is interrupted by the unannounced visit of two members of a right-wing movement, things quickly spiral out of control. Turkish director Çevik uses long takes and an enclosed space as a canvas onto which his ensemble cast’s strong performances paint a story reflecting the turbulent political situation in 1978 Ankara. How far are people willing to go for their political beliefs, and how much can the ideology of a group influence the behavior of an individual? “Nothing in its Place” holds up a mirror to more than one revolution. “Ju wai ren” (Stranger) Director: Zhengfan Yang U.S., China, Netherlands, Norway, France, world premiere The hotel room as a place where everybody is a stranger. A place that is yours for just a moment. A temporarily intimate space entered by a maid in order to clean it while, if possible, not leaving a single trace of her visit. Each part of the episodic “Stranger” is set in just such a place. One episode equals one shot. One shot equals one story. What they have in common is China, the home country of both guests and staff, although each of their lives differs from the others. The film’s absurd, darkly humorous, poignant and mysterious stories are set in a seemingly confined space that nevertheless opens up new and surprising dimensions with each episode. “Lapilli” Director: Paula Ďurinová Slovak Republic, Germany, world premiere In her feature debut, Ďurinová sets out to wander among varied rock formations in order to try and come to terms with the loss of her grandparents. Different stages of grief unfold among the sea currents, the dark caves and the volcanic wasteland, while the strings of an autoharp resonate in the ravines. Lapilli finds a balance between the personal and the environmental in a modernistic requiem full of perceptive observations on natural phenomena and on man himself. This is a work that excels in its inner strength and rare film language, where sea waves reflect shifting thoughts, and where the erosion of arid soil is reminiscent of a broken heart filled with memories of people who are lost to us forever. “Od marca do mája” (March to May) Director: Martin Pavol Repka Czech Republic, world premiere A family of five lives together in an old village house. While the parents are slowly aging, the children are growing up, and it is clear that they will soon go their own way. This unchanging rhythm of everyday life is disrupted by the unexpected news of the mother’s pregnancy, and the idea of a new sibling gradually affects all members of the household. “March to May” is an understated, intimate portrait of family togetherness, which is often expressed in the smallest of ways. An unassuming yet highly original story, filmed with the same tenderness and patience with which nature awakens every spring. “Second Chance” Director: Subhadra Mahajan India, world premiere Desolate after experiencing a traumatic incident, Mia travels to the family’s summer retreat amid the snow-covered Himalayas in order to regain her strength. There she finds the company of the caretaker’s mother-in-law, Bimal, and her grandson, Sunny. Irrespective of their differing ages, social background and their ideas of happiness, a surprisingly strong bond develops between them, which cannot be broken, not even by the arrival of someone who drives Mia straight back into her trauma. This visually mesmerizing film offers an authentic and vivid depiction of the process of coping with female pain and demonstrates that a second chance might emerge where we least expect it. “Trans Memoria” Director: Victoria Verseau Sweden, France, world premiere “I collect. I document. I write down my memories. I’m afraid they’ll disappear.” This is how Verseau introduces her intimate documentary diary, in which she returns to Thailand and to the year 2012, when she underwent her transition. She had long awaited this moment, but then came feelings of uncertainty, amplified by the death of a close friend. The conceptual artist adopts an almost archaeological approach to the past and lays bare the process of writing a personal story that is intrinsically linked to the creation of her own identity. In this deeply felt debut she reveals the joyful aspects and also the dark recesses of transition and, bringing other testimonies into play as well, she critically examines what defines women as women. “Tropicana” Director: Omer Tobi Israel, Canada, world premiere A lonely middle-aged woman lives her monotonous life. Every morning, she goes to her job as a supermarket cashier, and every day after work she goes straight home to look after her ailing mother and the rest of the family. Nobody, however, seems to care. Then, the mysterious murder of her boss sets off a chain of events at the end of which she can be free and find her own worth. How to describe her journey? Perhaps best as a sexual odyssey, an exploratory expedition to places where an important role is played by carnality, desire, and its gratification. “Tropicana” is a subtly enigmatic reflection on conservatism, prudery, and the false ideal of physical beauty. “Vino la noche” (Night Has Come) Director: Paolo Tizón Peru, Spain, Mexico, world premiere A group of young adventurers sign up for one of the most challenging military training courses in Latin America, which will turn them into fearsome warriors entrusted with overseeing the dangerous VRAEM region, an area filled with coca plants, terrorists and smugglers. In his absorbing look at the hermetically sealed world of the army, debut director Tizon paints a portrait of one institution while depicting individual human stories and reflecting on male identity, the potential for self-determination, and a fragile masculinity that stands in striking contrast to the brutal training. Sensitivity alongside violence, beauty alongside vulnerability. Special Screenings “Architektura ČSSR 58–89” (Czechoslovak Architecture 58–89) Director: Jan Zajíček Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, world premiere Vladimír 518, uncompromising rapper, artist, stage designer and activist, is a rare phenomenon, who not only writes books, but publishes them as well. Today also a respected authority primarily on pre-1989 architecture, he has written not only a major publication on the subject, but also the story for two audiovisual works treating the same theme, which were shot by Jan Zajíček, renowned director of music videos. In addition to the recent TV series we have the eagerly anticipated feature film which, through its fascinating and impressive exploration of Czech and Slovak architecture of the latter half of the 20th century, offers exclusive insight into extraordinary buildings and unique individuals living below the Tatra Mountains. “In the Land of Brothers” Director: Alireza Ghasemi, Raha Amirfazli Iran, France, Netherlands, European premiere The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to a massive flight of Afghans to neighboring Iran, which – since they hoped to find a new home there – they called the “Land of Brothers.” But the dream of fraternal coexistence soon faded, Iranian law never accepted them as equal citizens, and so even the descendants of the first refugees still carry the burden of otherness. Ghasemi and Amirfazli’s wistful, beautifully shot feature debut about a family who will never feel at home in the country where they live won over audiences immediately on its premiere at Sundance. “Ještě nejsem, kým chci být” (I’m Not Everything I Want to Be) Director: Klára Tasovská Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Austria This year’s notional award for excellence on the domestic film front should go to this documentary on the internationally renowned photographer Libuše Jarcovjáková, a work which enchanted many at the Berlinale. This project looks back over the past 50 years at the life of a true icon, known as the Czech Nan Goldin, and this via a montage of several thousand of her photographs and her diary entries, which she reads out herself. Portraits, self-portraits, immortalized moments, the quest for truth lying deep within nameless fellow opponents of grim Normalisation, reflections of the transformation of body and soul, black-and-white images, emotion and life in flashes of brilliant light. “Das Lied der Anderen – Eine Suche nach Europa” (The Song of Others – A Search for Europe) Director: Vadim Jendreyko Switzerland, international premiere What is Europe? In his topical personal essay, Jendreyko travels across the old continent to discover its essence in places that might be called acupuncture points of European identity. His various stops include the bottom of the Rhine, Greek docks, the European Parliament, a primeval forest in Poland, and a Sarajevo library. All of these places invite ambivalent reflections: on the one hand, they celebrate Europe’s diversity and the breadth of its cultural heritage; on the other hand, they are symbols of turbulence, conflict and bloody history. Is Europe condemned to be stuck in a vicious circle of violence, or is there hope in those who try to sing the songs of others? “Real” Director: Oleh Sentsov Ukraine, Croatia, world premiere Acclaimed filmmaker, activist, Sakharov Prize-winning former Kremlin prisoner, and soldier Sentsov is currently defending his homeland as a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, which he joined in the first days of the Russian invasion in February 2022. During one assault, his infantry fighting vehicle was destroyed by enemy artillery. His attempts to organize the evacuation of part of his unit were complicated by the lack of ammunition and incessant Russian fire. The name of the operation was Real, and Sentsov’s eponymous film is an immersive experience that offers a hyper-documentary insight into the reality of the war through the eyes of one direct participant. “Ta druhá” (The Other One) Director: Marie-Magdalena Kochová Czech Republic, world premiere In her feature-length debut, Kochová uses the character of 18-year-old Johanna to explore the phenomenon of “glass children” – children who, because they have a special-needs sibling, are neglected by their family, however unintentionally. They often feel invisible, their problems are always considered less important, and they are often expected to help take care of their disabled brother or sister. Johana is about to graduate from high school, and so she must decide whether to leave home to study, or stay and help her parents. An immensely sensitive account of the nature of sibling love which, for once, puts “the other one” first. “Tatabojs.doc” Director: Marek Najbrt Czech Republic, world premiere “Foot Soldiers,” “Attention aux hommes,” “Dancer,” “Repetition”... These are just some of the string of hits by Prague band Tata Bojs. Always energetic, capable of myriad transformations, precise in their conceptual approach to the visual and musical interpretation of individual albums and concerts. It’s no surprise that Najbrt decided not to go for the conventional documentary. He tells the band’s story as a playful collage, pieced together from a wealth of archive material and recordings of concerts and futuristic stage performances with the Vosto5 theater company. Thus, unfolding before our very eyes is a portrait of a highly original band which, despite the alternative nature of its output, has earned its rightful place among the country’s top players. “Vlny” (Waves) Director: Jiří Mádl Czech Republic, world premiere One might think that Czech and Slovak filmmakers have already said all there is to say about the period around 1968 in Czechoslovak history. As Mádl’s latest outing shows, however, this crucial era in our modern history still has forgotten stories to offer that are worthy of our attention. The film revolves around the international news office at Czechoslovak Radio, a place full of talented individuals possessing broad insight, linguistic skills, and above all a commitment to honest journalistic work with a focus on the truth. An epic, dynamically shot, rewarding film, which embraces uncommon heroism in the face of an oppressive regime, the strength of fraternal ties, and the eternal themes of love, betrayal, morality, and hope. “Voyage au bord de la guerre” (Journey to the Brink of War) Director: Antonin Peretjatko France, international premiere Within the first month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than 12.5 million people were forced to flee their homes and 5 million fled the country altogether. Peretjatko returns to Lviv with Andrei, who has left with his family for France, to retrieve Andrei’s personal belongings and to explore his own roots, but most importantly to record eyewitness testimony from people who have remained in Ukraine. Part reportage documentary and part poetic road movie with an aesthetic style reminiscent of the early French New Wave, “Journey to the Brink of War” tries to share with the viewer what everyday life looks like in a war-torn country. “Zahradníkův rok” (The Gardener’s Year) Director: Jiří Havelka Czech Republic, world premiere A true story of injustice perpetrated on a peaceful gardener by a wealthy neighbor meets Karel Čapek’s eponymous literary work about a gardener’s hardships and successes over the course of a year. Havelka, one of the most complex artistic personalities of our time, has long proved that “alternative” and “audience-friendly” need not be mutually exclusive. His quietly moving tragicomic story about a remarkably stubborn struggle for the right to a dignified life is built on two great performances by the always outstanding Oldřich Kaiser and Dáša Vokata.",

        "content": "The Karlovy Vary Film Festival (KVIFF) has unveiled its competition and other lineups for its 58th edition, set to run in the Czech spa town from June 28 to July 6. It also set its competition jury, led by indie film producer who will be joined by Australian actor , Hungarian director Gábor Reisz, Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón and Czech actress Eliška Křenková.. Organizers highlighted 15 directorial or feature-directorial debuts in this year’s official selection and various world premieres. In its special screenings lineup, KVIFF will present the world premiere of Ukrainian filmmaker and former Kremlin prisoner . Sentsov “is currently defending his homeland as a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, which he joined in the first days of the Russian invasion in February 2022,” the film description provided by the fest reads. “During one assault, his infantry fighting vehicle was destroyed by enemy artillery. His attempts to organize the evacuation of part of his unit were complicated by the lack of ammunition and incessant Russian fire. The name of the operation was Real, and Sentsov’s eponymous film is a unique immersive experience that offers a hyper-documentary insight into the reality of the war through the eyes of one direct participant.” Among this year’s KVIFF competition lineup are Iveta Grófová’s , which depicts the rise of nationalism in Slovakia in the 1940s, and Bruno Anković’s , a film adaptation of a novel about a Croatian village between the years 1926 and 1945 where right-wing ideology rises. from Japanese director Yukihiro Morigakia, about a marriage “steadily losing its spark,” will also compete for the festival’s Crystal Globe honor for best competition film. The competition also features such established names as , who brings , about British modern painter Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, to Karlovy Vary, as well as Noaz Deshe who will debut , about a Greek refugee camp where Syrian and Palestinian asylum seekers await news of their refugee status. Organizers on Tuesday also unveiled the program for Karlovy Vary’s Proxima sidebar, which aims to put the spotlight on bold works by young filmmakers and renowned auteurs alike. This year, it includes films about the hotel room as a place where everybody is a stranger, leftist students being interrupted by the visit of members of a right-wing movement, and , directed by Victoria Verseau, a documentary diary about the filmmaker’s return to Thailand where she underwent her transition in 2012. The Karlovy Vary team noticed several themes cutting across various movies in the lineup. “Freshly revisionist takes on the esthetical canons of a period film. A balanced, caring but also provocative look [at] the fate of a woman in ... contemporary society ... The immediate influence of political events on the life of an individual human being anywhere in the world. My colleagues and I discovered these themes running through our selection of films,” highlighted . He also touted a global cinematic lineup with new works. “15 out of 32 films featured in the official selection are debuts, and we could not be more excited they are accompanied by the brand new works of renowned filmmakers of the likes of Mark Cousins, Oleh Sentsov, Noaz Deshe, Antonin Peretjatko, Beata Parkanova and Burak Cevik,” he said. Check out the full KVIFF official selection with descriptions of the films below. / Director: Yukihiro Morigaki Japan, 2023, 105 min, World premiere An unsettling drama about a marriage which is steadily losing its spark. Momoko (Noriko Eguchi) leads a respectable life as a housewife. She dresses elegantly and ensures that the apartment looks just right, down to the last detail; she attends to her husband assiduously and goes to great lengths to cook him proper Japanese food. Are these expressions of love, or rather paranoia from the emotional chasm that has opened out between them? And when does devoted care become an obsession? A psychologically precise case history of a spent relationship, in which long suppressed pain has risen to the surface. A film that examines the dark corners of human frustration and hysteria, where the desire to create something good develops into the urge to destroy. Director: Margarida Cardoso Portugal, France, Netherlands, 2024, 127 min, International premiere In 1907, Alonso arrives on Prince’s Island, where he has been tasked with treating a group of workers plagued by a mysterious affliction called , also known as slave nostalgia. Those affected feel an intense homesickness, fall into apathy, lose the strength to live, and eventually die. Alonso slowly discovers that it is not enough to treat the physical symptoms; he must understand the soul of those who have been uprooted. The oppressive atmosphere of the isolated tropical island forms the backdrop for a story from the dark colonial past in which humanity is put to the ultimate test. is also a reminder that there is more than one way to interpret the past, and that behind every story is a person telling the story. / Director: Nelicia Low Singapore, Taiwan, Poland, 2024, 109 min, World premiere After Han is released from juvenile prison, where he served seven years for killing an opponent in a fencing match, he meets his younger brother and insists on his innocence. Jie believes him, and the torn brotherly bond begins to heal. Behind their mother’s back, Han helps Jie perfect his fencing skills so that he can qualify for the national championships. But the initially energetic clinking of sabres is slowly drowned out by silent doubts: is Han really innocent? Nelicia Low’s gripping atmospheric thriller offers a nerve-wracking duel between the ideals of brotherly love and the illusions that we project onto those close to us. / Director: Peter Hoogendoorn Netherlands, Belgium, 2024, 85 min, World premiere Just as he does every year, dad flies from sunny Portugal for a three-day visit to the Netherlands, the drab country of his birth. He has his usual errands to run and he visits his doctor for his annual check-up, accompanied by his eccentric grown-up son... This intimate film offers a glimpse into the relationship between two men who have grown apart yet, as they engage in seemingly mundane activities, little by little they try to find their way back to one another. , the second outing by Dutch filmmaker Peter Hoogendoorn, is a gentle drama, interlaced with the dry humour typical for the region. The director’s feature debut premiered at the Venice IFF. / Director: Lilja Ingolfsdottir Norway, 2024, 101 min, World premiere While Sigmund is always away on business, Maria juggles her career with childcare and managing the home. Like many other relationships, theirs was also all about love and harmony in the early stages, however, after years of married life, the cracks started to appear. Sigmund is ultimately the one to ask for a divorce, and Maria is forced to confront her greatest fears. While ostensibly a divorce drama, this debut by writer-director Lilja Ingolfsdottir nevertheless takes us further, delivering a multilayered character study of a woman experiencing a crisis that leads her to self-knowledge. isn’t a story about the quest for true love; on the contrary, it takes a fresh approach to examine contemporary ideas of romance, equality within the relationship, and the power of womanhood. / Director: Iveta Grófová Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, 2024, 129 min, World premiere It’s the 1940s. The Slovak state witnesses the rise of nationalism and it’s not an auspicious time for minorities. The turbulent social mood also impacts the widow Marika, who loses her job in an Aryanised dressmaker’s shop. Given the increasing anti-Hungarian sentiment she shuts herself away, particularly since she is harbouring a little Jewish boy. Despite this she still finds herself singled out by two men: a German Nazi officer and a captain of Slovakia’s Hlinka Guard. This drama by Slovak director Iveta Grófová is an adaptation of the novella of the same name by Peter Krištúfek, which conjures up the dramatic atmosphere of wartime Slovakia. The story of a fragmented era, which forces the protagonists to confront complex dilemmas, is told not only through words, but also by way of a powerful visual language. / Director: Adam Martinec Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, 2024, 84 min, World premiere The pig-killing fest on an old farm is a tradition Karel looks forward to every year. It’s the only chance for the whole family to get together, have a good time, engage in a squabble or two, and enjoy some great food. But this time things are different. The butcher hides the fact his cartridges are damp, grampa can’t bring himself to tell Karel, recently widowed, that this slaughter will be their last, daughter Lucie is depressed after her marital breakup, and grandson Dušík runs away while his parents argue over whether he’s old enough to watch the kill. As for Karel, the pig’s blood spilling everywhere is the last straw... Adam Martinec’s feature debut is a remarkably incisive study of the Czech temperament which, through its visceral character portrayal and searing humour, evokes the masterworks of the Czechoslovak New Wave. / Director: George Sikharulidze Georgia, France, Italy, Romania, 2024, 95 min, World premiere When Sandro’s father decides to devote his life to God and leaves for a monastery, the teenage introvert finds himself deprived of the fundamental certainties of life. Abandoned by his father and his mother, who is working abroad, the young man embarks on a journey of self-discovery, opening up both to a new friendship with the radical Lasha, who has ties with an ultra-right organisation, and also to the chance to explore his own sexuality. George Sikharulidze’s perceptive feature debut considers how fine the line is between the observer and the observed, and asks where contemporary post-Soviet Georgian society is heading as it hovers on the border between religious conservatism and nationalisation on the one hand, and the desire for independence and modernisation on the other. / Director: Bruno Anković Croatia, Qatar, 2024, 86 min, World premiere Bruno Anković’s feature film debut is set in an impoverished Croatian village between the years 1926 and 1945. The constant deprivation, repeated changes to the regime, and war pervaded the forests and shrouded the place in a miasma that obscured all visions of a better future. Village life was also tough for Mijo: His young, innocent soul was burdened by the outside world and troubled by inhumane orders, and he then fell prey to the false sheen of right-wing ideology. This film adaptation of the successful novel of the same name by Damir Karakaš presents us with wonderful shots of the rural landscape, but it is also a testimony of commonplace brutality and demonstrates the reasons why innocent people become easy quarry for ideological crusaders. Director: Mark Cousins United Kingdom, 2024, 88 min, World premiere One of the most important women in British modern art, the painter Wilhelmina Barns-Graham was a highly inspirational figure, whose work was deeply impacted by a pivotal event in her life. In May 1949, this leading representative of the modernist St Ives group of artists climbed to the top of the Grindelwald glacier in Switzerland, an experience which was to transform the way she saw the world. She spent the rest of her life capturing its shapes and colours, indeed its very essence. In his essayistic portrait documentarist Mark Cousins delves into complex themes of gender, climate change and creativity, while laying bare the artist’s character and vast imagination so pervasively that he creates the impression we are seeing the world through her eyes. / Director: Beata Parkanová Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, 2024, 74 min, World premiere Amálka is six years old. She loves her cat, her parents, and her gran and grampa. It’s summertime and all the little girl could wish for is for the day to turn out just as it should. Except that things are different. Her parents have shut themselves in a room and she can hear raised voices through the door, which isn’t normal. Something’s going on and Amálka has no idea what it is. In a superbly creative direction from Beata Parkanová, follows a family break-up as perceived by a child: Through the keyhole, ear pressed to the door, everything seen at adult waist height.Each day has to end, and this one has brought Amálka to the point of no return. She feels the hurt as she drifts off to sleep, but she has also grown up a little. Director: Noaz Deshe Germany, France, 2024, 95 min, World premiere Xoftex is a Greek refugee camp, where Syrian and Palestinian asylum seekers anxiously wait for news of their refugee status. To pass the time between interviews with the immigration office, Nasser and his friends film satirical sketches and make preparations for a zombie horror flick. Except that the reality of the camp could be taken for a horror scenario itself. The tension between its inhabitants gains momentum and every conflict removes one more brick from the wall which divides reality from dream – or, indeed, nightmare. Fragments of real life, humour, and the unimaginable suffering of people risking their lives to escape their own country, merge into an explosive, at times, surreal spectacle which invites the viewers to immerse themselves in the story and the lives of immigrants in a way they will never have experienced before. / Director: Pavel G. Vesnakov Bulgaria, Italy, 2024, 93 min, World premiere After years away Kaloyan returns to his native Bulgaria in order to sell his late father’s flat. What at first seems like a routine task devoid of emotion gradually develops into a journey to the depths of his being, where he is confronted with distant traumas, yet he also strikes a new path towards self-discovery. While childhood is filled with sensations and the rustling wind, adulthood is a state of fragile windless and fading memories of those closest to us. Vesnakov delivers colourful existential reflections on the nature of family bonds and personal identity over the course of time. Yet he also muses on modern-day Bulgaria, where the cemeteries of its original inhabitants are being replaced by shady casinos, and where cultural memory is waning in a country deceived by an illusory vision of economic prosperity. Director: Abdellah Taïa France, Morocco, 2024, 76 min, World premiere Two young people, Soundouss and Jaâfar, arrive at a luxury villa in the resort of Cabo Negro rented by Jaâfar’s lover, who is supposed to join them later. But something is wrong – he still hasn’t turned up, and they can’t reach him on his phone. Left on their own, they decide, despite their uncertain financial and personal situation, to enjoy their holiday as much as their minds and bodies will allow. On vacation, with time seemingly non-existent, they take the opportunity to reflect on their relationships back home – and on the future, which feels so distant here on the sun-drenched beach. Writer-director Abdellah Taïa presents a queer ode to the seemingly carefree time of youth. / Director: Ivana Gloria Italy, 2023, 75 min, International premiere Green-haired Maia is tired of city life and, driven by a desire to be among nature, she decides to spend the summer picking oranges. In the orchards she is greeted by the gardener, an eccentric loner called Teo, who notices that Maia isn’t like everyone else. In the same way he tends his plants, he devotes his time and energy to her, too, and the young woman starts to blossom. Their burgeoning friendship, however, is unsettled by the arrival of Teo’s father and older brother Arturo, who are planning a celebration in a neighbouring village... In her richly coloured story, which shows it’s sometimes difficult to find someone who could help us to discover our true selves, director Ivana Gloria awakens within us senses that we didn’t even know we had. / Director: Anja Kreis Germany, Moldova, France, 2024, 95 min, World premiere Varvara, a professor of philosophy, is discussing the concept of God’s death with her students. She is visited by her sister Angelina, an eminent gynecologist who has been recalled from Moscow and sent to another city, where she is to reduce the number of abortions. Not long afterwards a girl comes to see her at the hospital, asking her to perform an abortion, claiming that she is carrying the Antichrist in her womb. After a heated dispute with a student, Varvara ponders the presence of evil in human nature, while Angelina carries out an illegal abortion on the girl and takes the embryo home with her... This mystical film by Anja Kreis is beguiling for its ominous atmosphere and raises uncomfortable questions about human conscience, morality and faith, although it declines to provide definitive answers. / Director: Burak Çevik Turkey, Germany, South Korea, 2024, 76 min, International premiere One evening, one apartment, five leftist students, and one vision of a non-violent socialist revolution. When this gathering is interrupted by the unannounced visit of two members of a right-wing movement, things quickly spiral out of control. Turkish director Burak Çevik uses long takes and an enclosed space as a canvas onto which his ensemble cast’s strong performances paint a story reflecting the turbulent political situation in 1978 Ankara. How far are people willing to go for their political beliefs, and how much can the ideology of a group influence the behavior of an individual? holds up a mirror to more than one revolution. / Director: Zhengfan Yang USA, China, Netherlands, Norway, France, 2024, 113 min, World premiere The hotel room as a place where everybody is a stranger. A place that is yours for just a moment. A temporarily intimate space entered by a maid in order to clean it while, if possible, not leaving a single trace of her visit. Each part of the episodic is set in just such a place. One episode equals one shot. One shot equals one story. What they have in common is China, the home country of both guests and staff, although each of their lives differs from the others. The film’s absurd, darkly humorous, poignant, and mysterious stories are set in a seemingly confined space that nevertheless opens up new and surprising dimensions with each episode. Director: Paula Ďurinová Slovak Republic, Germany, 2024, 65 min, World premiere In her feature debut director Paula Ďurinová sets out to wander among varied rock formations in order to try and come to terms with the loss of her grandparents. Different stages of grief unfold among the sea currents, the dark caves and the volcanic wasteland, while the strings of an autoharp resonate in the ravines. finds a unique balance between the personal and the environmental in a modernistic requiem full of perceptive observations on natural phenomena and on man himself. This is a work that excels in its inner strength and rare film language, where sea waves reflect shifting thoughts, and where the erosion of arid soil is reminiscent of a broken heart filled with memories of people who are lost to us forever. / Director: Martin Pavol Repka Czech Republic, 2024, 85 min, World premiere A family of five lives together in an old village house. While the parents are slowly aging, the children are growing up, and it is clear that they will soon go their own way. This unchanging rhythm of everyday life is disrupted by the unexpected news of the mother’s pregnancy, and the idea of a new sibling gradually affects all members of the household. is an understated, intimate portrait of family togetherness, which is often expressed in the smallest of ways. An unassuming yet highly original story, filmed with the same tenderness and patience with which nature awakens every spring. Director: Subhadra Mahajan India, 2024, 104 min, World premiere Desolate after experiencing a traumatic incident, Mia travels to the family’s summer retreat amid the snow-covered Himalayas in order to regain her strength. There she finds the company of the caretaker’s mother-in-law, Bimal, and her grandson, Sunny. Irrespective of their differing ages, social background and their ideas of happiness, a surprisingly strong bond develops between them, which cannot be broken, not even by the arrival of someone who drives Mia straight back into her trauma. This visually mesmerising film offers an authentic and vivid depiction of the process of coping with female pain and demonstrates that a second chance might emerge where we least expect it. Director: Victoria Verseau Sweden, France, 2024, 72 min, World premiere “ .” This is how Victoria Verseau introduces her intimate documentary diary, in which she returns to Thailand and to the year 2012, when she underwent her transition. She had long awaited this moment, but then came feelings of uncertainty, amplified by the death of a close friend. The conceptual artist adopts an almost archaeological approach to the past and lays bare the process of writing a personal story that is intrinsically linked to the creation of her own identity. In this deeply felt debut she reveals the joyful aspects and also the dark recesses of transition and, bringing other testimonies into play as well, she critically examines what defines women as women. Director: Omer Tobi Israel, Canada, 2024, 82 min, World premiere A lonely middle-aged woman lives her monotonous life. Every morning, she goes to her job as a supermarket cashier, and every day after work she goes straight home to look after her ailing mother and the rest of the family. Nobody, however, seems to care. Then, the mysterious murder of her boss sets off a chain of events at the end of which she can be free and find her own worth. How to describe her journey? Perhaps best as a sexual odyssey, an exploratory expedition to places where an important role is played by carnality, desire, and its gratification. is a subtly enigmatic reflection on conservatism, prudery, and the false ideal of physical beauty. / Director: Paolo Tizón Peru, Spain, Mexico, 2024, 96 min, World premiere A group of young adventurers sign up for one of the most challenging military training courses in Latin America, which will turn them into fearsome warriors entrusted with overseeing the dangerous VRAEM region, an area filled with coca plants, terrorists, and smugglers. In his absorbing look at the hermetically sealed world of the army, debut director Paolo Tizon paints a portrait of one institution while depicting individual human stories and reflecting on male identity, the potential for self-determination, and a fragile masculinity that stands in striking contrast to the brutal training. Sensitivity alongside violence, beauty alongside vulnerability. / Director: Jan Zajíček Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, 2024, 126 min, World premiere Vladimír 518, uncompromising rapper, artist, stage designer and activist, is a rare phenomenon, who not only writes books, but publishes them as well. Today also a respected authority primarily on pre-1989 architecture, he has written not only a major publication on the subject, but also the story for two audiovisual works treating the same theme, which were shot by Jan Zajíček, renowned director of music videos. In addition to the recent TV series we have the eagerly anticipated feature film which, through its fascinating and impressive exploration of Czech and Slovak architecture of the latter half of the 20th century, offers exclusive insight into extraordinary buildings and unique individuals living below the Tatra Mountains. Director: Alireza Ghasemi, Raha Amirfazli Iran, France, Netherlands, 2024, 95 min, European premiere The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to a massive flight of Afghans to neighboring Iran, which – since they hoped to find a new home there – they called the “Land of Brothers.” But the dream of fraternal coexistence soon faded, Iranian law never accepted them as equal citizens, and so even the descendants of the first refugees still carry the burden of otherness. Alireza Ghasemi and Raha Amirfazli’s wistful, beautifully shot feature debut about a family who will never feel at home in the country where they live won over audiences immediately upon its premiere at Sundance. / Director: Klára Tasovská Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Austria, 2024, 90 min This year’s notional award for excellence on the domestic film front should unquestionably go to the unique documentary on the internationally renowned photographic legend Libuše Jarcovjáková, a work which enchanted just about everyone at the 2024 Berlinale. This remarkable project by Klára Tasovská and her team looks back over the past fifty years at the life of a true icon, known as the Czech Nan Goldin, and this via a fascinating montage of several thousand of her photographs and her diary entries, which she reads out herself. Portraits, self-portraits, immortalised moments, the quest for truth lying deep within nameless fellow opponents of grim Normalisation, reflections of the transformation of body and soul, black-and-white images, emotion and life in flashes of brilliant light. / Director: Vadim Jendreyko Switzerland, 2024, 136 min, International premiere What is Europe? In his highly topical personal essay, Vadim Jendreyko travels across the old continent to discover its essence in places that might be called acupuncture points of European identity. His various stops include the bottom of the Rhine, Greek docks, the European Parliament, a primeval forest in Poland, and a Sarajevo library. All of these places invite ambivalent reflections: on the one hand, they celebrate Europe’s diversity and the breadth of its cultural heritage; on the other hand, they are symbols of turbulence, conflict, and bloody history. Is Europe condemned to be stuck in a vicious circle of violence, or is there hope in those who try to sing the songs of others? Director: Oleh Sentsov Ukraine, Croatia, 2024, 90 min, World premiere Acclaimed filmmaker, activist, Sakharov Prize-winning former Kremlin prisoner, and soldier Oleh Sentsov is currently defending his homeland as a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, which he joined in the first days of the Russian invasion in February 2022. During one assault, his infantry fighting vehicle was destroyed by enemy artillery. His attempts to organize the evacuation of part of his unit were complicated by the lack of ammunition and incessant Russian fire. The name of the operation was Real, and Sentsov’s eponymous film is a unique immersive experience that offers a hyper-documentary insight into the reality of the war through the eyes of one direct participant. / Director: Marie-Magdalena Kochová Czech Republic, 2024, 85 min, World premiere In her feature-length debut, Marie-​Mag­da­le­na Kochová uses the character of eighteen-year-old Johanna to explore the phenomenon of “glass children” – children who, because they have a special-needs sibling, are neglected by their family, however unintentionally. They often feel invisible, their problems are always considered less important, and they are often expected to help take care of their disabled brother or sister. Johana is about to graduate from high school, and so she must decide whether to leave home to study, or stay and help her parents. An immensely sensitive account of the nature of sibling love which, for once, puts “the other one” first. Director: Marek Najbrt Czech Republic, 2024, 94 min, World premiere “Foot Soldiers”, “Attention aux hommes”, “Dancer”, “Repetition”... These are just some of the string of hits by Prague band Tata Bojs. Always energetic, capable of myriad transformations, precise in their conceptual approach to the visual and musical interpretation of individual albums and concerts. It’s no surprise that Marek Najbrt ( ) decided not to go for the conventional documentary. He tells the band’s story as a playful collage, pieced together from a wealth of archive material and recordings of concerts and futuristic stage performances with the Vosto5 theatre company. Thus, unfolding before our very eyes is a portrait of a highly original band which, despite the alternative nature of its output, has earned its rightful place among the country’s top players. / Director: Jiří Mádl Czech Republic, 2024, 131 min, World premiere One might think that Czech and Slovak filmmakers have already said all there is to say about the period around 1968 in Czechoslovak history. As Jiří Mádl’s latest outing shows, however, this crucial era in our modern history still has forgotten stories to offer that are worthy of our attention. The film revolves around the international news office at Czechoslovak Radio, a place full of talented individuals possessing broad insight, linguistic skills, and above all a commitment to honest journalistic work with a focus on the truth. An epic, dynamically shot, rewarding film, which embraces uncommon heroism in the face of an oppressive regime, the strength of fraternal ties, and the eternal themes of love, betrayal, morality, and hope. / Director: Antonin Peretjatko France, 2024, 62 min, International premiere Within the first month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than 12.5 million people were forced to flee their homes and 5 million fled the country altogether. Documentary filmmaker Antonin Peretjatko returns to Lviv with Andrei, who has left with his family for France, to retrieve Andrei’s personal belongings and to explore his own roots, but most importantly to record eyewitness testimony from people who have remained in Ukraine. Part reportage documentary and part poetic road movie with an aesthetic style reminiscent of the early French New Wave, tries to share with the viewer what everyday life looks like in a war-torn country. / Director: Jiří Havelka Czech Republic, 2023, 104 min, World premiere A true story of injustice perpetrated on a peaceful gardener by a wealthy neighbor meets Karel Čapek’s eponymous literary work about a gardener’s hardships and successes over the course of a year. Director Jiří Havelka, one of the most complex artistic personalities of our time, has long proved that “alternative” and “audience-friendly” need not be mutually exclusive. His quietly moving tragicomic story about a remarkably stubborn struggle for the right to a dignified life is built on two great performances by the always outstanding Oldřich Kaiser and Dáša Vokata.

        "content": "The 32-strong official selection of the 58th edition of Karlovy Vary Film Festival , Central and Eastern Europe’s leading cinema fete, will feature 15 directorial debuts as well as the latest works of established filmmakers such as Mark Cousins , Oleh Sentsov , Noaz Deshe, Antonin Peretjatko, Beata Parkanova and Burak Cevik. Karel Och, artistic director of Karlovy Vary, said Tuesday that he’d identified a number of themes and genre in the selection, which included “a freshly revisionist take on the esthetical canons of a period film; a balanced, caring but also provocative look on the fate of a woman in the contemporary society in any moment of her life; and the immediate influence of political events on the life of an individual human being anywhere in the world.” The festival, which runs June 28-July 6 in the Czech Republic, has also revealed the juries of the Crystal Globe and Proxima competitions. The members of the Crystal Globe jury are producer Christine Vachon, actor Geoffrey Rush, director Gábor Reisz, poet and novelist Sjón, and actor Eliška Křenková. The films in the Proxima Competition will be judged by filmmaker Mohamed Kordofani, producer Bianca Balbuena, Daniela Michel, the founding director of the Morelia Film Festival, Wouter Jansen, the founder of the sales company Square Eyes, and Adéla Komrzý, a filmmaker. (Film descriptions, below, supplied by the festival.) Crystal Globe Competition “Ai ni ranbou” (Rude to Love) Director: Yukihiro Morigaki Japan, world premiere An unsettling drama about a marriage that is steadily losing its spark. Momoko (Noriko Eguchi) leads a respectable life as a housewife. She dresses elegantly and ensures that the apartment looks just right, down to the last detail; she attends to her husband assiduously and goes to great lengths to cook him proper Japanese food. Are these expressions of love, or rather paranoia from the emotional chasm that has opened out between them? And when does devoted care become an obsession? A psychologically precise case history of a spent relationship, in which long suppressed pain has risen to the surface. A film that examines the dark corners of human frustration and hysteria, where the desire to create something good develops into the urge to destroy. “Banzo” Director: Margarida Cardoso Portugal, France, Netherlands, international premiere In 1907, Alonso arrives on Prince’s Island, where he has been tasked with treating a group of workers plagued by a mysterious affliction called banzo, also known as slave nostalgia. Those affected feel an intense homesickness, fall into apathy, lose the strength to live, and eventually die. Alonso slowly discovers that it is not enough to treat the physical symptoms; he must understand the soul of those who have been uprooted. The oppressive atmosphere of the isolated tropical island forms the backdrop for a story from the dark colonial past in which humanity is put to the ultimate test. “Banzo” is also a reminder that there is more than one way to interpret the past, and that behind every story is a person telling the story. “Cì xīn qiè gŭ” (Pierce) Director: Nelicia Low Singapore, Taiwan, Poland, world premiere After Han is released from juvenile prison, where he served seven years for killing an opponent in a fencing match, he meets his younger brother and insists on his innocence. Jie believes him, and the torn brotherly bond begins to heal. Behind their mother’s back, Han helps Jie perfect his fencing skills so that he can qualify for the national championships. But the initially energetic clinking of sabres is slowly drowned out by silent doubts: Is Han really innocent? Low’s gripping atmospheric thriller offers a nerve-wracking duel between the ideals of brotherly love and the illusions that we project onto those close to us. “Drie dagen vis” (Three Days of Fish) Director: Peter Hoogendoorn Netherlands, Belgium, world premiere Just as he does every year, dad flies from sunny Portugal for a three-day visit to the Netherlands, the drab country of his birth. He has his usual errands to run, and he visits his doctor for his annual check-up, accompanied by his eccentric grown-up son... This intimate film offers a glimpse into the relationship between two men who have grown apart yet, as they engage in seemingly mundane activities, little by little they try to find their way back to one another. “Three Days of Fish,” the second outing by Dutch filmmaker Hoogendoorn, is a gentle drama, interlaced with the dry humor typical for the region. The director’s feature debut “Between 10 and 12” premiered at Venice. “Elskling” (Loveable) Director: Lilja Ingolfsdottir Norway, world premiere While Sigmund is always away on business, Maria juggles her career with childcare and managing the home. Like many other relationships, theirs was also all about love and harmony in the early stages, however, after years of married life, the cracks started to appear. Sigmund is ultimately the one to ask for a divorce, and Maria is forced to confront her greatest fears. While ostensibly a divorce drama, this debut by Ingolfsdottir nevertheless takes us further, delivering a multilayered character study of a woman experiencing a crisis that leads her to self-knowledge. “Loveable” isn’t a story about the quest for true love; on the contrary, it takes a fresh approach to examine contemporary ideas of romance, equality within the relationship, and the power of womanhood. “Ema a smrtihlav” (The Hungarian Dressmaker) Director: Iveta Grófová Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, world premiere It’s the 1940s. The Slovak state witnesses the rise of nationalism and it’s not an auspicious time for minorities. The turbulent social mood also impacts the widow Marika, who loses her job in an Aryanised dressmaker’s shop. Given the increasing anti-Hungarian sentiment she shuts herself away, particularly since she is harboring a little Jewish boy. Despite this she still finds herself singled out by two men: a German Nazi officer and a captain of Slovakia’s Hlinka Guard. This drama by Slovak director Grófová is an adaptation of the novella of the same name by Peter Krištúfek, which conjures up the dramatic atmosphere of wartime Slovakia. The story of a fragmented era, which forces the protagonists to confront complex dilemmas, is told not only through words, but also by way of a powerful visual language. “Mord” (Our Lovely Pig Slaughter) Director: Adam Martinec Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, world premiere The pig-killing fest on an old farm is a tradition Karel looks forward to every year. It’s the only chance for the whole family to get together, have a good time, engage in a squabble or two, and enjoy some great food. But this time things are different. The butcher hides the fact his cartridges are damp, grandpa can’t bring himself to tell Karel, recently widowed, that this slaughter will be their last, daughter Lucie is depressed after her marital breakup, and grandson Dušík runs away while his parents argue over whether he’s old enough to watch the kill. As for Karel, the pig’s blood spilling everywhere is the last straw... Martinec’s feature debut is a remarkably incisive study of the Czech temperament which, through its visceral character portrayal and searing humor, evokes the masterworks of the Czechoslovak New Wave. “Panoptikoni” (Panopticon) Director: George Sikharulidze Georgia, France, Italy, Romania, world premiere When Sandro’s father decides to devote his life to God and leaves for a monastery, the teenage introvert finds himself deprived of the fundamental certainties of life. Abandoned by his father and his mother, who is working abroad, the young man embarks on a journey of self-discovery, opening up both to a new friendship with the radical Lasha, who has ties with an ultra-right organization, and also to the chance to explore his own sexuality. Sikharulidze’s perceptive feature debut considers how fine the line is between the observer and the observed, and asks where contemporary post-Soviet Georgian society is heading as it hovers on the border between religious conservatism and nationalisation on the one hand, and the desire for independence and modernization on the other. “Proslava” (Celebration) Director: Bruno Anković Croatia, Qatar, world premiere Bruno Anković’s feature film debut is set in an impoverished Croatian village between the years 1926 and 1945. The constant deprivation, repeated changes to the regime, and war pervaded the forests and shrouded the place in a miasma that obscured all visions of a better future. Village life was also tough for Mijo: His young, innocent soul was burdened by the outside world and troubled by inhumane orders, and he then fell prey to the false sheen of right-wing ideology. This film adaptation of the successful novel of the same name by Damir Karakaš presents us with wonderful shots of the rural landscape, but it is also a testimony of commonplace brutality and demonstrates the reasons why innocent people become easy quarry for ideological crusaders. “A Sudden Glimpse to Deeper Things” Director: Mark Cousins U.K. world premiere One of the most important women in British modern art, the painter Wilhelmina Barns-Graham was a highly inspirational figure, whose work was deeply impacted by a pivotal event in her life. In May 1949, this leading representative of the modernist St. Ives group of artists climbed to the top of the Grindelwald glacier in Switzerland, an experience which was to transform the way she saw the world. She spent the rest of her life capturing its shapes and colors, indeed its very essence. In his essayistic portrait Cousins delves into complex themes of gender, climate change and creativity, while laying bare the artist’s character and vast imagination so pervasively that he creates the impression we are seeing the world through her eyes. “Světýlka” (Tiny Lights) Director: Beata Parkanová Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, world premiere Amálka is six years old. She loves her cat, her parents, and her gran and grandpa. It’s summertime and all the little girl could wish for is for the day to turn out just as it should. Except that things are different. Her parents have shut themselves in a room and she can hear raised voices through the door, which isn’t normal. Something’s going on and Amálka has no idea what it is. In a superbly creative direction from Parkanová, “Tiny Lights” follows a family break-up as perceived by a child: Through the keyhole, ear pressed to the door, everything seen at adult waist height. Each day has to end, and this one has brought Amálka to the point of no return. She feels the hurt as she drifts off to sleep, but she has also grown up a little. “Xoftex” Director: Noaz Deshe Germany, France, world premiere Xoftex is a Greek refugee camp, where Syrian and Palestinian asylum seekers anxiously wait for news of their refugee status. To pass the time between interviews with the immigration office, Nasser and his friends film satirical sketches and make preparations for a zombie horror flick. Except that the reality of the camp could be taken for a horror scenario itself. The tension between its inhabitants gains momentum and every conflict removes one more brick from the wall which divides reality from dream – or, indeed, nightmare. Fragments of real life, humor, and the unimaginable suffering of people risking their lives to escape their own country, merge into an explosive, at times, surreal spectacle which invites the viewers to immerse themselves in the story and the lives of immigrants in a way they will never have experienced before. Proxima Competition “Bezvetrije” (Windless) Director: Pavel G. Vesnakov Bulgaria, Italy, world premiere After years away Kaloyan returns to his native Bulgaria in order to sell his late father’s flat. What at first seems like a routine task devoid of emotion gradually develops into a journey to the depths of his being, where he is confronted with distant traumas, yet he also strikes a new path toward self-discovery. While childhood is filled with sensations and the rustling wind, adulthood is a state of fragile windless and fading memories of those closest to us. Vesnakov delivers colorful existential reflections on the nature of family bonds and personal identity over the course of time. Yet he also muses on modern-day Bulgaria, where the cemeteries of its original inhabitants are being replaced by shady casinos, and where cultural memory is waning in a country deceived by an illusory vision of economic prosperity. “Cabo Negro” Director: Abdellah Taïa France, Morocco, world premiere Two young people, Soundouss and Jaâfar, arrive at a luxury villa in the resort of Cabo Negro rented by Jaâfar’s lover, who is supposed to join them later. But something is wrong – he still hasn’t turned up, and they can’t reach him on his phone. Left on their own, they decide, despite their uncertain financial and personal situation, to enjoy their holiday as much as their minds and bodies will allow. On vacation, with time seemingly non-existent, they take the opportunity to reflect on their relationships back home – and on the future, which feels so distant here on the sun-drenched beach. Taïa presents a queer ode to the seemingly carefree time of youth. “Clorofilla” (Chlorophyll) Director: Ivana Gloria Italy, international premiere Green-haired Maia is tired of city life and, driven by a desire to be among nature, she decides to spend the summer picking oranges. In the orchards she is greeted by the gardener, an eccentric loner called Teo, who notices that Maia isn’t like everyone else. In the same way he tends his plants, he devotes his time and energy to her, too, and the young woman starts to blossom. Their burgeoning friendship, however, is unsettled by the arrival of Teo’s father and older brother Arturo, who are planning a celebration in a neighboring village... In her richly colored story, which shows it’s sometimes difficult to find someone who could help us to discover our true selves, Gloria awakens within us senses that we didn’t even know we had. “Fără suflet” (The Alienated) Director: Anja Kreis Germany, Moldova, France, world premiere Varvara, a professor of philosophy, is discussing the concept of God’s death with her students. She is visited by her sister Angelina, an eminent gynaecologist who has been recalled from Moscow and sent to another city, where she is to reduce the number of abortions. Not long afterwards a girl comes to see her at the hospital, asking her to perform an abortion, claiming that she is carrying the Antichrist in her womb. After a heated dispute with a student, Varvara ponders the presence of evil in human nature, while Angelina carries out an illegal abortion on the girl and takes the embryo home with her... This mystical film is beguiling for its ominous atmosphere and raises uncomfortable questions about human conscience, morality and faith, although it declines to provide definitive answers. “Hiçbir şey yerinde değil” (Nothing in its Place) Director: Burak Çevik Turkey, Germany, South Korea, international premiere One evening, one apartment, five leftist students, and one vision of a non-violent socialist revolution. When this gathering is interrupted by the unannounced visit of two members of a right-wing movement, things quickly spiral out of control. Turkish director Çevik uses long takes and an enclosed space as a canvas onto which his ensemble cast’s strong performances paint a story reflecting the turbulent political situation in 1978 Ankara. How far are people willing to go for their political beliefs, and how much can the ideology of a group influence the behavior of an individual? “Nothing in its Place” holds up a mirror to more than one revolution. “Ju wai ren” (Stranger) Director: Zhengfan Yang U.S., China, Netherlands, Norway, France, world premiere The hotel room as a place where everybody is a stranger. A place that is yours for just a moment. A temporarily intimate space entered by a maid in order to clean it while, if possible, not leaving a single trace of her visit. Each part of the episodic “Stranger” is set in just such a place. One episode equals one shot. One shot equals one story. What they have in common is China, the home country of both guests and staff, although each of their lives differs from the others. The film’s absurd, darkly humorous, poignant and mysterious stories are set in a seemingly confined space that nevertheless opens up new and surprising dimensions with each episode. “Lapilli” Director: Paula Ďurinová Slovak Republic, Germany, world premiere In her feature debut, Ďurinová sets out to wander among varied rock formations in order to try and come to terms with the loss of her grandparents. Different stages of grief unfold among the sea currents, the dark caves and the volcanic wasteland, while the strings of an autoharp resonate in the ravines. Lapilli finds a balance between the personal and the environmental in a modernistic requiem full of perceptive observations on natural phenomena and on man himself. This is a work that excels in its inner strength and rare film language, where sea waves reflect shifting thoughts, and where the erosion of arid soil is reminiscent of a broken heart filled with memories of people who are lost to us forever. “Od marca do mája” (March to May) Director: Martin Pavol Repka Czech Republic, world premiere A family of five lives together in an old village house. While the parents are slowly aging, the children are growing up, and it is clear that they will soon go their own way. This unchanging rhythm of everyday life is disrupted by the unexpected news of the mother’s pregnancy, and the idea of a new sibling gradually affects all members of the household. “March to May” is an understated, intimate portrait of family togetherness, which is often expressed in the smallest of ways. An unassuming yet highly original story, filmed with the same tenderness and patience with which nature awakens every spring. “Second Chance” Director: Subhadra Mahajan India, world premiere Desolate after experiencing a traumatic incident, Mia travels to the family’s summer retreat amid the snow-covered Himalayas in order to regain her strength. There she finds the company of the caretaker’s mother-in-law, Bimal, and her grandson, Sunny. Irrespective of their differing ages, social background and their ideas of happiness, a surprisingly strong bond develops between them, which cannot be broken, not even by the arrival of someone who drives Mia straight back into her trauma. This visually mesmerizing film offers an authentic and vivid depiction of the process of coping with female pain and demonstrates that a second chance might emerge where we least expect it. “Trans Memoria” Director: Victoria Verseau Sweden, France, world premiere “I collect. I document. I write down my memories. I’m afraid they’ll disappear.” This is how Verseau introduces her intimate documentary diary, in which she returns to Thailand and to the year 2012, when she underwent her transition. She had long awaited this moment, but then came feelings of uncertainty, amplified by the death of a close friend. The conceptual artist adopts an almost archaeological approach to the past and lays bare the process of writing a personal story that is intrinsically linked to the creation of her own identity. In this deeply felt debut she reveals the joyful aspects and also the dark recesses of transition and, bringing other testimonies into play as well, she critically examines what defines women as women. “Tropicana” Director: Omer Tobi Israel, Canada, world premiere A lonely middle-aged woman lives her monotonous life. Every morning, she goes to her job as a supermarket cashier, and every day after work she goes straight home to look after her ailing mother and the rest of the family. Nobody, however, seems to care. Then, the mysterious murder of her boss sets off a chain of events at the end of which she can be free and find her own worth. How to describe her journey? Perhaps best as a sexual odyssey, an exploratory expedition to places where an important role is played by carnality, desire, and its gratification. “Tropicana” is a subtly enigmatic reflection on conservatism, prudery, and the false ideal of physical beauty. “Vino la noche” (Night Has Come) Director: Paolo Tizón Peru, Spain, Mexico, world premiere A group of young adventurers sign up for one of the most challenging military training courses in Latin America, which will turn them into fearsome warriors entrusted with overseeing the dangerous VRAEM region, an area filled with coca plants, terrorists and smugglers. In his absorbing look at the hermetically sealed world of the army, debut director Tizon paints a portrait of one institution while depicting individual human stories and reflecting on male identity, the potential for self-determination, and a fragile masculinity that stands in striking contrast to the brutal training. Sensitivity alongside violence, beauty alongside vulnerability. Special Screenings “Architektura ČSSR 58–89” (Czechoslovak Architecture 58–89) Director: Jan Zajíček Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, world premiere Vladimír 518, uncompromising rapper, artist, stage designer and activist, is a rare phenomenon, who not only writes books, but publishes them as well. Today also a respected authority primarily on pre-1989 architecture, he has written not only a major publication on the subject, but also the story for two audiovisual works treating the same theme, which were shot by Jan Zajíček, renowned director of music videos. In addition to the recent TV series we have the eagerly anticipated feature film which, through its fascinating and impressive exploration of Czech and Slovak architecture of the latter half of the 20th century, offers exclusive insight into extraordinary buildings and unique individuals living below the Tatra Mountains. “In the Land of Brothers” Director: Alireza Ghasemi, Raha Amirfazli Iran, France, Netherlands, European premiere The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to a massive flight of Afghans to neighboring Iran, which – since they hoped to find a new home there – they called the “Land of Brothers.” But the dream of fraternal coexistence soon faded, Iranian law never accepted them as equal citizens, and so even the descendants of the first refugees still carry the burden of otherness. Ghasemi and Amirfazli’s wistful, beautifully shot feature debut about a family who will never feel at home in the country where they live won over audiences immediately on its premiere at Sundance. “Ještě nejsem, kým chci být” (I’m Not Everything I Want to Be) Director: Klára Tasovská Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Austria This year’s notional award for excellence on the domestic film front should go to this documentary on the internationally renowned photographer Libuše Jarcovjáková, a work which enchanted many at the Berlinale. This project looks back over the past 50 years at the life of a true icon, known as the Czech Nan Goldin, and this via a montage of several thousand of her photographs and her diary entries, which she reads out herself. Portraits, self-portraits, immortalized moments, the quest for truth lying deep within nameless fellow opponents of grim Normalisation, reflections of the transformation of body and soul, black-and-white images, emotion and life in flashes of brilliant light. “Das Lied der Anderen – Eine Suche nach Europa” (The Song of Others – A Search for Europe) Director: Vadim Jendreyko Switzerland, international premiere What is Europe? In his topical personal essay, Jendreyko travels across the old continent to discover its essence in places that might be called acupuncture points of European identity. His various stops include the bottom of the Rhine, Greek docks, the European Parliament, a primeval forest in Poland, and a Sarajevo library. All of these places invite ambivalent reflections: on the one hand, they celebrate Europe’s diversity and the breadth of its cultural heritage; on the other hand, they are symbols of turbulence, conflict and bloody history. Is Europe condemned to be stuck in a vicious circle of violence, or is there hope in those who try to sing the songs of others? “Real” Director: Oleh Sentsov Ukraine, Croatia, world premiere Acclaimed filmmaker, activist, Sakharov Prize-winning former Kremlin prisoner, and soldier Sentsov is currently defending his homeland as a lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, which he joined in the first days of the Russian invasion in February 2022. During one assault, his infantry fighting vehicle was destroyed by enemy artillery. His attempts to organize the evacuation of part of his unit were complicated by the lack of ammunition and incessant Russian fire. The name of the operation was Real, and Sentsov’s eponymous film is an immersive experience that offers a hyper-documentary insight into the reality of the war through the eyes of one direct participant. “Ta druhá” (The Other One) Director: Marie-Magdalena Kochová Czech Republic, world premiere In her feature-length debut, Kochová uses the character of 18-year-old Johanna to explore the phenomenon of “glass children” – children who, because they have a special-needs sibling, are neglected by their family, however unintentionally. They often feel invisible, their problems are always considered less important, and they are often expected to help take care of their disabled brother or sister. Johana is about to graduate from high school, and so she must decide whether to leave home to study, or stay and help her parents. An immensely sensitive account of the nature of sibling love which, for once, puts “the other one” first. “Tatabojs.doc” Director: Marek Najbrt Czech Republic, world premiere “Foot Soldiers,” “Attention aux hommes,” “Dancer,” “Repetition”... These are just some of the string of hits by Prague band Tata Bojs. Always energetic, capable of myriad transformations, precise in their conceptual approach to the visual and musical interpretation of individual albums and concerts. It’s no surprise that Najbrt decided not to go for the conventional documentary. He tells the band’s story as a playful collage, pieced together from a wealth of archive material and recordings of concerts and futuristic stage performances with the Vosto5 theater company. Thus, unfolding before our very eyes is a portrait of a highly original band which, despite the alternative nature of its output, has earned its rightful place among the country’s top players. “Vlny” (Waves) Director: Jiří Mádl Czech Republic, world premiere One might think that Czech and Slovak filmmakers have already said all there is to say about the period around 1968 in Czechoslovak history. As Mádl’s latest outing shows, however, this crucial era in our modern history still has forgotten stories to offer that are worthy of our attention. The film revolves around the international news office at Czechoslovak Radio, a place full of talented individuals possessing broad insight, linguistic skills, and above all a commitment to honest journalistic work with a focus on the truth. An epic, dynamically shot, rewarding film, which embraces uncommon heroism in the face of an oppressive regime, the strength of fraternal ties, and the eternal themes of love, betrayal, morality, and hope. “Voyage au bord de la guerre” (Journey to the Brink of War) Director: Antonin Peretjatko France, international premiere Within the first month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than 12.5 million people were forced to flee their homes and 5 million fled the country altogether. Peretjatko returns to Lviv with Andrei, who has left with his family for France, to retrieve Andrei’s personal belongings and to explore his own roots, but most importantly to record eyewitness testimony from people who have remained in Ukraine. Part reportage documentary and part poetic road movie with an aesthetic style reminiscent of the early French New Wave, “Journey to the Brink of War” tries to share with the viewer what everyday life looks like in a war-torn country. “Zahradníkův rok” (The Gardener’s Year) Director: Jiří Havelka Czech Republic, world premiere A true story of injustice perpetrated on a peaceful gardener by a wealthy neighbor meets Karel Čapek’s eponymous literary work about a gardener’s hardships and successes over the course of a year. Havelka, one of the most complex artistic personalities of our time, has long proved that “alternative” and “audience-friendly” need not be mutually exclusive. His quietly moving tragicomic story about a remarkably stubborn struggle for the right to a dignified life is built on two great performances by the always outstanding Oldřich Kaiser and Dáša Vokata.",

        "description": "Call for significant state investment to kick-start the sector",
        "content": "Minister for the Environment, Eamon Ryan, today launched new reports from the Irish District Energy Association (IrDEA). The reports show that district energy is the most economically viable low carbon heating option for 64% of the Irish population. The reports also compare the rollout of the technology in six European countries, using this as the basis for recommendations on policies needed to deliver district energy to Irish consumers quickly and at scale. Recommendations include consumer protection measures, and rules on planning and licensing, among others. District energy networks distribute water, which has been heated at a local energy centre, to buildings through a network of insulated underground pipes eliminating the need for fossil fuels and individual boilers. The benefits include improved energy security, efficiency savings, affordability, better air quality and employment opportunities. According to IrDEA, the reports make the case for significant state investment to kick-start the sector, which has been tasked with delivering enough heat for 200,000 homes and 2,500 public buildings by 2030, which equates to 10% of building heat demand. Though well proven in other countries, district energy is not yet common in Ireland. Less than 1% of building heat demand is currently met this way, most commonly through communal schemes. According to the reports launched by Minister Ryan today, this is the most economical way of meeting the heat demand of 67% of buildings across Ireland. Speaking at the launch, Minister Eamon Ryan said, “The government is committed to accelerating building heat decarbonisation. District energy is a proven technology, with millions of customers across Europe and beyond, and it can play a key role in improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions in Ireland. That is why we have committed to clear Climate Action Plan targets to deliver up to 2.7 terawatt hours (TWh) of district energy capacity by 2030. I am encouraged to note that this research from IrDEA aligns with the broader policy direction for district heating and I welcome the support of the industry for the Government’s decarbonisation programme.” Irish District Energy Association CEO, Yvonne Murphy said, “Around 70% of heat demand in countries like Denmark and Sweden is met with district energy right now; Europe-wide, 30 million households and 70 million people rely on district energy. It is a well proven technology that is available right now for deployment in Ireland. There has been a growing commitment by government to using district energy as a key part of its heat dearbonisation strategy, which has been incredibly encouraging for the sector. But we need solid action now to get moving in time to reach our 2030 targets. \"IrDEA is launching this research to set out a roadmap for delivering district energy to the almost two thirds of Ireland’s population for whom it would be the most affordable low-carbon heating option. Our key ask today is upfront investment of €1billion in state subsidies to help make that happen.” David Connolly, Chairperson, and founder of IrDEA added, “Two decades ago, widespread generation of wind-powered electricity seemed far-fetched to many. Now, after a concerted effort, it’s a natural part of our energy supply chain. The same can happen with district heating. The system can use any source of energy including renewable electricity or surplus heat from industry or cooling processes, which is a real game changer as we reduce our reliance on imported oil and gas. “The key barrier we face as a sector now is the lack of a mechanism to draw down government funding to help finance the rollout of projects. We’re optimistic that if the financing barrier is addressed quickly, we could start to see projects materialise in the next 12 to 24 months. According to our research, an investment of around €1billion in the next couple of years could unlock the potential of the sector to deliver affordable, low-carbon heat to consumers across Ireland.” The Irish District Energy Association is a trade organisation that supports and promotes the growth of the district heating and cooling sector in Ireland. The not-for-profit company has members from across the public, private and academic sectors. For more information about district energy and to read the roadmap visit www.district energy.ie/policy",

        "content": "Hurricane season begins Saturday and runs through Nov. 30. Here are some facts and information about the 2024 hurricane season and hurricanes in general. Weather forecasters are predicting that this will be a busier than usual year for hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting that there will be 17 to 25 named storms with winds of 39 mph or higher, 8-13 hurricanes with winds of 39 mph or higher, and 4-7 major hurricanes category 3, 4 or 5, with winds of 111 mph or higher. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1-5 rating system based on the sustained winds of the hurricane. Categories 3, 4, and 5 are classified as major hurricanes. People are also reading... Categories 4 and 5 can cause major destruction, leaving damaged areas uninhabitable for weeks or months, according to NOAA. Hurricanes are named to cut down on confusion. For example, there can be a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and another one in the Atlantic. Having names for the hurricanes makes it easier to keep up with the storms, according to the National Hurricane Center. Here are the names of the 2024 hurricanes: Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Francine, Gordon, Helene, Isaac, Joyce, Kirk, Leslie, Milton, Nadine, Oscar, Patty, Rafael, Sara, Tony, Valerie, and William. The World Meteorological Organization maintains the name lists. There are six lists that are rotated. The 2023 list will repeat in 2029. “The only time that there is a change in the list is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name for a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity,” according to NOAA. If a name is removed from the list, then at a meeting of the WMO a replacement name is chosen. The most recently retired names are Fiona and Ian from the 2022 list. Fiona has been replaced by Farrah, and Ian has been replaced by Idris for the 2028 list. Hurricanes start out as tropical waves. If they strengthen to sustained winds of at least 38 mph, they become tropical depressions. As the storm continues to strengthen, when it has sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph, it becomes a tropical storm. That’s when it gets its name. Before that, it has been a number. When sustained winds are 75 mph or higher, the storm is a hurricane. Toronto residents Bob Givehchi, right, and his son Daniel, 8, visiting Miami for the first time, walk past debris and palm trees blowing in gusty winds Dec. 15 at Matheson Hammock Park in Coral Gables, Fla. Eastbound traffic on Fourth Street between Spring and Poplar streets in downtown Winston-Salem will be shifted to the center turn lane between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Tuesday. The shift will allow a contractor from Winston-Salem Forsyth County Utilities to make water system improvements. Motorists are encouraged to use alternate routes.

        "content": "The Triad has several more chefs competing in the online Favorite Chef Competition. In addition to those previously announced, Jon Berry and Sherrita Delacruz , other local chefs competing in Favorite Chef to win $25,000 include Christopher Brown, Justin Webster, Jordan Rainbolt and Victoria Manginas. Christopher Brown is a Winston-Salem native who has worked at such restaurants as Mozelle’s, Noble’s Grille, Mission Pizza and the Katharine Brasserie and Bar, as well as restaurants in Washington, D.C., and Dallas. He most recently co-founded the Casa Domenica supper club in Winston-Salem with baker Brittany McGee. People are also reading... Brown said in his online profile that he is now interested in starting a restaurant and would use his prize money to get that rolling. Jordan Rainbolt is the chef/owner of the popular Native Root , which does pop-dinners in Winston-Salem. Rainbolt espouses a \"global meets local\" approach to her cooking, paying homage to her Native American roots as well as respect for the history of agriculture and food here in the South. Rainbolt also is hoping to start a restaurant and would use the prize money to help with that. Victoria Manginas began running Zito Pizzeria + Grill on Healy Drive in her early 20s after her father passed away after being hit by a car about five years ago. Now Manginas is hoping to open her own Greek restaurant. Justin Webster already has a restaurant. He opened Heff's Burger Club in downtown Winston-Salem in 2022, offering creative riffs on classic burgers. In 2023, his creative approach got Heff's named as a semifinalist for a James Beard award in the Best New Restaurant category. Webster said in his profile that he would use the Favorite Chef prize money to boost his restaurant's profile, give bonuses to staff and update restaurant equipment. Favorite Chef, presented by celebrity chef and Food Network host Carla Hall, is an online competition that features multiple rounds of online voting by the public. The first round of voting ends May 30. Those who survive the first round advance to the second round of voting, which goes from May 30 to June 6. Upon visiting favchef.com , visitors can view each chef’s profile page and cast one vote every 24 hours for free. Visitors to the site who choose to donate can vote more than once every 24 hours. Donations go to DTCare, which partners with the James Beard Foundation, whose mission is “to create a more equitable and sustainable future in the restaurant industry.” The rounds of voting gradually narrow the field to the Top 20, 15, 10 and 5, with a winner set to be announced Aug. 2. The People’s Choice Grand Prize winner will win $25,000, get on the cover of \"Taste of Home\" magazine, have a chance to cook with Hall, and more. In addition, Hall will choose a Carla’s Pick Prize winner.

        "content": "The construction unicorn has netted an additional funding round from Liquidity Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s MARS Unicorn Fund This takes the fund's investment in the company to $100 Mn The company plans to deploy the proceeds to bolster its expansion plans to newer global markets, along with increasing its presence across product verticals Construction unicorn Infra.Market has raised $50 Mn (INR 390 Cr) in an additional funding round from Liquidity Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s MARS Unicorn Fund. This takes the fund’s investment in the company to $100 Mn , adding on to the $50 Mn it poured into the company back in June 2022. The company plans to deploy the proceeds to bolster its expansion plans to newer global markets, along with increasing its presence across product verticals. As of now, the company claims to export its products to Dubai, Singapore, Italy and more. “We are seeing growth opportunities as we are rapidly expanding our product portfolio and market presence, and the launch of new verticals will help us seed newer markets and create a best in class construction materials company out of India,” said Infra.Market’s founder Souvik Sengupta. The development comes about three months after Inc42 reported that the company is eyeing to raise a debt of $60 Mn in multiple tranches over the coming months. Besides, the company also secured a $12 Mn debt from SK Finance in January. Founded in 2016 by Sengupta and Aaditya Sharda, Infra.Market manufactures construction materials under its private-label brands. It has a B2B, retail and B2C network and leverages technology to digitise the procurement process. Infra.Market operates brands like IVAS, Shalimar Paints and RDC, through which it sells building material like concrete, AAC Blocks, steel, pipes and fittings, MDF, plywood, laminates, tiles, bath fittings and sanitary, among others. The company said that the funding comes amid an increased allocation for infrastructure projects under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP). Planned projects under the NIP are scheduled to surpass $2 Tn over the next few years. For financial year 2022-23 (FY23), the unicorn reported an operating revenue of INR 11,846.5 Cr, an increase of 90% from FY22’s INR 6,236.3 Cr. Despite the increase in operating revenue, the startup’s net profit declined 17% to INR 155.2 Cr from INR 185.9 Cr in the previous fiscal year as its depreciation and amortisation expenses rose over 5X to INR 178.7 Cr.",

        "description": "A woman was left furious with her husband after he'd gone 'AWOL' on a night out - she is now worried he isn't interested in being a 'family man' and wants to be 'single'",
        "content": "Communication is key in a relationship , and it's important that you're on the same page. One woman was left confused, however, when her husband refused to communicate with her when he was out with mates. She shared that they have two kids together, one four and one six months, so she was concerned about his \"zero contact\" style when he was out - from the afternoon until the early hours of the morning. The woman took to Mumsnet to explain she'd \" forgiven him for a lot over the years\", but he's gone \"AWOL\" a couple of times in the past few years when \"out with mates\". She asked people what they thought about the situation, giving further context to what he'd done. She penned: \"I woke up with the baby in the early hours and he wasn't home, so I sent a message asking where he was. No reply. Up with baby again about an hour and a half later, again no reply. Tried to call with the next wake up, didn't pick up. By this point it was about 5.30am - everything would have been closed. He went out in the afternoon. 'My work party turned out to be career-ending – it was a recipe for disaster' \"If he'd have responded 'in a bar/at friend's house, be home later' or just ANYTHING it would've been fine, but it was the ignoring that bothered me. He would've just not come home with zero contact if I hadn't pushed it. \"The next time I woke with baby (we're both ill with Covid and she’s exclusively breastfeeding, so I've done all night feeds for 6 months and am knackered/feeling s**t) I sent a message saying I was locking the front door. Miraculously he responded straight away. He claimed he had been trying to get home for 'hours' but his bank cards had been 'blocked'. \"I told him how upset/angry I was and that he should have just messaged me, etc. etc., and he told me I was 'locking him out of his home' and that 'this is your decision, not mine' - as if I'm ending the relationship. Feels like he's trying to push me to leave.\" The woman told him she was \"upset\", calling him \"irresponsible\" because he's 36 - and his cruel five-word response was \"cry me a f**king river\", leaving her floored. She was wondering \"if his story is true\", why would he have ghosted her. \"Also, he could’ve gone home with friends who live in the same direction or asked one of them to book him an Uber and pay them back,\" she fumed. \"Also thinking if it's true, he's blown an awful lot of money...Why else would his cards stop working other than the accounts being emptied?\" She said he hadn't \"made an appearance\" and she'd had to lie to her eldest child saying he was \"having a sleepover with his friend\". When she spoke to her friend, they said \"it comes across like he just doesn't care\" about her, or \"being a family man\". The woman is now worried he wants the \"single lifestyle over his family\". She said her husband is treating her \"worse and worse\", and it's \"heightened\" since she went on maternity leave. \"I wouldn't mind as much if this was a one-off, but he's got form for irresponsible partying-type behaviour and, like I said, has pulled disappearing acts before. But then part of me thinks maybe I am just going crazy and being harsh,\" she concluded. In the comments, people were left baffled about why she was still with him. One wrote: \"Get him out, because he’s vile, and enjoy your life.\" Another raged: \"Overreacting? Hardly. I very rarely say this but I would be thinking very carefully about this relationship. You say you've forgiven him a lot over the years. It sounds as if that has encouraged him to behave worse and worse rather than feel grateful for your forbearance. \"Also, I would be very suspicious that he’s not just drinking on these binges [...] In short, I'd be keeping that door locked a while and have a hard think.\" Someone else fumed: \"I'd go f**king mental. I just wouldn't tolerate this. I'd have his bags packed and on the doorstep awaiting his arrival.\" Do you have a story to share?

        "content": "I always say people in the casting department have the potential to do god’s work—especially when they cast men who cry so pretty . People are usually ugly criers (myself included, ngl), but some people are blessed with rosy cheeks, wet baby cow eyes, and a cute li’l red nose when the waterworks start. These people are a rare breed, but the men on this elite list are even fewer. Here are some of our favorite actors who just glow when they start bawling. The list is not at all comprehensive, so feel free to fight me on this if your fave isn’t on here—but know I’ll be (ugly) crying if you do. Steven Yeun in “Beef” When “Beef” came out, it was a big moment for the Asian-American community. It was also a big moment for people who love Steven Yeun . In one of the most iconic scenes from the show, Steven Yeun sheds silent tears during a praise and worship scene. It did things to me. Timothée Chalamet in “Call Me By Your Name” Many things have happened since the release of “Call Me By Your Name,” but the film has definitely left a lasting impact on many of us. The final scene in particular, where Elio cries in front of the fireplace, has been imprinted on many a mind. Park Bo-Gum in “Record of Youth” If a puppy ever turned into a person, it would be Park Bo-Gum. “Record of Youth” wasn’t the smash hit everyone expected it to be, but it still delivered one of the best clips of Park Bo-Gum crying. That in itself is enough. Dev Patel in “Lion” Dev Patel is one of the most gorgeous gorgeous men who have ever walked this earth—and you can quote me on this. So it only makes sense if he’s also one of the most gorgeous criers we’ve ever seen. Though he only sheds a few tears during this scene in “Lion,” it’s enough to warrant a spot on this list. Nam Joo-Hyuk in “Twenty-Five Twenty-One” “Twenty-Five Twenty-One” destroyed many a heart, including the hearts of its main characters. In the penultimate episode, we see a distraught Baek Yi-Jin (played by Nam Joo-Hyuk) crying his little heart out. I just wanted to give him a warm blanket, some tea, and a hug at this point. But man did he look good. Young Leonardo DiCaprio in “Romeo + Juliet” At the tender age of 18, a very young Leonardo DiCaprio starred as Romeo in Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo + Juliet.” In one of the most iconic scenes from the movie, he bawls “I defy you stars!” as he dramatically falls to his knees. I’m no longer a fan of the Leo now because he only dates people close to the age he was in when he was in the movie, but I can admit he really popped off with that one. Kim Soo-Hyun in literally everything Kim Soo-Hyun may have just wrapped “Queen of Tears,” but even without the drama, he’s the undisputed King of Tears. In whatever project he’s in, the face card never declines when the crying commences. He’s just cursed with a perfect face that even bawling cannot ruin.

        "content": "For pledging his life in service and bringing true and lasting meaning to his “Malasakit” advocacies, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go was honored with the Jinseo Arigato “Champion of Life Hero of the Year” award in Nagoya, Japan on Sunday, 26 May. The honor recognizes the impact of Go’s dedication to lift the quality of lives of Filipinos by initiating measures for more accessible health care, among others. He is also praised for his leadership in inspiring genuine concern for the poor among those in government. Senator Go, also known as “Mr. Malasakit” for his compassionate brand of public service, was full of humility in accepting the award. “Ako naman po, with or without an award, I am grateful and honored to always serve the Filipino people. Bisyo ko na ang magserbisyo at ako po’y naniniwala na ang serbisyo po sa tao, serbisyo po ‘yan sa ating Panginoon,” he said in his acceptance speech. “First of all, I would like to take this moment to express my deepest gratitude to the award-giving body for the Jinseo Arigato Champion of Life award. This special award is truly a profound honor. Pero huwag po kayo magpasalamat sa akin. Ako po ang nagpapasalamat sa inyo dahil binigyan n’yo ako ng pagkakataon na magserbisyo sa kapwa ko Pilipino,” Go added. The award was presented by no less than Philippine Consul General in Nagoya, Japan Roy B. Ecraela at the Jinseo Arigato International Film Festival Awards Night. Known for its significant contribution to the international film community, the event celebrated the cross-cultural collaboration between the Philippines and Japan. Addressing the significance of the film industry, Go assured his full support for Filipino filmmakers and the cultural value they add both locally and internationally. “We also celebrated the Filipino films included in this prestigious festival. I am incredibly proud of the work of our filmmakers. Your creativity and dedication reflect the rich talent and potential of the Filipino people. Rest assured, I will continue to support the Filipino film industry, recognizing its immense potential,” said Go. The Senator also recognized the sacrifices of Filipinos in Japan and other parts of the world. “During the time of President (Rodrigo) Duterte, we prioritized the welfare of our OFWs. We passed Republic Act No. 11641, which established the Department of Migrant Workers. Ito po ‘yung Department of OFW...Ako po’y isa sa mga author at co-sponsor ng batas na ‘yan, which underscores our government’s commitment to listen, to protect, and uphold the rights and welfare of Filipino migrant workers,” the senator explained. “At sa mga nakapag-asawa po ng Japanese, alagaan n’yo po ang inyong mga asawa. Alam n’yo mababait po ang Pilipino, sa totoo lang po. Swerteng-swerte po kayo sa inyong napangasawang Pilipina,” he added. Go always reminds concerned agencies, embassies and consulates to be available “24/7” for Filipinos abroad as they have no one else to run to but the representatives of the Philippine government. “Gusto ko rin pong batiin si Consul General Roy Ecraela. Salamat po sa pag-aalaga sa mga kababayan natin dito. And salamat po sa mga ConGen, (foreign service) officers and employees,” said Go. Go then spoke about his legislative efforts, particularly those impacting health and public welfare, which have also indirectly supported the creative industries by improving the overall well-being of Filipinos. As a Senate Committee on Public Information member, he is pushing to pass Senate Bill No. 1183 or the “Media and Entertainment Workers Welfare Act”. This proposal aims to provide enhanced protection, security, and incentives for media workers in the country across all platforms. The bill includes provisions for additional health insurance coverage, overtime and night differential pay, hazard pay, and other benefits to safeguard the rights and welfare of media workers. Go is also a member of the MMFF Executive Committee. Recognizing the exposure needed by Filipino filmmakers under the festival’s single annual event, he proposed the creation of the Metro Manila Summer Film Festival, providing a second yearly platform for showcasing quality Filipino movies and supporting the growth of the country’s film industry. He also continues to support MMFF’s efforts of promoting local films as it now celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Go also highlighted his dedication to enhancing access to healthcare through the ongoing operations of Malasakit Centers, the establishment of more Super Health Centers nationwide, and the enactment of the Regional Specialty Centers Act to bring medical services closer to the less privileged and remote areas. “I principally sponsored and authored Republic Act 11463 or the Malasakit Centers Act. Mayroon na ho tayong 165 na Malasakit Center sa buong Pilipinas. Nakakalat po ‘yan sa buong Pilipinas na laging handang tumulong po sa ating mga poor and indigent patients,” he said. These one-stop shops aim to support impoverished patients in reducing their hospital costs to the least possible amount. The DOH reports that the Malasakit Center program has already provided aid to more or less ten million Filipinos. As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, he principally sponsored and is one of the authors of a newly enacted law for the establishment of Regional Specialty Centers to bring specialized medical services closer to people outside the major urban centers. “I am proud to have been the principal sponsor and one of the authors of Republic Act No. 11959, also known as the Regional Specialty Centers Act. Ito po ‘yung maglalagay na po ng mga heart center, lung center, neonatal, cancer center sa mga selected DOH hospitals in every region all over the country,” he said. Lastly, the Super Health Center initiative, according to Go who advocated for its establishment, is a pivotal part of the government’s strategy to enhance the country’s healthcare system in the grassroots. Through the collective efforts of Go as vice chairperson of the Senate Committee on Finance, the DOH, local government units, and fellow lawmakers, sufficient funds have been allocated for around 700 Super Health Centers nationwide to bring primary care, medical consultations and early disease detection closer to communities. In closing, Go expressed a poignant reflection on the transient nature of life and the importance of doing good: “Minsan lang po tayo dadaan sa mundong ito... Kung ano pong kabutihan at tulong na pwede nating gawin sa ating kapwa, gawin na po natin ngayon dahil hindi na po tayo babalik sa mundong ito.” “Ako po ang inyong Senador kuya Bong Go, patuloy po akong magseserbisyo sa ating kapwa Pilipino sa abot ng aking makakaya... Mabuhay po ang Pilipino,” Go ended.",

        "content": "Tuesday, Deutsche Bank adjusted its price target on Avon Protection PLC (AVON:LN) (OTC: AVNBF) shares, raising it to GBP 14.70 from GBP 12.00 while maintaining a Hold rating on the stock. The revision follows Avon Protection's interim results, which indicated significant advancements across multiple areas of the business. The company has demonstrated progress in strengthening its balance sheet and achieving earlier-than-anticipated profitability at Team Wendy. Additionally, there have been operational improvements within the respirator segment. These positive developments, coupled with the potential for continued enhancements, signal a sustained momentum for the company going forward. Deutsche Bank's decision to raise the price target by approximately 23% to 1470p (from 1200p) is primarily driven by upgrades to their estimates. Despite the positive outlook, the firm's analyst cited the current market valuation as a factor limiting a more optimistic rating. Avon Protection's stock is trading at a forecasted September FY26E Price-Earnings Ratio (PER) of 17.3 times the bank's revised estimates, and even 11.3 times the upper end of management's Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) criteria, which anticipates FY26E Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 150c. The analyst noted that while there is an allure of further opportunities for improvement, the extent to which the company's success is already reflected in the stock price is a consideration. Deutsche Bank will continue to monitor Avon Protection closely for any potential changes that could present an opportunity.

        "content": "JPMorgan strategists believe investors should consider shifting towards defensive and commodity stocks in anticipation of upcoming rate cuts by central banks. Historically, defensives have struggled when bond yields were rising, but this phase might be ending, the Wall Street giant notes. Now, during the November-December episode, cyclicals rallied as the US 10-year yield tumbled 120 basis points, from 5.0% to 3.8%. According to JPMorgan, the rally was driven by market anticipation of an acceleration in activity, spurred by a Fed pivot and easing financing conditions. As a result, the Russell 2000 briefly outperformed the S&P 500 during that period. “This time around, the backdrop could be the softening activity momentum, as seen in a notable fall in US CESI most recently, into negative territory,” strategists wrote in a Tuesday note. “If bond yields are falling as economic growth is moderating, the sector leadership is likely to be more Defensively tilted. Indeed, in Q2 so far, Defensives are ahead in both the US and in Europe,” they added. The current market environment, marked by falling bond yields and softening activity momentum, supports this defensive tilt. The strategists believe that utilities and real estate sectors are particularly likely to rebound, regardless of bond yield movements. Despite recent uptrends, these sectors remain attractive based on valuation metrics, with utilities being the top-performing defensive sector in the US. In addition to defensive stocks, the bank also recommends a barbell strategy that revolves around commodity stocks. To be more specific, JPMorgan said its commodity strategists are bullish about industrial commodity prices for the second half of the year, “which should support Miners’ earnings per share,” the note states. In terms of large versus small-cap stocks, JPMorgan maintains a cautious stance on small caps, particularly in the US, where they expect them to necessitate a series of rate cuts to rally. However, they see potential in European and UK small caps after the start of rate cuts in those regions.",

        "content": "A sessions court in Mumbai on Tuesday sentenced two colleagues to life imprisonment for the murder of Kirti Vyas, a finance manager at BBlunt salon in Andheri, who was reported missing by her family six years ago. On Monday, Sessions Judge M G Deshpande found Siddhesh Shantaram Tamhankar and a woman colleague guilty of murder, kidnapping for murder, wrongful restraint, and destruction of evidence, among other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Tamhankar and the woman colleague sought leniency stating that they had no criminal antecedents and had their families dependent on them. Kirti Vyas’s woman colleague pleaded for leniency and said there was no evidence against her. They also submitted that the entire case was based on circumstantial evidence. Advertisement However, Special Public Prosecutor A M Chimalkar said the crime was committed with the ‘coolest of minds’ and that Vyas was a budding chartered accountant who was the financial pillar of her family. Missing body Earlier this month, the session court concluded arguments in a rare criminal trial where the court had to determine a murder charge despite the absence of the victim’s body. Also Read | Mumbai court convicts 2 colleagues in 2018 Kirti Vyas murder case Vyas, aged 28 at the time, was reported missing on March 16, 2018, after she left her South Mumbai residence for work. Nearly two months later, the police alleged that two of her colleagues were responsible for her death. Although Vyas’s body was never found, the prosecution argued that the circumstances indicated her colleagues killed her in a moving car after picking her up from her residence on the morning of March 16, 2018, over workplace-related issues. Both accused denied any involvement, contesting that they neither picked her up nor caused her disappearance. Advertisement The police filed a nearly 962-page chargesheet against the two, alleging murder, with statements from Vyas’s father, sister, colleagues, and other experts. The prosecution primarily relied on traces of Vyas’s blood found in the woman accused’s car , CCTV footage, and the Call Detail Records (CDR) of the accused. In the chargesheet, the Mumbai police said the primary motive for the alleged murder was Kirti Vyas’s reprimanding of Tamhankar, her junior at work. They alleged she was aware of the relationship between the female accused and Tamhankar and that they did not want her to expose it at work. The trial began in 2019 with both defendants facing murder charges, despite the absence of Kirti Vyas’s body. Since her initial bail application, the woman accused has maintained her innocence, claiming various irregularities in the evidence through her legal representation. The defence argued that the DNA analysis was flawed and questioned how bloodstains were discovered over a month later when the car had been previously inspected twice by the police. Advertisement While the sessions court denied her bail, the Supreme Court granted her bail in 2021, considering her prolonged incarceration and gender. Tamhankar, however, remained in jail. The woman colleague was taken into custody on Monday after she was convicted.",

        "description": "Lady Gaga’s ‘Chromatica Ball’ is now available to stream – and includes a surprise announcement of LG7, or her seventh studio album.",
        "content": "Little Monsters, rejoice: The concert film is finally here! Released on Max on Saturday night, the movie – directed by Kerry Asmussen and herself – comprises two hours of twisted pop greatness, filmed at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles during the star’s Chromatica Ball tour in 2022. “This tour went on during a time that people didn’t think that you could tour [due to the pandemic] and stadiums were packed all over the world and they were sold out, all dressed up and dancing and singing,” Gaga has . “I’m just so excited for you all to see what we made up close.” As someone who attended one of those shows, at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, I was, of course, already quite familiar with the Chromatic Ball – but I couldn’t resist experiencing the performance again. After all, Gaga’s epic set truly had it all, from her biggest hits – “Bad Romance”, “Stupid Love” – to (including custom pieces by Gareth Pugh, Alexander McQueen, and Vex Latex). So, in honour of the film’s release, find my 33 thoughts on below. Put your paws up! 1. The show is starting! According to the opening credits, 52,344 Little Monsters attended this performance at the Dodger Stadium. I wonder if they were as rowdy as the people at MetLife. 2. Gaga is opening with “Bad Romance” in a custom Gareth Pugh creation that’s basically like a high-fashion cocoon. God, I love when she does 3. She’s now emerging from the cocoon for “Just Dance”. Love when an artist opens a concert with their older hits. Nostalgia, baby! She keeps telling the crowd to “put their fucking hands up!” I remember dutifully obeying her orders in the crowd. 4. Her vocals are vocal-ing. These days, it’s honestly rare for pop stars to sound better than they do on the record. No lip-synching here! 5. On to “Poker Face”. Let’s take a moment for her back-up dancers and choreography. Her dancers are not missing a . I love how fast and synchronised the movements are. You almost don’t even notice them – which means they’re killing it, obviously. 6. Now we’re transitioning into “Act I”. This is where Gaga starts singing some of her hits. This album is easily in my top five of all time; it got me through the pandemic in 2020, when there were no dance clubs to go to. Thanks to this album, the living room became my club. 7. Gaga is singing “Alice” while perched on a concrete slab, wearing a custom red look by Tops Studio. Very futuristic, very avant-garde, Gaga. 8. It’s time for “Replay” – my favourite song on the album! She sheds her red cape to reveal a bloodied latex bodysuit from Vex and Yummy Gummy Latex. Such a gag-worthy reveal. 9. Again, Gaga demands, “Put your fucking hands up!” I am from my living room. 10. I’m shook whenever the cameras pan to the audience. Very few performers can draw a crowd like this. 11. On to Act II. The interlude videos, from her longtime collaborator Nick Knight, are . I love that no details were overlooked in this show. Everything is cohesive. 12. She’s performing “911” in a black sharp-shouldered latex top from Sinrgy. I love that she kept the opening transition from “Chromatica II” into “911” – one of the best parts of the album, duh. 13. “Pop a 911 and then pop another one.” Ugh, such a good line. Also, the for this song is so good – please do yourself a favour and watch it. 14. Imagine if she had brought out Blackpink to perform their song “Sour Candy” together? I would have passed out. It’s interesting that Gaga didn’t bring out any special guests for this tour. Then again, does she need to? 15. She’s now performing “Telephone”. Gaga was recently asked if she would ever team up with Beyoncé for a part two to the smash hit. She , “Whenever calls, I’d like to pick up the phone.” Such a tease. 16. I’m obsessed with her lead pianist, Brockett Parsons – specifically, the circular piano that he is playing. In the world of Gaga, nothing can be normal. 17. On to Act III. Gaga and her dancers are all coming out in gold for “Babylon”. Her gold suit is by Alexander McQueen. This song is so camp. She’s telling us to dance through our pain. “You better werk tonight, LA.” Roger that! 18. I could listen to a whole remix track of Gaga just saying, “That’s gossip.” I find myself using it in everyday sentences. Am I late in filing this story? “That’s gossip.” 19. Gaga has now put on a gold cape by Topo Studio, and a gold Philip Treacy headpiece in the shape of a lobster claw. I wonder what the wardrobe budget was for this performance. More than my net worth, that’s for sure. 20. She’s now singing “Born This Way” on the piano, and saying it’s time to “celebrate your pride”. I remember getting super emotional when I heard this live. Gaga has done so much for the LGBTQ+ community, and she always creates a safe space at her shows. “You’re perfect with a capital P.” No, are. 21. Oh, shit, she’s now picking up the pace and doing full dance choreo. Huge flames are bursting out from the stage. I remember my spot at the concert being so close to said flames, and worrying that, like, my eyebrows would burn off. They were ! 22. We’re on to Act IV, and this is the more slowed-down, piano-focused portion of the evening. Gaga’s voice is unreal, and I love that she created a moment in the show to strip things down and spotlight it. 23. Her Dead Lotus Couture bodysuit and alien-like headpiece are just so good. She’s singing “Shallow” from . Everyone has their iPhone flashlights up. 24. “I’M OFF THE DEEP END, WATCH AS I DIVE IN.” I practically lost my voice screaming these lyrics at the concert. 25. Gaga’s taking a moment to talk about getting through the pandemic together. “The whole world did not fade; we’re all still here.” I can’t stress enough how much her – and music in general – uplifted people back in 2020. That’s the power of art, baby. 26. One thing I love about Gaga is she’s always going to make a political statement, too. “Just while I’m here,” she says after singing “The Edge of Glory”, “I hope we can all agree that everybody in this nation deserves the right to make choices about their own bodies.” Amen to that. 27. Gaga’s dancing and skipping her way off the stage to “Enigma”. This song doesn’t get enough credit. One of my favourites off . 28. Time for the finale act! I’m sad it’s almost over. She’s back in a custom Alexander McQueen biker look with crystals all over it to sing “Stupid Love”. The choreo in this performance is so ; I would be out of breath by the first chorus. And yet, the vocals are still on point. I wonder how one trains for this. Singing on the treadmill? Singing while doing jumping jacks? I’m exhausted just thinking about it. 29. The big, dramatic flames are back. I wonder if anyone lost their eyebrows that night. Like, truly. 30. I’m sad didn’t come out for “Rain On Me”. That would have broken the internet. At least we got that one live VMAs performance from them. 31. She ends the show with “Hold My Hand”, her song from . It’s definitely an epic, belt-your-heart-out song to cap things off with. 32. The last shot in the film we see is Gaga doing a quick dance break with what appears to be a sample of a new song. We see a flash of a caption: “LG7: Gaga Returns”. 33. Is this a track on her next album (which would be her seventh, hence LG7)? The lyrics sounded something like “dance in the shadow”. ! You can’t leave us on this cliffhanger, Gaga!",

        "description": "There are conflicting reports over the alleged Guptas arrest in India this week in connection with a suicide. Here’s what we know so far ...",
        "content": "Confusion reigns over the apparent Guptas arrest in India this week. This follows the suicide of a high-profile builder. According to India Today , two of the three Gupta brothers were arrested in Uttarakhand this past weekend. Many believed news of the Guptas arrest in India this past weekend was a positive break for South Africa. Authorities have been trying to get the brothers extradited to face charges for looting billions of Rands through state capture. It is estimate state capture cost South Africa as much as R613 billion during Zuma’s tenure as ANC president. GUPTAS ARREST IN INDIA Late last year, Deputy President Paul Mashatile and Justice Minister Ronald Lamola went to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to facilitate the extradition of Atul and Rajesh Gupta. However, the Guptas appear to have fled to India. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) confirms that the Guptas are wanted on money laundering and fraud charges in South Africa. After fleeing South Africa on a private plane, they were arrested in the UAE in June 2022, following Interpol’s intervention. Now, following the alleged Guptas arrest in India, the NDPP has the task of getting Indian authorities to declare them fugitives in that country, too. TWO OUT OF THREE According to reports, two of the three Gupta brothers were arrested on Saturday after Satinder Singh Sawhney named them in his suicide note before jumping off a building. IOL reports the Guptas arrest in India was facilitated after Sawhney’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Guptas threatened him. As a result, this lead him to take his own life. His son, Ranvir Sahni, lodged the complaint against the Guptas with police. Furthermore, Sahni said his father was constantly threatened by Ajay and Anil Gupta, over financial matters. A written complaint was submitted to the local police in May 2023 about the Gupta’s threats, harassment, intimidation, and blackmail. This provided the prima facie evidence for the Guptas arrest in India and both were produced in court this past Saturday, confirmed Senior Police Superintendent Ajay Singh. THE ‘WRONG’ GUPTAS However, confusion reigns over whether these are the correct Guptas. Justice Minister Ronald Lamola says preliminary investigations indicate the arrested pair are not the Guptas South Africa wants, reports TimesLive . “According to the information at our disposal, verified by our high commissioner in India, the Guptas that have been arrested are not the ones we want. Per the warrant of arrest issued by South Africa, and the red notice issued by Interpol, it is not Ajay and Atul Gupta,” asserts Lamola. However, investigative journalism website amaBhungane has confirmed that the images of the Gupta brothers behind bars are indeed the ‘correct’ brothers. It reports that the photograph provided by Indian journalist Ankit Paliwal, is of Ajay Gupta and his brother-in-law Anil Gupta, in a jail cell in Rajpur.

        "content": "Inilahad ni Danica Sotto na hindi niya naiwasang mapikon sa intriga na nambabae umano ang kaniyang mister na si Marc Pingris. Sa panayam ng “Updated with Nelson Canlas” podcast, sinabi ni Danica na nakapag-move on na sila ni Marc sa naturang isyu pero may mga nais siyang linawin. Noong kainitan ng alegasyon, sinabi ni Danica na nag-post siya ng quote tungkol sa betrayal at loyalty sa kaniyang Instagram Stories. Pero paglilinaw niya, ibang tao ang kaniyang pinatutungkulan sa post. “I post because I like the quote or sometimes, noong time na iyon, aaminin ko, it was a feeling that I was feeling about someone else, na parang napipikon ako sa isang tao. And that is a person na nangloko sa amin sa negosyo. A person we truly trusted,” paliwanag niya. Hanggang ngayon, pinagdadaanan pa raw nila ang sinasabing pagsubok sa negosyo. “This tabloid, ang ginawa, kinuha ‘yung quote ko na ‘yun. Sinabi na I'm confirming daw the issue kasi pinapatamaan ko daw si Marc. Pero hindi na ako nagsalita,” sabi pa ni Danica. Dahil sa nangyari, sinabi ni Danica na nag-usap sila ni Marc at nagkasundo na huwag nang mag-post ng tungkol sa mga quote na maaaring maging iba ang pagkakaunawa ng makakabasa. “So, parang doon pumasok 'yung communication namin na usap,” anang aktres. “Tapos ako naman sa side ko, pinagsabihan ko lang siya na, ingat sa mga nakakasama, ingat sa mga pinupuntahan. Minsan kasi, sa'yo wala lang ‘yun, you're too friendly or—hindi friendly, accommodating. Diba? ‘Yung parang, oh, ito chika-chika. Ganoon naman mga basketball player e,” dagdag ni Danica. Sinabi rin ni Danica na hindi niya naiwasan na mahaluan ng tawa ang pagkapikon dahil may mga tao na mahusay na \"magtahi-tahi\" ng kuwento. “Tapos ‘yun lang gagawin ng mga tao, gagawan ng butas, pagdidikit-dikitin, tatagpi-tagpiin,” sabi pa ni Danica na dahilan para mabigyan ng malisya at ibang kulay ang post. Ayon kay Danica, hindi na siya naapektuhan ng mga tsismis dahil nasanay na siya bilang bahagi ng showbiz industry. “Ang dami pa nga nilang may mga chinismis pa sila before about my dad, (Vic Sotto). May ganito daw na anak na. Oh my gosh, ang sinungaling talaga,” patuloy niya. Gayunman, aminado ang aktres na ibang usapan kapag idinadamay ang kaniyang mga anak. “Siyempre, napikon ako pag anak mo na ‘yung tinitira. May sasabihin na masama, na very very foul,” paglalahad niya. “I think 'yung foul doon is parang may mga sinabi na it's the karma of my parents. ‘Yung ganoon.” Dagdag niya, “Ang rude. Diba na parang, oh yeah, dahil sa mga kasalanan ng mga magulang kaya nagsasabi. Parang gusto kong sabihin, first of all, mali ang statement na ‘yan. And pangalawa, hindi niyo alam ‘yung buong story. Nag-speculate na kayo hindi niyo alam kung anong totoo at hindi.” Nitong nakaraang Marso, naintriga si Marc na kasama ang aktres na si Kim Rodriguez dahil sa parehong larawan nila na may background ng Sydney Opera House, na kuha pala sa magkaibang pagkakataon nang magkahiwalay na namasyal sa lugar ang dalawa. \"Walang katotohanan ang mga lumalabas na balita tungkol sa amin ni Ms. Kim Rodriguez. Walang namamagitan sa aming dalawa gaya ng sinasabi ng ibang tao,\" ani Marc sa isang post para linaw ang naturang intriga sa social media. \"OK kami ng pamilya ko. Wag na po tayo magpakalat ng mga balita na hindi totoo. Humihingi po kami ng respeto para hindi madamay ang mga anak namin ni Danica. Salamat po at God bless po,\" pakiusap niya. Itinanggi rin ni Kim ang maling hinala tungkol sa kanila ni Marc. — FRJ, GMA Integrated News",

        "description": "This upswing in premium travel bookings highlights a robust recovery and growing confidence among business travelers.The post FCM Travel First Quarter Shows Strong Recovery With a 20% Increase in Premium Travel appeared first on Travel And Tour World.",
        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 FCM Travel, the premier corporate travel division of Flight Centre Travel Group, has seen a significant surge in its bookings. According to recent data, the company, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), experienced a 20% increase in premium class travel bookings. This growth was recorded in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This upswing in premium travel bookings highlights a robust recovery and growing confidence among business travelers. It also suggests a shift in travel preferences, possibly due to increased corporate travel budgets or a higher demand for comfort and luxury during business trips. Such a trend is noteworthy, especially considering the broader impacts on the travel industry and the global economy. It reflects an evolving landscape where business travel is not just rebounding but also evolving to meet new demands and expectations. Sunny Sodhi , Managing Director of FCM Travel India, said that conglomerates, manufacturing, and IT sectors, just to name a few, have been consistently travelling for business growth, both domestically and internationally. “India is soon going to be the 7th largest business travel market in the world and the aviation boom in India is most certainly supporting the growth in business travel. Business travellers are now more willing to spend a little extra for a premium experience which has led to a demand for both premium and business class travel,” said Sodhi . “Domestic air capacity has increased more than 3 per cent but due to the demand in travel, we have seen average ticket prices increase by 9 per cent which is attributed to a much stronger economic growth and a general increase in demand for travel. Popular domestic routes for business travel include Delhi to Mumbai, Mumbai to Delhi and Bangalore to Mumbai,” added Sodhi . “International air capacity has also increased by 14 per cent due to India’s growing aviation sector hence, however, average international airfares have softened by 15 per cent which is a general global trend of yields decreasing across airfares,” concluded Sodhi .",

        "content": "26 years ago on this day, Pakistan took the decision as a response and in self-defence to the nuclear tests accompanying hostile posturing by its neighbour, India. Pakistan carried out five successful tests of its own in Balochistan's Chaghi followed by another one in Kharan on May 30. Following the successful tests, Pakistan became the seventh nuclear-armed country in the world and the first in the Islamic world. Paying tribute to the heroes of 1998 success, Pakistan Mulsim League-Nawaz (PML-N) made a video detailing world pressure on the country at the time of becoming a nuclear power. In the video, the current ruling party lauded its supremo Nawaz Sharif, who was prime minister in 1998 and who gave a befitting reply to the world in order to restore the balance of power in the region. However, PML-N forgot to mention renowned nuclear scientist and national icon Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, who developed the Muslim world's first atomic bomb. Dr AQ Khan is considered the father of Pakistan's nuclear programme. Dr Khan was the first Pakistani to be awarded three presidential awards. He was awarded the Nishan-e-Imtiaz (Order of Excellence) twice and the Hilal-e-Imtiaz (Crescent of Excellence) once. Khan passed away on October 10 in 2021 after his health deteriorated.",

        "content": "Wayne Rooney was once in the sights of snipers as he completed a round of golf with former US President Donald Trump . The Manchester United and England legend, who was recently appointed as the new head coach of Championship side Plymouth Argyle , had quite the audience for 18 holes. While accompanying Trump may have been startling in itself, being followed by an army of security was a surreal moment for Rooney. The match-up occurred when the 38-year-old was based in Washington DC, having taken his career to the United States in 2018. Rooney departed Everton for the second time to enjoy two seasons with DC United, netting 23 times in 48 appearances for the club. Former New York Mayor Rudi Guiliani was in tow while Rooney paired with Trump. It left Rooney with an easy an answer to a question from Gary Neville . Jack Grealish left facing Euro 2024 nightmare despite Pep Guardiola claims Watch Champions League, Europa League & Conference League finals with TNT Sports When asked the most famous person he'd played golf with, Rooney told The Overlap, brought to you by Sky Bet : \"Donald Trump. The maddest thing about it was we had [Rudi] Guiliani in the buggy behind us, then there were about 50-100 golf buggies that were all security. \"There was a boat in the lake with snipers, there were snipers in the bushes, and I was like ‘what’s going on here?!’\" The opportunity for Rooney to join the businessman and star of the US version of television show the Apprentice was born out of a connection with his son. It even led to a visit to the Oval Office, in the White House. Wayne Rooney is back in management after being appointed by Plymouth ( Image: PA) Rooney explained: \"I went in, he asked me to give his son football lessons. H e said 'do you want to see my dad?' Took me into the oval office. From there his PA just texted, 'do you want to play golf?'\" Rooney also revealed that he would choose Lionel Messi in the debate of whether the Inter Miami star or Cristiano Ronaldo is the greatest player of all time. The ex-striker showed no favouritism to his former teammate. He said: \"I think Messi, I think he's the best ever. I get a lot of stick for saying Messi. I understand people can say Messi or Ronaldo, they're both incredible, probably the best two players to play the game. For me, Messi has just got that little bit more flair which I like in a player.

Revanna, who is contesting Karnataka ’s Hassan Lok Sabha seat again, left the country on April 27, hours before the first First Information Report ( FIR ) alleging sexual assault was filed against him. The Karnataka government has constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the charges against the MP. On Monday, he released a video saying he would appear before investigating officials at 10 am on Friday, May 31. “I have heard that his passport will expire on May 31. If he loses the (Lok Sabha) elections, his (MP) membership will also end. Automatically, his diplomatic passport will be seized. After learning about all this, maybe he has decided to return to the country,” Parameshwara told reporters. Advertisement Parameshwara said the state government had done everything possible to ensure his arrest. An arrest warrant and a blue corner notice were issued against the MP. “If he did not return, Interpol would have intervened by learning his location,” he said, adding that Revanna’s decision to surrender before investigating officials was right. On Monday, the Karnataka home minister said the state government would arrest the MP as soon as he lands in the country citing the warrants issued against him.

The JD(S) MLA was later released on regular bail on May 13 after the victim was traced by the SIT.",

        "content": "University of California, Santa Cruz graduate students and other academic workers in the UAW 4811 union begin a strike and are joined by UCSC students for Justice in Palestine as they picket the main entrance to campus on Monday, May 20, 2024, in Santa Cruz, Calif. (Shmuel Thaler/The Santa Cruz Sentinel via AP) LOS ANGELES – A rolling strike by unionized academic workers upset about the University of California’s response to pro Palestinian protests at various campuses will come to UCLA beginning Tuesday as part of the second wave of union walkouts. Workers represented by United Auto Workers Local 4811 have already been striking at UC Santa Cruz in what the union called the first wave of planned walkouts. According to the union, the second round of strikes will begin Tuesday at UCLA and UC Davis. The strike is “in response to egregious unfair labor practices that UC has committed, including summoning militarized police officers from numerous outside law enforcement to violently eject and arrest peaceful protesters at UCLA, UC Irvine, and UC San Diego; making unilateral changes to standards for employee discipline, free speech rights and academic freedom; and disciplining and suspending employees engaged in peaceful protest,” according to the union. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address. I agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge that I have read the Privacy Policy . The UC system has blasted the union’s allegations and filed unfair labor practice complaints of its own, saying the union’s labor contract has a no-strike provision and that the union’s demands are outside the scope of union labor issues. In a statement released before the union’s strike-authorization vote, officials at the University of California Office of the President said, “UC believes that the vote currently being conducted by UAW leadership sets a dangerous precedent that would introduce non-labor issues into labor agreements. If a strike is allowed for political and social disputes, the associated work stoppages would significantly impact UC’s ability to deliver on its promises to its students, community and the State of California.” The union represents teaching assistants, readers, tutors, student researchers and academic researchers. UAW Local 4811 is asking the UC schools to give amnesty to all academic employees and students who face arrest or disciplinary actions for protesting. The union wants the students to have guarantees of freedom of speech and political expression on campus and is asking for researchers to be able to opt out of funding sources tied to the Israeli Defense Force.

        "description": "MUNICH & PFORZHEIM, Germany — Visitors to The smarter E Europe, Europe’s Largest Alliance of Exhibitions for the Energy Industry, will find out how private consumers can become self-sufficient in electricity, heat and transport in a smart way and how this creates new business opportunities for installers and system providers. The smarter E Europe combines [...]",
        "content": "MUNICH & PFORZHEIM, Germany — There are around 19.3 million residential buildings in Germany. More than half of these will need to be renovated and equipped with photovoltaics over the next 20 years. But residential buildings also play a central role in solar expansion throughout Europe. Everywhere, solar systems are being installed with storage systems, as this allows the solar power generated to be used as needed. Solar power has been generated and stored to supply the home, but what else can it be used for? For the increasingly popular electric car. In the home system, battery electric vehicles as well as heat pumps can be charged and operated cost-effectively and climate-neutrally with the solar power. In Germany, 51 percent more heat pumps were sold last year than in 2022. With the adoption of the EU Heat Pump Action Plan, this development will continue dynamically. The combination of PV, a storage system, electric car and heat pump forms an effective network of electricity-generating, electricity-storing and electricity-consuming units. The industry offers a wide range of components – from PV systems and intelligent wall boxes to smart meters and much more. However, successfully building a comprehensive energy system requires not only interaction between the individual components, but also smooth cooperation between the electrical trade, plumbing, heating and air conditioning technology (HVAC) and other trades. The electricity system requires a high degree of flexibility in order to be able to provide a renewable energy supply 24/7. Flexible small consumers with their own home energy systems can make a major contribution to keeping electricity generation and consumption in balance while optimizing their own consumption at low cost. Dynamic electricity tariffs are another way of better coordinating supply and demand. Consumers base their consumption on the current electricity prices, which change depending on supply and demand. From 2025, all electricity suppliers in Germany will be obliged to offer their customers a dynamic electricity tariff. Prerequisite for this is the installation of a smart meter. “Accelerating Integrated Energy Solutions” – under this motto, The smarter E Europe, Europe’s largest trade fair alliance for the energy industry, focuses on cross-industry solutions for a 24/7 renewable energy supply in the electricity, heating and transport sectors. The smarter E Europe combines four trade fairs and will take place from June 19-21, 2024 at Messe München.

        "content": "Anwar said an announcement will be made by Amir Hamzah. – Bernama photo KUALA LUMPUR (May 28): Wait for the announcement from Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan regarding the decision on whether diesel prices will be floated, said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. “Wait for the announcement from MKII (Amir Hamzah),” he said briefly when met by reporters after launching the Global Forum on Islamic Economics and Finance here today. He said this when asked about the possibility of the government floating diesel prices following the decision to rationalise diesel subsidies. On the request from industry stakeholders for the government to expand the list of diesel subsidy recipients, Anwar asked that the matter be referred to Minister of Transport Anthony Loke and Minister of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali. When asked about restaurant operators’ concerns that the increase in transportation costs would be passed on to consumers, the Prime Minister said the government has taken sufficient steps to address the issue. In a national address on May 21, Anwar announced that the Cabinet had agreed to implement a targeted diesel subsidy for consumers in Peninsular Malaysia, estimating an annual saving of RM4 billion. To avoid a sharp rise in the cost of goods and services, subsidies will continue for traders using diesel-powered commercial vehicles. On the awarding of the demand responsive transit (DRT) Selangor Mobility Initiative pilot project to a company co-founded by the husband of Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh, the Prime Minister said he leaves it to the authorities to conduct an investigation. “If there are reports, investigations, and there should be explanations about the process, it should be considered as a normal case that needs to be investigated,” he said. – Bernama",

KOTA KINABALU (May 28): Kota Kinabalu City Hall (DBKK) has activated Ops Tunda to remove vehicles abandoned around the city. A statement from DBKK stated that its enforcement department would tow away and issue compounds on obsolete and abandoned vehicles in public places. Vehicles that have been left abandoned for a long time by the side or shoulder of the road, residential and commercial areas will be removed. Vehicle owners who default and fail or do not cooperate will face action under the Anti-Litter By-Laws 1984 (Amendment 2005). The by-law provides for car towing and a compound not exceeding RM500 for continuous or repeated offences, or if convicted, a fine not exceeding RM10,000 and all related costs to be borne by the vehicle owner. Since 2020, DBKK has issued 1,038 Abandoned/Obsolete Vehicle Notices and towed away 83 vehicles through the Ops Tunda. The city authority therefore reminded the public not to leave vehicles parked for a long period in public places, on the shoulder and side of roads as they obstruct the traffic and affect the environment. The Ops Tunda will be carried out from time to time to improve the orderliness, cleanliness and safety of the Kota Kinabalu City environment. For further information, the public can contact the DBKK Enforcement Department at 088-527800.",

The Elland Road club suffered Championship play-off final heartache at the weekend, losing 1-0 to Southampton at Wembley. Daniel Farke's men now face another term in the second tier, and Ampadu has already told his international team-mate he should stay in Yorkshire, despite them not returning to the top flight. He has one year left to run on his Tottenham contract. Ampadu said earlier this year : \"I'll be pressuring him. He knows that. READ MORE: Joe Rodon has already made his Leeds United feelings clear as play-off final moment spotted \"A lot of Leeds fans enjoyed it when I commented on one of his Instagram photos one time. \"I haven't done it in a while. But we are all telling him to stay. Everyone knows how much we appreciate him and what he has done this year.\" Leeds' hopes of bringing him back to Yorkshire appear slim but Rodon's sentiments before the final suggest the Whites do have a look-in. In an interview with the Mail , the Swansea product said: “It would be nice to have stability and know where I am next season. I’ve always strived to get to the elite level and hopefully I can get back there with Leeds, but you never know. “I don’t want to look too far into the future, although I do love it here and Leeds feels like a second home to me now. I’m just concentrating on giving my best and getting this club back to where it belongs.”",

        "content": "MADRID, 28 May. (EUROPA PRESS) - El 53% de los españoles prefiere que su banco ofrezca un modelo híbrido que combine un servicio tanto digital como presencial, para poder elegir. Se trata de una de las conclusiones del III Estudio de Nickel 'Percepción y hábitos de los españoles respecto al sector bancario'. El resto, un 33%, quiere atención presencial disponible en todo momento, y tan sólo un 14% apostaría por un banco puramente digital. La fintech señala que estas preferencias que reflejan su estudio contrasta con la idea de que el futuro de los servicios bancarios debería ser únicamente digital. \"No parece que el mercado demande un modelo así\", explica. Al ser preguntados por las opciones de banca que ofrecen un servicio únicamente digital, al 33% de los encuestados les parece que es \"cómodo\", pero el resto declara que echan en falta la posibilidad de ser atendidos en una sucursal para cualquier cosa (27%) o, al menos, poder tener una opción presencial para gestiones importantes (40%). El estudio también pregunta por la opinión de los encuestados en cuanto a cuáles serían para ellos las áreas de mejora del sector bancario. La atención presencial se posiciona como el principal aspecto a mejorar para la mitad de los encuestados, en el 50% de los casos. Le siguen una mejor atención a los mayores (46%) y ofrecer productos \"más sencillos y transparentes\" (43%). Por otro lado, Nickel señala que su análisis trasluce diferencias generacionales, pero \"no como cabría esperar\": los jóvenes entre 18 y 30 años también prefieren un modelo híbrido en una proporción igual a la de la población general (52%). \"Es decir, no por ser más jóvenes prefieren un modelo puramente digital. Sin embargo, como sí era de esperar, entre los mayores de 50 años, tan sólo un 6% se decantaría por un servicio totalmente digital, la mitad que para el resto de adultos\", resalta la entidad.

        "description": "South Wales pub chain Croeso has entered into a new lease for pub which has been closed since March",
        "content": "A former JD Wetherspoon’s pub in Penarth has been taken on by expanding south Wales pubs group Croeso. Croeso Pubs has agreed a lease deal for the Bear’s Head in the seaside town, after Wetherspoon opted not to renew its lease in March. Croeso plans to reopen the pub in July. The freehold interest in the building is owned by Nefertiti Fashions. Last December Croeso acquired the Discovery in the Lakeside area of Cardiff, where it has since invested £400,000. It has also recently extended the Blue Bell in Cardiff’s city centre into the former Brew Monster bar next door. Last year it also acquired the lease for the Dock pub in Cardiff Bay. : Croeso Pubs director Simon Little said: “We are really pleased to be able to add a venue in Penarth to our growing portfolio and hope to replicate the success we’ve had in our other venues to the Bear’s Head by delivering what the people of Penarth want in their local pub. “We aren’t planning on changing what is already a winning formula at The Bear’s Head, the prices will mostly remain the same.” Fellow Croeso Pubs director, Craig Davies, said: “The Bear’s Head fits extremely well with our model of acquiring larger sites and we are hopeful that we can not only secure the jobs of the staff currently working there, but also create new ones as we extend our offering. “We now have a successful formula that we have worked hard to refine when taking over new pubs, which fulfils our determination to provide quality venues for the communities we operate in. The fact that the community launched a petition when the closure of the Bear’s Head was announced demonstrates that this is a place that matters to locals, and this only galvanises our resolve to invest in this pub in Penarth. It is our intention to run the business along the same ‘value lines’ as the local community previously enjoyed.” Croeso Pubs has proven track record of breathing new life into venues. It took over the lease for the Philharmonic and reopened it in 2017 following a £1m refurbishment. It also took over the former Brains pub 33 on Windsor Place in the centre of Cardiff in late 2022 and reopened it as a food led venue the Daffodil. Its portfolio also includes the Brewhouse in Pontcanna.",

        "content": "Wunder gibt es immer wieder Der VfL Bochum bleibt nach einem spektakulären Comeback in der Bundesliga. Quelle: IMAGO/Laci Perenyi Der VfL Bochum dreht in der Relegation gegen Fortuna Düsseldorf ein 0:3 und bleibt in der Bundesliga. Die spektakuläre Aufholjagd des Revierklubs liefert auch mit Blick auf die anstehenden Großereignisse eine wichtige Erkenntnis, meint Sportbuzzer-Redakteur Timon Zöfelt. Was für ein Wahnsinnsspektakel: Der VfL Bochum bleibt dank einer irren Aufholjagd bei Fortuna Düsseldorf in der Bundesliga. Ein Fußball-Wunder ohne Ankündigung. Denn dass dem VfL nach dem niederschmetternden 0:3 im Relegationshinspiel tatsächlich noch die Wende gelingen würde, daran dürften im Vorlauf selbst kühnste Optimisten kaum mehr einen Gedanken verschwendet haben. Zu wenig Hoffnung versprachen die sportlich unterirdischen vergangenen Wochen, die teils blutleeren Auftritte und scheppernden Pleiten, die den Revierklub überhaupt erst in die Relegationsbredouille manövriert hatten. 0:5 (gegen Bayer Leverkusen) und 1:4 (gegen Werder Bremen) lauteten die ernüchternden Resultate zum Saisonabschluss. Es folgte die Unruhe um Stammkeeper Manuel Riemann, der für die Relegationspartien aus dem Kader flog und die deftige Niederlage gegen Düsseldorf vor heimischer Kulisse. Der siebte Bundesliga -Abstieg der Vereinsgeschichte schien besiegelt. Danke an den VfL Bochum Anschließende Durchhalteparolen und Kampfansagen wirkten nurmehr obligatorisch. Aufgeben in aller Öffentlichkeit – die Blöße wollte man sich an der Castroper Straße trotz der schier aussichtslosen Lage nicht geben. „Aggressivität, Intensität, Leidenschaft und Haltung – bis zum Schlusspfiff“ beschwor etwa Trainer Heiko Butscher in den vier Tagen zwischen Hin- und Rückspiel gebetsmühlenartig – so lange, bis nicht nur er, sondern auch seine Spieler offenbar wieder an ein furioses Comeback glaubten. Denn was der VfL in Düsseldorf ablieferte, hätten einer verunsicherten Mannschaft mit all dem Frust der Vorwochen im Hinterkopf nur die wenigsten zugetraut. Vollgasfußball, Wille und Leidenschaft – über 120 Minuten feinste Unterhaltung. Fanherz, was willst du mehr? Dass sich das Investment am Ende eines dramatischen Elfmeterschießens (6:5) auch noch auszahlte, markierte zumindest aus Bochumer Sicht das Happy End einer wilden Achterbahnfahrt der Gefühle – und der sportlichen Leistung. Am Ende darf sich nicht nur der VfL-Anhänger, sondern auch der gemeine Nicht-Düsseldorf-Fan in Bochum für einen atemberaubenden Flutlichtabend und einen würdigen Abschluss einer Saison bedanken, in der es mit Bayer Leverkusen als deutschem Meister oder dem 1. FC Heidenheim als Europapokal-Teilnehmer viele Überraschungen gab. Mehr zum Thema „Heute sind alle Helden“: Wie Bochum den sensationellen Klassenerhalt feiert „Das ist nichts mehr für mein Herz“: Emotionaler Andreas Luthe beendet Karriere Düsseldorf-Boss sucht nach Erklärungen: „Vielleicht zu viele Gedanken gemacht“ Zurück bleibt nun eine Erkenntnis, die aus deutscher Sicht mit Blick auf ein Champions-League -Finale, in dem Borussia Dortmund gegen Rekordchampion Real Madrid als klarer Underdog daherkommt, sowie die danach anstehende Heim-Europameisterschaft nicht unerheblich ist. Eine Erkenntnis, die trotz scheinbar zunehmend schwindender Fußballromantik im von Geld getriebenen Geschäft auch zukünftig große Herzschlagmomente verspricht. Eine Erkenntnis, die nachhallt: Wunder gibt es im Fußball immer wieder.",

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 A week after a deadly turbulence incident, several Singapore Airlines passengers are still hospitalized in Bangkok, highlighting the severity of the tragic event. Thirty-four passengers from a Singapore Airlines flight remain hospitalized in Bangkok nearly a week after their flight encountered severe turbulence, highlighting the gravity of the incident. The airline reported late Monday that 50 individuals from the May 21 London-Singapore flight are still in Bangkok, with some receiving medical care. All crew members from Flight SQ321 have returned to Singapore. Thai authorities indicated that most injuries involved the head or spine, with over a dozen people requiring surgery. In response, Singapore Airlines has implemented stricter cabin rules during turbulence but has not mandated that passengers wear seat belts throughout the flight. The airline is fully cooperating with authorities investigating the incident, which resulted in one fatality. The plane made an emergency landing in Bangkok. The turbulence hit Singapore Airlines flight from London’s Heathrow to Singapore on a Boeing 777, causing the hospitalization of two crew members and 44 passengers in Bangkok, the airline revealed on its Facebook page on Tuesday, May 21.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email According to Xu Bing, co-founder of SenseTime, China’s domestic artificial intelligence (AI) chipmakers are rapidly catching up to global leaders. TakeAway Points: China’s domestic artificial intelligence (AI) chipmakers are making fast progress in closing the gap on international leaders, according to SenseTime co-founder Xu Bing. Meanwhile, one of China’s AI pioneers, SenseTime, has been put on a US investment blacklist as a result of broad US sanctions that are limiting the nation’s AI advancements. Another chipmaker that has demonstrated promise in AI, in addition to Biren and Huawei, is Moore Threads Intelligent Beijing. Chipmaker are Matching up on AI Growth Speaking at the UBS Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong, Xu stated that while Asia is well behind the US in terms of computing capacity for AI, China has the expertise and data to catch up. One of China’s AI pioneers, SenseTime, has been put on a US investment blacklist as a result of broad US sanctions that are limiting the nation’s AI advancements. US trade restrictions that prohibit the import of Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI accelerators have complicated China’s advancement in this area. That’s sparked the need for domestic alternatives from the likes of Huawei Technologies and Shanghai Biren Technology, which are both also subject to US trade restrictions. “There’s a shortage of resources here in Asia in general. It’s like a 10-fold gap in the compute resources that we have here compared to the US leaders. But I think Asian markets never lack talent and never lack data,” Xu said. Local Semiconductor Companies are Collaborating According to Xu, local semiconductor companies in China are collaborating with SenseTime to enhance their computational capabilities, as local chips are rapidly catching up. He did not mention any particular companies, but Huawei has quietly emerged as China’s leader in chip technology research after navigating US restrictions to create its own cutting-edge smartphone processor last year. According to Xu, estimates of China’s current lag behind the US vary, with some putting it at a year and others at three years. However, he stated that the nation’s shortfall in processing power will not last forever. He declared, “A computer is a commodity.” “Over time, there will not be a compute gap.” Another chipmaker that has demonstrated promise in AI, in addition to Biren and Huawei, is Moore Threads Intelligent Beijing. March saw a visit by the leading AI and chip manufacturing companies in China, including Baidu, a developer of AI, and Naura Technology Group, a manufacturer of chip production equipment. Chinese Premier Li Qiang spoke with Moore Threads’ CEO. About SenseTime SenseTime is a Hong Kong-based, publicly traded artificial intelligence business that is partially controlled by the state. In October 2014, computer scientist Xu Li and professor Tang Xiao’ou of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Department of Information Engineering co-founded SenseTime. The firm creates technology for autonomous driving, remote sensing, medical image analysis, optical character recognition, object detection, facial identification, image recognition, and video analysis. The U.S. government has regularly sanctioned SenseTime since 2019 over claims that it has used its facial recognition technology to monitor and imprison Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities.

East Sepik Provincial Member Allan Bird clarified by making reference to the disaster in Enga stating that they (Alternate Government) are focused on issues affecting the country and not individuals. “I want to make that clear. “We have to increase funding to where the majority of our local people are,” said Mr Bird. Present at the press conference was the full alternate government team led by the opposition leader, Douglas Tomuriesa, Deputy Opposition Leader James Nomane, former Alternate PM Allan Bird and the newly nominated alternate PM Rainbo Paita.",

        "description": "Young Bill Gates was awkward and socially inept. This book helped him learn empathy and charm.",
        "content": "Since childhood Bill Gates has always been one of the smartest people in the room. But by his own admission, he wasn't always the most charming or empathetic. \"I was overly intense and socially inept,\" Gates explained in a Reddit AMA in 2019. Other people noticed. Early Microsoft employees apparently found their brilliant but introverted boss difficult, demanding, and lacking in empathy . Looking back, Gates can see their point. \"I thought if somebody had a high IQ, they could be good at everything,\" he admitted in another AMA . \"This notion that there was just this simple idea of smartness, and it could solve everything -- I wish I had known better than to think that.\" These days no one would mistake Gates for being a social butterfly or irresistible charmer , but as the billionaire head of a global philanthropic powerhouse, he certainly seems to have sanded the rough edges off his demeanor and learned to chat, charm, and empathize. Given his public reflections on his past deficiencies, he also seems to have cultivated some humility . How did he do it? In a recent post on his blog recommending David Brooks's new book, How to Know a Person , Gates reflected on his long, slow journey toward greater kindness and better social skills and just how many of the essential lessons he learned are captured in Brooks's book. It's a must-read for anyone struggling to polish up their social skills, he concludes. Gates kicks off the post with more reflections on his youthful social inadequacies. \"When I was younger, I would have been perfectly happy spending hours alone in my room reading, learning about my latest obsession, and letting my mind wander. But my mom was intentional about creating opportunities for me to engage and socialize,\" he recalls. Gates's mom chased him to social events and forced him to make conversation with visitors to the house. This taught him the first major lesson he also found in Brooks's book -- charm isn't a talent you have to be born with, it's something you can actively learn (if you want to read a ton of sciences and experts confirming this, click here , here , and here ). In How to Know a Person , Brooks makes the case that learning how to truly listen to and connect with others is an essential skill not just for our own happiness and development, but for a functioning democracy and cohesive society. He puts a lot of the blame for our loneliness and divisions on our crummy social skills. He also offers specific tips to help readers better connect with others. Gates had already intuited some of them but he claims reading the book further improved his social skills. \"These simple practices can go a long way in making others feel heard and valued,\" he claims. According to Gates, some of Brook's best tips include: Loud listening. \"When another person is talking,\" Brooks writes, \"you want to be listening so actively that you're practically burning calories.\" Gates reflects that while he's pretty good at \"loud listening\" when the other party is talking about something he's interested in, he could still improve when it comes to \"listening to someone talk about a hardship they're dealing with or an accomplishment they're proud of.\" Open-ended questions. \"David emphasizes something I've found really helpful in my own life: asking open-ended questions--with phrases like 'How did you ..,' 'What's it like ...,' 'Tell me about ...,' and 'In what ways ...'--that invite people to share their experiences and perspectives in a more in-depth way,\" Gates writes. Looping. Another component trick of loud listening that Gates has found helpful is looping, which simply means rephrasing and repeating what the other person has just said to make sure you've fully understood them. The slant method. Body language is a huge part of charm and connection. \"To convey attention and interest in a conversation: Sit up, Lean forward, Ask questions, Nod, and Track the speaker.\" What makes these techniques so valuable, Gates concludes, is that they can help you in so many different areas of life. Yes, social savvy helps you get ahead in business, but it also improves family, life, romance, and even day-to-day chores . \"Whether you're catching up with a close friend, chatting with a co-worker, or just exchanging pleasantries with someone while waiting in line for a cheeseburger, being fully present and attuned can transform the encounter,\" Gates stresses. Improved social skills will not only make life nicer for those around you, but also make you happier. Research shows having more meaningful conversations (or even just more pleasant but trivial chats with strangers ) is strongly linked with greater well-being. The takeaway couldn't be clearer. If, like a young Bill Gates, you struggle with small talk and other social niceties, don't assume you're doomed to a life of awkwardness or isolation. Gates' story proves charm can be cultivated, and How to Know a Person is a great way to learn.",

        "content": "Mira Banjac je u novembru napunila 94 godine, u njih je stalo i smeha i suza, a prisetila se mračnog perioda svog života Mira Banjac , rođena 4. novembra 1929. godine, je srpska filmska, televizijska i pozorišna glumica. Rođena je u Erdeviku, u Kraljevini Jugoslaviji. Nakon petnaest godina rada u pozorištima, najviše u Srpskom narodnom u Novom Sadu, Mira se 1960-ih postepeno okreće malim i velikim ekranima. Iako nema mnogo detalja o njenom detinjstvu, Mira Banjac je jednom prilikom izjavila da je njen život zapravo počeo tek kasnije, a da je sve pre toga bila velika muka kroz koju je prolazila sama. - Menjala bih veliki mračni deo mog života u Beogradu. Ja sam jaukala beogradskim ulicama, bila sam na ivici da se ubijem . Imala sam stan u Novom Sadu kada sam krenula u Beograd. Jedna gospođa je htela da uđe u njega, a ja sam imala stanarsko pravo. To pravo sam joj prodala, a to se tada nije smelo. Meni je to odobrio grad uz klauzulu da više nikada ne mogu dobiti stan u Novom Sadu. Pristala sam. Sa tim parama sam kod Skadarlije iznajmila jednu garsonjeru na godinu dana - ispričala je glumica i otkrila da ju je spasao poziv reditelja Stipe Delića. Mira je ispričala kako nije videla izlaza kada su dužnici potraživali novac i bila je spremna na to da oduzme sebi život. - Posle je ta žena došla da traži novac nazad i tužila me. Ja te pare više nisam imala i krenula sam da zajmim. Prvo sam naišla na zelenaše koji su uzimali tri puta više i to je bio rašomon. Jednog dana sam otišla u „Metropol”, naručila kafu, sela da napišem pismo i htela da se bacim dole. Moj sin je bio u vojsci, više nisam imala izlaza. Iduće noći zvoni telefon i javi se reditelj Stipe Delić. Bio je poznat tada, ali nismo se znali lično. Ponudio mi je da radim veliku glavnu ulogu Marije iz logora i višemilionski ugovor zahvaljujući kome sam vratila sve dugove - rekla je svojevremeno za \"Politiku\". Nakon što je diplomirala, Mira se udala za svoju prvu veliku ljubav Andreju Jovanovića. Oni su se upoznali tokom studiranja u Novom Sadu, a Mira je sa 24 godine postala majka sina Branislava. Tokom više od sedamdeset godina karijere, Mira Banjac je dobila najveće esnafske nagrade i priznanja. Njen umetnički izraz doživljava pravu ekspanziju kroz čak 44 filmska i televizijska ostvarenja u periodu između 1970. i 1979. godine. Iz tog perioda ističe se njena uloga u klasiku Čuvar plaže u zimskom periodu, koja joj je donela slavu širom bivše Jugoslavije.",

        "content": "It appears RiverGee County Senators Jonathan Boye Charles Sogbie, Francis Dopoh, and Superintendent Mike Swengbe have found themselves in hot water weeks after the 2024 County Meets. County citizens have accused both men of siphoning funds entrusted to their care during the competition and now want them to account for funds received from citizens and supporters. They claimed that Supt. Swengbe, who served as chairman of the Rivergee County Steering Committee, allegedly received several funding requests from citizens in the diaspora. Citizens view his alleged action as a conflict of interest. Sen. Sogbie was said to have received US10K from President Boakai on behalf of the team and gave US5 K to the team, indicating that the remaining 5 K would have been spent on future expectations. Sources told this paper that the Senator and Superintendent collected thousands of United States Dollars from citizens of the county both home and abroad and sympathizers, including House Speaker Cllr. Fonati Koffa gave the team US12000, while former Executive Mansion Chief of Protocol Nora Finda Bondoo and Cllr. Kukuyon Wleh was tagged as a top supporter. But that Sen. Sogbie, Sen. Dopoh and Supt. Swengbe, who is handling the finances, has since refused to account for their stewardship. The men have also been accused of politicizing the victory celebration, which was planned to be held in the county last week. This forced some players and citizens from other districts in the county to boycott the program and insist that they account for the entrusted funds. screen.width >= 320 && screen.width = 480 && screen.width = 768 ? ((__lxGc__ = window.__lxGc__ || { 's': {}, 'b': 0 })['s']['_215885'] = __lxGc__['s']['_215885'] || { 'b': {} })['b']['_707261'] = { 'i': __lxGc__.b++ } : {} googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-async-ad-center-b');}); This paper has tried contacting both Sen. Sogbie and Supt. Swengbe to comment, but to no avail. On Sunday, May 26, the New Dawn sent messages to their respective WhatsApp numbers after several failed calls and followed up with calls on Monday. However, Supt. Swengbe answered his phone on Monday but got disconnected due to a bad connection. He later called just before press time, denying the allegation and stating that the team is still being paraded and that after that, they will provide all financial reports. He also denied a split within the county as a result of their handling of the victory celebration. He opined that Rep. Williams misrepresented the facts about the happenings within the county as it relates to the celebration. Pushed for the county leaders to be held accountable came after RiverGee won the 2024 County Meet against Lofa County on penalty kickouts. This is RiverGee's second time competing in the finals. The first time RiverGee went to the final was in 2009, but it lost to Bomi, former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's county of origin. Split in the celebration as political intent looms. It has been widely observed that the team's lead supporters, Finda Bondoo and Cllr. Kukuyon Wleh, whom they named \"Talk and Do,\" were allegedly sidelined by Sen. Sogbie and others during the victory celebration planning process. Both Cllr. Wleh and Ms. Bondoo have been popular with the teams. With Sen. Sogbie's seat up for grabs in 2029, he fears that with such soaring popularity, one of those two individuals could unseat him. However, Cllr. Wleh and Ms. Bondoo were not the only two to be sidelined by Sen. Sogbie and Supt. Swengbe. RiverGee County District #3 Representative Johnson Williams Sr. was also sidelined. Speaking on a local radio station last week, Rep. Willaims condemned and called out Sen. Sogbie and Sen. Francis Dopoh for stage managing the trophy presentation ceremony in the county. Rep. Willaims Sr. opined that almost everyone, including national actors, spent money for the county's victory, but the two acted as if they bankrolled the teams. Rep.Williams Sr. said the actions of Sen. Sogbie and Sen. Dopoh were undermining the true intent of the National County Sports Meet, which River Gee recently won. Rep. Willaims, the Secretary of the RiverGee Caucus, believes that decisions on how to present the trophy in Monrovia and back in the county should be unanimously reached by all Members of the Caucus and stakeholders.

Sogbie and Sen.Dopoh were using the victory that every member of the Caucus supported as a pre-campaign program. He asked members of his district to boycott the victory celebration in Fish Town, RiverGee, because the essence of the trophy presentation had been lost. Noticeable absentees Rep. Willaims and the people of his district were not the only citizens absent from the victory celebration. Notable absentees included Ms. Bondoo and Cllr. Wleh, who are regarded as top supporters. Others who boycotted the program included seven key players and the two captains: Alvaro Anderson, Derrick Weah, Polamo Weah, Jusu Dukuly, the competition's best defender, and Daniel Toe (MVP). The alleged exclusion of several personalities by both Sen. Sogbie and Dopoh has left citizens hugely divided. Read the original article on New Dawn .",

        "description": "A maior e melhor epopeia de Super Mario!Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door está de regresso, promete muitas melhorias e arrisca-se a ser a versão definitiva deste clássico da GameCube.",
        "content": "O aparente consenso que aponta The Thousand-Year Door (2004, Game Cube) como melhor Paper Mario , terá levado a Nintendo a priorizar o seu remake para a Nintendo Switch, em detrimento do primeiro jogo da franquia, Paper Mario (2000, Nintendo 64). Encontrei, no que li ao longo do tempo sobre os Paper Mario originais, mais elogios direcionados a The Thousand-Year Door que a qualquer outro título desta franquia, sobressaindo-se aplausos à corajosa inovação da história, das personagens e das mecânicas de jogo, com especial destaque para a direção de arte e banda sonora. Nas muitas horas que agradavelmente passei com ele, pude efetivamente atestar todas estas qualidades, percebendo rapidamente o porquê de se ter transformado num videojogo tão acarinhado. A essas qualidades, que bastariam para me agarrar ao jogo, soma-se um inesperado detalhe: percebi que o ponto de partida e os muitos lugares onde se desenrola a ação desta história são imensamente semelhantes a One Piece . Não encontrei nenhuma informação oficial nesse sentido, mas é altamente provável que a grande aventura que se vive em The Thousand-Year Door seja inspirada em One Piece . Estranho seria se tantas semelhanças fossem mera coincidência. A inspiração vai do geral ao pormenor, da premissa ao desenvolvimento e, mesmo assim, The Thousand-Year Door consegue ser a sua própria aventura, cativando, por isso, fãs de Super Mario , fãs de RPG e agora, quem sabe, até fãs de One Piece . O jogo arranca com a introdução de uma pequena cidade do litoral outrora destruída por um inexplicável desastre natural. Como consequência, a cidade acabou por se afundar nas profundezas do oceano. Neste mesmo local, foi construída Rogueport, local onde atualmente aportam muitos barcos e perigosas personagens à procura do afamado tesouro que se esconde algures por detrás da Thousand-Year Door. A princesa Peach conseguiu obter o mapa que assinala a localização das sete lendárias Crystal Stars, que juntas servirão de chave para abrir a Thousand-Year Door. No entanto também os X-Nauts, liderados por Grodus, estão à procura das Crystal Stars, tentando reuni-las para dominar o mundo. Não me vou alongar muito mais nas comparações com One Piece . Porém, a fim de pontuar o assunto, e com a garantia de te deixar apenas uma pequena unha das muitas inspirações nele presentes, encontrarás pormenores menos óbvios, como uma plataforma de execução que serve de centro para Rogueport (à semelhança daquilo que acontece com Loguetown), até a detalhes mais explícitos, como ilhas voadoras que ninguém acredita existir (à semelhança de todo o lore que circunda Skypea). Seja como for, coincidência ou não, e como referi no início, o mérito de The Thousand-Year Door vai muito além da sua potencial inspiração, assentando sobretudo na invulgar coragem e vontade de inovar que este jogo transpira. Já tinha sentido isso em Super Mario RPG , título que quebra muitos dos moldes e lugares comuns da franquia, mas sente-se em The Thousand-Year Door uma coragem mais madura e direcionada, uma coragem inédita para a franquia Super Mario e até para a própria Nintendo, que resulta em muita criatividade. Para além do óbvio - a deliciosa direção artística -, a engrenagem central de The Thousand-Year Door é a história. O ponto de partida é, já por si, aliciante. Que tesouro esconde aquela enigmática porta? Que aventuras nos aguardam em cada vila, cidade ou ilha que visitamos à procura de mais uma Crystal Star? Que estética exótica terá o próximo local? Que personagens irreverentes - companheiros e/ou inimigos - encontraremos? Quanto mais tempo investimos nesta épica aventura, mais queremos saber sobre ela. A conclusão de um capítulo recompensa-nos com mais uma Crystal Star. Contudo, o que verdadeiramente nos move de capítulo para capítulo é a genuína vontade de ver como se vai desenrolar uma história de Super Mario que se afasta do ‘vamos de ponto A a ponto B para salvar a princesa Peach’, embora esse objetivo persista. Resguardando-te ao máximo de spoilers , vou apenas falar um pouco dos traços gerais do primeiro capítulo, servindo-me deles para expor alguns dos muitos fatores que nos agarram a esta aventura tão peculiar do universo de Super Mario . A primeira aventura de Mario leva-o até Petal Meadows, não só porque está lá uma Crystal Star, mas sobretudo porque Mario quer ajudar Koops. O Koops é um Koopa Troopa (raça das pequenas tartarugas que toda a gente conhece do universo de Super Mario), filho de um corajoso guerreiro que desapareceu após ter enfrentado o gigante dragão que ameaça aquela área. Ao contrário do que acontece noutros jogos da franquia, em The Thousand-Year Door há um investimento extra nas personagens e no que estas nos comunicam através do seu design, maneirismos e formas de conversar. O Koops tem um olho semi-fechado, um penso no nariz e uma postura contraída. Tudo isto comunica esforço, apesar da pouca auto-estima. Ele sabe que para salvar o pai, terá de enfrentar perigos muito maiores que ele, figura e literalmente, nomeadamente um dragão. Ainda assim, e contra a vontade dos familiares, alia-se a Mario na jornada a Petal Meadows. Através da forma como fala, presenciamos a sua subtil, mas gradual evolução, transformando-se em alguém um pouco mais confiante e até reconhecido pela sua aldeia. Todos os capítulos de The Thousand-Year Door estão preenchidos de pormenores como estes. De personagens que contam muito através do seu visual, mas também através dos diálogos, dando-nos a sensação de estarmos num mundo com vida, com coisas a acontecer quer estejamos presentes, quer não. Isto estava longe de ser uma sensação que esperava encontrar num jogo de Super Mario . Após tantos elogios, é a custo que tenho de apontar o dedo ao maior defeito do jogo: a superficialidade das mecânicas de jogo, em particular do sistema de batalha. É monótono e repetitivo. Foi-me removendo da história e até me foi retirando, a pouco e pouco, a vontade de chegar ao fim. Uma epopeia desta dimensão exigia das mecânicas de jogo uma profundidade e diversidade capazes de manter o jogador investido em toda a aventura. The Thousand-Year Door pode variar entre as 30 e 60 horas de jogo, dependendo do quão investido estás em completá-lo a 100%. Em apenas dois capítulos (que se traduz sensivelmente em 4 horinhas de jogo) o aborrecimento já se fazia sentir. Passo a explicar: Na tua party podes ter duas personagens, o Mario e outra que é rotativa e à tua escolha. Cada personagem tem um número limitadíssimo de ataques diferentes, que teoricamente deveriam ser utilizados consoantes o inimigo que tens à frente, havendo personagens com mais ou menos vantagens contra determinados tipos de inimigos. Com exceção de casos particulares, é raro sentires que a estratégia que criaste para determinado inimigo é recompensadora, sendo possível derrotar quase todas as adversidades seja qual for a estratégia em prática. É certo que, o que para mim é o maior defeito de Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door - a ausência de um sistema de batalha mais complexo, diversificado e recompensador - poderá ser apenas mais uma qualidade para um jogador que queira apenas desfrutar da belíssima aventura de Mario e companhia (não se livrando, seja como for, de batalhar imensas vezes e repetir dezenas, senão centenas, de vezes, os poucos ataques que existem).",

        "content": "Barbie Imperial took to social media a gym photo with a man behind her and netizens ask if it is Richard Gutierrez. One of the celebrity breakups that left countless hearts broken was the breakup of Richard Gutierrez and Sarah Lahbati. It was in March of this year when the actress confirmed that she and her husband have parted ways. Richard and Sarah’s marriage was blessed with two (2) sons — Zion and Kai, whom they are co-parenting. Both celebrities are currently surrounded by rumors. In the case of the actor, he is currently linked with young actress Barbie Imperial. The speculations linking Richard Gutierrez and Barbie Imperial started when the two (2) celebrities were spotted together in a gastropub in Alabang. Several people saw the two celebrities and there were claims that their gestures show they are very close to each other. After the said photos taken in Alabang stirring reactions online, entertainment writer Ogie Diaz claimed that his source said that Barbie was just entertaining Richard at the restaurant. Allegedly, the actress is one of the shareholders of the restaurant. Recently, Barbie Imperial and Richard Gutierrez were spotted together anew in South Korea . A netizen who has asked for a photo with the actress posted the photos on social media. The two (2) celebrities could be seen walking and seemingly talking to each other as they cross a busy street abroad. Neither Barbie nor Richard have spoke on the issues linking them to each other. There are also speculations that the two (2) celebrities may be doing a project together that is why they are spotted together. However, a recent photo posted by Barbie Imperial on her social media account stirred the confusion of eagle-eyed netizens once again. In a post that is no longer available, based on a report on Pep, the actress shared a gym photo with a man behind her doing a workout. Some netizens speculate that it was Richard Gutierrez. Undeniably, the body built of Richard somehow matches the physique of the man exercising behind Barbie in the photo. Here’s a copy of the photo: Barbie did not write any caption on her post. Based on the article , some netizens speculate that the post of the actress is a “hard launch” or “flex” of Richard.",

        "content": "El alcalde de Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida , ha dado este martes durante el Pleno del Ayuntamiento de Madrid un repaso a la portavoz socialista, Reyes Maroto , y al secretario general de su formación, el presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez . «Si pretende que haga el ridículo de llamar 'el puto amo' a Sánchez, olvídese», le ha espetado desde la tribuna de oradores antes de asegurar que la ex ministra de Industria, Comercio y Turismo es «la mejor oposición» que podía tener para «seguir siendo alcalde de Madrid». Almeida ha asegurado que «ningún político decente sería presidente del Gobierno al precio de Pedro Sánchez, al precio de conceder una amnistía y traicionar la democracia por siete votos como va a pasar esta semana» y, mientras se le escapaba una sonrisa socarrona, ha avanzado a Maroto que «si pretende que vaya a llorar a Ferraz a pedirle a Sánchez que continúe, olvídese». « Me parece grotesco , si le digo la verdad», ha apostillado durante su turno de réplica a la portavoz del grupo municipal del PSOE. Puente lleva la adulación al límite: «Sánchez es el puto amo» El Debate | Europa Press «Me habla usted de confrontación y de crispación, ¿se acuerda usted cuando me llamó terrorista ambiental? ¿cree que eso es un ejemplo de concordia, de diálogo y de convivencia? ¿se acuerda cuando dijo que en el Ayuntamiento tratábamos a las víctimas de violencia de género como a sus agresores?», ha lanzado el alcalde de la capital. Almeida se ha pronunciado en estos términos después de que Reyes Maroto le acusara de ser «el rey de la descalificación y del bulo» para «ascender en ese listado de mejores amigos de los ultras de su partido, como Isabel Díaz Ayuso ». Maroto ha criticado, después de calificar el día de hoy como «histórico» por el reconocimiento del estado Palestino por parte del Gobierno de España, los «continuos gestos de desprecio hacia el Gobierno y hacia su presidente» por parte del alcalde de Madrid, antes de enumerar algunos de los calificativos que le ha dedicado en los últimos meses como « macho alfa, caudillo populista, autoritario, corrupto estratosférico o señor bulo ». La Junta Electoral lleva a la Fiscalía a la ministra Saiz, a Reyes Maroto y al PSOE-M por saltarse la jornada de reflexión El Debate «Y apenas hace dos días decía que hay que votar contra Sánchez y sus secuaces, que quieren desguazar España por la puerta de atrás. Usted, señor Almeida, se ha mimetizado con el discurso de la extrema derecha y ya no se diferencia de Javier Ortega Smith . Ha asumido en primera persona y con un entusiasmo que nadie le pide el llamamiento de José María Aznar, cuando pidió 'el que pueda hablar que hable, el que pueda hacer que haga, el que pueda aportar que aporte y el que pueda moverse que se mueva`», ha agregado.",

After the beating, they humiliated the young man further by putting a garland of slippers around his neck and parading him through the area. They also streamed the incident live on their social media accounts. The video was later shared widely, causing widespread outrage.

        "content": "Actress Rashmika Mandanna has once again become a victim of deepfake technology. A video has been doing the rounds on social media platforms in which her face has been morphed and placed on a model's body. This comes six months after the actress' AI-generated video went viral. In April 2024, Columbia model and content created Daniela Villareal had shared a video on Instagram in which she is seen posing near a waterfall in a strapless bikini. In the video, she is seen striking different poses and was all smiles for the camera. However, a couple of days back, the model's face was replaced by Rashmika's and it went viral within no time. Check it out here: A post shared by DANIELA VILLARREAL (@danielavillarreal_a) Rashmika has not reacted to the viral deepfake video yet. This is not the first time that Rashmika has become a victim of the deepfake menace. In November 2023, a morphed video of the actress went viral in which she was seen wearing black shorts and a top with plunging neckline. While some social media users were tricked into believing that the woman is Rashmika, others had pointed out that it is an AI-generated edited video and the woman in the clip is not the actress. In January 2024, the Delhi Police arrested the main accused who created the video. Reacting to the development, Rashmika took to social media and expressed her gratitude to the police. Several other celebrities like Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh, Katrina Kaif, Nora Fatehi, Aamir Khan and Kajol also fell prey to the technology's misuse. Meanwhile, on the work front, Rashmika will feature opposite Salman Khan in the upcoming movie Sikandar. Set to be released in theatres on Eid 2025, the project will be produced by Sajid Nadiadwala's banner Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment.",

        "content": "A man who stalked and attempted to murder the sister of Federal MP Kate Chaney with an axe has been sentenced to 23 years' jail. Christopher Bernard Healey, 56, first met doctor Anna Chaney in 2018 when he became a regular patient of hers at a medical practice in the inner Perth suburb of West Leederville. However in 2020, when Dr Chaney noticed a decline in his mental health, he started sending her and members of her family inappropriate messages, some of them of a sexual nature. The court was told that led to Healey being excluded from the medical practice, but state prosecutor Benjamin Stanwix said that only caused him to become \"enraged and bitter\". \"After being rebuffed in early 2020 and particularly after he was excluded from the practice, he developed an all consuming hatred and bitterness towards Dr Chaney ... that grew ever more intense,\" Mr Stanwix submitted. Restraining order breached The court was told he continued to try to contact Dr Chaney, so in January 2021 she obtained a violence restraining order against him, which over the ensuing years he repeatedly breached. That included using social media to send messages to her family members as well as making a false complaint against her to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Mr Stanwix said at one point Dr Chaney reported Healey to the police but she was incorrectly told his behaviour did not amount to a breach because the contact was not directly with her. In some of the messages he sent family members, he falsely accused Dr Chaney of doing him \"a grave injustice\" and said \"everything I have is centred on the anger I have towards Anna\". Mr Stanwix said by about September 2022, Healey had \"formed a fixed intention to kill her\" and he set about finding out where she worked \"so he could attend to kill her.\" Then in September 2023, about nine months after the restraining order expired, he scoped out the North Perth clinic where she was working and lied to staff to find out when she was next on duty. Mr Stanwix said Healey also bought an ice pick, a hunting knife and an axe with the intention of using one of them to kill her. On the morning of September 28 last year, he hid the axe in a cardboard sleeve before he gained access to to the practice again by lying to staff. When Dr Chaney was in her room having a consultation with a patient who was 12 weeks pregnant, he walked in, stood in front of her and swung down the axe on her. Mr Stanwix said Dr Chaney was hit in the abdomen and suffered a large laceration which bled profusely. As she yelled \"Chris don't do this\", she and the patient struggled with him. Healey then yelled \"she's ruined my life\" before another doctor entered the room and managed to grab the axe and stop the attack. The court was told during the struggle the patient was hit in the temple, probably by Healey's elbow, and as a result he had endangered her life. Search reveals 'obsession' Mr Stanwix said a search of Healey's home found extensive handwritten notes which showed his \"obsession\" with Dr Chaney. Healey pleaded guilty to six charges including the attempted murder of Dr Chaney, endangering the life of her patient, aggravated stalking and possessing a controlled weapon. Healey's lawyer Edward Fitzpatrick described his client as \"a very complicated man\", saying despite his guilty pleas, he still held the same beliefs. Mr Fitzpatrick said Healey had a history of mental health issues and it was likely he had Autism Spectrum Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Mr Stanwix submitted that Healey should receive a lengthy jail term, saying Dr Chaney had shown nothing but kindness towards him, even when he had behaved inappropriately to her. \"This is a case of a man not getting what he wanted from a woman, and as a consequence she had to die,\" Mr Stanwix said. Healey will have to serve 21 years of his sentence before he can apply to be released on parole. Want more local WA news? Select \" from either the or the settings menu .",

        "content": "Doha, Qatar: Dr. Javaid I. Sheikh, dean of Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar (WCM-Q), recently hosted the inaugural Dean’s Distinguished Lecture Series event, which focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare. Dr. Rainu Kaushal, a distinguished US-based data scientist and health services researcher, led the session. Dr. Kaushal’s lecture focused on how AI is dominating the healthcare IT landscape, how it is created and being implemented across various areas of healthcare, including imaging, and how health systems can meaningfully capture the vast quantities of clinical data that is required for research. Other key topics included the importance of ensuring guidance and regulations that govern the ethical use of AI in healthcare and the significance of investments driving the generation, implementation, and meaningful use of novel AI technologies. Dr. Kaushal is the senior associate dean of clinical research, chair of the Department of Population Health Sciences, and the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professor of Population Health Sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). She is also the physician-in-chief of population health sciences at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. As the principal investigator of INSIGHT Clinical Research Network (CRN), Dr. Kaushal has built the US’s largest urban clinical database of 22 million patients with trillions of medical, biological, and social data points integrated for national research use. During his introductory note, Dr. Javaid Sheikh, dean of WCM-Q, said: “It is truly a momentous time in healthcare when multiple scientific streams—computational biology, data science, artificial intelligence, and population health sciences—are converging. The landscape of healthcare is being transformed to enhance healthspans, to spawn an era of precision health, to get people involved in taking care of their own health, and to add life to years and years to life.” The lecture was attended by a diverse audience of health professionals from across Qatar and overseas, including Qatar Foundation, Hamad Medical Corporation, Sidra Medicine, WCM, WCM-Q, and the director of the Public Health Department at the Ministry of Public Health, Sheikh Dr. Mohamed bin Hamad al-Thani. Dr. Kaushal said: “In the realm of healthcare, AI acts as a co-pilot, enriching human decision-making processes by streamlining data interpretation and handling routine tasks. AI also extends our cognitive reach beyond human limitations, processing information swiftly and comprehensively. For instance, AI-driven analysis of specific imaging modalities unveils novel insights into functional assessments, underscoring the profound potential of AI to positively transform healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.” During the session, Dr. Kaushal highlighted exemplary collaborations across Cornell University colleges, WCM-Q, and hospital partner New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.
